shared lead authorship eastern spruce budworm esbw is a major agent of disturbance in eastern canada s boreal forests outbreaks have historically led to widespread defoliation of its preferred host trees fir and spruce species leading to high rates of mortality this in turn can result in significant economic losses and enhancement of fire potential in the region representation of such biotic disturbance has rarely been included in dynamic global vegetation models dgvm which have become essential tools in understanding and predicting forest dynamics in present and future contexts we present novel representation of host specific defoliation in a dgvm lpj lmfire to better represent disturbance regimes in the boreal forest of eastern canada using host foliage density to trigger outbreak we were able to calibrate and simulate general spatial patterns of defoliation relative to historical aerial sketch map data return intervals were thus sensitive to the growth rates of host trees modeled return intervals tended to be significantly longer than 30 years the approximate observed return interval a factorial experiment was performed on the interactions of esbw with wildfire which was found to be slightly enhanced in terms of burned areas after outbreaks due to increased fuel loads interactions between esbw and fire were found to have higher interaction strength in the drier western region of the boreal forest our study demonstrates that biotic disturbance and its interaction with wildfire can be effectively simulated in a dgvm we show that bottom up climatic controls are sufficient to drive simulated spatiotemporal patterns of esbw that can be calibrated to generally match historical observations data availability links in manuscript 1 introduction dynamic global vegetation models dgvms have proven to be invaluable tools in the large scale simulation of terrestrial ecosystems operating effectively in diverse contexts ranging from climate science to palaeoecology sato et al 2021 koch and kaplan 2022 dgvms are now well established tools for estimating the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and resultant biogeochemical implications pavlick et al 2013 maréchaux et al 2021 however there is a need to improve process representations in dgvms to better address questions in ecosystem management restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation which are generally approached at the regional scale among the most important of these adaptations include inclusion of regionally specific vegetation at higher taxonomic resolutions and effective representation of critical disturbance regimes kautz et al 2017 fire has long been the principal disturbance agent represented in dgvms with an extensive history of model development and improvement thonicke et al 2001 li et al 2012 hantson et al 2016 2020 fire s frequent occurrence major role in most terrestrial ecosystems and that modeling fire is generalizable across ecosystems made it the first priority for implementation into dgvms hantson et al 2016 biotic disturbances such as insects and diseases however can also have major impacts on forests causing widespread synchronized defoliation and mortality mccullough et al 1998 pureswaran et al 2016 rauchfuss and ziegler 2011 insects and pathogens in turn can affect successional pathways species composition and forest carbon balance significantly kurz et al 2008 biotic disturbances also may have potent interactions with climate and other sources of disturbance such as management and fire both natural and anthropogenic girard et al 2008 canelles et al 2021 unlike fire there have been very few successful efforts to implement a process representation of biotic disturbances in a dgvm despite acknowledgement of its importance quillet et al 2010 bachelet et al 2018 landry et al 2016 canelles et al 2021 the eastern spruce budworm esbw choristoneura fumiferana clem is a defoliator native to the boreal and hemiboreal forests of north america that exhibits widespread 105 km2 periodic outbreaks at approximately 30 year intervals boulanger et al 2012 during major outbreaks esbw larvae consume the live foliage of its preferred host tree balsam fir abies balsamea l mill and to a lesser extent white spruce picea glauca moench voss and black spruce picea mariana mill b s p after three to ten years of consecutive defoliation by consumption large scale synchronized mortality of host trees occurs blais 1981 de grandpré et al 2019 these budworm induced mortality events have historically been associated with increased fire risk in the following years stock 1987 james et al 2017 paleoenvironmental proxy studies in the esbw range has allowed a characterization of the typical frequency and extent of outbreaks on centennial to millennial timescales boulanger et al 2004 sonia et al 2011 navarro et al 2018 the extent and severity of outbreaks has been hypothesized to have increased since the application of forest management due to the increase in dense and even aged balsam fir stands blais 1983 robert et al 2012 from an economic perspective esbw outbreaks have major destructive effects on potential timber through increased tree mortality and reduced growth rates maclean 2019 during an outbreak 1982 1987 annual losses of wood volume to esbw are on the order of 106 to 108 m3 and accounted for roughly 1 4 times the amount lost to wildfire hall and moody 1994 candau and fleming 2011 esbw outbreaks also impact overall forest carbon dynamics through removal of photosynthetically active foliage and dramatically increasing the mortality of host trees this results in net reductions of carbon uptake and potential shifts from carbon sinks to sources over landscapes of up to 105 km2 dymond et al 2010 liu et al 2019 it has also been estimated that ongoing and future climate change may drive more severe outbreaks of esbw which would exacerbate current economic and environmental challenges candau et al 2011 the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of esbw defoliation are yet to be fully resolved with the relative importance of bottom up and top down controls on outbreak still undetermined three theories have emerged to explain the dynamics of esbw population outbreaks and its synchronized defoliation pureswaran et al 2016 the first of these theories is the silvicultural hypothesis which posits that forest management practices induced esbw outbreaks by increasing the amount of large homogenous balsam fir dominated stands miller and rusnock 1993 this would then imply that outbreak would be triggered to some degree by the density of host tree foliage available an alternative hypothesis the double or multiple equilibria hypothesis characterizes esbw populations to have two relatively clear stable states of low and high densities morris 1963a 1963b the low density state of esbw would be maintained by top down controls such as predation and would be triggered by environmental events such as consecutive warm dry summers to transition to the high density state while population collapse would result from repeated years of defoliation depleting host foliage finally the oscillatory hypothesis argues that predation such as by parasitoids controls levels of esbw larvae with periodic lapses where esbw populations can escape this top down control regardless of external environmental triggers royama et al 2005 spatial patterns of esbw have been closely linked to the density of host foliage particularly balsam fir which has shown to have statistical influence over outbreak class gray and mackinnon 2006 in ontario eastern canada spatial analysis of aggregated historical outbreaks suggests the existence of three hotspots that experience frequent defoliation with a radially oriented decrease in activity candau et al 1998 this pattern was hypothesized to be driven by a diffusive decrease in environmental conditions optimal for outbreak which include a decreasing density of host species these hotspots exist within a longitudinally oriented belt in the southern boreal region where patterns of defoliation are roughly correlated with the density of fir biomass fig 1 the southern boundary of this belt where outbreak frequency is low has also been found to be correlated with low abundance of host trees candau and fleming 2005 however it is likely that the compositional changes associated with climate change may shift host abundances in the future pureswaran et al 2016 interactions between esbw and fire have also long been a topic of interest given their roles as the two most prominent sources of disturbance in the boreal forests of eastern canada widespread synchronized defoliation has been theorized to increase fire potential starting with qualitative observations that esbw defoliation preceded large fires stocks and walker 1973 navarro et al 2018 the experimental burns studied by stocks 1987 showed high fire intensity and size after esbw defoliation though could not provide data to measure the degree of enhancement relative to a control modeling studies using historical data have yielded mixed results on the subject showing nuanced relationships between esbw defoliation composition and fire as opposed to a clear enhancement signal sturtevant et al 2012 james et al 2011 2017 from a spatial perspective interactions between esbw and fire have been found to be bounded by prevalence of host species to the north hardwoods in the south and moisture in the west candau et al 2018 until now the specific mechanisms of interaction have yet to be explored using process representations in a dynamic vegetation model that can run over large areas in this study we developed a process representation of esbw dynamics in the lpj lmfire dgvm pfeiffer et al 2013 chaste et al 2018 we test how bottom up controls can determine spatial and temporal patterns of defoliation as well as the influence of esbw driven mortality on wildfire outbreaks are triggered by the density of preferred host foliage abies in our simulations to our knowledge this is the first attempt at introducing a mechanism to trigger insect outbreak within a dgvm though others have studied biophysical and biogeochemical implications of defoliation using the ibis dgvm model landry et al 2016 we simulate the effects of esbw on the boreal forests of eastern canada over the period 1901 2012 using four representative tree genera abies pinus picea and populus the benefit of using a dgvm in this context is that it effectively simulates a major component of the esbw ecology forest dynamics as the productivity density and distribution of host trees is largely determined by environmental conditions and competition while it may be difficult to currently simulate the entire ecology of esbw progress can be made by first simulating independent aspects of their behavior and their impacts on forests as we approach in this study lpj lmfire is also equipped with a sophisticated fire module which is capable of simulating the essential aspects of forest fires including fuel dynamics ignition and spread this presents a convenient opportunity to investigate interactions between esbw defoliation and wildfire to resolve existing uncertainties on the subject 2 methods 2 1 study region and input data in our study we focus on the boreal forests of eastern canada where esbw defoliation is a major source of disturbance our study area is approximately 2 9 million km2 extending from manitoba to newfoundland 102 53 w 46 65 n the dominant conifers in the region include black and white spruce balsam fir jack pine pinus banksiana lamb and white pine pinus strobus l major broadleaf deciduous trees are trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx balsam poplar populus balsamifera l bp white birch betula papyrifera marsh and yellow birch betula alleghaniensis britt datasets used to drive our model were prepared as in chaste et al 2018 except for lightning flashes climate inputs for our experiments on eastern canada span from 1901 2012 and were generated by biosim software from environment canada s historical climate database at a 10 10 km resolution environment canada 2013 lightning flashes in units of number of cloud to ground strikes per day per km2 were reconstructed for the period of 1901 2012 using the canadian lightning detection network data set covering the 1999 2010 period as described in chaste et al 2018 soil texture fractions were derived and interpolated from isric world soil information dataset atmospheric co2 concentrations for 1901 2021 were derived from pfeiffer et al 2013 and keeling et al 2009 as in chaste et al 2018 2 2 vegetation model description lpj lmfire is a dynamic global vegetation model from the lund potsdam jena lpj family of models used for process based simulation of terrestrial ecosystems at large spatial scales sitch et al 2003 this model has been modified and adapted to serve several purposes as descendent models with specific upgrades in fire representation soil processes and dispersal wania et al 2010 pfeiffer et al 2013 snell 2014 chaste et al 2018 lpj lmfire is driven by climate data i e monthly means of temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation number of days with precipitation wind speed total cloud cover percentage and lightning flashes in tandem with soil some environmental constraints water fraction elevation and slope and co2 masks fig 2 outputs include variables characterizing terrestrial vegetation ranging from compositional and structural e g species height canopy density biomass to biogeochemical e g carbon uptake soil carbon carbon emissions from fires aspects vegetation cover is generated dynamically from bare ground during a spin up period of about 1000 years using detrended climate data until carbon pools reach equilibrium then the climate scenario of interest is applied for the transient stage to simulate the period of interest vegetation is described in terms of plant functional types pfts typically covering a wide range of vegetation groups at the global scale sitch et al 2003 pfts are defined by ecophysiological and biological parameters characterizing key aspects of plant function such as partitioning of carbon resources bioclimatic limits and resistance to stressors such heat drought and fires here we used the chaste et al 2018 approach of genera level pfts for its more direct applicability to regional management and policy this is particularly useful in regions with a low overall number of dominant tree species such as the boreal forests of eastern canada the four genera present in this study are abies picea pinus and populus which tend to dominate the forests of our study area and which are each represented by only a few and usually dominated by one species e g abies balsamea the four pfts are assumed to be omnipresent that is present in every grid cell if environmentally suitable pfts establish then grow and compete within this cell which then determines composition and abundance there is no spread of pfts between pixels as each grid cell functions independently mortality is triggered by a range of processes such as heat stress meteorological events or negative carbon balance photosynthate is allocated to fast foliage and slow wood pools which shift to litter as a result of both regular turnover and mortality the majority of litter carbon returns to the atmosphere and the remainder is incorporated into soil organic matter the fire module used in lpj lmfire pfeiffer et al 2013 is derived from the spread and intensity fire spitfire model thonicke et al 2010 representations of fire occurrence behavior and its impacts on vegetation occur in the module for the purposes of this study we neglect human caused ignitions and agricultural burning and only consider lightning ignited wildfire over 90 of fires in canada have been driven by lightning and agricultural burning is negligible in eastern boreal canada coogan et al 2021 the probability of wildfire occurring by ignition from lightning is dependent on the amount of available fuel and fuel moisture tracked with the fire danger index fdi lightning occurrence was estimated using the canadian lightning detection network following by chaste et al 2018 fire behavior simulated using the rothermel equations rothermel 1972 where the rate of spread and fire residence time are functions of fuel moisture and local meteorological conditions fire impacts on vegetation including fuel consumption tree mortality trace gas emissions and burned area are then calculated daily and aggregated for annual output fires occur independently without spread between grid cells spin up periods were run for 1120 years using a linearly detrended 1901 2012 climate data time series repeated ten times until carbon pools were in equilibrium and wildfire disturbance stabilized the original climate dataset not detrended was then run a single time for the transient run when the esbw module was activated and tested for more detail on lpj lmfire and its application to eastern canada see pfeiffer et al 2013 chaste et al 2018 and chaste et al 2019 2 3 esbw module the esbw module was designed to simulate the consumption of host foliage over spatial scales larger than 100 km2 esbw is represented in terms of stage development insect population mass and insect population energy larvae development in the module occurs in 10 stages egg l1 l2o l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 pupa adult to represent the different steps of development in the spruce budworm life cycle miller 1975 after the metamorphosis process larvae to moth during summer female adults lay eggs over a period of a few days these eggs hatch in two weeks maximum l1 stage and quickly find a suitable place to spin a silken hibernaculum where they molt into the second larval stage and enter an overwintering resting stage l2o stage called diapause no feeding occurs in the l1 stage or during the diapause period so all the energy to survive to the winter is placed in the egg by their mother during spring larvae emerge and move to food sites l2 stage once established at feeding sites over a period of a few weeks larvae develop through four stages of development l3 to l6 stages before pupating pupa stage larvae development occurs by obtaining energy from feeding on needles adults emerge in july after metamorphosis adult stage and female moths then lay a new generation of esbw eggs in the esbw module the state of development at each life cycle stage is represented by a value between 0 and 1 where each cohort begins at 0 and progresses to the next life stage when the state equals 1 rates of development are calculated through régnière s process based development model régnière 1982 régnière et al 2012 where rate parameters differ based on sex and life stage and are coupled to climate through temperature dependence table s1 the rate of development for the l1 stage is represented by eq 1 while the adult stage is modeled by eq 2 and all other stages are modeled by eq 3 insect masses were derived from two sources leonard and koller 1981 for stages 4 6 pupa and adult while we used régnière and you 1991 for stages 2 and 3 table s2 developmental parameters were taken from régnière et al 2012 which were modified from régnière 1982 1983 1987 1990 with l1 values taken from han et al 2000 and reported in supplementary table 1 1 i f t t b r a t e t β 1 exp 0 5 r

development of larvae only occurs when daily temperatures are between 2 5 c and 32 c oogenesis and oviposition are estimated by calculating the total number of females and assuming that each has a potential 200 eggs to lay scaled by an increasing linear function of air temperature régnière 1983 oogenesis is only possible under three conditions 1 presence of adult female insects 2 adult female insects are mature state of development is 0 0666 and 3 temperature is between 10 and 25 c l2o larvae can survive winter temperatures greater than 10 c while consuming energy from the egg state fig s1 the value of 0 06 corresponds roughly to one day for a female adult s life stage progression well fed mated females do not lay eggs in the first 24 h after emergence laying a third to a half of their eggs during their second day 2 3 1 modeling bottom up controls on esbw in our study we assume that a minimum amount of abies leaf biomass is required to trigger the initial presence of esbw larvae under influence of the silvicultural hypothesis we selected abies foliage density to be the sole determinant of larval colonization this is a simplification and some combination of host tree foliar density could feasibly be used to trigger initial colonization given comparable preference for picea glauca and its importance in the western margins of its distribution thus picea foliage does not contribute to colonization of esbw in our study though it is consumed along with abies during defoliation events foliar biomass is a function of both host tree density and tree age and size akalusi and bourque 2021 temesgen and weiskittel 2006 we hypothesize that there is an approximate minimum amount of foliage required to support an outbreak which is an assumption of the double equilibria hypothesis this is a practical simplification of a density dependent process that is sufficient for our study from here we refer to the minimum value of fir foliage that triggers colonization as the leaf mass threshold lmt parasitism and predation on esbw may also be important controls on esbw density particularly at low population densities but our model simplifies its dynamics and excludes these processes we likewise exclude anthropogenic control measures of esbw which aim to limit tree mortality and anthropogenic drivers of tree community composition such as forest harvest and silviculture 2 3 2 consumption of foliage consumption of host foliage energy accumulation and usage are calculated by taking the number of individual larvae within an instar and multiplying it by the rate of consumption as measured in vial based experiments by leonard and koller 1981 table s3 if temperature is below 10 celsius all larvae except for l2o are killed régnière j and nealis v g 2019 though régnière and nealis 2019 focused their study on the western spruce budworm this specific mortality condition was developed with reference to studies on the frost tolerance of esbw larvae han and bause 1995 warm temperature sensitivity is represented by a temperature dependent metabolism function which accounts for the potential for overwinter starvation eq 4 régnière et al 2012 life stage progression and consumption is halted if daily temperatures are outside a temperature window of 2 5 to 32 celsius energy is still consumed during these days and mortality occurs if larvae deplete their energy reserves 4 e n e r g y l o s s 8 6623 e 11 t m e a n 6 5241 the esbw module interacts with lpj lmfire through both direct effects on tree growth and mortality and indirect effect on the probability of fire by increasing fuel loads consumption of live foliage from host trees abies and picea reduces carbon uptake while foliage and wood from the esbw killed trees are transferred to the litter pools the esbw module runs prior to fire and delivers information on fuel litter biomass to the fire model on an annual time step the size of this timestep is appropriate for this study given that budworm driven enhancements of fire tend to occur years after mortality due to fuel drying and fuel ladder development james et al 2017 in our initial model simulations foliage of the host trees was completely consumed by esbw after two to three simulation years field observations show that esbw defoliation typically takes up to 10 years prior to mortality chen et al 2017 a number of factors could explain this overestimated rate in the model including i lack of bottom up control on esbw through parasitism or predation and ii idealized food availability esbw is also a very wasteful eater consuming only a fraction of the total quantity of foliage on twigs and branches that die as a result of defoliation as a result more foliage is lost than what is actually consumed esbw larvae only consume current year foliage whereas in this version of our model host foliage from any year is available for consumption this additional restriction would likely extend the time from initial colonization to tree mortality and would be a useful addition to future iterations we addressed this inaccuracy in the model by imposing a scaling factor on the rate of foliage consumption to slow consumption rates to more realistic levels we multiplied rates by a constant value between 0 and 1 that we refer to as the consumption coefficient the length of defoliation period showed an inverse relationship with consumption coefficient cc with cc 0 35 inducing an outbreak length of approximately 5 10 years fig s3 this method though simple sufficed for our purposes given that our study was focused primarily on the impacts of esbw outbreak on forests over longer timescales the return interval showed strong sensitivity to lmt variation figs 6 and 7 in our model unimpeded consumption will lead to complete defoliation and subsequent complete mortality which repeats as cover regenerates and foliar density reaches the lmt in reality there is often an understory of suppressed host trees that is less affected by esbw outbreak that will resume growth after opening of the stand canopy lavoie et al 2021 our initial tests that allowed for complete mortality of host trees resulted in return intervals up to an order of magnitude larger than observed values to remedy the slow growth rates and reflect residual host trees surviving after outbreaks we allowed a small amount of foliage to survive post outbreak mortality was then defined to a set amount in accordance with past studies slow and fast litter from the killed trees were then allocated to total pools accordingly maclean 1980 presented average post outbreak mortality for mature 85 and immature balsam fir 42 stands spruce stands were found to have significantly lower average mortality for both mature 36 and immature 13 cases given that lpj lmfire does not have stand age incorporated an average of these two values was taken to estimate the modeled mortality which was 64 for fir and 25 for spruce application of this method yielded significantly faster regrowth post outbreak but still slower than observed values 2 4 modeling experiments three modeling experiments were performed to assess spatial and temporal patterns of esbw outbreaks and their interactions with fire first we tested the sensitivity of long term defoliation to a range of lmt values to generate a set of spatial patterns of esbw outbreaks comparable to observations in eastern canada where esbw is monitored annually by field and aerial surveys lmt was tested over a range of values resulting in a distinct set of defoliation patterns that could be compared and calibrated to those of gray and mackinnon 2006 to test the response of outbreak return interval against the lmt we ran a sensitivity test of fir foliage density over time including frequency of foliar collapse to lmt simulations were run over a range of lmt values in a smaller region on the ontario quebec border where an outbreak occurred in all runs return intervals defined as the time period between two consecutive esbw defoliation events were averaged over three consecutive outbreaks in transient runs from ten cells from regions defoliated in all runs intersection of all runs in the case of return intervals over 100 years outbreaks during spin up immediately prior to the transient stage were taken into consideration to test interactions between fire and esbw defoliation on fir foliage density we performed a factorial experiment with four scenarios a control scenario without any natural disturbances b fire only c esbw only and d fire and esbw to assess the effects of esbw integration on burned area fraction gross primary productivity slow fuel and carbon emissions variables from fire only runs were simply subtracted from the fire and esbw runs 2 5 model evaluation consolidated aerial sketch map data on esbw defoliation in canada from 1941 to 1998 were sourced from gray and mackinnon 2006 through personal communication we developed a ground truth dataset for model evaluation by creating a binary categorization of the aerial sketch map data though gray and mackinnon 2006 contained categorical outbreak classes we chose to convert both model and aerial sketch map data to binary classification given the qualitative nature of asm outbreak classes all classifications of outbreak ranging from very mild mild mild moderate moderate moderate severe severe to very severe were interpreted as outbreak occurrence indications shapefiles of outbreak classes were reclassified to the binary categories of defoliation present and defoliation absent and rasterized in alignment with model output in arcgis 10 7 1 to quantify agreement between model output and aerial sketch map based measurements of defoliation we computed the jaccard coefficient for each scenario relative to data by gray and mackinnon 2006 the jaccard coefficient is a simple metric of similarity between two sets of data calculated by dividing the intersection number of grid cells of model data agree on defoliation presence by the union total combined number of grid cells with defoliation by either model or data 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of outbreak through host tree density defoliation patterns showed strong sensitivity to lmt variation with low values of lmt resulting in very broad distributions of defoliation and high values resulting in a narrower concentrated southern pattern fig 3 a low lmt results in esbw appearing wherever abies appears even at low levels while at higher thresholds esbw only populates regions dense in fir simulated distributions of cumulative consumption generally match patterns of defoliation as found by gray and mackinnon 2006 at the higher end of lmt the latitudinal belt of esbw defoliation found by candau et al 1998 in ontario was also present in our simulations across eastern canada particularly at the higher end of lmt values this belt is where abies foliage is most dense and thus where environmental conditions are optimal for abies growth and fitness against other pfts this is consistent with findings by candau and fleming 2005 this suggests that host tree density may be an important factor in defining the southern boundary of defoliation which could shift northward under climate change scenarios the spatial distribution of frequent outbreaks hot spots was generally well simulated past defoliation in historical aerial sketch maps were co located with areas of high defoliation in our simulations though a strip of heavy defoliation was found fig 2 instead of point locations candau and fleming 2005 gray and mackinnon 2006 this can be attributed to model overestimation of abies density in this region as found by chaste et al 2018 evaluation of lpj lmfire s model skill in simulating genus level biomass in eastern canada note that in their study and ours lpj lmfire simulates potential vegetation based on environmental drivers and does not include the effects of management on composition management has been suggested to be the reason underlying low density of host species in corridors separating hotspots and could explain the difference in patterns between our simulations and observation candau et al 1998 belyea 1952 regions of high levels of defoliation in our simulations are generally surrounded by areas of lower levels of defoliation tapering off to zero by assuming outbreaks to be dependent solely on the density of host foliage we also see the radially diffusive patterns of outbreak frequency an lmt of 30 g m2 was found to drive simulations with highest agreement with asm data as model data agreement assessed using the jaccard coefficient fig 4 a tended to increase gradually toward an optimal value with a quick drop off afterward this best run scored a jaccard coefficient of 0 45 which is notably higher in agreement than a random model jaccard coefficient 0 20 see fig 4a total modeled values of live foliar biomass for picea pinus and populus pfts are at the lower end of empirical estimates but within an order of magnitude of measured average oven dry foliage biomass from mixed coniferous deciduous forest tadaki 1966 fig 5 a b c shows the binary presence absence re classification of model output and gray and mackinnon s data set and the intersection of these two data sets of the model parameter set that showed highest agreement with data the complement between model output and asm data was also calculated for the run of highest agreement fig 5d regions of disagreement include model simulations showing relatively higher outbreak severity in eastern newfoundland and labrador and nova scotia in the case of newfoundland and labrador this overestimate can be traced to lpj lmfire s tendency to significantly overestimate abies biomass in the eastern region likely due to overestimates of soil fertility chaste et al 2018 northern regions of quebec also show low levels of defoliation even at the higher end of lmt which are not observed in gray and mackinnon s 2006 analysis but appear within the northern boundaries of esbw presence as found by régnière et al 2012 thus lack of survey data rather than defoliation may underlie model data disagreement particularly due to the northern limit of surveys in quebec and for all of nova scotia gray 2013 3 2 temporal patterns of outbreaks return interval fig 7 shows return interval sensitivity to lmt for both intermediate and immature mortality values based on model assumptions the frequency of outbreak has an inverse relation to the level of mortality in stands in our model assuming all stands to have low mortality as prescribed by maclean s 1980 values for immature stands resulted in the fastest and most realistic return intervals however the assumption for all stands to be immature and mortality to be this low is unrealistic suggesting that selective regrowth may be too slow in the model triggering outbreaks by host foliage density produced roughly regular intervals based on the regeneration rates of host foliage and the value of the threshold parameter lmt as prescribed by versions of the silvicultural hypothesis pureswaran et al 2016 the degree of mortality also showed significant influence on the length of return intervals our results are roughly in agreement with regeneration based theories of esbw outbreak however this representation would be inconsistent with theories of outbreak that posit external influences such as predation and parasitism to be critical controls of defoliation onset and cessation johns et al 2019 régnière et al 2019 the value of lmt that resulted in a return interval closest to observation was still much lower than the value that produced best spatial pattern agreement however our simulated defoliation patterns were based on potential fir distributions and neglected the effects of management and their effects on fir density furthermore lack of survey data where esbw occurred such as in northern quebec may have resulted in increased commission error thus the lmt that best fits actual outbreak patterns could potentially be significantly lower 3 3 interactions between esbw and wildfire the esbw module progressively decreased the amount of fir foliage during outbreak with subsequent regrowth fig 8 c and d the results of our factorial experiment also showed that fire tended to decrease the overall volume of fir foliage by up to roughly half of its control values regeneration of fir foliage was also slower when fire was present fig 8b and d esbw presence triggered clear but small increases in burned fraction after defoliation events relative to control fig 9 a as living leaf mass from host trees decreases carbon uptake decreases while respiration values remain roughly constant resulting in lowered net uptake fig 9d after defoliation there is a small sustained increase in burned area 1 8 fig 9a this coincides with a sudden rise in slow fuel caused by mortality of host trees fig 9b increases in dry fuel leads to an increase in the rate of spread ros our simulations show that defoliation induced mortality leads to an increase in fuel load and an increased likelihood of ignition and larger fires this initial increase in burned area relative to control is followed by a decrease due to depletion of fuel carbon emissions from fire are also enhanced due to esbw in proportion to burned area at intermediate mortality rates esbw defoliation generated an average of 890 g m2 of burned fuel from killed host trees which resulted in at least small increases in burned area fig 9a in certain grid cells one may see larger enhancements of burned area fraction in a single fire when there is a large amount of dead fuel caused by defoliation and fire spreads into living biomass when averaged over the entire region these effects are attenuated to an average of less than 1 when averaged over time the overall amount of burned area of sites with and without esbw is small even for cells with strong pulses of enhancements in burned area to assess the larger spatial variation of the esbw fire interaction average increases in burned area after defoliation driven mortality were plotted across eastern canada interactions were found to be stronger in the west relative to the east fig 10 drier climate in the western part of the study area may explain in part stronger interactions relative to the eastern part of the boreal region studied extreme summer temperatures in ontario may also contribute to higher interactions relative to the maritimes in terms of moisture representation within lpj lmfire the probability that a fire will be triggered by lightning is represented by the dependence of ignition efficiency on fire danger index fdi which in turn is a function of soil moisture moisture of extinction is also represented in the fdi which is the upper bound value above which fire will not spread this is consistent with analysis that suggests the sensitivity of fire regimes to be higher in drier environments with a shorter fire cycle james et al 2017 fleming et al 2002 also found a general pattern of decreasing interaction strength from the drier climate of the west to the wetter east suggesting that drier climates would lead to slower decomposition and could extend the season of heightened fire potential and likelihood of successful ignition our simulation of esbw fire interactions agree with previous modeling studies and importantly the experimental results of stocks 1987 fire burn experiments and theorized observed impacts of esbw defoliation on forest carbon dynamics fleming et al 2002 it is difficult to compare our results with stocks work given the lack of control cases in past burn experiments to demonstrate how esbw may lead to a relative enhancement of burnt area the positive but small enhancement of fire by esbw defoliation modeled in our study could explain the subtle or null effects of esbw on fire risk found by james et al 2011 and sturtevant et al 2012 in these cases analyses at larger scales in which small pulses of enhancement may be washed out over larger spatiotemporal scales that is positive feedback from defoliation on burning may be largely canceled out by subsequent negative feedback averaged over longer timescales due to depleted fuel loads similarly post fire stands in boreal forest have been found less likely to burn due to reduced biomass and slow regrowth parisien et al 2020 in reality the interactions between fire and esbw are likely to be highly context dependent with wind and soil conditions likely playing important roles it should be noted that there is no interaction between grid cells in lpj lmfire so each disturbance i e fire and esbw does not spread between cells this is very likely to underestimate the importance of single large fire events that could rapidly grow or join additionally in our model the absence of fire leads to higher density and growth rates of fir foliage assuming that fir foliage density triggers outbreaks this could lead to both shorter return intervals and broader outbreaks this is consistent with silvicultural hypotheses that postulates that management including fire suppression could promote the occurrence of esbw outbreak by promoting abies this aspect could be further explored in future studies given its consistency with blais 1983 and its relevance to management practices 4 concluding remarks our study shows that the assumption that esbw outbreak and defoliation is triggered by the density of fir foliage has a number of consequences linking defoliation to modeled abies density produced results in general agreement with consolidated aerial based observations of esbw defoliation with model data agreement peaking at an intermediate value within the tested range of threshold values it is noteworthy that our simulation generated dynamic distributions of abies and picea from bare ground using only ecophysiological parametrizations of each pft reacting to environmental drivers competition between these pfts mediated by their growth parameters determined stands i e grid cells composition and density across time and space thus the ability to simulate spatial patterns of defoliation is highly contingent on successful simulation of abies it is natural that to simulate the large scale patterns of the parasite one must first successfully simulate the patterns of the host given the ability to estimate the general patterns of esbw defoliation including belt zone and hotspot type spatial patterns we posit that our methods may be sufficient as a first order approximation of spruce budworm fir dynamics while parasitism predation and dispersal are likely important controls of outbreak dynamics this method would at least conceivably give an upper bound on the extent of outbreak size host foliage biomass may not be the sole trigger of outbreak but it is likely a requisite condition as fuel is to fire this will be even more important when projecting out future patterns of esbw defoliation given the potentially major climate change driven changes in tree composition chaste et al 2019 moreover indirect and non climatic processes such as co2 fertilization fire and interaction between disturbances will likely play a factor in these shifts for these reasons this insect adapted dgvm version of lpj lmfire lpj lmfire esbw could be a powerful tool in forecasting large scale changes in defoliation and discerning underlying mechanisms future work could improve on several aspects to modeling biotic disturbance in a dgvm first dispersal is likely necessary to better represent defoliation dynamics to integrate dispersal would require inter cell interactions which has long been absent in other major forest processes such as fire and seed dispersal these interactions would likely change results significantly and could improve spatiotemporal dynamics second esbw is likely controlled not only by foliage availability but also by parasitoids e g cappuccino et al 1998 régnière et al 2020 and avian predators e g crawford et al 1983 crawford and jennings 1989 venier and holmes 2010 additionally a mechanistic approach to host preference could be implemented to account for potential future changes there has been evidence that changes in phenological synchrony between budbreak of host trees and emergence of l2o diapause phase could alter host preference from balsam fir to black spruce and subsequently push esbw distributions northward pureswaran et al 2019 increasing the number of pfts to include genera such as birch and maple would improve realism in forest regeneration and possibly alter post fire fuel dynamics particularly in the southern boreal where community composition is more diverse another avenue to improve upon would be working toward a sufficiently detailed representation of fuel structures and understory vegetation to enable more complete simulation of the delayed positive feedback of defoliation on fire as suggested by stocks 1987 our study was one of the very first attempts at integrating insect driven defoliation and biotic disturbance within a dgmv relative to fire modeling insect disturbance requires a more specific understanding of the disturbance agent s ecology physiology and its relationship to its host or multiple hosts we suggest this is an opportunity for entomologists ecologists and earth systems scientists to work together to better understand the role of biotic disturbances within the context of global change as many insect species affect forests worldwide and in turn the carbon storage trees represent here we opted to investigate esbw but the architecture of our model may be transferable to other species particularly other defoliators with appropriate revision and reparameterization for broader scale or global models researchers may consider broader functional classifications of biotic disturbance agents such as defoliators wood boring insects fungal pathogens etc using the bottom up controls of host foliage density to trigger initial outbreak we effectively simulated the spatial patterns of esbw and produced regular return intervals we suggest that these results may have physical implications given that regions of dense fir will eventually experience defoliation over longer timescales and that the regeneration rates of host foliage may play an important role in return interval length with additional sensitivity to mortality rates of past outbreaks thus the spatial and temporal patterns of esbw outbreak may be driven by specific aspects of the ecophysiology of balsam fir additionally we found that mortality driven by esbw defoliation enhanced burnt area though by a small amount when averaged over space and time our study used climate data from the last century calibrated with aerial sketch maps to replicate patterns of the past however spatiotemporal patterns of outbreak and interactions with fire are likely to shift due to climate change with potentially important contributions from shifts in host tree density code

shared lead authorship eastern spruce budworm esbw is a major agent of disturbance in eastern canada s boreal forests outbreaks have historically led to widespread defoliation of its preferred host trees fir and spruce species leading to high rates of mortality this in turn can result in significant economic losses and enhancement of fire potential in the region representation of such biotic disturbance has rarely been included in dynamic global vegetation models dgvm which have become essential tools in understanding and predicting forest dynamics in present and future contexts we present novel representation of host specific defoliation in a dgvm lpj lmfire to better represent disturbance regimes in the boreal forest of eastern canada using host foliage density to trigger outbreak we were able to calibrate and simulate general spatial patterns of defoliation relative to historical aerial sketch map data return intervals were thus sensitive to the growth rates of host trees modeled return intervals tended to be significantly longer than 30 years the approximate observed return interval a factorial experiment was performed on the interactions of esbw with wildfire which was found to be slightly enhanced in terms of burned areas after outbreaks due to increased fuel loads interactions between esbw and fire were found to have higher interaction strength in the drier western region of the boreal forest our study demonstrates that biotic disturbance and its interaction with wildfire can be effectively simulated in a dgvm we show that bottom up climatic controls are sufficient to drive simulated spatiotemporal patterns of esbw that can be calibrated to generally match historical observations data availability links in manuscript 1 introduction dynamic global vegetation models dgvms have proven to be invaluable tools in the large scale simulation of terrestrial ecosystems operating effectively in diverse contexts ranging from climate science to palaeoecology sato et al 2021 koch and kaplan 2022 dgvms are now well established tools for estimating the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems and resultant biogeochemical implications pavlick et al 2013 maréchaux et al 2021 however there is a need to improve process representations in dgvms to better address questions in ecosystem management restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation which are generally approached at the regional scale among the most important of these adaptations include inclusion of regionally specific vegetation at higher taxonomic resolutions and effective representation of critical disturbance regimes kautz et al 2017 fire has long been the principal disturbance agent represented in dgvms with an extensive history of model development and improvement thonicke et al 2001 li et al 2012 hantson et al 2016 2020 fire s frequent occurrence major role in most terrestrial ecosystems and that modeling fire is generalizable across ecosystems made it the first priority for implementation into dgvms hantson et al 2016 biotic disturbances such as insects and diseases however can also have major impacts on forests causing widespread synchronized defoliation and mortality mccullough et al 1998 pureswaran et al 2016 rauchfuss and ziegler 2011 insects and pathogens in turn can affect successional pathways species composition and forest carbon balance significantly kurz et al 2008 biotic disturbances also may have potent interactions with climate and other sources of disturbance such as management and fire both natural and anthropogenic girard et al 2008 canelles et al 2021 unlike fire there have been very few successful efforts to implement a process representation of biotic disturbances in a dgvm despite acknowledgement of its importance quillet et al 2010 bachelet et al 2018 landry et al 2016 canelles et al 2021 the eastern spruce budworm esbw choristoneura fumiferana clem is a defoliator native to the boreal and hemiboreal forests of north america that exhibits widespread 105 km2 periodic outbreaks at approximately 30 year intervals boulanger et al 2012 during major outbreaks esbw larvae consume the live foliage of its preferred host tree balsam fir abies balsamea l mill and to a lesser extent white spruce picea glauca moench voss and black spruce picea mariana mill b s p after three to ten years of consecutive defoliation by consumption large scale synchronized mortality of host trees occurs blais 1981 de grandpré et al 2019 these budworm induced mortality events have historically been associated with increased fire risk in the following years stock 1987 james et al 2017 paleoenvironmental proxy studies in the esbw range has allowed a characterization of the typical frequency and extent of outbreaks on centennial to millennial timescales boulanger et al 2004 sonia et al 2011 navarro et al 2018 the extent and severity of outbreaks has been hypothesized to have increased since the application of forest management due to the increase in dense and even aged balsam fir stands blais 1983 robert et al 2012 from an economic perspective esbw outbreaks have major destructive effects on potential timber through increased tree mortality and reduced growth rates maclean 2019 during an outbreak 1982 1987 annual losses of wood volume to esbw are on the order of 106 to 108 m3 and accounted for roughly 1 4 times the amount lost to wildfire hall and moody 1994 candau and fleming 2011 esbw outbreaks also impact overall forest carbon dynamics through removal of photosynthetically active foliage and dramatically increasing the mortality of host trees this results in net reductions of carbon uptake and potential shifts from carbon sinks to sources over landscapes of up to 105 km2 dymond et al 2010 liu et al 2019 it has also been estimated that ongoing and future climate change may drive more severe outbreaks of esbw which would exacerbate current economic and environmental challenges candau et al 2011 the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of esbw defoliation are yet to be fully resolved with the relative importance of bottom up and top down controls on outbreak still undetermined three theories have emerged to explain the dynamics of esbw population outbreaks and its synchronized defoliation pureswaran et al 2016 the first of these theories is the silvicultural hypothesis which posits that forest management practices induced esbw outbreaks by increasing the amount of large homogenous balsam fir dominated stands miller and rusnock 1993 this would then imply that outbreak would be triggered to some degree by the density of host tree foliage available an alternative hypothesis the double or multiple equilibria hypothesis characterizes esbw populations to have two relatively clear stable states of low and high densities morris 1963a 1963b the low density state of esbw would be maintained by top down controls such as predation and would be triggered by environmental events such as consecutive warm dry summers to transition to the high density state while population collapse would result from repeated years of defoliation depleting host foliage finally the oscillatory hypothesis argues that predation such as by parasitoids controls levels of esbw larvae with periodic lapses where esbw populations can escape this top down control regardless of external environmental triggers royama et al 2005 spatial patterns of esbw have been closely linked to the density of host foliage particularly balsam fir which has shown to have statistical influence over outbreak class gray and mackinnon 2006 in ontario eastern canada spatial analysis of aggregated historical outbreaks suggests the existence of three hotspots that experience frequent defoliation with a radially oriented decrease in activity candau et al 1998 this pattern was hypothesized to be driven by a diffusive decrease in environmental conditions optimal for outbreak which include a decreasing density of host species these hotspots exist within a longitudinally oriented belt in the southern boreal region where patterns of defoliation are roughly correlated with the density of fir biomass fig 1 the southern boundary of this belt where outbreak frequency is low has also been found to be correlated with low abundance of host trees candau and fleming 2005 however it is likely that the compositional changes associated with climate change may shift host abundances in the future pureswaran et al 2016 interactions between esbw and fire have also long been a topic of interest given their roles as the two most prominent sources of disturbance in the boreal forests of eastern canada widespread synchronized defoliation has been theorized to increase fire potential starting with qualitative observations that esbw defoliation preceded large fires stocks and walker 1973 navarro et al 2018 the experimental burns studied by stocks 1987 showed high fire intensity and size after esbw defoliation though could not provide data to measure the degree of enhancement relative to a control modeling studies using historical data have yielded mixed results on the subject showing nuanced relationships between esbw defoliation composition and fire as opposed to a clear enhancement signal sturtevant et al 2012 james et al 2011 2017 from a spatial perspective interactions between esbw and fire have been found to be bounded by prevalence of host species to the north hardwoods in the south and moisture in the west candau et al 2018 until now the specific mechanisms of interaction have yet to be explored using process representations in a dynamic vegetation model that can run over large areas in this study we developed a process representation of esbw dynamics in the lpj lmfire dgvm pfeiffer et al 2013 chaste et al 2018 we test how bottom up controls can determine spatial and temporal patterns of defoliation as well as the influence of esbw driven mortality on wildfire outbreaks are triggered by the density of preferred host foliage abies in our simulations to our knowledge this is the first attempt at introducing a mechanism to trigger insect outbreak within a dgvm though others have studied biophysical and biogeochemical implications of defoliation using the ibis dgvm model landry et al 2016 we simulate the effects of esbw on the boreal forests of eastern canada over the period 1901 2012 using four representative tree genera abies pinus picea and populus the benefit of using a dgvm in this context is that it effectively simulates a major component of the esbw ecology forest dynamics as the productivity density and distribution of host trees is largely determined by environmental conditions and competition while it may be difficult to currently simulate the entire ecology of esbw progress can be made by first simulating independent aspects of their behavior and their impacts on forests as we approach in this study lpj lmfire is also equipped with a sophisticated fire module which is capable of simulating the essential aspects of forest fires including fuel dynamics ignition and spread this presents a convenient opportunity to investigate interactions between esbw defoliation and wildfire to resolve existing uncertainties on the subject 2 methods 2 1 study region and input data in our study we focus on the boreal forests of eastern canada where esbw defoliation is a major source of disturbance our study area is approximately 2 9 million km2 extending from manitoba to newfoundland 102 53 w 46 65 n the dominant conifers in the region include black and white spruce balsam fir jack pine pinus banksiana lamb and white pine pinus strobus l major broadleaf deciduous trees are trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx balsam poplar populus balsamifera l bp white birch betula papyrifera marsh and yellow birch betula alleghaniensis britt datasets used to drive our model were prepared as in chaste et al 2018 except for lightning flashes climate inputs for our experiments on eastern canada span from 1901 2012 and were generated by biosim software from environment canada s historical climate database at a 10 10 km resolution environment canada 2013 lightning flashes in units of number of cloud to ground strikes per day per km2 were reconstructed for the period of 1901 2012 using the canadian lightning detection network data set covering the 1999 2010 period as described in chaste et al 2018 soil texture fractions were derived and interpolated from isric world soil information dataset atmospheric co2 concentrations for 1901 2021 were derived from pfeiffer et al 2013 and keeling et al 2009 as in chaste et al 2018 2 2 vegetation model description lpj lmfire is a dynamic global vegetation model from the lund potsdam jena lpj family of models used for process based simulation of terrestrial ecosystems at large spatial scales sitch et al 2003 this model has been modified and adapted to serve several purposes as descendent models with specific upgrades in fire representation soil processes and dispersal wania et al 2010 pfeiffer et al 2013 snell 2014 chaste et al 2018 lpj lmfire is driven by climate data i e monthly means of temperature diurnal temperature range precipitation number of days with precipitation wind speed total cloud cover percentage and lightning flashes in tandem with soil some environmental constraints water fraction elevation and slope and co2 masks fig 2 outputs include variables characterizing terrestrial vegetation ranging from compositional and structural e g species height canopy density biomass to biogeochemical e g carbon uptake soil carbon carbon emissions from fires aspects vegetation cover is generated dynamically from bare ground during a spin up period of about 1000 years using detrended climate data until carbon pools reach equilibrium then the climate scenario of interest is applied for the transient stage to simulate the period of interest vegetation is described in terms of plant functional types pfts typically covering a wide range of vegetation groups at the global scale sitch et al 2003 pfts are defined by ecophysiological and biological parameters characterizing key aspects of plant function such as partitioning of carbon resources bioclimatic limits and resistance to stressors such heat drought and fires here we used the chaste et al 2018 approach of genera level pfts for its more direct applicability to regional management and policy this is particularly useful in regions with a low overall number of dominant tree species such as the boreal forests of eastern canada the four genera present in this study are abies picea pinus and populus which tend to dominate the forests of our study area and which are each represented by only a few and usually dominated by one species e g abies balsamea the four pfts are assumed to be omnipresent that is present in every grid cell if environmentally suitable pfts establish then grow and compete within this cell which then determines composition and abundance there is no spread of pfts between pixels as each grid cell functions independently mortality is triggered by a range of processes such as heat stress meteorological events or negative carbon balance photosynthate is allocated to fast foliage and slow wood pools which shift to litter as a result of both regular turnover and mortality the majority of litter carbon returns to the atmosphere and the remainder is incorporated into soil organic matter the fire module used in lpj lmfire pfeiffer et al 2013 is derived from the spread and intensity fire spitfire model thonicke et al 2010 representations of fire occurrence behavior and its impacts on vegetation occur in the module for the purposes of this study we neglect human caused ignitions and agricultural burning and only consider lightning ignited wildfire over 90 of fires in canada have been driven by lightning and agricultural burning is negligible in eastern boreal canada coogan et al 2021 the probability of wildfire occurring by ignition from lightning is dependent on the amount of available fuel and fuel moisture tracked with the fire danger index fdi lightning occurrence was estimated using the canadian lightning detection network following by chaste et al 2018 fire behavior simulated using the rothermel equations rothermel 1972 where the rate of spread and fire residence time are functions of fuel moisture and local

host foliage over spatial scales larger than 100 km2 esbw is represented in terms of stage development insect population mass and insect population energy larvae development in the module occurs in 10 stages egg l1 l2o l2 l3 l4 l5 l6 pupa adult to represent the different steps of development in the spruce budworm life cycle miller 1975 after the metamorphosis process larvae to moth during summer female adults lay eggs over a period of a few days these eggs hatch in two weeks maximum l1 stage and quickly find a suitable place to spin a silken hibernaculum where they molt into the second larval stage and enter an overwintering resting stage l2o stage called diapause no feeding occurs in the l1 stage or during the diapause period so all the energy to survive to the winter is placed in the egg by their mother during spring larvae emerge and move to food sites l2 stage once established at feeding sites over a period of a few weeks larvae develop through four stages of development l3 to l6 stages before pupating pupa stage larvae development occurs by obtaining energy from feeding on needles adults emerge in july after metamorphosis adult stage and female moths then lay a new generation of esbw eggs in the esbw module the state of development at each life cycle stage is represented by a value between 0 and 1 where each cohort begins at 0 and progresses to the next life stage when the state equals 1 rates of development are calculated through régnière s process based development model régnière 1982 régnière et al 2012 where rate parameters differ based on sex and life stage and are coupled to climate through temperature dependence table s1 the rate of development for the l1 stage is represented by eq 1 while the adult stage is modeled by eq 2 and all other stages are modeled by eq 3 insect masses were derived from two sources leonard and koller 1981 for stages 4 6 pupa and adult while we used régnière and you 1991 for stages 2 and 3 table s2 developmental parameters were taken from régnière et al 2012 which were modified from régnière 1982 1983 1987 1990 with l1 values taken from han et al 2000 and reported in supplementary table 1 1 i f t t b r a t e t β 1 exp 0 5 r

the value of 0 06 corresponds roughly to one day for a female adult s life stage progression well fed mated females do not lay eggs in the first 24 h after emergence laying a third to a half of their eggs during their second day 2 3 1 modeling bottom up controls on esbw in our study we assume that a minimum amount of abies leaf biomass is required to trigger the initial presence of esbw larvae under influence of the silvicultural hypothesis we selected abies foliage density to be the sole determinant of larval colonization this is a simplification and some combination of host tree foliar density could feasibly be used to trigger initial colonization given comparable preference for picea glauca and its importance in the western margins of its distribution thus picea foliage does not contribute to colonization of esbw in our study though it is consumed along with abies during defoliation events foliar biomass is a function of both host tree density and tree age and size akalusi and bourque 2021 temesgen and weiskittel 2006 we hypothesize that there is an approximate minimum amount of foliage required to support an outbreak which is an assumption of the double equilibria hypothesis this is a practical simplification of a density dependent process that is sufficient for our study from here we refer to the minimum value of fir foliage that triggers colonization as the leaf mass threshold lmt parasitism and predation on esbw may also be important controls on esbw density particularly at low population densities but our model simplifies its dynamics and excludes these processes we likewise exclude anthropogenic control measures of esbw which aim to limit tree mortality and anthropogenic drivers of tree community composition such as forest harvest and silviculture 2 3 2 consumption of foliage consumption of host foliage energy accumulation and usage are calculated by taking the number of individual larvae within an instar and multiplying it by the rate of consumption as measured in vial based experiments by leonard and koller 1981 table s3 if temperature is below 10 celsius all larvae except for l2o are killed régnière j and nealis v g 2019 though régnière and nealis 2019 focused their study on the western spruce budworm this specific mortality condition was developed with reference to studies on the frost tolerance of esbw larvae han and bause 1995 warm temperature sensitivity is represented by a temperature dependent metabolism function which accounts for the potential for overwinter starvation eq 4 régnière et al 2012 life stage progression and consumption is halted if daily temperatures are outside a temperature window of 2 5 to 32 celsius energy is still consumed during these days and mortality occurs if larvae deplete their energy reserves 4 e n e r g y l o s s 8 6623 e 11 t m e a n 6 5241 the esbw module interacts with lpj lmfire through both direct effects on tree growth and mortality and indirect effect on the probability of fire by increasing fuel loads consumption of live foliage from host trees abies and picea reduces carbon uptake while foliage and wood from the esbw killed trees are transferred to the litter pools the esbw module runs prior to fire and delivers information on fuel litter biomass to the fire model on an annual time step the size of this timestep is appropriate for this study given that budworm driven enhancements of fire tend to occur years after mortality due to fuel drying and fuel ladder development james et al 2017 in our initial model simulations foliage of the host trees was completely consumed by esbw after two to three simulation years field observations show that esbw defoliation typically takes up to 10 years prior to mortality chen et al 2017 a number of factors could explain this overestimated rate in the model including i lack of bottom up control on esbw through parasitism or predation and ii idealized food availability esbw is also a very wasteful eater consuming only a fraction of the total quantity of foliage on twigs and branches that die as a result of defoliation as a result more foliage is lost than what is actually consumed esbw larvae only consume current year foliage whereas in this version of our model host foliage from any year is available for consumption this additional restriction would likely extend the time from initial colonization to tree mortality and would be a useful addition to future iterations we addressed this inaccuracy in the model by imposing a scaling factor on the rate of foliage consumption to slow consumption rates to more realistic levels we multiplied rates by a constant value between 0 and 1 that we refer to as the consumption coefficient the length of defoliation period showed an inverse relationship with consumption coefficient cc with cc 0 35 inducing an outbreak length of approximately 5 10 years fig s3 this method though simple sufficed for our purposes given that our study was focused primarily on the impacts of esbw outbreak on forests over longer timescales the return interval showed strong sensitivity to lmt variation figs 6 and 7 in our model unimpeded consumption will lead to complete defoliation and subsequent complete mortality which repeats as cover regenerates and foliar density reaches the lmt in reality there is often an understory of suppressed host trees that is less affected by esbw outbreak that will resume growth after opening of the stand canopy lavoie et al 2021 our initial tests that allowed for complete mortality of host trees resulted in return intervals up to an order of magnitude larger than observed values to remedy the slow growth rates and reflect residual host trees surviving after outbreaks we allowed a small amount of foliage to survive post outbreak mortality was then defined to a set amount in accordance with past studies slow and fast litter from the killed trees were then allocated to total pools accordingly maclean 1980 presented average post outbreak mortality for mature 85 and immature balsam fir 42 stands spruce stands were found to have significantly lower average mortality for both mature 36 and immature 13 cases given that lpj lmfire does not have stand age incorporated an average of these two values was taken to estimate the modeled mortality which was 64 for fir and 25 for spruce application of this method yielded significantly faster regrowth post outbreak but still slower than observed values 2 4 modeling experiments three modeling experiments were performed to assess spatial and temporal patterns of esbw outbreaks and their interactions with fire first we tested the sensitivity of long term defoliation to a range of lmt values to generate a set of spatial patterns of esbw outbreaks comparable to observations in eastern canada where esbw is monitored annually by field and aerial surveys lmt was tested over a range of values resulting in a distinct set of defoliation patterns that could be compared and calibrated to those of gray and mackinnon 2006 to test the response of outbreak return interval against the lmt we ran a sensitivity test of fir foliage density over time including frequency of foliar collapse to lmt simulations were run over a range of lmt values in a smaller region on the ontario quebec border where an outbreak occurred in all runs return intervals defined as the time period between two consecutive esbw defoliation events were averaged over three consecutive outbreaks in transient runs from ten cells from regions defoliated in all runs intersection of all runs in the case of return intervals over 100 years outbreaks during spin up immediately prior to the transient stage were taken into consideration to test interactions between fire and esbw defoliation on fir foliage density we performed a factorial experiment with four scenarios a control scenario without any natural disturbances b fire only c esbw only and d fire and esbw to assess the effects of esbw integration on burned area fraction gross primary productivity slow fuel and carbon emissions variables from fire only runs were simply subtracted from the fire and esbw runs 2 5 model evaluation consolidated aerial sketch map data on esbw defoliation in canada from 1941 to 1998 were sourced from gray and mackinnon 2006 through personal communication we developed a ground truth dataset for model evaluation by creating a binary categorization of the aerial sketch map data though gray and mackinnon 2006 contained categorical outbreak classes we chose to convert both model and aerial sketch map data to binary classification given the qualitative nature of asm outbreak classes all classifications of outbreak ranging from very mild mild mild moderate moderate moderate severe severe to very severe were interpreted as outbreak occurrence indications shapefiles of outbreak classes were reclassified to the binary categories of defoliation present and defoliation absent and rasterized in alignment with model output in arcgis 10 7 1 to quantify agreement between model output and aerial sketch map based measurements of defoliation we computed the jaccard coefficient for each scenario relative to data by gray and mackinnon 2006 the jaccard coefficient is a simple metric of similarity between two sets of data calculated by dividing the intersection number of grid cells of model data agree on defoliation presence by the union total combined number of grid cells with defoliation by either model or data 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial patterns of outbreak through host tree density defoliation patterns showed strong sensitivity to lmt variation with low values of lmt resulting in very broad distributions of defoliation and high values resulting in a narrower concentrated southern pattern fig 3 a low lmt results in esbw appearing wherever abies appears even at low levels while at higher thresholds esbw only populates regions dense in fir simulated distributions of cumulative consumption generally match patterns of defoliation as found by gray and mackinnon 2006 at the higher end of lmt the latitudinal belt of esbw defoliation found by candau et al 1998 in ontario was also present in our simulations across eastern canada particularly at the higher end of lmt values this belt is where abies foliage is most dense and thus where environmental conditions are optimal for abies growth and fitness against other pfts this is consistent with findings by candau and fleming 2005 this suggests that host tree density may be an important factor in defining the southern boundary of defoliation which could shift northward under climate change scenarios the spatial distribution of frequent outbreaks hot spots was generally well simulated past defoliation in historical aerial sketch maps were co located with areas of high defoliation in our simulations though a strip of heavy defoliation was found fig 2 instead of point locations candau and fleming 2005 gray and mackinnon 2006 this can be attributed to model overestimation of abies density in this region as found by chaste et al 2018 evaluation of lpj lmfire s model skill in simulating genus level biomass in eastern canada note that in their study and ours lpj lmfire simulates potential vegetation based on environmental drivers and does not include the effects of management on composition management has been suggested to be the reason underlying low density of host species in corridors separating hotspots and could explain the difference in patterns between our simulations and observation candau et al 1998 belyea 1952 regions of high levels of defoliation in our simulations are generally surrounded by areas of lower levels of defoliation tapering off to zero by assuming outbreaks to be dependent solely on the density of host foliage we also see the radially diffusive patterns of outbreak frequency an lmt of 30 g m2 was found to drive simulations with highest agreement with asm data as model data agreement assessed using the jaccard coefficient fig 4 a tended to increase gradually toward an optimal value with a quick drop off afterward this best run scored a jaccard coefficient of 0 45 which is notably higher in agreement than a random model jaccard coefficient 0 20 see fig 4a total modeled values of live foliar biomass for picea pinus and populus pfts are at the lower end of empirical estimates but within an order of magnitude of measured average oven dry foliage biomass from mixed coniferous deciduous forest tadaki 1966 fig 5 a b c shows the binary presence absence re classification of model output and gray and mackinnon s data set and the intersection of these two data sets of the model parameter set that showed highest agreement with data the complement between model output and asm data was also calculated for the run of highest agreement fig 5d regions of disagreement include model simulations showing relatively higher outbreak severity in eastern newfoundland and labrador and nova scotia in the case of newfoundland and labrador this overestimate can be traced to lpj lmfire s tendency to significantly overestimate abies biomass in the eastern region likely due to overestimates of soil fertility chaste et al 2018 northern regions of quebec also show low levels of defoliation even at the higher end of lmt which are not observed in gray and mackinnon s 2006 analysis but appear within the northern boundaries of esbw presence as found by régnière et al 2012 thus lack of survey data rather than defoliation may underlie model data disagreement particularly due to the northern limit of surveys in quebec and for all of nova scotia gray 2013 3 2 temporal patterns of outbreaks return interval fig 7 shows return interval sensitivity to lmt for both intermediate and immature mortality values based on model assumptions the frequency of outbreak has an inverse relation to the level of mortality in stands in our model assuming all stands to have low mortality as prescribed by maclean s 1980 values for immature stands resulted in the fastest and most realistic return intervals however the assumption for all stands to be immature and mortality to be this low is unrealistic suggesting that selective regrowth may be too slow in the model triggering outbreaks by host foliage density produced roughly regular intervals based on the regeneration rates of host foliage and the value of the threshold parameter lmt as prescribed by versions of the silvicultural hypothesis pureswaran et al 2016 the degree of mortality also showed significant influence on the length of return intervals our results are roughly in agreement with regeneration based theories of esbw outbreak however this representation would be inconsistent with theories of outbreak that posit external influences such as predation and parasitism to be critical controls of defoliation onset and cessation johns et al 2019 régnière et al 2019 the value of lmt that resulted in a return interval closest to observation was still much lower than the value that produced best spatial pattern agreement however our simulated defoliation patterns were based on potential fir distributions and neglected the effects of management and their effects on fir density furthermore lack of survey data where esbw occurred such as in northern quebec may have resulted in increased commission error thus the lmt that best fits actual outbreak patterns could potentially be significantly lower 3 3 interactions between esbw and wildfire the esbw module progressively decreased the amount of fir foliage during outbreak with subsequent regrowth fig 8 c and d the results of our factorial experiment also showed that fire tended to decrease the overall volume of fir foliage by up to roughly half of its control values regeneration of fir foliage was also slower when fire was present fig 8b and d esbw presence triggered clear but small increases in burned fraction after defoliation events relative to control fig 9 a as living leaf mass from host trees decreases carbon uptake decreases while respiration values remain roughly constant resulting in lowered net uptake fig 9d after defoliation there is a small sustained increase in burned area 1 8 fig 9a this coincides with a sudden rise in slow fuel caused by mortality of host trees fig 9b increases in dry fuel leads to an increase in the rate of spread ros our simulations show that defoliation induced mortality leads to an increase in fuel load and an increased likelihood of ignition and larger fires this initial increase in burned area relative to control is followed by a decrease due to depletion of fuel carbon emissions from fire are also enhanced due to esbw in proportion to burned area at intermediate mortality rates esbw defoliation generated an average of 890 g m2 of burned fuel from killed host trees which resulted in at least small increases in burned area fig 9a in certain grid cells one may see larger enhancements of burned area fraction in a single fire when there is a large amount of dead fuel caused by defoliation and fire spreads into living biomass when averaged over the entire region these effects are attenuated to an average of less than 1 when averaged over time the overall amount of burned area of sites with and without esbw is small even for cells with strong pulses of enhancements in burned area to assess the larger spatial variation of the esbw fire interaction average increases in burned area after defoliation driven mortality were plotted across eastern canada interactions were found to be stronger in the west relative to the east fig 10 drier climate in the western part of the study area may explain in part stronger interactions relative to the eastern part of the boreal region studied extreme summer temperatures in ontario may also contribute to higher interactions relative to the maritimes in terms of moisture representation within lpj lmfire the probability that a fire will be triggered by lightning is represented by the dependence of ignition efficiency on fire danger index fdi which in turn is a function of soil moisture moisture of extinction is also represented in the fdi which is the upper bound value above which fire will not spread this is consistent with analysis that suggests the sensitivity of fire regimes to be higher in drier environments with a shorter fire cycle james et al 2017 fleming et al 2002 also found a general pattern of decreasing interaction strength from the drier climate of the west to the wetter east suggesting that drier climates would lead to slower decomposition and could extend the season of heightened fire potential and likelihood of successful ignition our simulation of esbw fire interactions agree with previous modeling studies and importantly the experimental results of stocks 1987 fire burn experiments and theorized observed impacts of esbw defoliation on forest carbon dynamics fleming et al 2002 it is difficult to compare our results with stocks work given the lack of control cases in past burn experiments to demonstrate how esbw may lead to a relative enhancement of burnt area the positive but small enhancement of fire by esbw defoliation modeled in our study could explain the subtle or null effects of esbw on fire risk found by james et al 2011 and sturtevant et al 2012 in these cases analyses at larger scales in which small pulses of enhancement may be washed out over larger spatiotemporal scales that is positive feedback from defoliation on burning may be largely canceled out by subsequent negative feedback averaged over longer timescales due to depleted fuel loads similarly post fire stands in boreal forest have been found less likely to burn due to reduced biomass and slow regrowth parisien et al 2020 in reality the interactions between fire and esbw are likely to be highly context dependent with wind and soil conditions likely playing important roles it should be noted that there is no interaction between grid cells in lpj lmfire so each disturbance i e fire and esbw does not spread between cells this is very likely to underestimate the importance of single large fire events that could rapidly grow or join additionally in our model the absence of fire leads to higher density and growth rates of fir foliage assuming that fir foliage density triggers outbreaks this could lead to both shorter return intervals and broader outbreaks this is consistent with silvicultural hypotheses that postulates that management including fire suppression could promote the occurrence of esbw outbreak by promoting abies this aspect could be further explored in future studies given its consistency with blais 1983 and its relevance to management practices 4 concluding remarks our study shows that the assumption that esbw outbreak and defoliation is triggered by the density of fir foliage has a number of consequences linking defoliation to modeled abies density produced results in general agreement with consolidated aerial based observations of esbw defoliation with model data agreement peaking at an intermediate value within the tested range of threshold values it is noteworthy that our simulation generated dynamic distributions of abies and picea from bare ground using only ecophysiological parametrizations of each pft reacting to environmental drivers competition between these pfts mediated by their growth parameters determined stands i e grid cells composition and density across time and space thus the ability to simulate spatial patterns of defoliation is highly contingent on successful simulation of abies it is natural that to simulate the large scale patterns of the parasite one must first successfully simulate the patterns of the host given the ability to estimate the general patterns of esbw defoliation including belt zone and hotspot type spatial patterns we posit that our methods may be sufficient as a first order approximation of spruce budworm fir dynamics while parasitism predation and dispersal are likely important controls of outbreak dynamics this method would at least conceivably give an upper bound on the extent of outbreak size host foliage biomass may not be the sole trigger of outbreak but it is likely a requisite condition as fuel is to fire this will be even more important when projecting out future patterns of esbw defoliation given the potentially major climate change driven changes in tree composition chaste et al 2019 moreover indirect and non climatic processes such as co2 fertilization fire and interaction between disturbances will likely play a factor in these shifts for these reasons this insect adapted dgvm version of lpj lmfire lpj lmfire esbw could be a powerful tool in forecasting large scale changes in defoliation and discerning underlying mechanisms future work could improve on several aspects to modeling biotic disturbance in a dgvm first dispersal is likely necessary to better represent defoliation dynamics to integrate dispersal would require inter cell interactions which has long been absent in other major forest processes such as fire and seed dispersal these interactions would likely change results significantly and could improve spatiotemporal dynamics second esbw is likely controlled not only by foliage availability but also by parasitoids e g cappuccino et al 1998 régnière et al 2020 and avian predators e g crawford et al 1983 crawford and jennings 1989 venier and holmes 2010 additionally a mechanistic approach to host preference could be implemented to account for potential future changes there has been evidence that changes in phenological synchrony between budbreak of host trees and emergence of l2o diapause phase could alter host preference from balsam fir to black spruce and subsequently push esbw distributions northward pureswaran et al 2019 increasing the number of pfts to include genera such as birch and maple would improve realism in forest regeneration and possibly alter post fire fuel dynamics particularly in the southern boreal where community composition is more diverse another avenue to improve upon would be working toward a sufficiently detailed representation of fuel structures and understory vegetation to enable more complete simulation of the delayed positive feedback of defoliation on fire as suggested by stocks 1987 our study was one of the very first attempts at integrating insect driven defoliation and biotic disturbance within a dgmv relative to fire modeling insect disturbance requires a more specific understanding of the disturbance agent s ecology physiology and its relationship to its host or multiple hosts we suggest this is an opportunity for entomologists ecologists and earth systems scientists to work together to better understand the role of biotic disturbances within the context of global change as many insect species affect forests worldwide and in turn the carbon storage trees represent here we opted to investigate esbw but the architecture of our model may be transferable to other species particularly other defoliators with appropriate revision and reparameterization for broader scale or global models researchers may consider broader functional classifications of biotic disturbance agents such as defoliators wood boring insects fungal pathogens etc using the bottom up controls of host foliage density to trigger initial outbreak we effectively simulated the spatial patterns of esbw and produced regular return intervals we suggest that these results may have physical implications given that regions of dense fir will eventually experience defoliation over longer timescales and that the regeneration rates of host foliage may play an important role in return interval length with additional sensitivity to mortality rates of past outbreaks thus the spatial and temporal patterns of esbw outbreak may be driven by specific aspects of the ecophysiology of balsam fir additionally we found that mortality driven by esbw defoliation enhanced burnt area though by a small amount when averaged over space and time our study used climate data from the last century calibrated with aerial sketch maps to replicate patterns of the past however spatiotemporal patterns of outbreak and interactions with fire are likely to shift due to climate change with potentially important contributions from shifts in host tree density code

24146,a process based model was developed to predict dry matter yields and amounts of harvested nitrogen in conventionally cropped grassland fields accounting for within field variation by a node network design and utilizing remotely sensed information from a drone borne system for increased accuracy the model named norne was kept as simple as possible regarding required input variables but with sufficient complexity to handle central processes and minimize prediction errors the inputs comprised weather data soil information management data related to fertilization and a visual estimate of clover proportion in the aboveground biomass a sensitivity analysis was included to apportioning variation in dry matter yield outputs to variation in model parameter settings using default parameter values from the literature the model was evaluated on data from a two year study 2016 2017 264 research plots in total each year conducted at two locations in norway i e in south east and in central norway with contrasting climatic conditions and with internal variation in soil characteristics the results showed that the model could estimate dry matter yields with a relatively high accuracy without any corrections based on remote sensing compared with published results from comparable model studies to further improve the results the model was calibrated shortly before harvest using predictions of above ground dry matter biomass obtained from a drone borne remote sensing system the only parameters which were hereby adjusted in the norne model were the starting values of nitrogen content in soil first cut and the plant available water capacity second cut the calibration based on the remotely sensed information improved the predictive performance of the model significantly at first cut the root mean square error rmse of dry matter yield prediction was reduced by 20 to a mean value of 58 g m 2 corresponding to a relative value rrmse of 0 12 for the second cut the rmse decreased by 13 to 66 g m 2 rrmse 0 18 the model was also evaluated in terms of the predictions of amounts of nitrogen in the harvested crop here the calibration reduced the rmse of the first cut by 38 obtaining a mean rmse value of 2 1 g n m 2 rrmse 0 28 for the second cut the rmse reduction for simulated harvested n was 16 corresponding to a mean rmse value of 2 3 g n m 2 rrmse 0 33 the large improvements in model accuracy for simulated dry matter and nitrogen yields obtained through calibration by utilizing remotely sensed information indicate the importance of considering spatial variability when applying models under nordic conditions both for yield predictions and for decision support for nitrogen application keywords calibration drone dynamic model precision nitrogen fertilization yield data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction forage based livestock production is a cornerstone in norwegian agriculture both in terms of land use and economic value steinshamn et al 2016 its position legitimacy and public support depend on its environmental performance regarding resource use efficiency and emissions of greenhouse gases acidifying and eutrophicating compounds tuning the application of nitrogen fertilizer to forage crop demand and production potential is regarded a key challenge in this context both in time and space precision agriculture is about matching resource application and agronomic practices with soil and crop requirements as they vary in space and time within a field whelan and mcbratney 2000 the concept is usually associated with precision fertilization that seeks to synchronize nutrient application with plant demand accounting for spatial variation in order to maximize crop yields high within field variation in nitrogen requirements is common because of highly varying crop status and soil characteristics but still fertilizers are commonly applied at uniform rate over the entire field according to the average regime in which yield expectations are assessed on field scale to be able to implement precision fertilization to a forage crop in practice it is crucial to develop a technological solution that enables predictions of required nitrogen inputs site specifically within field stafford 2000 auernhammer 2001 by describing the underlying mechanisms in the system process based dynamic models may simulate the interactions between vegetation and environment such models are widely designed to mimic production and phenological development of forage grasses to better understand the underlying biological and physical processes or to forecast yield and quality development for decision support in fodder production compared to empiric models process based models tend to be more readily adopted in grassland modeling because of their superior robustness accuracy and flexibility of application hurtado uria et al 2013 while process based models rely on theory obtained from a range of experimental approaches empirical models including machine learning models rely on observations machine learning can easily identify trends and patterns in data but the method requires massive data sets to train generalizable models such models will predict accurately the behavior of a system for conditions similar to the training data contrary to the process based models that should work well in all the situations for which they are developed many of the sub processes in crop growth are uncertain both in nature and their interactions and as models often perform worse when unnecessary complexity is added they should be kept as simple as possible under nordic conditions the process based grass simulation models basgra höglind et al 2016 basgra n höglind et al 2020 and catimo bonesmo and bélanger 2002a b and the soil crop model stics brisson et al 2003 simulate canopy growth as functions of weather conditions soil characteristics and crop management factors they are shown to work well under northern conditions korhonen et al 2018 simulating yield development in pure stands of timothy at a field scale level neither of the models managed however to simulate yield response adequately to gradients in nitrogen fertilization rates korhonen et al 2018 timothy is commonly grown in mixtures with clover but the mentioned simulation models have not been evaluated for that kind of stands because they do not account for clover nitrogen fixation remotely sensed data may provide an instant and non destructive estimate of grassland traits and therefore minimize costs and labor wachendorf et al 2018 recent studies demonstrated that the use of aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles uav in the following referred to as drones equipped with multi hyperspectral imagers can obtain good predictions of both grassland yield and quality through thorough radiometric calibration multivariate statistics and machine learning capolupo et al 2015 geipel et al 2021 lussem et al 2022 pullanagari et al 2018 2016 wijesingha et al 2020 assuming that the remotely sensed information is more accurate at the time of observation than the corresponding prediction of the process based growth model the former may be used to update the latter few studies have emphasized the topic of improving the predictions of a process based model by dynamic updates using remotely sensed information various methods on how to couple remotely sensed data with crop models have been reviewed kasampalis et al 2018 jin et al 2018 moulin et al 1998 but only the study by clevers et al 2002 have actually performed such a coupling this study uses spot satellite data to successfully calibrate a wheat growth model during run time the study by jin et al 2018 focused on the crucial question on which method to select for the actual model update different options were compared and concluded that calibration was the best option the overall aim of this work was to develop a tool that enables farmers to time harvests and target nitrogen inputs in their forage production according to prevailing yield potential for this purpose the norne model a process based model to predict daily dry

estimates on above ground standing biomass the model was kept relatively simple regarding required input variables and complexity in form of number of routines to be able to cover within field variations extra focus was placed on the water and nitrogen sub models finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify to what degree predicted dry matter yield was influenced by variation in settings of altogether 43 model parameters 2 material and methods 2 1 the core concept of norne in order to develop a tool that enables farmers to time harvests and target nitrogen inputs in their forage production according to prevailing yield potential a process based model the norne model was developed to predict grass growth and amount of nitrogen in yield on a daily basis for a node network within the field fig 1 to further improve prediction accuracy the system allows for in season and node wise model calibration using predictions of dry matter biomass from drone borne remote sensing norne is an expansion of grovfôrmodellen bakken 2016 which is an online decision support tool that simulates forage yield and quality development in species and species mixtures grown and harvested for silage production in norway in contrast to norne grovfôrmodellen has no routines that address and predict within field variation and crop nitrogen content and uptake is expressed by a simple function of calculated standing crop biomass according to the critical nitrogen curve greenwood et al 1990 sub optimal nitrogen supply according to crop demand is neither predicted nor allowed to retard crop growth rate the norne model requires daily input of weather data air temperature soil temperature precipitation global radiation wind speed and relative humidity soil type sand silty sand sandy loam loam sandy silt silty loam clay loam clay silty clay loam and silt clover percentage in the sward and some management data timing and amount of nitrogen fertilization and timing of harvests field capacity plant available water capacity and texture data are set according to riley 2021 for the given soil type the model consists of three sub models i the plant growth and dry matter partitioning sub model ii the water sub model and iii the nitrogen sub model that are further described in the sub sections below 2 1 1 the plant growth and dry matter partitioning sub model the norne model applies to daily d growth of grassland swards during the growing season in years of ley not to the year of establishment growth start in spring was estimated to be the third day when a five day floating average air temperature exceeded 5 c and the corresponding soil temperature at 10 cm depth exceeded 1 c then the potential daily growth δdmpot was estimated as a sigmoid function of leaf area

empirical data from field trials unpublished dry matter of residues dmresidues was set to be 2 of the dry matter yield a standard stubble height of 0 07 m was assumed which is in agreement with the stubble height of the field experiments producing the data used in this study the fraction of total above ground dry matter dmyield dmstub dmresidues allocated to stubble was formulated as a declining function adapted from the engnor model baadshaug and lantinga 2002 starting with allocating 85 of the total above ground dry matter to stubble in the beginning of the growth period after reaching an above ground dry matter biomass of 460 g m 2 no further allocation to the stubble was assumed root biomass was calculated according to an assumed root shoot ratio of 1 15 fystro 1995 90 of roots dry matter was estimated to be in the top soil layer dmroots ts and the remaining 10 in the sub soil layer dmroots ss fystro 2001 at each harvest 50 of the roots were assumed to die kertulis 2001 2 1 2 indices of aging air temperature and solar radiation the aging index ai retards daily growth rate until first cut according to the phenological stage of the grass crop the stage is expressed as mean stage by count msc moore et al 1991 attaining values on a continuous scale from 1 to 4 ai is set to 1 until msc exceeds 3 which corresponds to the stage when the inflorescence has emerged on 50 of the shoots afterwards ai declines until msc reaches 4 where it is set to 0 the development of msc is predicted according to an equation adapted from bonesmo 2004 with air temperature as the only driving variable the original day length function was excluded because most first cuts in silage production systems are taken when the day length is longer than the threshold for retardation of phenological advancement in regrowth after the first cut there is no clear relationship between sward structure as expressed by msc and aging and both the msc sub model and ai are left out for this part of the season earlier versions of the functions leading to scores on ai were defined by angus et al 1980 and torsell and kornher 1983 the temperature index ti was scored according to a bell shaped function of air temperature scaled between 0 and 1 the optimum was set at 17 c being the temperature corresponding to maximum growth torssell et al 1982 further no growth was assumed at temperatures below 0 or above 33 c torssell et al 1982 the solar radiation index si was calculated according to an inverse exponentially growing function of global radiation the function was scaled between 0 and 1 and was adapted from torssell et al 1982 2 1 3 the water sub model and the water index wi the amount of water in top wts and sub soil wss layer was calculated daily in mm l m 2 following eq 4 and eq 5

evapotranspiration ae subtracted from the water pool in both layers when water content in the top soil layer exceeded field capacity redundant water was assumed to percolate to the sub soil layer wpercolation equally when water content in the sub soil layer reached field capacity redundant water was assumed to leach to the ground wleaching the potential evapotranspiration pe was estimated according to a function described in riley and berentsen 2009 this function has been developed and tested under norwegian conditions and requires inputs of weather data global radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit that is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity and month number ae was calculated according to torssell et al 1982 eq 6 it was set to zero when water content was below the plant available water capacity 6 a e d p e d w t s d 1 w s s d 1 f c t s f c s s an index for water availability wi was constructed to retard simulated growth during periods with water deficit it was defined as the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration and scaled between 0 and 1 2 1 4 the nitrogen sub model and the nitrogen index ni nitrogen content in soil was calculated for both soil layers and included the processes of fertilization clover nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification percolation leaching mineralization humification and root death fig 2 the model distinguished three pools of organic nitrogen readily decomposable litter 1 slowly decomposable litter 2 and very slowly decomposable humus while the mineral nitrogen was split between ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 vold and søreng 1997 mineral nitrogen application was added to the nitrogen content in soil initially assumed to be 50 ammonia and 50 nitrate only the nitrogen content in form of nitrate was assumed to percolate or leach and its amount was estimated from the nitrate concentration in the soil water and the amount of water that percolated or leached nitrification is the microbiological oxidation of ammonia to nitrate the fraction of the ammonia nitrified to nitrate was calculated from soil temperature and soil water content in line with sierra et al 2003 denitrification is the microbial process of reducing nitrate to gaseous forms of nitrogen the calculation was based on the nitrate content in soil soil temperature and water filled pore space in line with heinen 2006 decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds is the result of two contrasting processes mineralization and humification it was estimated separately for the two soil layers and for each of the organic components litter 1 litter 2 and humus nitrogen mineralization was simulated as a first order decay using rate constants from vold and søreng 1997 and korsaeth et al 2003 and soil climate rate that accounts for temperature water and cultivar effect based on andrén et al 2004 mineralization is the process by which organic nitrogen is converted to plant available inorganic forms and was estimated to account for 99 of the decomposition whereas the remaining 1 was regarded as humification a fraction of the root dies at harvest and the nitrogen content within this dry matter was retained to the soil in line with the distribution of the root mass 90 of this nitrogen was retained in the top soil layer and the remaining 10 in the sub soil layer it was equally split between the organic components litter 1 and litter 2 clover has the ability to fixate nitrogen from the air to the soil and the estimation of the clover nitrogen fixation in the model was adapted from lazzarotto et al 2009 and depended on soil temperature soil mineral nitrogen dry matter of roots and clover proportion all fixated nitrogen from clover was assumed directly taken up by the plant nitrogen in mineral form was taken up by the plant from the soil on a daily basis together with the daily clover nitrogen fixated a maximum plant nitrogen concentration was set as a function of dry matter yield and used to limit the maximum daily nitrogen uptake further the nitrogen uptake was partitioned between the different parts of the plant eq 7 which was done in accordance with baadshaug and lantinga 2002 7 n t o t d n y i e l d d n s t u b d n r e s i d u e s d n r o o t s t s d n r o o t s s s d nitrogen scarcity is another growth limiting factor and the index for nitrogen availability ni was constructed to inhibit growth during periods with nitrogen deficit ni was defined as the ratio of a plant s current nitrogen concentration to the plant s critical nitrogen concentration and scaled between 0 and 1 a plant s critical nitrogen concentration is defined as the minimum plant nitrogen concentration allowing for maximum growth rate greenwood et al 1990 it declines with increased dry matter yield and was estimated in line with grovfôrmodellen 2 2 field experimental data field experimental data from a previous study conducted at two locations in norway geipel et al 2021 were used for model calibration and evaluation in south east norway the field experiment was located at apelsvoll 60 70 n 10 87 e 251 m above sea level research station with a humid continental climate the soil was an imperfectly drained loam in central norway the field experiment was located at kvithamar 63 49 n 10 87 e 25 m above sea level research station with a maritime climate the soil was a poorly drained silty clay loam at both locations the experiment was laid out on soil with high variation in organic matter content and partly texture using soil electric conductivity measurements as proxy variable fig 3 this was done to mimic a typical situation where within field differentiation of fertilization rate is required the fields were established in 2015 with a mixture of timothy phleum pratense l meadow fescue festuca pratensis and red clover trifolium pratense l and field trials were performed in the following two years 2016 and 2017 the trials were laid out according to a split plot design with five replicates in south east and six replicates in central norway three different fertilization rates low 13 g n m 2 medium 20 g n m 2 and high 27 g n m 2 were applied to main plots while time of harvest early and normal first cut was applied to sub plots totaling in 120 plots in south east and 144 plots in central norway the trials were managed with a three cut regime but data from the two first cuts were included in this study only at each harvest day a drone with a hyperspectral imager was used to capture canopy reflections of the grass legume mixture in the visual and near infrared part of the solar spectrum right before cut and yield registration clover proportion was visually estimated in field in south east then and at both sites the plants were cut at a stubble height of 0 07 m with an experimental plot harvester followed by fresh and dry matter yield registration sub samples of the dried yield were grinded and analysed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy giving outputs for forage quality and proportion of clover site in central norway only after that thorough radiometric and geometric calibration of the drone data was performed the canopy reflections were transformed to average reflectance per plot and used as predictors to calibrate a powered partial least squares regression model to estimate dry matter yield the validated prediction accuracy for a general dry matter yield model showed a root mean square error rmse of 15 2 55 g dm m 2 for consistency in the data and to exclude data with missing remote sensing estimates only the field experimental data from south east in 2016 and from central norway in 2017 was included in the current study moreover due to high clover percentages observed in the main plots fertilized at low rates these plots were omitted from the study as the norne model was not developed to handle such high percentages of clover that rarely occur in intensively managed grasslands in practice 2 3 weather data weather data with daily resolution were automatically recorded by weather stations provided by agrometeorology norway https lmt nibio no the data included air temperature c soil temperature c precipitation mm global radiation mj m 2 wind speed m s 2 and relative humidity air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at 2 m height while soil temperature was recorded at 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m below ground the measurements at 0 1 m below ground was used as the soil temperature in the top soil layer while the mean temperature at 0 2 and 0 5 m below ground was used as the soil temperature in the sub soil layer the distance between field trials and weather stations in this study was 350 m in south east and 110 m in central norway 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis determines the parameters that are the key drivers of a model by investigating to what extent the variation in model output is influenced by variation in the model parameter settings saltelli et al 2004 the screening method developed by morris morris 1991 is adequate for complex models like the norne model where the number of parameters and also the computational cost limit the possibility of numerical calculation the method identifies the parameters being most influential to model output in addition to which parameters have either a non linear relationship with the output or interactions with other parameters the elementary effects ee of model output are calculated by dividing the change in dry matter yield output from two consecutive model runs by the change in the input parameter eq 8 8 e e i θ y θ 1 θ i 1 θ i δ θ i 1 θ k y θ δ here is in the range of 1 p 1 1 1 p 1 p is the number of levels θ is any selected parameter vector mapped to the 0 1 space and θ is the selected parameter vector in the parameter space the transformed point θ from θ e i remains within the parameter space for each index i 1 2 k e i is a vector of zeros with a unit corresponding to its i th component the finite distribution of elementary effects denoted eei θ fi is constructed by r elementary effects that are sampled using an efficient design that constructs r trajectories of k 1 points in the parameter space two sensitivity measures are calculated 1 the mean value µ which evaluates the overall influence of the parameters on model output and 2 the standard deviation σ which is used to detect parameters involved in interaction with other parameters or whose effect is nonlinear to avoid the problem of effects of positive signs which occur when the model is non monotonic we will in this study use the mean of the absolute values µ campolongo et al 2007 for dynamic models that simulate daily outputs the sensitivity of model parameters may change with time it is consequently most appropriate to consider the output over the whole time series lamboni et al 2009 but the large number of responses that need to be evaluated makes this approach challenging for complex models in this study the total above ground yield at first and second cut was selected as the response the sensitivity analysis explored the space within the parameter boundaries defined as uniform distributions with minimum and maximum defined as 50 and 150 of the default value the sensitivity of a total of 43 model parameters were tested supporting information table s1 for both cuts the analysis was repeated for the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut thereafter the mean of the four calculations was used as result further the sensitivity of the model outputs to environmental conditions was included by introducing a parameter that was defined to vary between 1 and 4 and the selected value chose the location year combination south east central 2016 2017 2 5 in season model calibration the norne model is designed to handle within field variation and allows for in season calibration of central model parameters to improve the prediction accuracy based on remotely sensed information and resulting estimates on above ground standing biomass geipel et al 2021 calculated within 24 h before the cuts within field in season update of the norne model was performed by using the calibration procedure with the nonlinear least square algorithm this optimization algorithm searches for the parameter set which would minimize the sum of squares of residual error the workflow for the in season and node wise model calibration is illustrated in fig 4 here two consecutive calibrations were performed the parameters to be calibrated were selected due to the high within field soil variation that was deliberately included in the field experiment by using fields with high variation in terms of soil organic matter and soil texture firstly the model was calibrated based on remotely sensed information from drone overflights within 24 h before first cut to improve the model accuracy at first cut uncertainties regarding the starting value of nitrogen in soil were supposed to be the main source of discrepancy between simulated and actual observation at this early stage and the starting values of mineral and organic nitrogen in soil were selected for calibration the organic nitrogen content was allowed to vary between 100 and 1000 g m 2 while the mineral nitrogen content was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 3 g m 2 a starting value of 2 g m 2 mineral nitrogen initially consisting of 80 ammonium and 20 nitrate and 540 g m 2 organic nitrogen was assumed for the entire field and as the calibration was performed for a node network within the field node specific initial values for soil nitrogen content were generated secondly the model was calibrated based on remotely sensed information from drone overflights within 24 h before second cut to improve model accuracy at second cut water availability is important for optimal growth and uncertainties regarding the soil texture determining plant available water capacity was supposed to be the main source of discrepancy between simulated and actual observation at this later stage and was selected for calibration the plant available water capacity in the top soil layer was allowed to vary within the boundaries of all soil texture types riley 2021 which were 35 and 95 mm further the soil type containing that specific value for plant available water capacity in top soil layer was used and the corresponding field capacities and plant available water capacity in sub soil layer was used following the assumed soil type starting value of 62 75 and 54 25 mm was used at south east and 69 75 and 51 75 mm at central norway for top and sub soil layer respectively the results from the first calibration were incorporated and the calibration at second cut was performed for a node network within the field and node specific field capacity levels were generated 2 6 model performance model performance was evaluated by four criteria to quantify the mismatch between simulated and observed quantity of dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in plants the four criteria were the absolute error ae root mean square error rmse the normalized relative rmse rrmse and the mean square error mse as decomposed into its two components squared bias and variance error kobayashi and salam 2000 eq 9 12 9 a e i s i o i 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 11 r r m s e r m s e o 12 m s e s o 2 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o 2 here n is the number of observations si is the simulated value oi is the observed value s is the vector of model simulations o is the vector of observations s is the mean simulated value and o is the mean observed value the first component of mse refers to bias while the second component refers to variance error bias is the difference between the average simulation and observation and indicates error from erroneous assumptions in the model or an underfitted model variance error on the other hand is a more random error that shows the variability of model simulation for a given data point or spread in the data a high variance error may indicate an overfitted model ae was only calculated separately for the sub plots while rmse rrmse and mse was calculated for each treatment 3 results the sensitivity of 43 parameters to the dry matter yield output was assessed by a sensitivity analysis looking at the dry matter yield outputs at first and second cut respectively fig 5 the group of the 10 most sensitive parameters to dry matter yield at first cut fig 5a and the 11 most sensitive parameters to dry matter yield at second cut fig 5b were selected both according to the main influential impact mean value and according to either a non linear relationship with the output or interactions with other parameters standard deviation within these two groups four parameters were common θ 24 the optimum air temperature for grass growth used to calculate the temperature index ti θ 5 the fraction of starting value of organic nitrogen in soil allocated to humus θ 6 the fraction of starting value of organic nitrogen in soil allocated to litter 2 among the fraction not allocated to humus and θ3 the environmental effect the overall two most sensitive parameters were θ 28 the initial growth rate during spring growth rm and θ 34 the maximum daily growth during spring growth dmmax at first cut and correspondingly θ 29 the initial growth rate during regrowth between first and second cut rm and θ 35 the maximum daily growth during regrowth between first and second cut dmmax at second cut additionally the parameter θ 31 at first cut and θ 32 at second cut was in the group of the most sensitive parameters also being a parameter value used to estimate potential daily dry matter yield during respectively spring growth and regrowth between first and second cut finally at first cut θ 15 a temperature threshold value used to calculate lai during first part of spring growth and θ 26 and θ 27 being respectively the parameter determining the curvature of the radiation response curve and the insolation at light saturation of the stand used to calculate the solar index si further at second cut θ 14 θ 16 and θ 17 which are all temperature threshold values used to calculate lai and θ4 the plant available water capacity at top soil level dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield at first and second cuts of a forage crop were simulated by the norne model using default parameter values and the outputs were further compared to observed values using the field experimental data from south east norway in 2016 and from central norway in 2017 the error term rmse was calculated individually for the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut at both locations further the mse was calculated and decomposed into its two components of squared bias and variance error and transferred into the rmse of dry matter yield fig 6 and amount of nitrogen in yield fig 7 for the first cut in south east fig 6a and in central norway fig 6c an average rmse of respectively 79 4 and 64 9 g m 2 was found for dry matter yield for both locations the rmse was lowest for the early first cut treatments while it generally increased with nitrogen fertilization rate except for the early cut in central norway the overall highest error term was detected for the treatment with normal first cut combined with high fertilization rate both dominated by bias that contributed with respectively 63 and 78 of the error term for south east and central norway the error terms for both locations with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate were dominated by variance error 81 and 100 the rrmse was lowest for the early first cut ranging between 0 10 and 0 13 while it ranged between 0 12 and 0 26 for the normal harvest for improved model fit at first cut the initial values for organic and mineral nitrogen in soil were optimized through model calibration with the remotely sensed predictions of dry matter yield this resulted in separate starting values through the sub plots nodes the starting value for organic nitrogen in soil was allowed to vary between 100 and 1000 g n m 2 while mineral nitrogen was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 3 g n m 2 after calibration the initial mineral nitrogen content varied between 0 5 and 3 g n m 2 in both south east and central norway while the initial organic nitrogen content varied between 100 and 672 g n m 2 in south east and between 100 and 1000 g n m 2 in central norway rmse was re calculated after calibration fig 5b and d showing an overall reduction resulting in an average rmse of respectively 57 0 and 59 5 g m 2 in south east and central norway for the treatments with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate no changes in the initial values were obtained after calibration for the treatment with normal first cut in both locations and the treatment with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in south east norway improvements in the error term were found for dry matter yield at first cut after calibration the rmse was reduced by 4 to 42 g m 2 while rrmse was reduced by up to 0 08 overall an 18 reduction in rrmse was achieved for the treatment in central norway with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate an increased error term was achieved after calibration due to an initial better fit for the norne model compared to the remote sensing predictions the error term was generally dominated by variance error for the second cut in south east fig 6e and in central norway fig 6g an average rmse of respectively 75 4 and 74 7 g m 2 was found for dry matter yield initially for both locations the rmse was highest in the treatment with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate the error term was generally dominated by bias except the treatment with normal first cut in south east norway and the treatment with normal first cut combined with high fertilization rate in central norway where variance error accounted for most of the error term for improved model fit at second cut the initial value for plant available water capacity in top soil layer was calibrated while the corresponding capacity in sub soil layer and the field capacity in both layers were set according to the soil type corresponding to the plant available water capacity identified by calibration the parameters were allowed to vary within the boundary of all soil types after calibration the plant available water capacity in top soil varied between 56 and 92 l m 2 in south east and 70 l m 2 in central norway the model was re run from growth start using the new parameter values and rmse at second cut was re calculated fig 6f and h the rmse varied between 35 4 and 96 6 g m 2 in south east and between and 37 0 and 99 5 g m 2 in central norway it was dominated by variance error and the highest error term was detected for early first cut in central norway the rmse was thus reduced by 9 5 to 65 6 g m 2 while rmse was reduced by up to 0 09 overall an 13 reduction in rrmse was achieved only predictions of the treatments with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway were not improved in the calibration process the ae was calculated individually for each sub plot with the distribution for the initial dry matter yield estimates at first fig 8 a and second cut fig 8c given combined for all sub plots that included the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut and both locations a distribution shifted to the right was detected in both cases with mean values of 41 3 and 57 2 g m 2 and standard deviations of 66 0 and 52 4 g m 2 respectively for the first and second cut the shift to the right with positive mean values of ae indicate a general overestimation of dry matter yield by the norne model when compared to field observation data the distribution of ae at first cut after calibration fig 7b had a mean value of 6 4 g m 2 and standard deviation of 60 3 g m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a minor overestimation of dry matter yield when compared to field data also the spread in fit between sub plots was reduced the distribution of ae at second cut after calibration fig 7d showed a mean value of 41 6 g m 2 with a standard deviation of 58 7 g m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a general overestimation of dry matter yield when compared to field data the rmse for amount of nitrogen in yield was calculated and given in fig 6 for the first cut in south east fig 7a and in central norway fig 7c an average rmse of respectively 4 0 and 2 7 g n m 2 was found the error term was dominated by bias contributing with 74 to 98 except for the treatment with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway where the bias only accounted for 30 of the error for both locations the rmse was highest for the treatments with high fertilization rate rmse at first cut was re calculated after calibration fig 7b and d the error term was higher for the treatments with high fertilization rate compared to the treatments with medium fertilization rate for the second cut in south east fig 7e and in central norway fig 7g an average rmse of respectively 2 4 and 3 1 g n m 2 was found for amount of nitrogen in yield initially the error term was dominated by bias contributing with 66 to 94 of the error term after calibration the rmse was recalculated for south east fig 7f and central norway fig 7h it was reduced at all treatments except the early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway the variance generally dominated after calibration the ae was calculated individually for each sub plot with the distribution for the initial estimates of amount of nitrogen in dry matter yield at first fig 9 a and second cut fig 9c given combined for all sub plots that included the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut and both locations a distribution shift to the right was detected in both cases with mean values of 3 1 and 2 6 g n m 2 and standard deviations of 1 7 and 1 2 g n m 2 respectively for the first and second cut the large shift to the right with positive mean values of the ae indicate a general high overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield by the norne model when compared to field observation data the distribution of ae at first cut after calibration fig 9b had a mean value of 1 5 g n m 2 and standard deviation of 1 8 g n m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a minor overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield when compared to field data the distribution of ae at second cut after calibration fig 8d had a mean value of 1 2 g n m 2 with a standard deviation of 1 9 g n m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a general overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield when compared to field data the simulated dry matter yield at harvest before and after model calibration is presented for each sub plot within treatment and location in the supporting information section figures s1 s8 the observed yield and the yield predictions from remote sensing are also included in these figures among the altogether 176 sub plots six sub plots from one site and treatment that differed in observed dry matter yield were selected as an illustration of model performance fig 10 for these six sub plots the model initially estimated a dry matter yield of 585 g m 2 at first cut and 324 g m 2 at second cut throughout the field after calibration sub plot specific parameter values were applied and the new simulation caught to a large extent the infield observed variation from 434 to 590 g m 2 in the first cut and from 252 to 308 g m 2 in the second cut fig 10 4 discussion when predicting dry matter yields with the norne model within two locations in norway at two rates of fertilization and for two different harvesting regimes the model fitted the measured yields well overall the model performed with an rmse of 72 g m 2 at first cut and 75 g m 2 at second cut when using the default parameter values i e without utilizing remotely sensed information the rrmse was 0 15 at first cut and 0 22 at second cut these results where comparably better than those reported by korhonen et al 2018 who evaluated three growth models for timothy basgra catimo and stics under northern conditions including data from norway sweden finland and canada our norne model achieved 0 30 0 15 and 0 7 smaller errors expressed as rrmse for first cuts and 0 08 0 52 and 0 01 smaller errors for second cuts respectively for basgra catimo and stics the basgra model was later tested under nordic conditions in a study by höglind et al 2020 allowing field specific calibration of some model parameters basgra then performed with an rrmse of 0 29 in sweden and 0 27 in norway for dry matter yield predictions still worse than the rrmse of yield predictions of norne using unchanged default parameter settings the amount of nitrogen in yield g n harvested per m2 was estimated with less accuracy than dry matter yield but still with a significant improvement after calibration to dry matter yield observations further improvement is to be expected if calibrations also were undertaken on basis of measurements of concentration of nitrogen in the yield höglind et al 2020 included calculations and testing on crude protein content with an rrmse of maximum 0 30 for swedish data and 0 18 for norwegian the norne model was not tested on crude protein but for the amount of nitrogen in yield it performed with a mean rrmse of 0 30 nitrogen availability is crucial for optimal crop growth and a comprehensive sub model for soil plant nitrogen dynamics was therefore developed within the norne model existing functions were adapted from literature and combined to describe the dynamic processes with parameter values directly taken from literature the inclusion of a separate nitrogen sub model is a strength of the norne model compared to other crop growth models and may explain the better fit and its ability to catch the effects of different nitrogen application rates it is also a necessity for further development of the model into a decision support tool for optimal plant nitrogen fertilization the norne model managed to simulate dry matter yield responses to increased nitrogen fertilization rates but still using the initial parameter values a better fit was achieved at first cut for the plots fertilized at medium rate compared to the fields fertilized at high rate contrary at second cut the plots fertilized at high rate achieved a better fit compared to the plots fertilized at medium rate the study by korhonen et al 2018 showed that the stics model with a more detailed description of soil nitrogen mineralization and water balance compared to basgra and catimo simulated dry matter yield response to increased nitrogen fertilization rates more accurately than the latter two models which both underestimated the nitrogen fertilization response within field soil variation e g varying distance to drainage networks is typical in farmers fields and may cause spatial variability in dry matter yield to mimic a typical situation the field experiments were placed on soils with high internal variation in organic matter content and partly texture such non linear effects can be accounted for using different methods li and converino 2021 runge et al 2019 but a global sensitivity analysis was selected in this study to assess the sensitivity of 43 parameters in the norne model to dry matter yield outputs at first and second cut the chosen screening method morris 1991 detected the parameters that were highly and weakly influential to changes in the dry matter yield output linear relationship additionally to detecting parameters with non linear relationships to the dry matter yield output and the parameters interaction with other parameters the results showed that parameters from the plant module were the most sensitive ones parameters related to the starting value of nitrogen in soil optimal air temperature for crop growth and the environmental effect were important for the dry matter yield prediction at both first and second cut finally the plant available water content was only among the most highly sensitive parameters to the model output at second cut within 24 h before each cut canopy reflection measurements were performed with a drone borne hyperspectral imager based on these measurements predictions of dry matter yield were calculated with a powered partial least square regression model at high spatial resolution i e plot level geipel et al 2021 in contrast to the norne model that provides daily predictions over the entire growing season the remote sensing model only applies to a very narrow time interval of one to two days around the day of measurement given a well calibrated and robust remote sensing model the remote sensing predictions were more accurate than the corresponding predictions of the norne model and assimilation of the outputs were used to improve the prediction accuracy of dry matter yields by the norne model nevertheless the remote sensing model should be calibrated for a wider time span of drone borne measurements than just right before harvest to enable more suitable predictions for applications in farming practice in line with drone borne measurements satellite data can be used for this purpose kasampalis et al 2018 and in zare et al 2022 within season assimilation of satellite observations was shown to improve the model fit of the pilote crop growth model used to forecast winter wheat different assimilation methods as calibration forcing and updating are tested and discussed in the literature jin et al 2018 kasampalis et al 2018 as forcing does not use any information in the crop model but simply uses the remotely sensed data to replace the crop model simulation data updating continuously adjusts model parameters in the crop model during the run time while the calibration strategy adjusts selected parameters to achieve optimal consistency between the remote sensing data and the simulated state variables among the three methods calibration is theoretically a better choice but has a high computational cost due to the requirement of a lot of optimization iterations in line with jin et al 2018 calibration was successfully used in this study calibration was first performed at first cut and then a re calibration was performed at second cut later in the season the traditional calibration algorithm nonlinear least square was used in the assimilation step in this study this optimization algorithm searches for the parameter set which would minimize the sum of squares of residual error the more comprehensive bayesian calibration berger 1985 has the advantage that it in addition to calibrating the parameter values simultaneously quantifies the parameter uncertainty campbell 2006 it is a flexible method but due to a high computational cost when applied to complex models the method was not used in this study as the calibration process will be implemented in a decision support system a faster routine is required soil variation was deliberately included in the field experiment to mimic a typical situation where site specific fertilization is required this was done by selecting a field with imperfectly drained soil with high variation in terms of soil organic matter and partly soil texture despite the variation a uniform value was initially used for the entire field for both nitrogen in soil and soil texture the initial values of both soil mineral and organic nitrogen were selected as the parameters to be calibrated at first cut the rationale for this was that the amount of soil nitrogen is previously shown to be a sensitive model parameter hjelkrem et al 2021 and that actual soil mineral and organic nitrogen contents are rarely known in practice at least not at high resolution within a field the calibration of these initial values indicated high within field variation and their adjustments improved the predictions of the norne model in all but one case overall the model achieved an rmse of 58 g m 2 for dry matter yield at first cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized the rrmse was 0 12 which corresponds to a reduction in the error term of 20 at first cut compared to the use of initial parameter values further development of remote sensing technology and more comprehensive data sets for empirical model calibration will enable more accurate and reliable remote sensing predictions to adjust and optimize crop model parameters and improve crop model simulation results at field and regional scales in addition to improve model performance the spatial information that is added to the process based model from the incorporation of the remote sensing data allows the model to predict and advice site specifically which is required for precision agriculture in addition to the presence of nitrogen water availability is important for optimal crop growth hurtado uria et al 2013 evaluated the english crop growth model developed by johnson and thornley 1983 under irish conditions and concluded that the inclusion of a water sub model would improve the model s accuracy a thorough sub model for water was thus included in the norne model highly depending on soil texture that was set uniform for the entire field despite the known within field variation plant available water capacity was given by the value of soil texture and was selected for calibration at second cut the value of this parameter influenced the model output substantially and through calibration improvements in the predictions of the norne model were achieved overall the model performed with an rmse of 66 g m 2 for dry matter yield at second cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized the rrmse was 0 18 which corresponds to a reduction in the error term of 19 at second cut compared to the use of initial parameter values thus the special information added to the process based model highly improved the model accuracy at second cut using data from two geographically spread locations in norway south east and central including two rates of nitrogen fertilization medium and high and two harvesting regimes the norne model simulated dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield with promising accuracy even though the model is process based it includes several empirically derived functions and one could assume that the accuracy of the model would vary with climatic and other environmental conditions hence model testing across a wide range of conditions is a key to strengthening the model therefore a more comprehensive model validation is required including a broader variation in crop composition and soil and weather conditions in order to obtain a model of more generalized validity for northern conditions additionally a routine to handle inputs and mineralization of organic nitrogen in animal manure and other organic fertilizers should be included in a future version to increase the usability of the model for a wider range of agricultural practices with regard to the overall ambition that norne will constitute the basis of a decision support system for timing of harvests and target nitrogen inputs to demand routines for collection and interpretation of weather forecast with high spatial resolution need to be established presently there are no forecasts for soil temperature and only two day forecasts for global radiation and proxies need to be developed to get the demanded input data further the model must be implemented into a digital farm management service along a web based user interface for the integration of geo referenced field fertilization remote sensing and preferably soil data also the use of satellite data in place of drone borne sensor measurements should be evaluated in the future as hyperspectral imagers are still rather costly more affordable solutions are needed to enable a faster and more widespread implementation of remote sensing under today s practical conditions here multispectral imagery from off the shelf drones e g dji p4ms and publicly available satellite missions e g esa copernicus sentinel 2 represent promising alternatives yet at the cost of a slight decrease in prediction accuracy 5 conclusions the newly developed norne model simulated crop dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield with promising accuracy the inclusion of in season nodewise calibration of the parameters soil nitrogen content i e mineral and organic nitrogen at initiation of growth and soil field capacity improved the model performance significantly overall the model performed with an rmse rrmse of 58 g m 2 0 12 for dry matter yield at first cut and 66 g m 2 0 18 at second cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized which corresponds to a reduction of respectively 20 and 16 for each cut when compared to the use of initial parameter values for amount of nitrogen in yield the improvements were even larger when utilizing remotely sensed information although the model was calibrated using remotely sensed predictions of dry matter yield only a reduction in the estimated rmse of 38 was achieved during first cut and 26 during second cut overall the model performed with an rmse rrmse of 2 1 g n m 2 0 28 during first cut and 2 3 g n m 2 0 33 during second cut for simulated amount of nitrogen in yield when remotely sensed information on dry matter yield was utilized in future a routine to handle inputs of animal manure and other organic fertilizers should be included to increase the usability of the model further in agricultural practice also the use of satellite data in place of drone borne measurements should be evaluated finally in a next step a feedback loop for nitrogen demand will be added and the system will be included in a decision support system within a digital infrastructure to serve as a tool for farmers giving advice on farming practice credit authorship contribution statement anne grete roer hjelkrem conceptualization methodology software

24146,a process based model was developed to predict dry matter yields and amounts of harvested nitrogen in conventionally cropped grassland fields accounting for within field variation by a node network design and utilizing remotely sensed information from a drone borne system for increased accuracy the model named norne was kept as simple as possible regarding required input variables but with sufficient complexity to handle central processes and minimize prediction errors the inputs comprised weather data soil information management data related to fertilization and a visual estimate of clover proportion in the aboveground biomass a sensitivity analysis was included to apportioning variation in dry matter yield outputs to variation in model parameter settings using default parameter values from the literature the model was evaluated on data from a two year study 2016 2017 264 research plots in total each year conducted at two locations in norway i e in south east and in central norway with contrasting climatic conditions and with internal variation in soil characteristics the results showed that the model could estimate dry matter yields with a relatively high accuracy without any corrections based on remote sensing compared with published results from comparable model studies to further improve the results the model was calibrated shortly before harvest using predictions of above ground dry matter biomass obtained from a drone borne remote sensing system the only parameters which were hereby adjusted in the norne model were the starting values of nitrogen content in soil first cut and the plant available water capacity second cut the calibration based on the remotely sensed information improved the predictive performance of the model significantly at first cut the root mean square error rmse of dry matter yield prediction was reduced by 20 to a mean value of 58 g m 2 corresponding to a relative value rrmse of 0 12 for the second cut the rmse decreased by 13 to 66 g m 2 rrmse 0 18 the model was also evaluated in terms of the predictions of amounts of nitrogen in the harvested crop here the calibration reduced the rmse of the first cut by 38 obtaining a mean rmse value of 2 1 g n m 2 rrmse 0 28 for the second cut the rmse reduction for simulated harvested n was 16 corresponding to a mean rmse value of 2 3 g n m 2 rrmse 0 33 the large improvements in model accuracy for simulated dry matter and nitrogen yields obtained through calibration by utilizing remotely sensed information indicate the importance of considering spatial variability when applying models under nordic conditions both for yield predictions and for decision support for nitrogen application keywords calibration drone dynamic model precision nitrogen fertilization yield data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction forage based livestock production is a cornerstone in norwegian agriculture both in terms of land use and economic value steinshamn et al 2016 its position legitimacy and public support depend on its environmental performance regarding resource use efficiency and emissions of greenhouse gases acidifying and eutrophicating compounds tuning the application of nitrogen fertilizer to forage crop demand and production potential is regarded a key challenge in this context both in time and space precision agriculture is about matching resource application and agronomic practices with soil and crop requirements as they vary in space and time within a field whelan and mcbratney 2000 the concept is usually associated with precision fertilization that seeks to synchronize nutrient application with plant demand accounting for spatial variation in order to maximize crop yields high within field variation in nitrogen requirements is common because of highly varying crop status and soil characteristics but still fertilizers are commonly applied at uniform rate over the entire field according to the average regime in which yield expectations are assessed on field scale to be able to implement precision fertilization to a forage crop in practice it is crucial to develop a technological solution that enables predictions of required nitrogen inputs site specifically within field stafford 2000 auernhammer 2001 by describing the underlying mechanisms in the system process based dynamic models may simulate the interactions between vegetation and environment such models are widely designed to mimic production and phenological development of forage grasses to better understand the underlying biological and physical processes or to forecast yield and quality development for decision support in fodder production compared to empiric models process based models tend to be more readily adopted in grassland modeling because of their superior robustness accuracy and flexibility of application hurtado uria et al 2013 while process based models rely on theory obtained from a range of experimental approaches empirical models including machine learning models rely on observations machine learning can easily identify trends and patterns in data but the method requires massive data sets to train generalizable models such models will predict accurately the behavior of a system for conditions similar to the training data contrary to the process based models that should work well in all the situations for which they are developed many of the sub processes in crop growth are uncertain both in nature and their interactions and as models often perform worse when unnecessary complexity is added they should be kept as simple as possible under nordic conditions the process based grass simulation models basgra höglind et al 2016 basgra n höglind et al 2020 and catimo bonesmo and bélanger 2002a b and the soil crop model stics brisson et al 2003 simulate canopy growth as functions of weather conditions soil characteristics and crop management factors they are shown to work well under northern conditions korhonen et al 2018 simulating yield development in pure stands of timothy at a field scale level neither of the models managed however to simulate yield response adequately to gradients in nitrogen fertilization rates korhonen et al 2018 timothy is commonly grown in mixtures with clover but the mentioned simulation models have not been evaluated for that kind of stands because they do not account for clover nitrogen fixation remotely sensed data may provide an instant and non destructive estimate of grassland traits and therefore minimize costs and labor wachendorf et al 2018 recent studies demonstrated that the use of aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles uav in the following referred to as drones equipped with multi hyperspectral imagers can obtain good predictions of both grassland yield and quality through thorough radiometric calibration multivariate statistics and machine learning capolupo et al 2015 geipel et al 2021 lussem et al 2022 pullanagari et al 2018 2016 wijesingha et al 2020 assuming that the remotely sensed information is more accurate at the time of observation than the corresponding prediction of the process based growth model the former may be used to update the latter few studies have emphasized the topic of improving the predictions of a process based model by dynamic updates using remotely sensed information various methods on how to couple remotely sensed data with crop models have been reviewed kasampalis et al 2018 jin et al 2018 moulin et al 1998 but only the study by clevers et al 2002 have actually performed such a coupling this study uses spot satellite data to successfully calibrate a wheat growth model during run time the study by jin et al 2018 focused on the crucial question on which method to select for the actual model update different options were compared and concluded that calibration was the best option the overall aim of this work was to develop a tool that enables farmers to time harvests and target nitrogen inputs in their forage production according to prevailing yield potential for this purpose the norne model a process based model to predict daily dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield according to nitrogen demand and availability based on soil characteristics sward clover proportion local weather and field management information was designed and tested the model was designed to handle within field variation and to allow for in season calibration of central model parameters based on remotely sensed information and resulting estimates on above ground standing biomass the model was kept relatively simple regarding required input variables and complexity in form of number of routines to be able to cover within field variations extra focus was placed on the water and nitrogen sub models finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify to what degree predicted dry matter yield was influenced by variation in settings of altogether 43 model parameters 2 material and methods 2 1 the core concept of norne in order to develop a tool that enables farmers to time harvests and target nitrogen inputs in their forage production according to prevailing yield potential a process based model the norne model was developed to predict grass growth and amount of nitrogen in yield on a daily basis for a node network within the field fig 1 to further improve prediction accuracy the system allows for in season and node wise model calibration using predictions of dry matter biomass from drone borne remote sensing norne is an expansion of grovfôrmodellen bakken 2016 which is an online decision support tool that simulates forage yield and quality development in species and species mixtures grown and harvested for silage production in norway in contrast to norne grovfôrmodellen has no routines that address and predict within field variation and crop nitrogen content and uptake is expressed by a simple function of calculated standing crop biomass according to the critical nitrogen curve greenwood et al 1990 sub optimal nitrogen supply according to crop demand is neither predicted nor allowed to retard crop growth rate the norne model requires daily input of weather data air temperature soil temperature precipitation global radiation wind speed and relative humidity soil type sand silty sand sandy loam loam sandy silt silty loam clay loam clay silty clay loam and silt clover percentage in the sward and some management data timing and amount of nitrogen fertilization and timing of harvests field capacity plant available water capacity and texture data are set according to riley 2021 for the given soil type the model consists of three sub models i the plant growth and dry matter partitioning sub model ii the water sub model and iii the nitrogen sub model that are further described in the sub sections below 2 1 1 the plant growth and dry matter partitioning sub model the norne model applies to daily d growth of grassland swards during the growing season in years of ley not to the year of establishment growth start in spring was estimated to be the third day when a five day floating average air temperature exceeded 5 c and the corresponding soil temperature at 10 cm depth exceeded 1 c then the potential daily growth δdmpot was estimated as a sigmoid function of leaf area

empirical data from field trials unpublished dry matter of residues dmresidues was set to be 2 of the dry matter yield a standard stubble height of 0 07 m was assumed which is in agreement with the stubble height of the field experiments producing the data used in this study the fraction of total above ground dry matter dmyield dmstub dmresidues allocated to stubble was formulated as a declining function adapted from the engnor model baadshaug and lantinga 2002 starting with allocating 85 of the total above ground dry matter to stubble in the beginning of the growth period after reaching an above ground dry matter biomass of 460 g m 2 no further allocation to the stubble was assumed root biomass was calculated according to an assumed root shoot ratio of 1 15 fystro 1995 90 of roots dry matter was estimated to be in the top soil layer dmroots ts and the remaining 10 in the sub soil layer dmroots ss fystro 2001 at each harvest 50 of the roots were assumed to die kertulis 2001 2 1 2 indices of aging air temperature and solar radiation the aging index ai retards daily growth rate until first cut according to the phenological stage of the grass crop the stage is expressed as mean stage by count msc moore et al 1991 attaining values on a continuous scale from 1 to 4 ai is set to 1 until msc exceeds 3 which corresponds to the stage when the inflorescence has emerged on 50 of the shoots afterwards ai declines until msc reaches 4 where it is set to 0 the development of msc is predicted according to an equation adapted from bonesmo 2004 with air temperature as the only driving variable the original day length function was excluded because most first cuts in silage production systems are taken when the day length is longer than the threshold for retardation of phenological advancement in regrowth after the first cut there is no clear relationship between sward structure as expressed by msc and aging and both the msc sub model and ai are left out for this part of the season earlier versions of the functions leading to scores on ai were defined by angus et al 1980 and torsell and kornher 1983 the temperature index ti was scored according to a bell shaped function of air temperature scaled between 0 and 1 the optimum was set at 17 c being the temperature corresponding to maximum growth torssell et al 1982 further no growth was assumed at temperatures below 0 or above 33 c torssell et al 1982 the solar radiation index si was calculated according to an inverse exponentially growing function of global radiation the function was scaled between 0 and 1 and was adapted from torssell et al 1982 2 1 3 the water sub model and the water index wi the amount of water in top wts and sub soil wss layer was calculated daily in mm l m 2 following eq 4 and eq 5

was assumed to be at field capacity in both soil layers retrieved from soil type according to riley 2021 daily precipitation p was added to the water content in the top soil layer and actual evapotranspiration ae subtracted from the water pool in both layers when water content in the top soil layer exceeded field capacity redundant water was assumed to percolate to the sub soil layer wpercolation equally when water content in the sub soil layer reached field capacity redundant water was assumed to leach to the ground wleaching the potential evapotranspiration pe was estimated according to a function described in riley and berentsen 2009 this function has been developed and tested under norwegian conditions and requires inputs of weather data global radiation wind speed and vapor pressure deficit that is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity and month number ae was calculated according to torssell et al 1982 eq 6 it was set to zero when water content was below the plant available water capacity 6 a e d p e d w t s d 1 w s s d 1 f c t s f c s s an index for water availability wi was constructed to retard simulated growth during periods with water deficit it was defined as the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration and scaled between 0 and 1 2 1 4 the nitrogen sub model and the nitrogen index ni nitrogen content in soil was calculated for both soil layers and included the processes of fertilization clover nitrogen fixation nitrification denitrification percolation leaching mineralization humification and root death fig 2 the model distinguished three pools of organic nitrogen readily decomposable litter 1 slowly decomposable litter 2 and very slowly decomposable humus while the mineral nitrogen was split between ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 vold and søreng 1997 mineral nitrogen application was added to the nitrogen content in soil initially assumed to be 50 ammonia and 50 nitrate only the nitrogen content in form of nitrate was assumed to percolate or leach and its amount was estimated from the nitrate concentration in the soil water and the amount of water that percolated or leached nitrification is the microbiological oxidation of ammonia to nitrate the fraction of the ammonia nitrified to nitrate was calculated from soil temperature and soil water content in line with sierra et al 2003 denitrification is the microbial process of reducing nitrate to gaseous forms of nitrogen the calculation was based on the nitrate content in soil soil temperature and water filled pore space in line with heinen 2006 decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds is the result of two contrasting processes mineralization and humification it was estimated separately for the two soil layers and for each of the organic components litter 1 litter 2 and humus nitrogen mineralization was simulated as a first order decay using rate constants from vold and søreng 1997 and korsaeth et al 2003 and soil climate rate that accounts for temperature water and cultivar effect based on andrén et al 2004 mineralization is the process by which organic nitrogen is converted to plant available inorganic forms and was estimated to account for 99 of the decomposition whereas the remaining 1 was regarded as humification a fraction of the root dies at harvest and the nitrogen content within this dry matter was retained to the soil in line with the distribution of the root mass 90 of this nitrogen was retained in the top soil layer and the remaining 10 in the sub soil layer it was equally split between the organic components litter 1 and litter 2 clover has the ability to fixate nitrogen from the air to the soil and the estimation of the clover nitrogen fixation in the model was adapted from lazzarotto et al 2009 and depended on soil temperature soil mineral nitrogen dry matter of roots and clover proportion all fixated nitrogen from clover was assumed directly taken up by the plant nitrogen in mineral form was taken up by the plant from the soil on a daily basis together with the daily clover nitrogen fixated a maximum plant nitrogen concentration was set as a function of dry matter yield and used to limit the maximum daily nitrogen uptake further the nitrogen uptake was partitioned between the different parts of the plant eq 7 which was done in accordance with baadshaug and lantinga 2002 7 n t

to inhibit growth during periods with nitrogen deficit ni was defined as the ratio of a plant s current nitrogen concentration to the plant s critical nitrogen concentration and scaled between 0 and 1 a plant s critical nitrogen concentration is defined as the minimum plant nitrogen concentration allowing for maximum growth rate greenwood et al 1990 it declines with increased dry matter yield and was estimated in line with grovfôrmodellen 2 2 field experimental data field experimental data from a previous study conducted at two locations in norway geipel et al 2021 were used for model calibration and evaluation in south east norway the field experiment was located at apelsvoll 60 70 n 10 87 e 251 m above sea level research station with a humid continental climate the soil was an imperfectly drained loam in central norway the field experiment was located at kvithamar 63 49 n 10 87 e 25 m above sea level research station with a maritime climate the soil was a poorly drained silty clay loam at both locations the experiment was laid out on soil with high variation in organic matter content and partly texture using soil electric conductivity measurements as proxy variable fig 3 this was done to mimic a typical situation where within field differentiation of fertilization rate is required the fields were established in 2015 with a mixture of timothy phleum pratense l meadow fescue festuca pratensis and red clover trifolium pratense l and field trials were performed in the following two years 2016 and 2017 the trials were laid out according to a split plot design with five replicates in south east and six replicates in central norway three different fertilization rates low 13 g n m 2 medium 20 g n m 2 and high 27 g n m 2 were applied to main plots while time of harvest early and normal first cut was applied to sub plots totaling in 120 plots in south east and 144 plots in central norway the trials were managed with a three cut regime but data from the two first cuts were included in this study only at each harvest day a drone with a hyperspectral imager was used to capture canopy reflections of the grass legume mixture in the visual and near infrared part of the solar spectrum right before cut and yield registration clover proportion was visually estimated in field in south east then and at both sites the plants were cut at a stubble height of 0 07 m with an experimental plot harvester followed by fresh and dry matter yield registration sub samples of the dried yield were grinded and analysed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy giving outputs for forage quality and proportion of clover site in central norway only after that thorough radiometric and geometric calibration of the drone data was performed the canopy reflections were transformed to average reflectance per plot and used as predictors to calibrate a powered partial least squares regression model to estimate dry matter yield the validated prediction accuracy for a general dry matter yield model showed a root mean square error rmse of 15 2 55 g dm m 2 for consistency in the data and to exclude data with missing remote sensing estimates only the field experimental data from south east in 2016 and from central norway in 2017 was included in the current study moreover due to high clover percentages observed in the main plots fertilized at low rates these plots were omitted from the study as the norne model was not developed to handle such high percentages of clover that rarely occur in intensively managed grasslands in practice 2 3 weather data weather data with daily resolution were automatically recorded by weather stations provided by agrometeorology norway https lmt nibio no the data included air temperature c soil temperature c precipitation mm global radiation mj m 2 wind speed m s 2 and relative humidity air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at 2 m height while soil temperature was recorded at 0 1 0 2 and 0 5 m below ground the measurements at 0 1 m below ground was used as the soil temperature in the top soil layer while the mean temperature at 0 2 and 0 5 m below ground was used as the soil temperature in the sub soil layer the distance between field trials and weather stations in this study was 350 m in south east and 110 m in central norway 2 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis determines the parameters that are the key drivers of a model by investigating to what extent the variation in model output is influenced by variation in the model parameter settings saltelli et al 2004 the screening method developed by morris morris 1991 is adequate for complex models like the norne model where the number of parameters and also the computational cost limit the possibility of numerical calculation the method identifies the parameters being most influential to model output in addition to which parameters have either a non linear relationship with the output or interactions with other parameters the elementary effects ee of model output are calculated by dividing the change in dry matter yield output from two consecutive model runs by the change in the input

points in the parameter space two sensitivity measures are calculated 1 the mean value µ which evaluates the overall influence of the parameters on model output and 2 the standard deviation σ which is used to detect parameters involved in interaction with other parameters or whose effect is nonlinear to avoid the problem of effects of positive signs which occur when the model is non monotonic we will in this study use the mean of the absolute values µ campolongo et al 2007 for dynamic models that simulate daily outputs the sensitivity of model parameters may change with time it is consequently most appropriate to consider the output over the whole time series lamboni et al 2009 but the large number of responses that need to be evaluated makes this approach challenging for complex models in this study the total above ground yield at first and second cut was selected as the response the sensitivity analysis explored the space within the parameter boundaries defined as uniform distributions with minimum and maximum defined as 50 and 150 of the default value the sensitivity of a total of 43 model parameters were tested supporting information table s1 for both cuts the analysis was repeated for the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut thereafter the mean of the four calculations was used as result further the sensitivity of the model outputs to environmental conditions was included by introducing a parameter that was defined to vary between 1 and 4 and the selected value chose the location year combination south east central 2016 2017 2 5 in season model calibration the norne model is designed to handle within field variation and allows for in season calibration of central model parameters to improve the prediction accuracy based on remotely sensed information and resulting estimates on above ground standing biomass geipel et al 2021 calculated within 24 h before the cuts within field in season update of the norne model was performed by using the calibration procedure with the nonlinear least square algorithm this optimization algorithm searches for the parameter set which would minimize the sum of squares of residual error the workflow for the in season and node wise model calibration is illustrated in fig 4 here two consecutive calibrations were performed the parameters to be calibrated were selected due to the high within field soil variation that was deliberately included in the field experiment by using fields with high variation in terms of soil organic matter and soil texture firstly the model was calibrated based on remotely sensed information from drone overflights within 24 h before first cut to improve the model accuracy at first cut uncertainties regarding the starting value of nitrogen in soil were supposed to be the main source of discrepancy between simulated and actual observation at this early stage and the starting values of mineral and organic nitrogen in soil were selected for calibration the organic nitrogen content was allowed to vary between 100 and 1000 g m 2 while the mineral nitrogen content was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 3 g m 2 a starting value of 2 g m 2 mineral nitrogen initially consisting of 80 ammonium and 20 nitrate and 540 g m 2 organic nitrogen was assumed for the entire field and as the calibration was performed for a node network within the field node specific initial values for soil nitrogen content were generated secondly the model was calibrated based on remotely sensed information from drone overflights within 24 h before second cut to improve model accuracy at second cut water availability is important for optimal growth and uncertainties regarding the soil texture determining plant available water capacity was supposed to be the main source of discrepancy between simulated and actual observation at this later stage and was selected for calibration the plant available water capacity in the top soil layer was allowed to vary within the boundaries of all soil texture types riley 2021 which were 35 and 95 mm further the soil type containing that specific value for plant available water capacity in top soil layer was used and the corresponding field capacities and plant available water capacity in sub soil layer was used following the assumed soil type starting value of 62 75 and 54 25 mm was used at south east and 69 75 and 51 75 mm at central norway for top and sub soil layer respectively the results from the first calibration were incorporated and the calibration at second cut was performed for a node network within the field and node specific field capacity levels were generated 2 6 model performance model performance was evaluated by four criteria to quantify the mismatch between simulated and observed quantity of dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in plants the four criteria were the absolute error ae root mean square error rmse the normalized relative rmse rrmse and the mean square error mse as decomposed into its two components squared bias and variance error kobayashi and salam 2000 eq 9 12 9 a e i s i o i 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 11 r r m s e r m s e o 12 m s e s o 2 1 n i 1 n s i s o i o 2 here n is the number of observations si is the simulated value oi is the observed value s is the vector of model simulations o is the vector of observations s is the mean simulated value and o is the mean observed value the first component of mse refers to bias while the second component refers to variance error bias is the difference between the average simulation and observation and indicates error from erroneous assumptions in the model or an underfitted model variance error on the other hand is a more random error that shows the variability of model simulation for a given data point or spread in the data a high variance error may indicate an overfitted model ae was only calculated separately for the sub plots while rmse rrmse and mse was calculated for each treatment 3 results the sensitivity of 43 parameters to the dry matter yield output was assessed by a sensitivity analysis looking at the dry matter yield outputs at first and second cut respectively fig 5 the group of the 10 most sensitive parameters to dry matter yield at first cut fig 5a and the 11 most sensitive parameters to dry matter yield at second cut fig 5b were selected both according to the main influential impact mean value and according to either a non linear relationship with the output or interactions with other parameters standard deviation within these two groups four parameters were common θ 24 the optimum air temperature for grass growth used to calculate the temperature index ti θ 5 the fraction of starting value of organic nitrogen in soil allocated to humus θ 6 the fraction of starting value of organic nitrogen in soil allocated to litter 2 among the fraction not allocated to humus and θ3 the environmental effect the overall two most sensitive parameters were θ 28 the initial growth rate during spring growth rm and θ 34 the maximum daily growth during spring growth dmmax at first cut and correspondingly θ 29 the initial growth rate during regrowth between first and second cut rm and θ 35 the maximum daily growth during regrowth between first and second cut dmmax at second cut additionally the parameter θ 31 at first cut and θ 32 at second cut was in the group of the most sensitive parameters also being a parameter value used to estimate potential daily dry matter yield during respectively spring growth and regrowth between first and second cut finally at first cut θ 15 a temperature threshold value used to calculate lai during first part of spring growth and θ 26 and θ 27 being respectively the parameter determining the curvature of the radiation response curve and the insolation at light saturation of the stand used to calculate the solar index si further at second cut θ 14 θ 16 and θ 17 which are all temperature threshold values used to calculate lai and θ4 the plant available water capacity at top soil level dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield at first and second cuts of a forage crop were simulated by the norne model using default parameter values and the outputs were further compared to observed values using the field experimental data from south east norway in 2016 and from central norway in 2017 the error term rmse was calculated individually for the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut at both locations further the mse was calculated and decomposed into its two components of squared bias and variance error and transferred into the rmse of dry matter yield fig 6 and amount of nitrogen in yield fig 7 for the first cut in south east fig 6a and in central norway fig 6c an average rmse of respectively 79 4 and 64 9 g m 2 was found for dry matter yield for both locations the rmse was lowest for the early first cut treatments while it generally increased with nitrogen fertilization rate except for the early cut in central norway the overall highest error term was detected for the treatment with normal first cut combined with high fertilization rate both dominated by bias that contributed with respectively 63 and 78 of the error term for south east and central norway the error terms for both locations with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate were dominated by variance error 81 and 100 the rrmse was lowest for the early first cut ranging between 0 10 and 0 13 while it ranged between 0 12 and 0 26 for the normal harvest for improved model fit at first cut the initial values for organic and mineral nitrogen in soil were optimized through model calibration with the remotely sensed predictions of dry matter yield this resulted in separate starting values through the sub plots nodes the starting value for organic nitrogen in soil was allowed to vary between 100 and 1000 g n m 2 while mineral nitrogen was allowed to vary between 0 5 and 3 g n m 2 after calibration the initial mineral nitrogen content varied between 0 5 and 3 g n m 2 in both south east and central norway while the initial organic nitrogen content varied between 100 and 672 g n m 2 in south east and between 100 and 1000 g n m 2 in central norway rmse was re calculated after calibration fig 5b and d showing an overall reduction resulting in an average rmse of respectively 57 0 and 59 5 g m 2 in south east and central norway for the treatments with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate no changes in the initial values were obtained after calibration for the treatment with normal first cut in both locations and the treatment with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in south east norway improvements in the error term were found for dry matter yield at first cut after calibration the rmse was reduced by 4 to 42 g m 2 while rrmse was reduced by up to 0 08 overall an 18 reduction in rrmse was achieved for the treatment in central norway with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate an increased error term was achieved after calibration due to an initial better fit for the norne model compared to the remote sensing predictions the error term was generally dominated by variance error for the second cut in south east fig 6e and in central norway fig 6g an average rmse of respectively 75 4 and 74 7 g m 2 was found for dry matter yield initially for both locations the rmse was highest in the treatment with early first cut combined with high fertilization rate the error term was generally dominated by bias except the treatment with normal first cut in south east norway and the treatment with normal first cut combined with high fertilization rate in central norway where variance error accounted for most of the error term for improved model fit at second cut the initial value for plant available water capacity in top soil layer was calibrated while the corresponding capacity in sub soil layer and the field capacity in both layers were set according to the soil type corresponding to the plant available water capacity identified by calibration the parameters were allowed to vary within the boundary of all soil types after calibration the plant available water capacity in top soil varied between 56 and 92 l m 2 in south east and 70 l m 2 in central norway the model was re run from growth start using the new parameter values and rmse at second cut was re calculated fig 6f and h the rmse varied between 35 4 and 96 6 g m 2 in south east and between and 37 0 and 99 5 g m 2 in central norway it was dominated by variance error and the highest error term was detected for early first cut in central norway the rmse was thus reduced by 9 5 to 65 6 g m 2 while rmse was reduced by up to 0 09 overall an 13 reduction in rrmse was achieved only predictions of the treatments with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway were not improved in the calibration process the ae was calculated individually for each sub plot with the distribution for the initial dry matter yield estimates at first fig 8 a and second cut fig 8c given combined for all sub plots that included the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut and both locations a distribution shifted to the right was detected in both cases with mean values of 41 3 and 57 2 g m 2 and standard deviations of 66 0 and 52 4 g m 2 respectively for the first and second cut the shift to the right with positive mean values of ae indicate a general overestimation of dry matter yield by the norne model when compared to field observation data the distribution of ae at first cut after calibration fig 7b had a mean value of 6 4 g m 2 and standard deviation of 60 3 g m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a minor overestimation of dry matter yield when compared to field data also the spread in fit between sub plots was reduced the distribution of ae at second cut after calibration fig 7d showed a mean value of 41 6 g m 2 with a standard deviation of 58 7 g m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a general overestimation of dry matter yield when compared to field data the rmse for amount of nitrogen in yield was calculated and given in fig 6 for the first cut in south east fig 7a and in central norway fig 7c an average rmse of respectively 4 0 and 2 7 g n m 2 was found the error term was dominated by bias contributing with 74 to 98 except for the treatment with early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway where the bias only accounted for 30 of the error for both locations the rmse was highest for the treatments with high fertilization rate rmse at first cut was re calculated after calibration fig 7b and d the error term was higher for the treatments with high fertilization rate compared to the treatments with medium fertilization rate for the second cut in south east fig 7e and in central norway fig 7g an average rmse of respectively 2 4 and 3 1 g n m 2 was found for amount of nitrogen in yield initially the error term was dominated by bias contributing with 66 to 94 of the error term after calibration the rmse was recalculated for south east fig 7f and central norway fig 7h it was reduced at all treatments except the early first cut combined with medium fertilization rate in central norway the variance generally dominated after calibration the ae was calculated individually for each sub plot with the distribution for the initial estimates of amount of nitrogen in dry matter yield at first fig 9 a and second cut fig 9c given combined for all sub plots that included the different treatment combinations of fertilizer rate and timing of first cut and both locations a distribution shift to the right was detected in both cases with mean values of 3 1 and 2 6 g n m 2 and standard deviations of 1 7 and 1 2 g n m 2 respectively for the first and second cut the large shift to the right with positive mean values of the ae indicate a general high overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield by the norne model when compared to field observation data the distribution of ae at first cut after calibration fig 9b had a mean value of 1 5 g n m 2 and standard deviation of 1 8 g n m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a minor overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield when compared to field data the distribution of ae at second cut after calibration fig 8d had a mean value of 1 2 g n m 2 with a standard deviation of 1 9 g n m 2 the reduced but still positive mean value of ae indicates a general improvement in the model performance but still with a general overestimation of amount of nitrogen in yield when compared to field data the simulated dry matter yield at harvest before and after model calibration is presented for each sub plot within treatment and location in the supporting information section figures s1 s8 the observed yield and the yield predictions from remote sensing are also included in these figures among the altogether 176 sub plots six sub plots from one site and treatment that differed in observed dry matter yield were selected as an illustration of model performance fig 10 for these six sub plots the model initially estimated a dry matter yield of 585 g m 2 at first cut and 324 g m 2 at second cut throughout the field after calibration sub plot specific parameter values were applied and the new simulation caught to a large extent the infield observed variation from 434 to 590 g m 2 in the first cut and from 252 to 308 g m 2 in the second cut fig 10 4 discussion when predicting dry matter yields with the norne model within two locations in norway at two rates of fertilization and for two different harvesting regimes the model fitted the measured yields well overall the model performed with an rmse of 72 g m 2 at first cut and 75 g m 2 at second cut when using the default parameter values i e without utilizing remotely sensed information the rrmse was 0 15 at first cut and 0 22 at second cut these results where comparably better than those reported by korhonen et al 2018 who evaluated three growth models for timothy basgra catimo and stics under northern conditions including data from norway sweden finland and canada our norne model achieved 0 30 0 15 and 0 7 smaller errors expressed as rrmse for first cuts and 0 08 0 52 and 0 01 smaller errors for second cuts respectively for basgra catimo and stics the basgra model was later tested under nordic conditions in a study by höglind et al 2020 allowing field specific calibration of some model parameters basgra then performed with an rrmse of 0 29 in sweden and 0 27 in norway for dry matter yield predictions still worse than the rrmse of yield predictions of norne using unchanged default parameter settings the amount of nitrogen in yield g n harvested per m2 was estimated with less accuracy than dry matter yield but still with a significant improvement after calibration to dry matter yield observations further improvement is to be expected if calibrations also were undertaken on basis of measurements of concentration of nitrogen in the yield höglind et al 2020 included calculations and testing on crude protein content with an rrmse of maximum 0 30 for swedish data and 0 18 for norwegian the norne model was not tested on crude protein but for the amount of nitrogen in yield it performed with a mean rrmse of 0 30 nitrogen availability is crucial for optimal crop growth and a comprehensive sub model for soil plant nitrogen dynamics was therefore developed within the norne model existing functions were adapted from literature and combined to describe the dynamic processes with parameter values directly taken from literature the inclusion of a separate nitrogen sub model is a strength of the norne model compared to other crop growth models and may explain the better fit and its ability to catch the effects of different nitrogen application rates it is also a necessity for further development of the model into a decision support tool for optimal plant nitrogen fertilization the norne model managed to simulate dry matter yield responses to increased nitrogen fertilization rates but still using the initial parameter values a better fit was achieved at first cut for the plots fertilized at medium rate compared to the fields fertilized at high rate contrary at second cut the plots fertilized at high rate achieved a better fit compared to the plots fertilized at medium rate the study by korhonen et al 2018 showed that the stics model with a more detailed description of soil nitrogen mineralization and water balance compared to basgra and catimo simulated dry matter yield response to increased nitrogen fertilization rates more accurately than the latter two models which both underestimated the nitrogen fertilization response within field soil variation e g varying distance to drainage networks is typical in farmers fields and may cause spatial variability in dry matter yield to mimic a typical situation the field experiments were placed on soils with high internal variation in organic matter content and partly texture such non linear effects can be accounted for using different methods li and converino 2021 runge et al 2019 but a global sensitivity analysis was selected in this study to assess the sensitivity of 43 parameters in the norne model to dry matter yield outputs at first and second cut the chosen screening method morris 1991 detected the parameters that were highly and weakly influential to changes in the dry matter yield output linear relationship additionally to detecting parameters with non linear relationships to the dry matter yield output and the parameters interaction with other parameters the results showed that parameters from the plant module were the most sensitive ones parameters related to the starting value of nitrogen in soil optimal air temperature for crop growth and the environmental effect were important for the dry matter yield prediction at both first and second cut finally the plant available water content was only among the most highly sensitive parameters to the model output at second cut within 24 h before each cut canopy reflection measurements were performed with a drone borne hyperspectral imager based on these measurements predictions of dry matter yield were calculated with a powered partial least square regression model at high spatial resolution i e plot level geipel et al 2021 in contrast to the norne model that provides daily predictions over the entire growing season the remote sensing model only applies to a very narrow time interval of one to two days around the day of measurement given a well calibrated and robust remote sensing model the remote sensing predictions were more accurate than the corresponding predictions of the norne model and assimilation of the outputs were used to improve the prediction accuracy of dry matter yields by the norne model nevertheless the remote sensing model should be calibrated for a wider time span of drone borne measurements than just right before harvest to enable more suitable predictions for applications in farming practice in line with drone borne measurements satellite data can be used for this purpose kasampalis et al 2018 and in zare et al 2022 within season assimilation of satellite observations was shown to improve the model fit of the pilote crop growth model used to forecast winter wheat different assimilation methods as calibration forcing and updating are tested and discussed in the literature jin et al 2018 kasampalis et al 2018 as forcing does not use any information in the crop model but simply uses the remotely sensed data to replace the crop model simulation data updating continuously adjusts model parameters in the crop model during the run time while the calibration strategy adjusts selected parameters to achieve optimal consistency between the remote sensing data and the simulated state variables among the three methods calibration is theoretically a better choice but has a high computational cost due to the requirement of a lot of optimization iterations in line with jin et al 2018 calibration was successfully used in this study calibration was first performed at first cut and then a re calibration was performed at second cut later in the season the traditional calibration algorithm nonlinear least square was used in the assimilation step in this study this optimization algorithm searches for the parameter set which would minimize the sum of squares of residual error the more comprehensive bayesian calibration berger 1985 has the advantage that it in addition to calibrating the parameter values simultaneously quantifies the parameter uncertainty campbell 2006 it is a flexible method but due to a high computational cost when applied to complex models the method was not used in this study as the calibration process will be implemented in a decision support system a faster routine is required soil variation was deliberately included in the field experiment to mimic a typical situation where site specific fertilization is required this was done by selecting a field with imperfectly drained soil with high variation in terms of soil organic matter and partly soil texture despite the variation a uniform value was initially used for the entire field for both nitrogen in soil and soil texture the initial values of both soil mineral and organic nitrogen were selected as the parameters to be calibrated at first cut the rationale for this was that the amount of soil nitrogen is previously shown to be a sensitive model parameter hjelkrem et al 2021 and that actual soil mineral and organic nitrogen contents are rarely known in practice at least not at high resolution within a field the calibration of these initial values indicated high within field variation and their adjustments improved the predictions of the norne model in all but one case overall the model achieved an rmse of 58 g m 2 for dry matter yield at first cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized the rrmse was 0 12 which corresponds to a reduction in the error term of 20 at first cut compared to the use of initial parameter values further development of remote sensing technology and more comprehensive data sets for empirical model calibration will enable more accurate and reliable remote sensing predictions to adjust and optimize crop model parameters and improve crop model simulation results at field and regional scales in addition to improve model performance the spatial information that is added to the process based model from the incorporation of the remote sensing data allows the model to predict and advice site specifically which is required for precision agriculture in addition to the presence of nitrogen water availability is important for optimal crop growth hurtado uria et al 2013 evaluated the english crop growth model developed by johnson and thornley 1983 under irish conditions and concluded that the inclusion of a water sub model would improve the model s accuracy a thorough sub model for water was thus included in the norne model highly depending on soil texture that was set uniform for the entire field despite the known within field variation plant available water capacity was given by the value of soil texture and was selected for calibration at second cut the value of this parameter influenced the model output substantially and through calibration improvements in the predictions of the norne model were achieved overall the model performed with an rmse of 66 g m 2 for dry matter yield at second cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized the rrmse was 0 18 which corresponds to a reduction in the error term of 19 at second cut compared to the use of initial parameter values thus the special information added to the process based model highly improved the model accuracy at second cut using data from two geographically spread locations in norway south east and central including two rates of nitrogen fertilization medium and high and two harvesting regimes the norne model simulated dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield with promising accuracy even though the model is process based it includes several empirically derived functions and one could assume that the accuracy of the model would vary with climatic and other environmental conditions hence model testing across a wide range of conditions is a key to strengthening the model therefore a more comprehensive model validation is required including a broader variation in crop composition and soil and weather conditions in order to obtain a model of more generalized validity for northern conditions additionally a routine to handle inputs and mineralization of organic nitrogen in animal manure and other organic fertilizers should be included in a future version to increase the usability of the model for a wider range of agricultural practices with regard to the overall ambition that norne will constitute the basis of a decision support system for timing of harvests and target nitrogen inputs to demand routines for collection and interpretation of weather forecast with high spatial resolution need to be established presently there are no forecasts for soil temperature and only two day forecasts for global radiation and proxies need to be developed to get the demanded input data further the model must be implemented into a digital farm management service along a web based user interface for the integration of geo referenced field fertilization remote sensing and preferably soil data also the use of satellite data in place of drone borne sensor measurements should be evaluated in the future as hyperspectral imagers are still rather costly more affordable solutions are needed to enable a faster and more widespread implementation of remote sensing under today s practical conditions here multispectral imagery from off the shelf drones e g dji p4ms and publicly available satellite missions e g esa copernicus sentinel 2 represent promising alternatives yet at the cost of a slight decrease in prediction accuracy 5 conclusions the newly developed norne model simulated crop dry matter yield and amount of nitrogen in yield with promising accuracy the inclusion of in season nodewise calibration of the parameters soil nitrogen content i e mineral and organic nitrogen at initiation of growth and soil field capacity improved the model performance significantly overall the model performed with an rmse rrmse of 58 g m 2 0 12 for dry matter yield at first cut and 66 g m 2 0 18 at second cut when the remotely sensed information was utilized which corresponds to a reduction of respectively 20 and 16 for each cut when compared to the use of initial parameter values for amount of nitrogen in yield the improvements were even larger when utilizing remotely sensed information although the model was calibrated using remotely sensed predictions of dry matter yield only a reduction in the estimated rmse of 38 was achieved during first cut and 26 during second cut overall the model performed with an rmse rrmse of 2 1 g n m 2 0 28 during first cut and 2 3 g n m 2 0 33 during second cut for simulated amount of nitrogen in yield when remotely sensed information on dry matter yield was utilized in future a routine to handle inputs of animal manure and other organic fertilizers should be included to increase the usability of the model further in agricultural practice also the use of satellite data in place of drone borne measurements should be evaluated finally in a next step a feedback loop for nitrogen demand will be added and the system will be included in a decision support system within a digital infrastructure to serve as a tool for farmers giving advice on farming practice credit authorship contribution statement anne grete roer hjelkrem conceptualization methodology software

24147,1 despite their exceptional biodiversity and carbon stocks more than 80 of tropical forests are disturbed however a lot of interrogations remain around the ability of vegetation attributes in tropical forests to recover from the various anthropogenic disturbances coexisting in many tropical landscapes while these different disturbances are usually studied separately this work provides for the first time a common modelling framework of vegetation attribute recovery in differently disturbed forests 2 we develop an original bayesian hierarchical model of recovery trajectories considering disturbed forests in a common framework through a disturbance intensity gradient as a case study we test our modelling approach on data from two long term experiments tirimbina costa rica and paracou french guiana where forest permanent sample plots have been set up following selective logging 63 25 ha agriculture 4 ha and clearcutting fire 6 25 ha 3 we build a modelling framework that stands out by i its interpretability with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning ii its robustness allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound iii its versatility to consider disturbance intensity through post disturbance changes in a structural variable either as input data or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre disturbance monitoring iv its flexibility to explicitly consider and test the effects on forest recovery of various disturbance types along an intensity gradient in a single integrative model 4 first conclusions drawn from our common framework underline the strongest above ground biomass and diversity recovery rate offered by selective logging compared to agriculture and clearcutting fire as well as the strong effect of disturbance intensity on taxonomic composition recovery 5 considering disturbed forests in a common framework might help managers to know which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments and where inexpensive natural regeneration should be favoured over active restoration such as tree planting testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery i e with forest monitoring or remote sensing data will be the next step to make it widely applicable graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anthropogenic disturbance recovery forest succession tropical forest conservation vegetation attribute

disturbance or old growth forest ogf values as quantified by their recovery rate holling 1973 previous studies have separately addressed different kinds of disturbance when examining forest stability however considering them together might offer new perspectives to understand forest succession as they increasingly coexist in various tropical landscapes by estimating the varying amount of change in forest structural attributes caused by disturbances i e the intensity of disturbances we can consider them along a disturbance intensity gradient ranging from nearly no change in forest structure to complete clearcutting in addition to disturbance intensity disturbance type information can be acknowledged too accounting for previous land use and environmental conditions selective logging and agricultural practices represent two major anthropogenic disturbances faced by tropical forests blaser et al 2011 selective logging consists in harvesting a few commercially valuable trees and leaving the remaining stand for natural regeneration as most of the forest cover is conserved about 50 90 piponiot et al 2018 moreover following abandonment of agricultural practices for which all or nearly all forest vegetation has been removed forest might emerge spontaneously or with assisted natural regeneration chazdon 2014 finegan 1996 although these disturbances have different ecological impacts on forest dynamics separating them is a bit manichean the development of agroforestry means that many plots abandoned by agriculture already harbour some trees at the time of abandonment selective logging might occur in more or less mature forests regenerating from other disturbances and agricultural practices encompass many ecological realities from shifting cultivation to extensive monoculture and heavy machinery martínez ramos et al 2016 we present an original model of forest recovery trajectories considering disturbed forests df in a common framework along a disturbance

experiments they were set in tirimbina costa rica and paracou french guiana with 3 disturbance types selective logging agriculture clearcutting fire and at least 10 censuses over 25 years these censuses allow us to build trajectories of a selected set of vegetation attributes i e the potential dynamics over time of above ground biomass agb taxonomic diversity and composition in disturbed plots 2 material and methods we aim at modelling recovery trajectories of vegetation attributes in tropical forests relying on two temporal processes a long term process and a short term process first we explain how we articulate these processes 2 1 conceptual framework second we present the construction of the long term process 2 1 1 long term process and then the construction of the short term process 2 1 2 short term process third we explain how disturbance history i e disturbance intensity and type might affect forest attribute recovery we also present how we infer disturbance intensity using basal area loss 2 1 3 disturbance history fourth we incorporate disturbance type and intensity effects in the main forest attribute model 2 1 4 recovery drivers finally we illustrate our modelling framework by predicting the recovery of three vegetation attributes agb taxonomic diversity and composition 2 2 application 2 1 conceptual framework post disturbance trajectories of forest attributes combine the delayed over mortality of trees damaged during disturbance and the post disturbance recovery of forest attributes here we focus on the post disturbance recovery and disregard the effects of delayed over mortality by discarding a time interval over which this delayed over mortality considerably affects the studied forest attributes we model recovery trajectories of forest attributes in a common framework combining two processes these two processes both modelled with an exponential kernel allow to accommodate case study specificities within the same framework a long term process ltp always present and built from the monomolecular growth equation described in zeide 1993 and franc et al 2000 this process assumes that forest attribute values of a disturbed ecosystem returns towards an ogf state at a constant relative recovery rate while the absolute recovery rate decreases in time as forest attributes approach values of ogf fig 2 1 a short term process stp optional and built as a hump equation e g the transient coexistence of early successional and late successional taxa during succession this coexistence can lead diversity to peak during recovery and momentarily reach values higher than those observed in ogf on the other hand a massive recruitment of early successional taxa coexisting with late successional taxa might cause a drop in composition similarity with ogf therefore this equation allows either for temporary overshooting or undershooting fig 2 1 depending on forest attributes and mechanisms at stake during succession beyond the aforementioned theoretical considerations regarding each forest attribute the expression or not of this stp can be empirically selected by a visual inspection of recovery trajectories this inspection can help determining if there is realistically a signal of such an stp in the data our modelling framework relies on forest attribute asymptotic values either in pre disturbance or ogf towards which we hypothesise the forest attribute value returns hypothesis 1 we select an asymptotic behaviour considering that an ecosystem can only support limited values of vegetation attributes i e its ecological carrying capacity due to environmental constraints e g basal area biomass taxonomic diversity and composition population growth restricted by the bounds of natural resources is mathematically formalised for the first time by pierre f verhulst in an equation describing human population growth verhulst 1838 and later complexified in r k selection theory macarthur and wilson 1967 tropical forests constantly suffer disturbances through local gap dynamics swaine et al 1987 and even old growth ecosystems do not remain free from human interference odonne et al 2019 moreover considering that anthropogenic disturbances lead to forest clearance in more than 45 of the cases vancutsem et al 2021 attribute trajectories might never reach ogf values therefore attribute asymptotic values should not necessarily be seen as targets but rather as tools providing us with knowledge on potential trajectories we can work with in conservation and management plans we model the trajectories of a forest attribute a with the likelihood defined as the product of two likelihoods one for the recovery trajectory of the attribute in df and a second one for the ogf attribute asymptote our response variables are positive by definition so we use lognormal distributions i e r e s p o n s e v a r i a b l e l o g n l o g μ σ 2 where μ is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the considered response variable and σ 2 its dispersion parameter for instance in eq 2 1 μ s p t a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by attribute a s p t d f at a recovery time t in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s this leads to two particular cases when t 0 μ s p t a d f α p a d f where α p a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by the attribute at t 0 i e the median of the a posteriori distribution of the attribute initial values in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s later referred to as the initial attribute value per plot for clarity purpose when t li m t m e d i a n a s p t d f ω s a ζ p a d f where ω s a ζ p a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by the attribute when t in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s i e the median of the a posteriori distribution of the asymptotic attribute values per plot we define time t as the time elapsed from the recovery start at t 0 immediately following disturbance we model the recovery of a forest attribute a s p t d f in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s at a recovery time t as follows fig 2 2 2 1 a s p t d f l o g n l o g μ s p t a d f σ a 2 where 2 2 μ s p t a d f α p a d f ω s a ζ p a d f α p a d f l t p p t a d f s t p p t a d f with α p a d f the initial attribute value immediately following disturbance t 0 defined on r α p a df allows the recovery trajectory to start at a non null value by considering remnant trees this is particularly useful in selectively logged forests where most of the forest cover remains after disturbance or in an agroforestry context where some trees are left uncut moreover the attribute values can increase or decrease through time respectively if α p a d f is smaller or higher than ω s a ζ p a d f ω s a the average asymptotic attribute value across the plots of site s defined on r ζ p a d f the variation per df plot from the

developed in annex appendix e mathematical development for equal attribute dispersion parameters in disturbed and old growth forests 2 1 1 long term process the equation of the ltp relies on the monomolecular growth equation described by zeide 1993 and initially developed to study tree growth the monomolecular equation stands out because of the ecological interpretation of its parameters and its simple form compared to other growth models the simplicity of this model makes it rather easy to infer even with limited amounts of data and provides a solid basis for later complexification recently piponiot et al 2016 successfully applied this type of model to forest attribute recovery in logged tropical forests and amani et al 2021 and poorter et al 2021 in secondary forests our ltp assumes that the absolute recovery rate is at any time t proportional to the difference between the state of the system at time t and the asymptotic value hypothesis 2 this means that the relative recovery rate is constant while the absolute recovery rate decreases in time as forest attributes approach their asymptotic value such hypothesis allows comparisons of recovery rates between plots sites and even studies we model the long term recovery process of a forest attribute a p t d f in a disturbed plot p at a recovery time t as follows green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 2 6 l t p p t a d f 1 e λ p a d f t with λ p a d f the relative recovery rate of the attribute a per plot defined on r 2 1 2 short term process some attribute trajectories might be more complex to model than a simple accumulation curve i e the ltp therefore considering ecological mechanisms at stake during succession we added an stp to our modelling framework green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 allowing to fit hump shaped recovery trajectories we model the stp of a forest attribute a p t d f in a disturbed plot p at a recovery time t as follows green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 2 7 s t p p t a d f δ p a d f t τ a d f e 1 t τ a d f κ a d f with δ p a d f the amplitude of the stp per plot defined on r the sign of δ p a d f in relation to the sign of ω s a ζ p a d f determines whether the hump represents a boom and bust or a drop and back process if δ p a d f is null then only the ltp is expressed in eq 2 2 τ a d f the time at which the extremum of the stp is reached defined on r κ a d f an elasticity parameter defined on r 2 1 3 disturbance history behind disturbance history i e the combination of disturbance type and intensity lie ecological realities 2 1 3 1 disturbance intensity inference disturbance causes a disruption in resource availability especially light the amount of disruption is one of the many factors driving forest recovery and depends on disturbance intensity intensity can be estimated through post disturbance changes in forest structure continuous variables there are two possible manners to incorporate intensity into the model of vegetation attribute recovery 1 when long term data i e temporal series is not available intensity might be incorporated during the inference process as input data by expressing changes in a structural vegetation attribute retrieved from forest censuses or remote sensing acquisitions such as canopy height or plant area density this requires two acquisitions one either before disturbance or in a similar ogf to be used as a reference and a second following the disturbance when the delayed structural changes induced by disturbance are no longer observed 2 if working with long term data intensity can be retrieved as a transformed parameter it requires modelling post disturbance trajectories of a structural vegetation attribute directly in the modelling framework modelling such trajectories allows to estimate intensity as the proportional change of the chosen attribute between its post disturbance minimal level and its asymptotic i e ogf level it stands out by accounting for tree recruitment and growth that started immediately after the disturbance occurred while delayed structural changes induced by disturbance were still going on moreover as often in post agricultural contexts structural attribute data is lacking at the start of the recovery period making option 1 impossible to compute furthermore in a bayesian framework inferring intensity allows to propagate the uncertainty of its estimation into the attribute recovery model here to infer disturbance intensity we select option 2 as long term data is available we define disturbance intensity as the proportion of lost basal area due to the studied disturbance inferring disturbance intensity from parameters of basal area trajectories allows us to retrieve the basal area of remnant trees without explicitly measuring it information about remnant trees is usually scarce if not absent particularly for secondary forests moreover such inference does not require pre disturbance forest censuses that we do not have for all plots to infer basal area trajectories and thus retrieve disturbance intensity i p for each plot fig 2 3 we only consider time t m i n as between 0 and t m i n years following disturbance basal area tends to decrease due to tree over mortality induced by disturbance we extrapolate at t 0 an unobserved basal area value that accounts directly for all over mortality induced by disturbance this extrapolated basal area value also accounts for basal area accumulation that started immediately following disturbance while over mortality is still going on fig 2 3 based on observations and results of shenkin et al 2015 we pick t m i n 4 years we apply the ltp of our modelling framework eqs 2 1 2 2 2 4 2 6 to basal area data we only express the ltp as there is no hump shape signal in our observed recovery trajectories of basal area the collapse in basal area at t 0 in fig 2 3 corresponds to the disturbance itself and the drop in basal area between t 0 and t m i n corresponds to the delayed over mortality caused by disturbance but both of these decreases do not correspond to recovery dynamics we define disturbance intensity as follows 2 8 i p ω s p b a s a l a r e a d f α p b a s a l a r e a d f ω s p b a s a l

parameter so that 2 14 ω s p b a s a l a r e a d f θ s p b a s a l a r e a d f α p b a s a l a r e a d f to directly compute disturbance intensity from parameters of basal area trajectories and assess its effect on other forest attribute recovery we build an integrated model including both the basal area and another forest attribute trajectory models it relies on four likelihoods two for basal area and two for the other attribute for both ogf and df 2 1 3 2 disturbance type many recovery drivers considered in ecological theories are not related to disturbance intensity and the depending disruption in resource availability endogenous drivers refer to the internal properties of the system that may influence its post disturbance behaviour hérault and piponiot 2018 such as remnant trees taxa and diameter distribution selective logging maintains most of the forest cover and targets relatively common genera while remnant trees after farming might be large but also scarce guevara et al 1986 moreover when deforesting for agriculture the choice of trees to be kept is usually not random but relies on benefits they might provide guevara et al 1986 exogenous drivers refer to external constraints or forces that limit the possible system trajectories hérault and piponiot 2018 such as the surrounding landscape e g distance to the nearest ogf patch ogf density in the surrounding landscape or soil conditions for instance selective logging usually occurs in large forest patches with larger trees while disturbance types at the origin of secondary forests mostly occurs in anthropised and complex mosaic landscapes lamb et al 2005 in these fragmented environments remaining ogf patches might be degraded due to edge effects reduced size increased isolation and human incursions hansen et al 2020 as forest cover is more or less disrupted physical conditions change too towards less humidity hennenberg et al 2008 and massive light intake matsuo et al 2021 consequently some disturbance types might preserve seed sources and microclimatic parameters better than others soil damage diverge between both types too for instance selective logging preserves most of the soil outside of the trails kleinschroth and healey 2017 contrary to agricultural use with ploughing and chemical inputs potentially applied for years if not decades lal 2015 acknowledging that intensity partially explains the ecological impacts of disturbance we decide to consider disturbance type effects and define disturbance type as a qualitative variable informing about previous land use 2 1 4 recovery drivers we assess how disturbance history affects the recovery of forest agb taxonomic diversity and composition fig 2 2 2 1 4 1 starting point we hypothesise that initial attribute values depend on disturbance history hypothesis 4 to preserve parameters identifiability we consider that α p a d f depends solely on disturbance type and not intensity to evaluate disturbance effects on forest immediately following disturbance we define hyper distributions of attribute initial values by disturbance type green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 full dag available in fig s1 as follows 2 15 α p a d f l o g n l o g α t y p e a d f σ α t y p e a d f 2 with α p a d f the initial attribute value per plot defined on r α t y p e a d f the initial attribute value of disturbance type type defined on r σ α t y p e a d f 2 the dispersion parameter of the lognormal distribution for initial attribute values per disturbance type defined on r we assume initial attribute values to depend on disturbance history notably because the number of remnant trees might differ between different disturbances and thus have different impact on vegetation attributes hypothesis 4 2 1 4 2 long term process recovery rate we see forest stability as the capacity of forest attributes to reach more or less quickly pre disturbance or ogf levels holling 1973 moreover various biophysical factors influence the success of forest regeneration such as local soil conditions and community composition as well as climate derroire et al 2016 santiago garcía et al 2019 uriarte et al 2016 and could be integrated in regional studies as done in amani et al 2021 therefore we expect relative recovery rates to vary depending on disturbance history as they might have different implications on forest dynamics e g soil damage dispersal and therefore for attribute recovery hypothesis 3 to evaluate forest stability to disturbance we express recovery rates as a function of disturbance intensity and type green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 full directed acyclic graph dag fig s1 so that 2 16 λ p a d f β t y p e a d f i p γ a d f with γ a d f the shape parameter of the relationship between disturbance intensity and attribute a relative recovery rate β t y p e a d f the effect of disturbance type on attribute a relative recovery rate i p the disturbance intensity defined on 0 1 where an intensity of 1 is maximal by defining the recovery rate this way it encompasses effects of both disturbance intensity and type when disturbance intensity tends towards 1 i e its maximal level λ p a d f β t y p e a d f indeed even in a clear cutting scenario we expect the recovery rate to vary depending on the disturbance type as disturbance type might have different implications for soil damage and dispersal and therefore for attribute recovery hypothesis 3 2 1 4 3 short term process hump amplitude we model composition trajectories with ltp and stp equations we want to assess how disturbance intensity and type impact the amplitude of stp we hypothesise that the amplitude of the drop and back process in composition trajectory modelling depends on disturbance intensity indeed it might be generated by a massive recruitment of pioneer trees which develop predominantly in highly disturbed environments hypothesis 5 forest dynamics vary in tropical regions and pioneer genera if present might not have the same behaviour therefore the application of the stp should be carefully considered regarding knowledge on local forest post disturbance dynamics we express the stp amplitude depending on disturbance intensity green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 full dag fig s2 as follows 2 17 δ p a d f δ a d f i p η a d f with δ a d f the constant amplitude coefficient of the stp defined on r it allows to have an

amplitude 2 2 application following the presentation of our modelling framework 2 1 conceptual framework we illustrate it with long term data from two sites 2 2 1 study sites from which we compute three forest attributes 2 2 2 forest attributes after three disturbance types 2 2 3 disturbance types then we model recovery trajectories for these three attributes using our modelling framework 2 2 4 inference 2 2 1 study sites and measurements we apply our modelling framework to data from long term neotropical disturbance experiments tirimbina 10 24 n 84 06 w belongs to the pentaclethra fabaceae mimosaceae forest type sesnie et al 2009 located in the central american atlantic moist forest ecoregion of costa rica it consists of a cluster of 7 plots 7 ha total amongst which 5 underwent a timber stand improvement treatment in 1991 1992 finegan and camacho 1999 they were monitored for 27 years 1988 2015 this cluster is ubicated inside a 345 ha private reserve protecting old growth tropical forest in the surrounding highly fragmented matrix of cultivated land old growth and secondary forests 4 secondary forests plots 4 ha total were prepared for sowing and later abandoned or abandoned after a culture cycle at different times 1960 1962 1972 1986 these plots were monitored for 30 years 1987 2017 paracou 5 18 n 52 55 w is located in a lowland tropical french guianese forest gourlet fleury et al 2004 the forest composition is typical of the guiana shield paracou gathers 15 plots 93 75 ha total monitored for 37 years 1984 2021 amongst which 9 56 25 ha total underwent various logging treatments from 1986 to 1988 3 plots were only selectively logged in 1986 while 6 were selectively logged in 1986 and subsequently applied silvicultural treatments not targeting particular species in 1987 1988 moreover 15 km west north west from paracou 5 30 n 53 05 w a 25 ha area is clearcut in july september 1976 for a pulp production project sarrailh et al 1990 in october 1976 an accidental fire burnt about 15 of the area a single 6 25 ha plot arbocel is set up in the clearcut area in 1989 and monitored for 32 years 1989 2021 forest censuses the plot areas vary between 1 ha costa rica and 6 25 ha french guiana all trees 10 cm diameter at breast height dbh were measured and identified to the lowest taxonomic level at various time intervals to have similar plot areas within our data set we divide in four the 6 25 ha plots in french guiana obtaining 1 56 ha plots taxonomic verification first inventories in tirimbina were led by botanists then carried out by parabotanists with foliar material collection when identification could not be achieved in the field all taxonomic names were checked in 2021 by a botanist for synonymy wrong use or absence of occurrence in costa rica synonyms and names inadequately employed are replaced by botanist s suggestions costa rican taxonomic data is finally submitted to the taxonomic name resolution service through the correcttaxo function of the biomass r package version 2 1 8 réjou méchain et al 2017 to correct for typos and synonymy we verify suggested changes and apply them if considered relevant taxonomic resolution in paracou has high standards for forestry however it varies between plots and potentially between families due to the contribution of botanists specialised in different taxa therefore we gapfill missing botanical names using vernacular names in the guyafor plot network aubry kientz et al 2013 mirabel 2018 thanks to the vernabota r package version 0 4 1 derroire et al 2022 cleaning routine to check taxonomic typos and synonymy is run weekly on paracou data 2 2 2 forest attributes we compute basal area and the other three forest attributes of interest as follows basal area basal area is computed for each tree summed to obtain basal area levels per plot and census year then reported at the plot scale biomass agb is computed from tree diameter values following chave et al 2014 with the computeagb function from the biomass r package version 2 1 8 réjou méchain et al 2017 it requires the wood density of the studied trees estimated from the global wood density database zanne et al 2009 and their taxonomy by the getwooddensity function from the aforementioned r package each agb tree value is summed to obtain agb levels per plot and census year then reported per hectare diversity taxonomic diversity is considered at the genus level and reported through shannon diversity 1 order hcdt diversity transformed hill number this index is computed with the diversity function from the entropart r package version 1 6 11 marcon and hérault 2015 and the unbiased asymptotic estimator unveilj level of interpolation is the mean sample coverage total probability of occurrence of the genera observed in the sample tirimbina 0 942 paracou 0 967 of all inventories determined separately for costa rican and guianese sites with zhang huang estimator and computed through the coverage function entropart r package version 1 6 11 marcon and hérault 2015 shannon diversity refers to the number of genera and the evenness in the considered community a single inventory per site plot and census year it indicates the extent to which genera differ between random pairs of trees composition change in floristic composition of disturbed forests during regeneration is assessed by calculating the dissimilarity between disturbed and ogf to consider both temporal and spatial variations between plots we assume that dissimilarity between disturbed and ogf communities tends towards the dissimilarity observed between ogf communities amani et al 2021 we compute the abundance based chao jaccard dissimilarity index chao et al 2005 implemented in the vegdist function vegan r package version 2 5 7 between post disturbance inventories of each plot and the last inventory we have for each ogf plot to inform asymptotic values we also calculate this dissimilarity index between all inventories of all ogf plots and the last inventory of all ogf plots carried out in 2021 in paracou only discarding the calculation of the index between different censuses of a given plot for interpretation and modelling purposes we work with a simple difference 1 dissimilarity index to obtain a composition similarity index hereafter 1 indicates the highest similarity between two censuses we do not work on composition with the costa rican site due to the lack of ogf plots 2 2 3 disturbance types we group disturbance types into three large categories to ensure a better representation across sites when possible selective logging i e felling and extracting trees belonging to commercial species both in costa rica and french guiana but associated with severe not species specific damage naves et al 2020 this category also includes plots that faced post silvicultural treatments to alleviate competition for trees with commercial interest finegan and camacho 1999 gourlet fleury et al 2004 agriculture referring to the preparation for sowing with a subsequent abandonment or an abandonment after a culture cycle in costa rica clearcutting fire the occurrence of a fire shortly after clear cutting in french guiana 2 2 4 inference bayesian hierarchical models are inferred through mcmc methods using the no u turn sampling algorithm nuts an adaptive form of the hamiltonian monte carlo sampling inference rely on 4 markov chains of 2000 iterations each including a 1000 iteration warm up maximum tree depth is set to 12 codes are developed using r version 4 2 2 and the rstan r package version 2 26 13 carpenter et al 2017 parameters bounds are specified and explained in table s1 we model the trajectories of basal area and of the three vegetation attributes of interest with the following specificities basal area disturbances such as logging have deep consequences on forest structure indeed beyond the loss of targeted trees from commercial genera these disturbances cause an induced mortality leading to a decrease in basal area at the plot level until 4 years after this event therefore for the model inference we input basal area values recorded at least 4 years after the disturbance considering clearcutting fire we constrain initial basal area per plot to 0 since this area is completely deforested biomass as for basal area we set a minimal age of 4 year post disturbance for agb values used as input in the model inference due to induced mortality considering clearcutting fire we constrain initial agb per plot to 0 since this area is completely deforested diversity as induced mortality is supposedly random in terms of genera targeted thus not having a strong impact on diversity trajectories diversity values recorded from 1 year post disturbance are used to infer the model composition as for diversity we set a minimal age of 1 year post disturbance for composition similarity values used as input in the model inference moreover contrary to the recovery of other forest attributes we choose a relative recovery rate λ t y p e c o m p o s i t i o n d f depending only on disturbance type we do not include a disturbance intensity effect on composition recovery rate as we only study composition in french guiana with two disturbance types amongst which one has a disturbance intensity of 1 for all considered plots furthermore we use a negative amplitude δ c o m p o s i t i o n d f for the stp following selective logging as we expect in df a decrease in composition similarity with ogf due to the recruitment of pioneer species following clearcutting fire a visual inspection of composition similarity trajectories do not suggest the occurrence of a boom and bust or drop and back process thus we do not express the stp for this disturbance type 3 results discussion 3 1 accuracy of the model predictions predicted versus observed attribute values are presented in fig 3 1 and those for basal area in fig s9 median predictions appear consistent with observations for all attributes both for the ltp only agb diversity and the ltp stp composition similarity 95 confidence interval are wider for diversity and composition similarity predictions than for agb prediction s reliability is also consistent across disturbance types furthermore time since disturbance does not seem to influence the quality of the predictions consequently our modelling framework appears to be reliable regardless of the studied vegetation attribute disturbance type and time since disturbance for the considered census 3 2 recovery drivers disturbance intensity drives diversity relative recovery rate i e its stability as well as the depth of composition drop and back amplitude the higher the disturbance intensity the slower the recovery and the lower the stability the higher the disturbance intensity fig 3 2 upper panels the deeper the drop and back amplitude fig 3 2 lower panel at maximal intensity and for the same disturbance type diversity and agb recovery rates display similar median values β s e l e c t i v e l o g g i n g d i v e r s i t y d f 0 014 and β s e l e c t i v e l o g g i n g a g b d f 0 019

this model can be run without data from ogf plots in this case the information to infer the a posteriori distribution of asymptotic values will only come from trajectories of the disturbed plots to improve predictions we recommend providing as many monitoring data i e forest censuses remote sensing series from ogf plots as possible the choice of these ogf references should be thought off carefully as landscape fragmentation might alter attribute levels even in ogf and disturbances may have very long lasting effects odonne et al 2019 i e longer than human memory our conceptual framework revolves around disturbance history effects on vegetation attribute recovery with an emphasis on disturbance intensity this continuous variable might be incorporated either as 1 input data or 2 as a transformed parameter directly inferred from long term forest monitoring inside the model framework here to estimate disturbance intensity for each studied plot we have our model relying on basal area trajectories option 2 requiring several forest censuses chronosequences which are much more common in secondary tropical forest databases than long term monitoring are not suitable for this option to analyse this type of data our modelling framework could however be easily modified to receive disturbance intensity as input data option 1 various structural vegetation attributes might be used to define disturbance intensity originating for instance from forest censuses or remote sensing acquisitions the choice of this structural attribute should be thoroughly considered to serve the purpose of the study and to be available for all study sites in order to remain consistent and draw comparisons in our data set disturbance type and intensity are not independent when possible we recommend having the widest range of intensities for most disturbance types to better identify intensity and type effects although it might not be possible as they are intrinsically linked 3 4 conservation implications of the common framework for disturbed forests historically forest recovery following different disturbance types has been studied separately although we expect to encounter different disturbance types in different environments landscape fragmentation makes them coexist in close range e g in tirimbina disturbed forests dominate our contemporary tropical landscapes lewis et al 2015 potapov et al 2017 but in addition to these ecosystem biogeographical characteristics disturbance history plays a major role in shaping their attribute trajectories therefore our approach offers the opportunity to study in a single framework a large spectrum of disturbance type and intensity thus allowing consistent comparative analyses beyond climatic events forests are mainly degraded by resource exploitation to generate income from agriculture or timber extraction while such a framework helps characterising the stability of tropical forests to disturbances from a pure ecological standpoint it also indicates which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided and which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments moreover it could assist managers in determining in which contexts forest attribute recovery rates and post disturbance levels are higher thus identifying which contexts offer good prospects for efficient natural regeneration amani et al 2022 crouzeilles et al 2017 furthermore this could help focusing human and financial resources on the improvement and the implementation of active restoration plans that are crucially needed in certain areas ngo bieng et al 2021 but have shown to be rather expensive and with uncertain outcomes so far see for instance caughlin et al 2019 and coleman et al 2021 4 conclusion we present an innovative modelling framework for multi attribute recovery trajectories following disturbance in tropical forests our modelling framework stands out by 1 its interpretability with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning 2 its robustness allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound 3 its flexibility to consider disturbance intensity through post disturbance changes in a structural attribute either as input data or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre disturbance monitoring and 4 its consideration of multiple disturbance types along intensity gradients in a single modelling framework allowing to compare trajectories between varying disturbance types and intensities to provide useful and meaningful information to forest managers and policy makers we suggest testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute

24147,1 despite their exceptional biodiversity and carbon stocks more than 80 of tropical forests are disturbed however a lot of interrogations remain around the ability of vegetation attributes in tropical forests to recover from the various anthropogenic disturbances coexisting in many tropical landscapes while these different disturbances are usually studied separately this work provides for the first time a common modelling framework of vegetation attribute recovery in differently disturbed forests 2 we develop an original bayesian hierarchical model of recovery trajectories considering disturbed forests in a common framework through a disturbance intensity gradient as a case study we test our modelling approach on data from two long term experiments tirimbina costa rica and paracou french guiana where forest permanent sample plots have been set up following selective logging 63 25 ha agriculture 4 ha and clearcutting fire 6 25 ha 3 we build a modelling framework that stands out by i its interpretability with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning ii its robustness allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound iii its versatility to consider disturbance intensity through post disturbance changes in a structural variable either as input data or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre disturbance monitoring iv its flexibility to explicitly consider and test the effects on forest recovery of various disturbance types along an intensity gradient in a single integrative model 4 first conclusions drawn from our common framework underline the strongest above ground biomass and diversity recovery rate offered by selective logging compared to agriculture and clearcutting fire as well as the strong effect of disturbance intensity on taxonomic composition recovery 5 considering disturbed forests in a common framework might help managers to know which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments and where inexpensive natural regeneration should be favoured over active restoration such as tree planting testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery i e with forest monitoring or remote sensing data will be the

stand out by their exceptional biodiversity although they cover only 7 of the earth s land surface they harbour more than 60 of all known species bradshaw et al 2009 these high biodiversity levels are related with the provision of ecosystem services benefiting humans from local to global scale brandon 2014 these ecosystems play a crucial role in carbon cycle and climate change mitigation by storing an estimated 200 300 pg c mitchard 2018 in the recent decades tropical forests faced major disturbances related to human activities either directly e g logging fires clear cutting or indirectly e g hurricanes droughts diseases we consider disturbances as relative discrete irregularities in structural vegetation attributes which affect the usual functioning of an ecosystem they garble forest structure norden et al 2015 rutishauser et al 2016 alter carbon stocks n guessan et al 2019 piponiot et al 2016 and might lead to a change in species diversity and composition amani et al 2021 avila et al 2015 although estimates might vary about 82 of the remaining tropical forest ecosystems are degraded to some extent watson et al 2018 moreover the estimated 18 of remaining intact tropical forests are likely to keep decreasing under human pressure lewis et al 2015 vancutsem et al 2021 in this context stability is the capacity of vegetation attributes to reach more or less quickly pre disturbance or old growth forest ogf values as quantified by their recovery rate holling 1973 previous studies have separately addressed different kinds of disturbance when examining forest stability however considering them together might offer new perspectives to understand forest succession as they increasingly coexist in various tropical landscapes by estimating the varying amount of change in forest structural attributes caused by disturbances i e the intensity of disturbances we can consider them along a disturbance intensity gradient ranging from nearly no change in forest structure to complete clearcutting in addition to disturbance intensity disturbance type information can be acknowledged too accounting for previous land use and environmental conditions selective logging and agricultural practices represent two major anthropogenic disturbances faced by tropical forests blaser et al 2011 selective logging consists in harvesting a few commercially valuable trees and leaving the remaining stand for natural regeneration as most of the forest cover is conserved about 50 90 piponiot et al 2018 moreover following abandonment of agricultural practices for which all or nearly all forest vegetation has been removed forest might emerge spontaneously or with assisted natural regeneration chazdon 2014 finegan 1996 although these disturbances have different ecological impacts on forest dynamics separating them is a bit manichean the development of agroforestry means that many plots abandoned by agriculture already harbour some trees at the time of abandonment selective logging might occur in more or less mature forests regenerating from other disturbances and agricultural practices encompass many ecological realities from shifting cultivation to extensive monoculture and heavy machinery martínez ramos et al 2016 we present an original model of forest recovery trajectories considering disturbed forests df in a common framework along a disturbance intensity gradient with varying disturbance types such model helps understanding and comparing how vegetation attributes recover within df we test our modelling approach on data from two long term experiments they were set in tirimbina costa rica and paracou french guiana with 3 disturbance types selective logging agriculture clearcutting fire and at least 10 censuses over 25 years these censuses allow us to build trajectories of a selected set of vegetation attributes i e the potential dynamics over time of above ground biomass agb taxonomic diversity and composition in disturbed plots 2 material and methods we aim at modelling recovery trajectories of vegetation attributes in tropical forests relying on two temporal processes a long term process and a short term process first we explain how we articulate these processes 2 1 conceptual framework second we present the construction of the long term process 2 1 1 long term process and then the construction of the short term process 2 1 2 short term process third we explain how disturbance history i e disturbance intensity and type might affect forest attribute recovery we also present how we infer disturbance intensity using basal area loss 2 1 3 disturbance history fourth we incorporate disturbance type and intensity effects in the main forest attribute model 2 1 4 recovery drivers finally we illustrate our modelling framework by predicting the recovery of three vegetation attributes agb taxonomic diversity and composition 2 2 application 2 1 conceptual framework post disturbance trajectories of forest attributes combine the delayed over mortality of trees damaged during disturbance and the post disturbance recovery of forest attributes here we focus on the post disturbance recovery and disregard the effects of delayed over mortality by discarding a time interval over which this delayed over mortality considerably affects the studied forest attributes we model recovery trajectories of forest attributes in a common framework combining two processes these two processes both modelled with an exponential kernel allow to accommodate case study specificities within the same framework a long term process ltp always present and built from the monomolecular growth equation described in zeide 1993 and franc et al 2000 this process assumes that forest attribute values of a disturbed ecosystem returns towards an ogf state at a constant relative recovery rate while the absolute recovery rate decreases in time as forest attributes approach values of ogf fig 2 1 a short term process stp optional and built as a hump equation e g the transient coexistence of early successional and late successional taxa during succession this coexistence can lead diversity to peak during recovery and momentarily reach values higher than those observed in ogf on the other hand a massive recruitment of early successional taxa coexisting with late successional taxa might cause a drop in composition similarity with ogf therefore this equation allows either for temporary overshooting or undershooting fig 2 1 depending on forest attributes and mechanisms at stake during succession beyond the aforementioned theoretical considerations regarding each forest attribute the expression or not of this stp can be empirically selected by a visual inspection of recovery trajectories this inspection can help determining if there is realistically a signal of such an stp in the data our modelling framework relies on forest attribute asymptotic values either in pre disturbance or ogf towards which we hypothesise the forest attribute value returns hypothesis 1 we select an asymptotic behaviour considering that an ecosystem can only support limited values of vegetation attributes i e its ecological carrying capacity due to environmental constraints e g basal area biomass taxonomic diversity and composition population growth restricted by the bounds of natural resources is mathematically formalised for the first time by pierre f verhulst in an equation describing human population growth verhulst 1838 and later complexified in r k selection theory macarthur and wilson 1967 tropical forests constantly suffer disturbances through local gap dynamics swaine et al 1987 and even old growth ecosystems do not remain free from human interference odonne et al 2019 moreover considering that anthropogenic disturbances lead to forest clearance in more than 45 of the cases vancutsem et al 2021 attribute trajectories might never reach ogf values therefore attribute asymptotic values should not necessarily be seen as targets but rather as tools providing us with knowledge on potential trajectories we can work with in conservation and management plans we model the trajectories of a forest attribute a with the likelihood defined as the product of two likelihoods one for the recovery trajectory of the attribute in df and a second one for the ogf attribute asymptote our response variables are positive by definition so we use lognormal distributions i e r e s p o n s e v a r i a b l e l o g n l o g μ σ 2 where μ is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the considered response variable and σ 2 its dispersion parameter for instance in eq 2 1 μ s p t a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by attribute a s p t d f at a recovery time t in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s this leads to two particular cases when t 0 μ s p t a d f α p a d f where α p a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by the attribute at t 0 i e the median of the a posteriori distribution of the attribute initial values in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s later referred to as the initial attribute value per plot for clarity purpose when t li m t m e d i a n a s p t d f ω s a ζ p a d f where ω s a ζ p a d f is the median of the a posteriori distribution of the values taken by the attribute when t in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s i e the median of the a posteriori distribution of the asymptotic attribute values per plot we define time t as the time elapsed from the recovery start at t 0 immediately following disturbance we model the recovery of a forest attribute a s p t d f in a disturbed plot p belonging to a site s at a recovery time t as follows fig 2 2 2 1 a s p t d f l o g n l o g μ s p t a d f σ a 2 where 2 2 μ s p t a d f α p a d f ω s a ζ p a d f α p a d f l t p p t a d f s t p p t a d f with α p a d f the initial attribute value immediately following disturbance t 0 defined on r α p a df allows the recovery trajectory to start at a non null value by considering remnant trees this is particularly useful in selectively logged forests where most of the forest cover remains after disturbance or in an agroforestry context where some trees are left uncut moreover the attribute values can increase or decrease through time respectively if α p a d f is smaller or higher than ω s a ζ p a d f ω s a the average asymptotic attribute value across the plots of site s defined on r ζ p a d f the variation per df plot from the

developed in annex appendix e mathematical development for equal attribute dispersion parameters in disturbed and old growth forests 2 1 1 long term process the equation of the ltp relies on the monomolecular growth equation described by zeide 1993 and initially developed to study tree growth the monomolecular equation stands out because of the ecological interpretation of its parameters and its simple form compared to other growth models the simplicity of this model makes it rather easy to infer even with limited amounts of data and provides a solid basis for later complexification recently piponiot et al 2016 successfully applied this type of model to forest attribute recovery in logged tropical forests and amani et al 2021 and poorter et al 2021 in secondary forests our ltp assumes that the absolute recovery rate is at any time t proportional to the difference between the state of the system at time t and the asymptotic value hypothesis 2 this means that the relative recovery rate is constant while the absolute recovery rate decreases in time as forest attributes approach their asymptotic value such hypothesis allows comparisons of recovery rates between plots sites and even studies we model the long term recovery process of a forest attribute a p t d f in a disturbed plot p at a recovery time t as follows green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 2 6 l t p p t a d f 1 e λ p a d f t with λ p a d f the relative recovery rate of the attribute a per plot defined on r 2 1 2 short term process some attribute trajectories might be more complex to model than a simple accumulation curve i e the ltp therefore considering ecological mechanisms at stake during succession we added an stp to our modelling framework green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 allowing to fit hump shaped recovery trajectories we model the stp of a forest attribute a p t d f in a disturbed plot p at a recovery time t as follows green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 2 7 s t p p t a d f δ p a d f t τ a d f e 1 t τ a d f κ a d f with δ p a d f the amplitude of the stp per plot defined on r the sign of δ p a d f in relation to the sign of ω s a ζ p a d f determines whether the hump represents a boom and bust or a drop and back process if δ p a d f is null then only the ltp is expressed in eq 2 2 τ a d f the time at which the extremum of the stp is reached defined on r κ a d f an elasticity parameter defined on r 2 1 3 disturbance history behind disturbance history i e the combination of disturbance type and intensity lie ecological realities 2 1 3 1 disturbance intensity inference disturbance causes a disruption in resource availability especially light the amount of disruption is one of the many factors driving forest recovery and depends on disturbance intensity intensity can be estimated through post disturbance changes in forest structure continuous variables there are two possible manners to incorporate intensity into the model of vegetation attribute recovery 1 when long term data i e temporal series is not available intensity might be incorporated during the inference process as input data by expressing changes in a structural vegetation attribute retrieved from forest censuses or remote sensing acquisitions such as canopy height or plant area density this requires two acquisitions one either before disturbance or in a similar ogf to be used as a reference and a second following the disturbance when the delayed structural changes induced by disturbance are no longer observed 2 if working with long term data intensity can be retrieved as a transformed parameter it requires modelling post disturbance trajectories of a structural vegetation attribute directly in the modelling framework modelling such trajectories allows to estimate intensity as the proportional change of the chosen attribute between its post disturbance minimal level and its asymptotic i e ogf level it stands out by accounting for tree recruitment and growth that started immediately after the disturbance occurred while delayed structural changes induced by disturbance were still going on moreover as often in post agricultural contexts structural attribute data is lacking at the start of the recovery period making option 1 impossible to compute furthermore in a bayesian framework inferring intensity allows to propagate the uncertainty of its estimation into the attribute recovery model here to infer disturbance intensity we select option 2 as long term data is available we define disturbance intensity as the proportion of lost basal area due to the studied disturbance inferring disturbance intensity from parameters of basal area trajectories allows us to retrieve the basal area of remnant trees without explicitly measuring it information about remnant trees is usually scarce if not absent particularly for secondary forests moreover such inference does not require pre disturbance forest censuses that we do not have for all plots to infer basal area trajectories and thus retrieve disturbance intensity i p for each plot fig 2 3 we only consider time t m i n as between 0 and t m i n years following disturbance basal area tends to decrease due to tree over mortality induced by disturbance we extrapolate at t 0 an unobserved basal area value that accounts directly for all over mortality induced by disturbance this extrapolated basal area value also accounts for basal area accumulation that started immediately following disturbance while over mortality is still going on fig 2 3 based on observations and results of shenkin et al 2015 we pick t m i n 4 years we apply the ltp of our modelling framework eqs 2 1 2 2 2 4 2 6 to basal area data we only express the ltp as there is no hump shape signal in our observed recovery trajectories of basal area the collapse in basal area at t 0 in fig 2 3 corresponds to the disturbance itself and the drop in basal area between t 0 and t m i n corresponds to the delayed over mortality caused by disturbance but both of these decreases do not correspond to recovery dynamics we define disturbance intensity as follows 2 8 i p ω s p b a s a l a r e a d f α p b a s a l a r e a d f ω s p b a s a l

its effect on other forest attribute recovery we build an integrated model including both the basal area and another forest attribute trajectory models it relies on four likelihoods two for basal area and two for the other attribute for both ogf and df 2 1 3 2 disturbance type many recovery drivers considered in ecological theories are not related to disturbance intensity and the depending disruption in resource availability endogenous drivers refer to the internal properties of the system that may influence its post disturbance behaviour hérault and piponiot 2018 such as remnant trees taxa and diameter distribution selective logging maintains most of the forest cover and targets relatively common genera while remnant trees after farming might be large but also scarce guevara et al 1986 moreover when deforesting for agriculture the choice of trees to be kept is usually not random but relies on benefits they might provide guevara et al 1986 exogenous drivers refer to external constraints or forces that limit the possible system trajectories hérault and piponiot 2018 such as the surrounding landscape e g distance to the nearest ogf patch ogf density in the surrounding landscape or soil conditions for instance selective logging usually occurs in large forest patches with larger trees while disturbance types at the origin of secondary forests mostly occurs in anthropised and complex mosaic landscapes lamb et al 2005 in these fragmented environments remaining ogf patches might be degraded due to edge effects reduced size increased isolation and human incursions hansen et al 2020 as forest cover is more or less disrupted physical conditions change too towards less humidity hennenberg et al 2008 and massive light intake matsuo et al 2021 consequently some disturbance types might preserve seed sources and microclimatic parameters better than others soil damage diverge between both types too for instance selective logging preserves most of the soil outside of the trails kleinschroth and healey 2017 contrary to agricultural use with ploughing and chemical inputs potentially applied for years if not decades lal 2015 acknowledging that intensity partially explains the ecological impacts of disturbance we decide to consider disturbance type effects and define disturbance type as a qualitative variable informing about previous land use 2 1 4 recovery drivers we assess how disturbance history affects the recovery of forest agb taxonomic diversity and composition fig 2 2 2 1 4 1 starting point we hypothesise that initial attribute values depend on disturbance history hypothesis 4 to preserve parameters identifiability we consider that α p a d f depends solely on disturbance type and not intensity to evaluate disturbance effects on forest immediately following disturbance we define hyper distributions of attribute initial values by disturbance type green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 full dag available in fig s1 as follows 2 15 α p a d f l o g n l o g α t y p e a d f σ α t y p e a d f 2 with α p a d f the initial attribute value per plot defined on r α t y p e a d f the initial attribute value of disturbance type type defined on r σ α t y p e a d f 2 the dispersion parameter of the lognormal distribution for initial attribute values per disturbance type defined on r we assume initial attribute values to depend on disturbance history notably because the number of remnant trees might differ between different disturbances and thus have different impact on vegetation attributes hypothesis 4 2 1 4 2 long term process recovery rate we see forest stability as the capacity of forest attributes to reach more or less quickly pre disturbance or ogf levels holling 1973 moreover various biophysical factors influence the success of forest regeneration such as local soil conditions and community composition as well as climate derroire et al 2016 santiago garcía et al 2019 uriarte et al 2016 and could be integrated in regional studies as done in amani et al 2021 therefore we expect relative recovery rates to vary depending on disturbance history as they might have different implications on forest dynamics e g soil damage dispersal and therefore for attribute recovery hypothesis 3 to evaluate forest stability to disturbance we express recovery rates as a function of disturbance intensity and type green and blue boxes in fig 2 2 full directed acyclic graph dag fig s1 so that 2 16 λ p a d f β t y p e a d f i p γ a d f with γ a d f the shape parameter of the relationship between disturbance

1 is maximal by defining the recovery rate this way it encompasses effects of both disturbance intensity and type when disturbance intensity tends towards 1 i e its maximal level λ p a d f β t y p e a d f indeed even in a clear cutting scenario we expect the recovery rate to vary depending on the disturbance type as disturbance type might have different implications for soil damage and dispersal and therefore for attribute recovery hypothesis 3 2 1 4 3 short term process hump amplitude we model composition trajectories with ltp and stp equations we want to assess how disturbance intensity and type impact the amplitude of stp we hypothesise that the amplitude of the drop and back process in composition trajectory modelling depends on disturbance intensity indeed it might be generated by a massive recruitment of pioneer trees which develop predominantly in highly disturbed environments hypothesis 5 forest dynamics vary in tropical regions and pioneer genera if present might not have the same behaviour therefore the application of the stp should be carefully considered regarding knowledge on local forest post disturbance dynamics we express the stp amplitude depending on disturbance intensity green and purple boxes in fig 2 2 full dag fig s2 as follows 2 17 δ p a d f δ a d f i p η a d f with δ a d f the constant amplitude coefficient of the stp defined on r it allows to have an

three forest attributes 2 2 2 forest attributes after three disturbance types 2 2 3 disturbance types then we model recovery trajectories for these three attributes using our modelling framework 2 2 4 inference 2 2 1 study sites and measurements we apply our modelling framework to data from long term neotropical disturbance experiments tirimbina 10 24 n 84 06 w belongs to the pentaclethra fabaceae mimosaceae forest type sesnie et al 2009 located in the central american atlantic moist forest ecoregion of costa rica it consists of a cluster of 7 plots 7 ha total amongst which 5 underwent a timber stand improvement treatment in 1991 1992 finegan and camacho 1999 they were monitored for 27 years 1988 2015 this cluster is ubicated inside a 345 ha private reserve protecting old growth tropical forest in the surrounding highly fragmented matrix of cultivated land old growth and secondary forests 4 secondary forests plots 4 ha total were prepared for sowing and later abandoned or abandoned after a culture cycle at different times 1960 1962 1972 1986 these plots were monitored for 30 years 1987 2017 paracou 5 18 n 52 55 w is located in a lowland tropical french guianese forest gourlet fleury et al 2004 the forest composition is typical of the guiana shield paracou gathers 15 plots 93 75 ha total monitored for 37 years 1984 2021 amongst which 9 56 25 ha total underwent various logging treatments from 1986 to 1988 3 plots were only selectively logged in 1986 while 6 were selectively logged in 1986 and subsequently applied silvicultural treatments not targeting particular species in 1987 1988 moreover 15 km west north west from paracou 5 30 n 53 05 w a 25 ha area is clearcut in july september 1976 for a pulp production project sarrailh et al 1990 in october 1976 an accidental fire burnt about 15 of the area a single 6 25 ha plot arbocel is set up in the clearcut area in 1989 and monitored for 32 years 1989 2021 forest censuses the plot areas vary between 1 ha costa rica and 6 25 ha french guiana all trees 10 cm diameter at breast height dbh were measured and identified to the lowest taxonomic level at various time intervals to have similar plot areas within our data set we divide in four the 6 25 ha plots in french guiana obtaining 1 56 ha plots taxonomic verification first inventories in tirimbina were led by botanists then carried out by parabotanists with foliar material collection when identification could not be achieved in the field all taxonomic names were checked in 2021 by a botanist for synonymy wrong use or absence of occurrence in costa rica synonyms and names inadequately employed are replaced by botanist s suggestions costa rican taxonomic data is finally submitted to the taxonomic name resolution service through the correcttaxo function of the biomass r package version 2 1 8 réjou méchain et al 2017 to correct for typos and synonymy we verify suggested changes and apply them if considered relevant taxonomic resolution in paracou has high standards for forestry however it varies between plots and potentially between families due to the contribution of botanists specialised in different taxa therefore we gapfill missing botanical names using vernacular names in the guyafor plot network aubry kientz et al 2013 mirabel 2018 thanks to the vernabota r package version 0 4 1 derroire et al 2022 cleaning routine to check taxonomic typos and synonymy is run weekly on paracou data 2 2 2 forest attributes we compute basal area and the other three forest attributes of interest as follows basal area basal area is computed for each tree summed to obtain basal area levels per plot and census year then reported at the plot scale biomass agb is computed from tree diameter values following chave et al 2014 with the computeagb function from the biomass r package version 2 1 8 réjou méchain et al 2017 it requires the wood density of the studied trees estimated from the global wood density database zanne et al 2009 and their taxonomy by the getwooddensity function from the aforementioned r package each agb tree value is summed to obtain agb levels per plot and census year then reported per hectare diversity taxonomic diversity is considered at the genus level and reported through shannon diversity 1 order hcdt diversity transformed hill number this index is computed with the diversity function from the entropart r package version 1 6 11 marcon and hérault 2015 and the unbiased asymptotic estimator unveilj level of interpolation is the mean sample coverage total probability of occurrence of the genera observed in the sample tirimbina 0 942 paracou 0 967 of all inventories determined separately for costa rican and guianese sites with zhang huang estimator and computed through the coverage function entropart r package version 1 6 11 marcon and hérault 2015 shannon diversity refers to the number of genera and the evenness in the considered community a single inventory per site plot and census year it indicates the extent to which genera differ between random pairs of trees composition change in floristic composition of disturbed forests during regeneration is assessed by calculating the dissimilarity between disturbed and ogf to consider both temporal and spatial variations between plots we assume that dissimilarity between disturbed and ogf communities tends towards the dissimilarity observed between ogf communities amani et al 2021 we compute the abundance based chao jaccard dissimilarity index chao et al 2005 implemented in the vegdist function vegan r package version 2 5 7 between post disturbance inventories of each plot and the last inventory we have for each ogf plot to inform asymptotic values we also calculate this dissimilarity index between all inventories of all ogf plots and the last inventory of all ogf plots carried out in 2021 in paracou only discarding the calculation of the index between different censuses of a given plot for interpretation and modelling purposes we work with a simple difference 1 dissimilarity index to obtain a composition similarity index hereafter 1 indicates the highest similarity between two censuses we do not work on composition with the costa rican site due to the lack of ogf plots 2 2 3 disturbance types we group disturbance types into three large categories to ensure a better representation across sites when possible selective logging i e felling and extracting trees belonging to commercial species both in costa rica and french guiana but associated with severe not species specific damage naves et al 2020 this category also includes plots that faced post silvicultural treatments to alleviate competition for trees with commercial interest finegan and camacho 1999 gourlet fleury et al 2004 agriculture referring to the preparation for sowing with a subsequent abandonment or an abandonment after a culture cycle in costa rica clearcutting fire the occurrence of a fire shortly after clear cutting in french guiana 2 2 4 inference bayesian hierarchical models are inferred through mcmc methods using the no u turn sampling algorithm nuts an adaptive form of the hamiltonian monte carlo sampling inference rely on 4 markov chains of 2000 iterations each including a 1000 iteration warm up maximum tree depth is set to 12 codes are developed using r version 4 2 2 and the rstan r package version 2 26 13 carpenter et al 2017 parameters bounds are specified and explained in table s1 we model the trajectories of basal area and of the three vegetation attributes of interest with the following specificities basal area disturbances such as logging have deep consequences on forest structure indeed beyond the loss of targeted trees from commercial genera these disturbances cause an induced mortality leading to a decrease in basal area at the plot level until 4 years after this event therefore for the model inference we input basal area values recorded at least 4 years after the disturbance considering clearcutting fire we constrain initial basal area per plot to 0 since this area is completely deforested biomass as for basal area we set a minimal age of 4 year post disturbance for agb values used as input in the model inference due to induced mortality considering clearcutting fire we constrain initial agb per plot to 0 since this area is completely deforested diversity as induced mortality is supposedly random in terms of genera targeted thus not having a strong impact on diversity trajectories diversity values recorded from 1 year post disturbance are used to infer the model composition as for diversity we set a minimal age of 1 year post disturbance for composition similarity values used as input in the model inference moreover contrary to the recovery of other forest attributes we choose a relative recovery rate λ t y p e c o m p o s i t i o n d f depending only on disturbance type we do not include a disturbance intensity effect on composition recovery rate as we only study composition in french guiana with two disturbance types amongst which one has a disturbance intensity of 1 for all considered plots furthermore we use a negative amplitude δ c o m p o s i t i o n d f for the stp following selective logging as we expect in df a decrease in composition similarity with ogf due to the recruitment of pioneer species following clearcutting fire a visual inspection of composition similarity trajectories do not suggest the occurrence of a boom and bust or drop and back process thus we do not express the stp for this disturbance type 3 results discussion 3 1 accuracy of the model predictions predicted versus observed attribute values are presented in fig 3 1 and those for basal area in fig s9 median predictions appear consistent with observations for all attributes both for the ltp only agb diversity and the ltp stp composition similarity 95 confidence interval are wider for diversity and composition similarity predictions than for agb prediction s reliability is also consistent across disturbance types furthermore time since disturbance does not seem to influence the quality of the predictions consequently our modelling framework appears to be reliable regardless of the studied vegetation attribute disturbance type and time since disturbance for the considered census 3 2 recovery drivers disturbance intensity drives diversity relative recovery rate i e its stability as well as the depth of composition drop and back amplitude the higher the disturbance intensity the slower the recovery and the lower the stability the higher the disturbance intensity fig 3 2 upper panels the deeper the drop and back amplitude fig 3 2 lower panel at maximal intensity and for the same disturbance type diversity and agb recovery rates display similar median values β s e l e c t i v e l o g g i n g d i v e r s i t y d f 0 014 and β s e l e c t i v e l o g g i n g a g b d f 0 019

rutishauser et al 2015 agb recovery in tirimbina and paracou might rely on underlying ecological processes whose drivers are not affected or poorly affected by disturbance intensity disturbance types influence both diversity and agb recovery with higher relative recovery rates for selective logging compared to agriculture and clearcutting fire disturbance types influence attribute initial values α

instance at around a 70 intensity diversity starting points following logging in paracou are much closer from ogf values than following agriculture in tirimbina 3 3 known limitations recommendations this model can be run without data from ogf plots in this case the information to infer the a posteriori distribution of asymptotic values will only come from trajectories of the disturbed plots to improve predictions we recommend providing as many monitoring data i e forest censuses remote sensing series from ogf plots as possible the choice of these ogf references should be thought off carefully as landscape fragmentation might alter attribute levels even in ogf and disturbances may have very long lasting effects odonne et al 2019 i e longer than human memory our conceptual framework revolves around disturbance history effects on vegetation attribute recovery with an emphasis on disturbance intensity this continuous variable might be incorporated either as 1 input data or 2 as a transformed parameter directly inferred from long term forest monitoring inside the model framework here to estimate disturbance intensity for each studied plot we have our model relying on basal area trajectories option 2 requiring several forest censuses chronosequences which are much more common in secondary tropical forest databases than long term monitoring are not suitable for this option to analyse this type of data our modelling framework could however be easily modified to receive disturbance intensity as input data option 1 various structural vegetation attributes might be used to define disturbance intensity originating for instance from forest censuses or remote sensing acquisitions the choice of this structural attribute should be thoroughly considered to serve the purpose of the study and to be available for all study sites in order to remain consistent and draw comparisons in our data set disturbance type and intensity are not independent when possible we recommend having the widest range of intensities for most disturbance types to better identify intensity and type effects although it might not be possible as they are intrinsically linked 3 4 conservation implications of the common framework for disturbed forests historically forest recovery following different disturbance types has been studied separately although we expect to encounter different disturbance types in different environments landscape fragmentation makes them coexist in close range e g in tirimbina disturbed forests dominate our contemporary tropical landscapes lewis et al 2015 potapov et al 2017 but in addition to these ecosystem biogeographical characteristics disturbance history plays a major role in shaping their attribute trajectories therefore our approach offers the opportunity to study in a single framework a large spectrum of disturbance type and intensity thus allowing consistent comparative analyses beyond climatic events forests are mainly degraded by resource exploitation to generate income from agriculture or timber extraction while such a framework helps characterising the stability of tropical forests to disturbances from a pure ecological standpoint it also indicates which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided and which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments moreover it could assist managers in determining in which contexts forest attribute recovery rates and post disturbance levels are higher thus identifying which contexts offer good prospects for efficient natural regeneration amani et al 2022 crouzeilles et al 2017 furthermore this could help focusing human and financial resources on the improvement and the implementation of active restoration plans that are crucially needed in certain areas ngo bieng et al 2021 but have shown to be rather expensive and with uncertain outcomes so far see for instance caughlin et al 2019 and coleman et al 2021 4 conclusion we present an innovative modelling framework for multi attribute recovery trajectories following disturbance in tropical forests our modelling framework stands out by 1 its interpretability with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning 2 its robustness allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound 3 its flexibility to consider disturbance intensity through post disturbance changes in a structural attribute either as input data or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre disturbance monitoring and 4 its consideration of multiple disturbance types along intensity gradients in a single modelling framework allowing to compare trajectories between varying disturbance types and intensities to provide useful and meaningful information to forest managers and policy makers we suggest testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery i e with forest monitoring or remote sensing data and applying this model to a wider range of disturbance types funding this study was funded by the cgiar research program on forests trees

24148,temperate forest is one of the largest forest biomes and is undergoing remarkable shifts in forest composition and ecosystem productivity under warming climates however there are considerable uncertainties when predicting future dynamics of temperate forest ecosystems partly because of the uncertainties in future climate predictions sensitivity analysis provides an effective mean to evaluate the uncertainties in the predicted forest responses to climate change here we evaluated the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity to climate change in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest a keystone temperate forest type in northeast china in this study we used a process based forest dynamic model formind to simulate and predict the response of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest under climate change based on plant functional types pfts and we performed model calibration using forest investigation we then designed a factorial experiment to quantify the sensitivity to temperature and precipitation of forest composition and ecosystem productivity results showed that the uncertainty in future climate predictions could result in divergent responses of forest composition and ecosystem productivity to climate change over the 21st century the response of pfts to climate temperature and precipitation varied in terms of aboveground biomass both shade tolerant and shade intolerant pfts exhibited higher sensitivity 80 for most of the pfts to temperature than precipitation yet they responded oppositely to climate warming with shade tolerant pfts generally increasing but shade tolerant pfts decreasing moderate shade tolerant pfts showed higher precipitation sensitiveness 50 such differences in response and sensitivity of pfts to climate change are related to pfts competitiveness ecosystem productivity exhibited a higher sensitivity 50 to temperature than to precipitation there was more increase in ecosystem respiration than gross primary productivity gpp under warming climate leading to a decrease in carbon sequestration and net ecosystem exchange nee our study addresses the importance of evaluating the sensitivity of a forest ecosystem model to climate change which is relatively less studied the insight from the study may help design effective forest management strategies to cope with future climate change keywords climate sensitivity aboveground biomass net ecosystem exchange formind model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction temperate forest is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems with carbon reservoirs up to over 50 pg c thurner et al 2014 these forests play an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change bonan 2008 piao et al 2009 temperate forests are sensitive to changing climates and have been undergoing remarkable and significant shifts in forest composition taylor et al 2017 thom et al 2017 consequently ecosystem productivity associated with the composition change along with tree growth carbon consumption and tree respiration is also expected to change boisvenue and running 2006 brzostek et al 2014 the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc5 predicted that annual average temperature will increase by 0 5 8 9 c and precipitation will increase by 2 5 76 2 in the middle and high latitudes of northern hemisphere in the 21st century ipcc 2013 the potential forest responses to climate change may be considerably varied across a broad range of climate projections ahlström et al 2012 huang et al 2021 accurate evaluation of temperate forest responses to future climate change is of great importance with respect to coping with global changes designing adaptable forest management strategies and maintaining its biodiversity the mixed broadleaved korean pine pinus koraiensis sieb et zucc forest is most significant among temperate forest ecosystems in northeast china because of its broad distribution and rich species diversity krestov et al 2015 research suggests that species composition of mixed broadleaf korean pine forest could shift from pine to broadleaf dominated under warming climates he et al 2005 lyu et al 2017 shao et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 for example many studies report that warming could potentially favor broadleaf species such as quercus and acer he et al 2005 kim et al 2020 the enhanced competitive capacity of the broadleaf species could promote their growth and colonization leading to an increase in their proportion and biomass in the forests he et al 2005 shao et al 2003 meanwhile dendrochronological studies show that temperature is a predominant factor affecting the growth of korean pine lyu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 elevated temperature along with the prolonged growing season can benefit the establishment of korean pine and cause an expansion of their leading edge li et al 2011 furthermore studies found a synergistic effect of heat and moisture on the growth of korean pine zhuang et al 2017 particularly increased precipitation can strengthen the positive effects of warming on korean pine while decreased precipitation can weaken the growth due to drought stress cao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2017 thus the discrepancies in the responses of mixed broadleaf korean pine forest to climate change may obscure our understanding of the response of the forest ecosystem to climate change the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest is also expected to significantly change its ecosystem productivity under warming climate qiu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 however the direction of this change is uncertain generally it is thought that relatively low temperature is a major constraint to tree growth in this forest cao et al 2019 warming should therefore increase the period of photosynthesis by prolonging the growing season leading to increases in tree growth forest biomass and productivity and further promoting carbon sequestration in the ecosystem cao et al 2019 cao et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 yet other studies report that higher temperatures especially when accompanied by an asynchronous increase in precipitation may lead to higher evapotranspiration slower tree growth decreased forest biomass and productivity and lower sequestrated carbon liang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 additionally elevated temperature could also increase maintenance respiration further reducing ecosystem productivity wang et al 2019 increased drought events under higher temperatures could also result in a shift from carbon sink to carbon source in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest lee et al 2021 peng et al 2009 in this study we investigated the response of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest of northeast china to climate warming we used the process based forest growth model formind to simulate forest dynamics under various climate scenarios the model simulates tree growth and forest development as well as carbon dynamics dependent on climatic conditions thus formind could evaluate the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change sensitivity analysis provides an effective mean to evaluate the uncertainties in forest responses to climate warming huang et al 2021 it can also quantify how variations of climate variable such as temperature and precipitation affect the projected results the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a formind modeling framework for the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest 2 examine the forest dynamics in response to future climates and 3 quantify the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity to potential changes in temperature and precipitation in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest of northeastern china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site the study focuses on the temperate forests of the changbai mountain northeast china bordering north korea fig 1 our study site 42 23 n 128 05 e is located in the old growth mixed broadleaf korean pine forest the mixed broadleaf korean pine forest is a typical temperate forest type of china the elevation is about 800 m a s l climate is a moist temperate climate with long cold winter and short warm summer the average temperature is 2 8 c and the average annual precipitation is about 700 mm with a wet season from june to september there are a variety of tree species and six dominant species of which represent 90 of total basal area including pinus koraiensis siebold zucc tilia amurensis rupr acer mono maxim quercus mongolica fisch ex ledeb fraxinus mandschurica rupr and ulmus davidiana planch var japonica rehd nakai 2 2 inventory data in 2004 a 25 ha 500 m 500 m permanent plot was established in our study site which is located within the changbai mountain nature reserve cmnr hao et al 2008 the plot consists of a multi layered uneven aged forest with a dominant tree layer of approximately 300 years and an average height of about 26 m the plot has an average elevation of 801 5 m ranging from 791 8 m to 809 5 m asl the terrain of the plot is generally flat with the exception of some undulating areas since the establishment of permanent plot all trees in the plot were censused in five year intervals for each tree with a diameter at breast height dbh 1 cm the coordinates species names dbh tree height and crown width were measured and recorded thus average basal area and tree density in the plot can be derived the successive tree census also allowed us to capture tree regeneration growth and mortality 2 3 climate data to assess the sensitivity of forest to climate change we collected current and future climate data in our study site the current weather data is derived from the meteorological station within the study site which collects hourly temperature precipitation solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from 2004 to 2019 future climate temperature and precipitation data 2015 2100 is derived from cmip6 global climate models gcms over the 21st century https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 which are based on simulations of the earth s climate system future climate predictions 2015 2100 of this region largely indicated that both temperature and precipitation will exhibit increasing trends but at different magnitudes thus we chose four typical climatic scenarios cesm2 waccm ssp245 cesm2 waccm ssp370 cnrm esm2 ssp245 and cnrm esm2 ssp585 representing warmer and wetter much warmer and wetter warmer and much wetter and much warmer and much wetter climate at the end of 21st century 2080 2100 respectively relative to current condition which can capture the potential future climate change characteristics table 1 fig s1 moreover the chosen future climate scenarios whose predictions in 2015 are closest to the weather data of the meteorological station all selected climate scenarios have inherited daily climate variability and consequently annual variability similar to the current climate data e g greatest precipitation occurs in the summer and snow in the winter specifically we used the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model interpolation method daly et al 2002 that included elevation of changbai mountain to spatially interpolate the future climate data for our study site 2 4 formind model the formind model is a processed based individual oriented spatially explicit forest model which was designed for simulating the dynamics of species rich forest communities it divides the simulated forest area into patches 20 m 20 m interacting by seed dispersal and tree falling within each patch formind simulates tree demographic processes including tree growth recruitment competition and mortality which are mainly controlled by the availability of light and space tree biomass growth is determined with respect to a carbon balance as a result of photosynthesis and respiration which regulates the increments in tree height stem diameter stem volume and leaf area in formind seeds are stochastically distributed among the patches and new seedlings can establish under suitable light conditions fischer et al 2016 both seed survival and establishment can be influenced by climate change which consequently regulates forest regeneration tree competition takes place for light owing to shading effects as well as for space owing to expanded canopies tree mortality is associated with weakened tree growth related to climate enhanced competition for space e g self thinning death of large trees and their falling as well as background mortality due to stochastic events which can be simulated stochastically the formind model does not simulate asexual reproduction e g sprouting layering that many trees are capable of and that is important in more disturbance prone forest ecosystems since the study location is not generally affected by these perturbations this limitation should not have an appreciable impact on our simulations and we have thus chosen to exclude this regeneration process more model details are available in the supplementary materials the formind model is capable of simulating forest carbon dynamics bohn et al 2014 fischer et al 2016 based on physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration it analyzes the local carbon fluxes among atmosphere vegetation and soil to estimate gross primary productivity gpp respiration of the forest including living biomass and dead biomass and the soil and net ecosystem exchange nee nee is calculated as the difference between the ecosystem gpp and the total respiration by the forest and soil thus a positive nee represents increasing carbon stocks while a negative nee represents decreasing carbon stocks 2 5 model parameterization formind simulates forest dynamics based on plant function types pfts which represents the groups of tree species with similar traits here according to physiological attributes including maximum potential tree height and light requirement shade tolerance we classified the species in our area into seven pfts table 2 we determined the maximum potential tree height classes by referring to the criteria from groeneveld et al 2009 together with the vertical structure i e height layers of the forest in the study site we conducted the parameterization of the formind model by defining environmental variables as well as model parameters describing tree establishment mortality geometry and biomass production in this study we defined the allometry relations for tree geometries e g diameter height relationships for each pft from the aforementioned permanent plot encompassing a range of sizes and ages of trees table s2 specifically we recorded dbh and height for each individual tree every five years 2004 2019 furthermore the seed number of each pft is determined from the published results in the study site qian et al 2019 the environmental parameters and variables include those related to light condition soil and climate the parameters referring to light condition and soil were obtained from field investigation the climatic parameters were derived from the climate station current climate and cmip6 future predicted data see above in the study site such as temperature precipitation here we did not simulate co2 concentration since we opted to simplify the parameterization the parameters related to mortality and biomass production for each pft were estimated from multiple successive censuses 2004 2014 by every five years in order to better reproduce each pft s growth dynamic we also inventoried an early successional forest plot 24 ha whose data were used as references point to adjust the diameter growth change parameters the plot 42 22 n 128 00 e is dominated by white birch betula platyphylla suk and aspen populus davidiana dode and is located near the study site within the plot the geographic coordinates height and dbh of all trees dbh 1 cm were recorded in this study we performed simulations based on pfts rather than on individual tree species since parameters at the tree species level may introduce uncertainties without gaining more significant insights 2 6 model simulation we simulated forest succession on 25 ha over a period of 585 years with a 1 year time step initializing with bare ground during the first 500 years forest dynamics were simulated in the stable climatic conditions to allow forest to reach a steady state corresponding to the current old growth forests which is designed for the model spin up to reach equilibrium fig 2 we then ran the model for the next 85 years which correspond to years 2015 2100 i e cmip6 projection period to simulate future forest dynamics under the predicted climatic scenarios see climate data section in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the forest to future climate change generally under uncertain future climate change forest attributes will exhibit three possible scenarios status quo the relatively stable current forest condition as the null hypothesis and either higher or lower levels as alternative outcomes fig 2 additionally we also included a simulation scenario with no future climate change as baseline in this study we performed the simulation for 10 replications not all simulation results will be presented in this paper please see the supplemental materials section for these outcomes 2 7 model calibration for model calibration we compared the simulated mature forests with the corresponding field observations based on the assumption that forests can reach the equilibrium state in the late successional stage under the stable climate conditions bormann and likens 1979 turner et al 1993 we regarded that the simulated forest reached maturity and stabilized after 300 simulation years thus the simulated mature forest attributes were averaged over the 300 500 years field observation values were the averages from 2004 to 2014 surveys in the study site 25 ha we conducted model calibration by iteratively adjusting the model parameters that cannot be directly determined such as light response curves and minimum light intensity required for seed ingrowth table s2 until we were able verify that there was no significant difference between the simulated results and the field observations 25 ha mentioned above in terms of tree density and basal area for each pft for all trees here the measured and estimated basal area for each pft can be calculated from the average of the basal area of all trees for each pft model calibration also involved comparing the simulated results at the early successional stage against forest inventory data an early successional forest plot near the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest plot see supplementary fig s3 the two step calibration processes ensured that calibrated model is capable of reproducing the current mixed forest conditions 2 8 climate sensitivity we quantified the sensitivity of forest dynamics in response to future climate change by the four cmip6 scenarios section climate data these scenarios can lead to a factorial experiment for two independent climate variables at two levels temperature warmer and much warmer at the end of 21st century and precipitation wetter and much wetter at the end of 21st century for the future scenarios we used daily values of temperature and precipitation of the corresponding cmip6 climate scenarios during 2015 2100 we analyzed final states in the simulated forest under the cmip6 future climate scenarios by the averaged values over the last 20 years 2080 2100 to evaluate the sensitivity of the forest to future climate change 2 9 data analysis for all climate scenarios we assessed the forest composition through the aboveground biomass agb of each pft and ecosystem productivity through gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp total respiration rt autotrophic respiration ra heterotrophic respiration rh and net ecosystem exchange nee moreover we regarded the above variables as the response variables when quantifying the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity in response to climate change for the end of 21st century 2080 2100 we quantified the sensitivity of the response variables to climate change through determining relative importance of each climatic variable by calculating the proportion of the total variance in the response variables explained by each climatic variable using two way anova analysis of variance based on type iii sums of squares 3 results 3 1 model validation current field inventory data and simulated data exhibited no significant differences in either total basal area or density by each pft paired t tests df 6 p 0 05 fig 3 this showed that the simulated forest composition and structure using the formind model are representative of our field based example of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest the simulated forest development pathways of all pfts showed that shade intolerant pfts s1h2 and s1h3 initially sharply increased but then decreased in agb and finally get gradually replaced by mid shade tolerant and shade tolerant pfts e g s2h3 s3h2 and s3h3 which exhibited gradual increases and stabilized after 300 years of the simulation fig s4 the pfts with both relative shade tolerance and a higher potential maximum height s3h3 s3h2 and s2h3 became dominant at the steady state more than 90 of total agb fig s4 thus simulated forest trajectories using the formind model were consistent with forest stand development theory oliver and larson 1996 which increased our confidence in the ability of the calibrated formind model to effectively represent long term forest dynamics for the study site 3 2 forest dynamics under future climates generally total agb showed patterns of gradual increase under all future climate scenarios from 317 0 t ha to 331 4 3 0 t ha from 2015 to 2100 fig 4 the largest increase in total agb occurred in the cnrm waccm ssp245 scenario warmer and wetter and the smallest increase occurred in cesm2 esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter fig s5 notably the seven pfts have divergent responses in their agb to future climate change specifically for some of the pfts including s3h3 and s2h3 agb gradually increased over the 21st century under future climate with an increase of 15 2 4 2 t ha 182 2 197 4 4 2 t ha during 2015 2100 and 5 3 0 6 t ha 72 7 78 0 0 6 t ha during 2015 2100 by 2100 respectively shade intolerant pfts s1h2 s1h3 exhibited decreases in agb with 1 9 0 4 t ha 5 3 3 4 0 4 t ha and 2 4 1 3 t ha 34 8 32 4 1 3 t ha from 2015 to 2100 other pfts like s3h2 s2h2 and s3h1 kept relatively stable during the years 2015 2100 fig 4 the increases in temperature and precipitation also resulted in noticeable changes in ecosystem productivity over the 21st century nee showed an overall slight decline from 0 3 t c ha yr in 2015 to 0 3 0 1 t c ha yr in 2100 respectively fig 4 the largest decrease occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp585 scenario much warmer and much wetter with 0 2 t c ha yr while the smallest decrease occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter with 0 0 t c ha yr fig s6 npp showed slight increase under the four future climate scenarios with 3 6 t c ha yr in 2015 to 3 9 0 2 t c ha yr in 2100 the largest npp occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter 3 8 t c ha yr while the smallest npp occurred in cesm2 waccm ssp245 scenario warmer and wetter 3 7 t c ha yr fig s6 additionally under the four climate scenarios gpp and respiration rt ra and rh presented slow increases of 1 7 0 6 gpp 1 8 0 6 rt 1 4 0 5 ra and 0 4 0 1 rh t c ha yr respectively during 2015 2100 fig 4 the largest increase occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp585 scenario much warmer and much wetter while the smallest increase in cesm2 esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter fig s6 3 3 sensitivity of individual pfts to climate the sensitivity of seven pfts to climate temperature and precipitation varied compared to precipitation most of the pfts were more sensitive to temperature in terms of agb including s1h2 s1h3 s3h1 s3h2 and s3h3 especially for s1h2 s3h1 and s3h2 temperature explained 80 of total variation in agb fig 5 for s1h3 and s3h3 temperature and its interaction with precipitation explained 65 of total variation in agb however agb of mid shade tolerant pfts s2h2 and s2h3 was more sensitive to precipitation than temperature with precipitation explaining 56 0 and 86 9 of total variation in their agb and temperature explaining 44 0 and 7 6 respectively fig 5 3 4 sensitivity of the forest ecosystem to climate total agb exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature explaining 49 6 of its total variation than to precipitation explaining only 7 7 fig 6 a meanwhile ecosystem productivity also exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation for gpp npp and nee temperature explained 87 8 56 7 and 66 1 of their total variation respectively exceeding that explained by precipitation 11 4 40 5 and 2 7 fig 6b d likewise respiration rt ra and rh was also more sensitive to temperature than precipitation with 80 of total variation explained by temperature fig 6e g 4 discussion this study is one of the few attempts to apply dynamic forest models here specifically formind to the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest an important temperate forest in northeast china simulated forest dynamics showed that shade intolerant pioneer tree species sharply increased in agb at early successional stages then decreased gradually and finally were replaced by dominant and climax tree species mid shade tolerant and shade tolerant tree species the simulated forest successional trajectories followed the theories of classic forest stand dynamics oliver and larson 1996 which are consistent with the simulated dynamics of other forest ecosystems fischer et al 2016 groeneveld et al 2009 we focused on the agb dynamics of individual pfts which can reflect the compositional differences through pft dominance and on ecosystem productivity under four representative future climate scenarios and evaluated the sensitivity of this forest ecosystem to climate we found that the uncertainty in future climate predictions can lead to inconsistent responses of forest composition and ecosystem productivity to climate change the sensitivity of the forest to temperature and precipitation differed within both plant function type pft composition and ecosystem productivity our study addresses the importance of evaluating the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change which is relatively less studied the insight from the study may help designing effective forest management strategies to cope with future climate change our results suggest that the simulated forest composition and structure of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest by the formind model in 2015 reflected the currently observed forest conditions moreover the simulated results with an nee of 0 3 0 6 t c ha yr in 2015 fig s6 indicated that currently the forest is still a carbon sink which agrees with the observations and other simulations at this forest site 0 3 1 8 t c ha yr guan et al 2006 saigusa et al 2013 tang et al 2009 wang et al 2006 xie et al 2020 moreover our simulated result is consistent with other studies in temperate forests worldwide for example a study of estimated nep which is generally considered to be close to nee from improved individual based forest ecosystem model forcchn showed that nep in mixed broadleaved coniferous forests from 1982 to 2011 were 0 4 t c ha yr zhao et al 2019 forest observation exhibited that the average nep for unmanaged temperate and boreal forests more than 200 years old was 1 3 0 6 t c ha yr indicating a slight net c sink gundersen et al 2021 which is close to our simulation result the above results confirmed that the formind model performs well in simulating the forest dynamics in the studied mixed broadleaved korean pine forest overall we found that both biomass and productivity of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest will show an increasing trend under future climate change which is similar to the predicted results of other temperate forest in northeastern united states wang et al 2017 further supporting the promoting effects of climate warming on forest carbon accumulation our results revealed that there are divergent responses of the pfts to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest the simulated agb of most pfts is generally more sensitive to temperature than to precipitation this is mainly due to the climate of the study site changbai mountain with low temperatures and abundant precipitation yang 1981 where tree growth is more responsive to temperature increases in our study we found that shade intolerant and shade tolerant pfts exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation but they showed opposite responses the shade tolerant pfts e g korean pine basswood gradually increased in agb with warming climate while the shade intolerant pfts such as birch aspen oak gradually decreased this discrepancy is related to the tree species biological traits which affect the species establishment and survival craine and dybzinski 2013 a tree s ability to increase its growth under more favorable climate is also confounded by its competition capability that varies significantly among species ford et al 2017 in our study area future increases in temperature and precipitation would create a more suitable environment for tree growth however the shade tolerant pfts with strong competitiveness will gain advantages over other pfts and occupy more space in particular recent studies based on both model simulation and tree chronology also confirmed that shade tolerant species such as korean pine was highly temperature sensitive and showed a positive relationship between radial growth and temperature lyu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however because of the diminished available space and enhanced tree competition resulted from the growth and establishment in shade tolerant pfts agb of shade intolerant pfts with weak competitiveness suffers even though these pfts are also favored under the warming climate noteworthily moderate shade tolerant pfts such as ash and elm group exhibited lower sensitivity to temperature than precipitation and the simulated dynamics in their agb remain largely stable with slight fluctuations this is because their ecological niches are mostly in the middle between shade tolerant and shade intolerant pfts allowing them to be less sensitive to climate change therefore under anticipated climatic conditions in the future species composition in mixed broadleaved korean pine forest may tend to evolve towards increasing in shade tolerant pfts but decreasing shade intolerant pfts notably this change in forest composition is mainly caused by climate change rather than succession as the current forest i e mature forest dominated by mid to late successional species has been already in a stable state i e the successional climax under the current climate certainly drought induced by high temperature may limit the increase in forest biomass allen et al 2010 ma et al 2012 we found that ecosystem productivity exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest this is consistent with recent studies based on carbon flux observation yu et al 2008 yu et al 2005 which shows that the low temperature limits tree growth in this forest ecosystem future warming can prolong the growing season and increase tree photosynthesis thereby enhancing forest ecosystem productivity keenan et al 2014 oberbauer et al 2007 our simulation results also found that gpp will increase under future climate scenarios over the 21st century meanwhile our results also suggest that ecosystem respiration demonstrated a high sensitivity to temperature which is consistent with recent studies jiang et al 2005 wen et al 2006 yu et al 2005 we found that ecosystem respiration showed a gradual increase under the warming climate this is resulted from the elevated temperature that increases plant and soil respiration rates atkin and tjoelker 2003 davidson and janssens 2006 although increasing precipitation may increase soil water content promoting plant growth and soil respiration and thus increasing ecosystem gpp and respiration beer et al 2010 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2004 the intensity of the effect is relatively weak due to abundant precipitation in our study site we did not find synchronous response of gpp and respiration to climate change in this study instead we found that respiration increases more strongly than gpp photosynthesis under the warming climate this could lead to a reduced carbon sequestration and decreased nee which may even change the forest ecosystem from a carbon sink to a carbon source under the higher temperature increase scenarios thus the differences in the response and sensitivity of photosynthesis and respiration to climate change may alter future ecosystem carbon dynamics our study that evaluates and quantifies the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change is crucial in predicting the evolution of ecosystems under future climate change under future warming and precipitation conditions our simulated results showed that the aboveground biomass of the forest increases over the 21st century accompanied by increases in abundance of shade tolerant tree species this suggests that forest demand of management for promoting shade tolerant species could be naturally met under the future climate conditions in our study area however there were some limitations in the model simulation for example the formind model we used can only simulate seed based tree regeneration without asexual reproduction which may partly limit the capability of the model when predicting future forest dynamics we will further explore and discuss these limitations in

24148,temperate forest is one of the largest forest biomes and is undergoing remarkable shifts in forest composition and ecosystem productivity under warming climates however there are considerable uncertainties when predicting future dynamics of temperate forest ecosystems partly because of the uncertainties in future climate predictions sensitivity analysis provides an effective mean to evaluate the uncertainties in the predicted forest responses to climate change here we evaluated the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity to climate change in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest a keystone temperate forest type in northeast china in this study we used a process based forest dynamic model formind to simulate and predict the response of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest under climate change based on plant functional types pfts and we performed model calibration using forest investigation we then designed a factorial experiment to quantify the sensitivity to temperature and precipitation of forest composition and ecosystem productivity results showed that the uncertainty in future climate predictions could result in divergent responses of forest composition and ecosystem productivity to climate change over the 21st century the response of pfts to climate temperature and precipitation varied in terms of aboveground biomass both shade tolerant and shade intolerant pfts exhibited higher sensitivity 80 for most of the pfts to temperature than precipitation yet they responded oppositely to climate warming with shade tolerant pfts generally increasing but shade tolerant pfts decreasing moderate shade tolerant pfts showed higher precipitation sensitiveness 50 such differences in response and sensitivity of pfts to climate change are related to pfts competitiveness ecosystem productivity exhibited a higher sensitivity 50 to temperature than to precipitation there was more increase in ecosystem respiration than gross primary productivity gpp under warming climate leading to a decrease in carbon sequestration and net ecosystem exchange nee our study addresses the importance of evaluating the sensitivity of a forest ecosystem model to climate change which is relatively less studied the insight from the study may help design effective forest management strategies to cope with future climate change keywords climate sensitivity aboveground biomass net ecosystem exchange formind model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction temperate forest is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems with carbon reservoirs up to over 50 pg c thurner et al 2014 these forests play an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change bonan 2008 piao et al 2009 temperate forests are sensitive to changing climates and have been undergoing remarkable and significant shifts in forest composition taylor et al 2017 thom et al 2017 consequently ecosystem productivity associated with the composition change along with tree growth carbon consumption and tree respiration is also expected to change boisvenue and running 2006 brzostek et al 2014 the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc5 predicted that annual average temperature will increase by 0 5 8 9 c and precipitation will increase by 2 5 76 2 in the middle and high latitudes of northern hemisphere in the 21st century ipcc 2013 the potential forest responses to climate change may be considerably varied across a broad range of climate projections ahlström et al 2012 huang et al 2021 accurate evaluation of temperate forest responses to future climate change is of great importance with respect to coping with global changes designing adaptable forest management strategies and maintaining its biodiversity the mixed broadleaved korean pine pinus koraiensis sieb et zucc forest is most significant among temperate forest ecosystems in northeast china because of its broad distribution and rich species diversity krestov et al 2015 research suggests that species composition of mixed broadleaf korean pine forest could shift from pine to broadleaf dominated under warming climates he et al 2005 lyu et al 2017 shao et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 for example many studies report that warming could potentially favor broadleaf species such as quercus and acer he et al 2005 kim et al 2020 the enhanced competitive capacity of the broadleaf species could promote their growth and colonization leading to an increase in their proportion and biomass in the forests he et al 2005 shao et al 2003 meanwhile dendrochronological studies show that temperature is a predominant factor affecting the growth of korean pine lyu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 elevated temperature along with the prolonged growing season can benefit the establishment of korean pine and cause an expansion of their leading edge li et al 2011 furthermore studies found a synergistic effect of heat and moisture on the growth of korean pine zhuang et al 2017 particularly increased precipitation can strengthen the positive effects of warming on korean pine while decreased precipitation can weaken the growth due to drought stress cao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2017 thus the discrepancies in the responses of mixed broadleaf korean pine forest to climate change may obscure our understanding of the response of the forest ecosystem to climate change the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest is also expected to significantly change its ecosystem productivity under warming climate qiu et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhou et al 2011 however the direction of this change is uncertain generally it is thought that relatively low temperature is a major constraint to tree growth in this forest cao et al 2019 warming should therefore increase the period of photosynthesis by prolonging the growing season leading to increases in tree growth forest biomass and productivity and further promoting carbon sequestration in the ecosystem cao et al 2019 cao et al 2018 zhou et al 2011 yet other studies report that higher temperatures especially when accompanied by an asynchronous increase in precipitation may lead to higher evapotranspiration slower tree growth decreased forest biomass and productivity and lower sequestrated carbon liang et al 2016 wang et al 2019 additionally elevated temperature could also increase maintenance respiration further reducing ecosystem productivity wang et al 2019 increased drought events under higher temperatures could also result in a shift from carbon sink to carbon source in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest lee et al 2021 peng et al 2009 in this study we investigated the response of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest of northeast china to climate warming we used the process based forest growth model formind to simulate forest dynamics under various climate scenarios the model simulates tree growth and forest development as well as carbon dynamics dependent on climatic conditions thus formind could evaluate the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change sensitivity analysis provides an effective mean to evaluate the uncertainties in forest responses to climate warming huang et al 2021 it can also quantify how variations of climate variable such as temperature and precipitation affect the projected results the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a formind modeling framework for the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest 2 examine the forest dynamics in response to future climates and 3 quantify the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity to potential changes in temperature and precipitation in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest of northeastern china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study site the study focuses on the temperate forests of the changbai mountain northeast china bordering north korea fig 1 our study site 42 23 n 128 05 e is located in the old growth mixed broadleaf korean pine forest the mixed broadleaf korean pine forest is a typical temperate forest type of china the elevation is about 800 m a s l climate is a moist temperate climate with long cold winter and short warm summer the average temperature is 2 8 c and the average annual precipitation is about 700 mm with a wet season from june to september there are a variety of tree species and six dominant species of which represent 90 of total basal area including pinus koraiensis siebold zucc tilia amurensis rupr acer mono maxim quercus mongolica fisch ex ledeb fraxinus mandschurica rupr and ulmus davidiana planch var japonica rehd nakai 2 2 inventory data in 2004 a 25 ha 500 m 500 m permanent plot was established in our study site which is located within the changbai mountain nature reserve cmnr hao et al 2008 the plot consists of a multi layered uneven aged forest with a dominant tree layer of approximately 300 years and an average height of about 26 m the plot has an average elevation of 801 5 m ranging from 791 8 m to 809 5 m asl the terrain of the plot is generally flat with the exception of some undulating areas since the establishment of permanent plot all trees in the plot were censused in five year intervals for each tree with a diameter at breast height dbh 1 cm the coordinates species names dbh tree height and crown width were measured and recorded thus average basal area and tree density in the plot can be derived the successive tree census also allowed us to capture tree regeneration growth and mortality 2 3 climate data to assess the sensitivity of forest to climate change we collected current and future climate data in our study site the current weather data is derived from the meteorological station within the study site which collects hourly temperature precipitation solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity from 2004 to 2019 future climate temperature and precipitation data 2015 2100 is derived from cmip6 global climate models gcms over the 21st century https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 which are based on simulations of the earth s climate system future climate predictions 2015 2100 of this region largely indicated that both temperature and precipitation will exhibit increasing trends but at different magnitudes thus we chose four typical climatic scenarios cesm2 waccm ssp245 cesm2 waccm ssp370 cnrm esm2 ssp245 and cnrm esm2 ssp585 representing warmer and wetter much warmer and wetter warmer and much wetter and much warmer and much wetter climate at the end of 21st century 2080 2100 respectively relative to current condition which can capture the potential future climate change characteristics table 1 fig s1 moreover the chosen future climate scenarios whose predictions in 2015 are closest to the weather data of the meteorological station all selected climate scenarios have inherited daily climate variability and consequently annual variability similar to the current climate data e g greatest precipitation occurs in the summer and snow in the winter specifically we used the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model interpolation method daly et al 2002 that included elevation of changbai mountain to spatially interpolate the future climate data for our study site 2 4 formind model the formind model is a processed based individual oriented spatially explicit forest model which was designed for simulating the dynamics of species rich forest communities it divides the simulated forest area into patches 20 m 20 m interacting by seed dispersal and tree falling within each patch formind simulates tree demographic processes including tree growth recruitment competition and mortality which are mainly controlled by the availability of light and space tree biomass growth is determined with respect to a carbon balance as a result of photosynthesis and respiration which regulates the increments in tree height stem diameter stem volume and leaf area in formind seeds are stochastically distributed among the patches and new seedlings can establish under suitable light conditions fischer et al 2016 both seed survival and establishment can be influenced by climate change which consequently regulates forest regeneration tree competition takes place for light owing to shading effects as well as for space owing to expanded canopies tree mortality is associated with weakened tree growth related to climate enhanced competition for space e g self thinning death of large trees and their falling as well as background mortality due to stochastic events which can be simulated stochastically the formind model does not simulate asexual reproduction e g sprouting layering that many trees are capable of and that is important in more disturbance prone forest ecosystems since the study location is not generally affected by these perturbations this limitation should not have an appreciable impact on our simulations and we have thus chosen to exclude this regeneration process more model details are available in the supplementary materials the formind model is capable of simulating forest carbon dynamics bohn et al 2014 fischer et al 2016 based on physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration it analyzes the local carbon fluxes among atmosphere vegetation and soil to estimate gross primary productivity gpp respiration of the forest including living biomass and dead biomass and the soil and net ecosystem exchange nee nee is calculated as the difference between the ecosystem gpp and the total respiration by the forest and soil thus a positive nee represents increasing carbon stocks while a negative nee represents decreasing carbon stocks 2 5 model parameterization formind simulates forest dynamics based on plant function types pfts which represents the groups of tree species with similar traits here according to physiological attributes including maximum potential tree height and light requirement shade tolerance we classified the species in our area into seven pfts table 2 we determined the maximum potential tree height classes by referring to the criteria from groeneveld et al 2009 together with the vertical structure i e height layers of the forest in the study site we conducted the parameterization of the formind model by defining environmental variables as well as model parameters describing tree establishment mortality geometry and biomass production in this study we defined the allometry relations for tree geometries e g diameter height relationships for each pft from the aforementioned permanent plot encompassing a range of sizes and ages of trees table s2 specifically we recorded dbh and height for each individual tree every five years 2004 2019 furthermore the seed number of each pft is determined from the published results in the study site qian et al 2019 the environmental parameters and variables include those related to light condition soil and climate the parameters referring to light condition and soil were obtained from field investigation the climatic parameters were derived from the climate station current climate and cmip6 future predicted data see above in the study site such as temperature precipitation here we did not simulate co2 concentration since we opted to simplify the parameterization the parameters related to mortality and biomass production for each pft were estimated from multiple successive censuses 2004 2014 by every five years in order to better reproduce each pft s growth dynamic we also inventoried an early successional forest plot 24 ha whose data were used as references point to adjust the diameter growth change parameters the plot 42 22 n 128 00 e is dominated by white birch betula platyphylla suk and aspen populus davidiana dode and is located near the study site within the plot the geographic coordinates height and dbh of all trees dbh 1 cm were recorded in this study we performed simulations based on pfts rather than on individual tree species since parameters at the tree species level may introduce uncertainties without gaining more significant insights 2 6 model simulation we simulated forest succession on 25 ha over a period of 585 years with a 1 year time step initializing with bare ground during the first 500 years forest dynamics were simulated in the stable climatic conditions to allow forest to reach a steady state corresponding to the current old growth forests which is designed for the model spin up to reach equilibrium fig 2 we then ran the model for the next 85 years which correspond to years 2015 2100 i e cmip6 projection period to simulate future forest dynamics under the predicted climatic scenarios see climate data section in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the forest to future climate change generally under uncertain future climate change forest attributes will exhibit three possible scenarios status quo the relatively stable current forest condition as the null hypothesis and either higher or lower levels as alternative outcomes fig 2 additionally we also included a simulation scenario with no future climate change as baseline in this study we performed the simulation for 10 replications not all simulation results will be presented in this paper please see the supplemental materials section for these outcomes 2 7 model calibration for model calibration we compared the simulated mature forests with the corresponding field observations based on the assumption that forests can reach the equilibrium state in the late successional stage under the stable climate conditions bormann and likens 1979 turner et al 1993 we regarded that the simulated forest reached maturity and stabilized after 300 simulation years thus the simulated mature forest attributes were averaged over the 300 500 years field observation values were the averages from 2004 to 2014 surveys in the study site 25 ha we conducted model calibration by iteratively adjusting the model parameters that cannot be directly determined such as light response curves and minimum light intensity required for seed ingrowth table s2 until we were able verify that there was no significant difference between the simulated results and the field observations 25 ha mentioned above in terms of tree density and basal area for each pft for all trees here the measured and estimated basal area for each pft can be calculated from the average of the basal area of all trees for each pft model calibration also involved comparing the simulated results at the early successional stage against forest inventory data an early successional forest plot near the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest plot see supplementary fig s3 the two step calibration processes ensured that calibrated model is capable of reproducing the current mixed forest conditions 2 8 climate sensitivity we quantified the sensitivity of forest dynamics in response to future climate change by the four cmip6 scenarios section climate data these scenarios can lead to a factorial experiment for two independent climate variables at two levels temperature warmer and much warmer at the end of 21st century and precipitation wetter and much wetter at the end of 21st century for the future scenarios we used daily values of temperature and precipitation of the corresponding cmip6 climate scenarios during 2015 2100 we analyzed final states in the simulated forest under the cmip6 future climate scenarios by the averaged values over the last 20 years 2080 2100 to evaluate the sensitivity of the forest to future climate change 2 9 data analysis for all climate scenarios we assessed the forest composition through the aboveground biomass agb of each pft and ecosystem productivity through gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp total respiration rt autotrophic respiration ra heterotrophic respiration rh and net ecosystem exchange nee moreover we regarded the above variables as the response variables when quantifying the sensitivity of forest composition and productivity in response to climate change for the end of 21st century 2080 2100 we quantified the sensitivity of the response variables to climate change through determining relative importance of each climatic variable by calculating the proportion of the total variance in the response variables explained by each climatic variable using two way anova analysis of variance based on type iii sums of squares 3 results 3 1 model validation current field inventory data and simulated data exhibited no significant differences in either total basal area or density by each pft paired t tests df 6 p 0 05 fig 3 this showed that the simulated forest composition and structure using the formind model are representative of our field based example of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest the simulated forest development pathways of all pfts showed that shade intolerant pfts s1h2 and s1h3 initially sharply increased but then decreased in agb and finally get gradually replaced by mid shade tolerant and shade tolerant pfts e g s2h3 s3h2 and s3h3 which exhibited gradual increases and stabilized after 300 years of the simulation fig s4 the pfts with both relative shade tolerance and a higher potential maximum height s3h3 s3h2 and s2h3 became dominant at the steady state more than 90 of total agb fig s4 thus simulated forest trajectories using the formind model were consistent with forest stand development theory oliver and larson 1996 which increased our confidence in the ability of the calibrated formind model to effectively represent long term forest dynamics for the study site 3 2 forest dynamics under future climates generally total agb showed patterns of gradual increase under all future climate scenarios from 317 0 t ha to 331 4 3 0 t ha from 2015 to 2100 fig 4 the largest increase in total agb occurred in the cnrm waccm ssp245 scenario warmer and wetter and the smallest increase occurred in cesm2 esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter fig s5 notably the seven pfts have divergent responses in their agb to future climate change specifically for some of the pfts including s3h3 and s2h3 agb gradually increased over the 21st century under future climate with an increase of 15 2 4 2 t ha 182 2 197 4 4 2 t ha during 2015 2100 and 5 3 0 6 t ha 72 7 78 0 0 6 t ha during 2015 2100 by 2100 respectively shade intolerant pfts s1h2 s1h3 exhibited decreases in agb with 1 9 0 4 t ha 5 3 3 4 0 4 t ha and 2 4 1 3 t ha 34 8 32 4 1 3 t ha from 2015 to 2100 other pfts like s3h2 s2h2 and s3h1 kept relatively stable during the years 2015 2100 fig 4 the increases in temperature and precipitation also resulted in noticeable changes in ecosystem productivity over the 21st century nee showed an overall slight decline from 0 3 t c ha yr in 2015 to 0 3 0 1 t c ha yr in 2100 respectively fig 4 the largest decrease occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp585 scenario much warmer and much wetter with 0 2 t c ha yr while the smallest decrease occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter with 0 0 t c ha yr fig s6 npp showed slight increase under the four future climate scenarios with 3 6 t c ha yr in 2015 to 3 9 0 2 t c ha yr in 2100 the largest npp occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter 3 8 t c ha yr while the smallest npp occurred in cesm2 waccm ssp245 scenario warmer and wetter 3 7 t c ha yr fig s6 additionally under the four climate scenarios gpp and respiration rt ra and rh presented slow increases of 1 7 0 6 gpp 1 8 0 6 rt 1 4 0 5 ra and 0 4 0 1 rh t c ha yr respectively during 2015 2100 fig 4 the largest increase occurred in cnrm esm2 ssp585 scenario much warmer and much wetter while the smallest increase in cesm2 esm2 ssp245 scenario warmer and much wetter fig s6 3 3 sensitivity of individual pfts to climate the sensitivity of seven pfts to climate temperature and precipitation varied compared to precipitation most of the pfts were more sensitive to temperature in terms of agb including s1h2 s1h3 s3h1 s3h2 and s3h3 especially for s1h2 s3h1 and s3h2 temperature explained 80 of total variation in agb fig 5 for s1h3 and s3h3 temperature and its interaction with precipitation explained 65 of total variation in agb however agb of mid shade tolerant pfts s2h2 and s2h3 was more sensitive to precipitation than temperature with precipitation explaining 56 0 and 86 9 of total variation in their agb and temperature explaining 44 0 and 7 6 respectively fig 5 3 4 sensitivity of the forest ecosystem to climate total agb exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature explaining 49 6 of its total variation than to precipitation explaining only 7 7 fig 6 a meanwhile ecosystem productivity also exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation for gpp npp and nee temperature explained 87 8 56 7 and 66 1 of their total variation respectively exceeding that explained by precipitation 11 4 40 5 and 2 7 fig 6b d likewise respiration rt ra and rh was also more sensitive to temperature than precipitation with 80 of total variation explained by temperature fig 6e g 4 discussion this study is one of the few attempts to apply dynamic forest models here specifically formind to the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest an important temperate forest in northeast china simulated forest dynamics showed that shade intolerant pioneer tree species sharply increased in agb at early successional stages then decreased gradually and finally were replaced by dominant and climax tree species mid shade tolerant and shade tolerant tree species the simulated forest successional trajectories followed the theories of classic forest stand dynamics oliver and larson 1996 which are consistent with the simulated dynamics of other forest ecosystems fischer et al 2016 groeneveld et al 2009 we focused on the agb dynamics of individual pfts which can reflect the compositional differences through pft dominance and on ecosystem productivity under four representative future climate scenarios and evaluated the sensitivity of this forest ecosystem to climate we found that the uncertainty in future climate predictions can lead to inconsistent responses of forest composition and ecosystem productivity to climate change the sensitivity of the forest to temperature and precipitation differed within both plant function type pft composition and ecosystem productivity our study addresses the importance of evaluating the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change which is relatively less studied the insight from the study may help designing effective forest management strategies to cope with future climate change our results suggest that the simulated forest composition and structure of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest by the formind model in 2015 reflected the currently observed forest conditions moreover the simulated results with an nee of 0 3 0 6 t c ha yr in 2015 fig s6 indicated that currently the forest is still a carbon sink which agrees with the observations and other simulations at this forest site 0 3 1 8 t c ha yr guan et al 2006 saigusa et al 2013 tang et al 2009 wang et al 2006 xie et al 2020 moreover our simulated result is consistent with other studies in temperate forests worldwide for example a study of estimated nep which is generally considered to be close to nee from improved individual based forest ecosystem model forcchn showed that nep in mixed broadleaved coniferous forests from 1982 to 2011 were 0 4 t c ha yr zhao et al 2019 forest observation exhibited that the average nep for unmanaged temperate and boreal forests more than 200 years old was 1 3 0 6 t c ha yr indicating a slight net c sink gundersen et al 2021 which is close to our simulation result the above results confirmed that the formind model performs well in simulating the forest dynamics in the studied mixed broadleaved korean pine forest overall we found that both biomass and productivity of the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest will show an increasing trend under future climate change which is similar to the predicted results of other temperate forest in northeastern united states wang et al 2017 further supporting the promoting effects of climate warming on forest carbon accumulation our results revealed that there are divergent responses of the pfts to temperature and precipitation over the 21st century in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest the simulated agb of most pfts is generally more sensitive to temperature than to precipitation this is mainly due to the climate of the study site changbai mountain with low temperatures and abundant precipitation yang 1981 where tree growth is more responsive to temperature increases in our study we found that shade intolerant and shade tolerant pfts exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation but they showed opposite responses the shade tolerant pfts e g korean pine basswood gradually increased in agb with warming climate while the shade intolerant pfts such as birch aspen oak gradually decreased this discrepancy is related to the tree species biological traits which affect the species establishment and survival craine and dybzinski 2013 a tree s ability to increase its growth under more favorable climate is also confounded by its competition capability that varies significantly among species ford et al 2017 in our study area future increases in temperature and precipitation would create a more suitable environment for tree growth however the shade tolerant pfts with strong competitiveness will gain advantages over other pfts and occupy more space in particular recent studies based on both model simulation and tree chronology also confirmed that shade tolerant species such as korean pine was highly temperature sensitive and showed a positive relationship between radial growth and temperature lyu et al 2017 wang et al 2019 however because of the diminished available space and enhanced tree competition resulted from the growth and establishment in shade tolerant pfts agb of shade intolerant pfts with weak competitiveness suffers even though these pfts are also favored under the warming climate noteworthily moderate shade tolerant pfts such as ash and elm group exhibited lower sensitivity to temperature than precipitation and the simulated dynamics in their agb remain largely stable with slight fluctuations this is because their ecological niches are mostly in the middle between shade tolerant and shade intolerant pfts allowing them to be less sensitive to climate change therefore under anticipated climatic conditions in the future species composition in mixed broadleaved korean pine forest may tend to evolve towards increasing in shade tolerant pfts but decreasing shade intolerant pfts notably this change in forest composition is mainly caused by climate change rather than succession as the current forest i e mature forest dominated by mid to late successional species has been already in a stable state i e the successional climax under the current climate certainly drought induced by high temperature may limit the increase in forest biomass allen et al 2010 ma et al 2012 we found that ecosystem productivity exhibited a higher sensitivity to temperature than precipitation in the mixed broadleaved korean pine forest this is consistent with recent studies based on carbon flux observation yu et al 2008 yu et al 2005 which shows that the low temperature limits tree growth in this forest ecosystem future warming can prolong the growing season and increase tree photosynthesis thereby enhancing forest ecosystem productivity keenan et al 2014 oberbauer et al 2007 our simulation results also found that gpp will increase under future climate scenarios over the 21st century meanwhile our results also suggest that ecosystem respiration demonstrated a high sensitivity to temperature which is consistent with recent studies jiang et al 2005 wen et al 2006 yu et al 2005 we found that ecosystem respiration showed a gradual increase under the warming climate this is resulted from the elevated temperature that increases plant and soil respiration rates atkin and tjoelker 2003 davidson and janssens 2006 although increasing precipitation may increase soil water content promoting plant growth and soil respiration and thus increasing ecosystem gpp and respiration beer et al 2010 chen et al 2013 wang et al 2004 the intensity of the effect is relatively weak due to abundant precipitation in our study site we did not find synchronous response of gpp and respiration to climate change in this study instead we found that respiration increases more strongly than gpp photosynthesis under the warming climate this could lead to a reduced carbon sequestration and decreased nee which may even change the forest ecosystem from a carbon sink to a carbon source under the higher temperature increase scenarios thus the differences in the response and sensitivity of photosynthesis and respiration to climate change may alter future ecosystem carbon dynamics our study that evaluates and quantifies the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to climate change is crucial in predicting the evolution of ecosystems under future climate change under future warming and precipitation conditions our simulated results showed that the aboveground biomass of the forest increases over the 21st century accompanied by increases in abundance of shade tolerant tree species this suggests that forest demand of management for promoting shade tolerant species could be naturally met under the future climate conditions in our study area however there were some limitations in the model simulation for example the formind model we used can only simulate seed based tree regeneration without asexual reproduction which may partly limit the capability of the model when predicting future forest dynamics we will further explore and discuss these limitations in

24149,individual based model of the dynamics of population with non overlapping generation with explicitly introduced resources and unequal partitioning of them between competing individuals is analysed individual variability in assimilation of resources influences population persistence measured by population extinction time the case of small individual variability and short extinction time is considered to show how different ecological mechanisms can increase population persistence winter mortality various types of summer mortality metapopulation dynamics and continuous and seasonal resources mortality can increase population extinction time but in the case of individual variability it is important which individuals are subject to mortality most effective in increasing population persistence are environmental factors heterogeneity of environment and seasonality of resource dynamics keywords individual based model individual variability population extinction winter mortality summer mortality metapopulation seasonality of resources 1 introduction organisms that reproduce by budding or division at the onset of independent life have a body mass that is large compared to that of an adult individual organisms that reproduce sexually start life as a zygote that is very small compared to the body weight of an adult individual this also applies to those organisms that although they reproduce asexually the development of offspring begins with an unfertilised zygote consequently organisms that reproduce without zygotes by budding or by division undergo a short growth process compared to organisms that reproduce with zygotes there are also indications that there will be an evolutionary tendency for organisms that reproduce without zygotes to be small and have low body weight leaves of the common duckweed lemna minor floating on the surface of small water bodies and reproducing by budding take up light and nutrients with their surface while they utilize energy with the entire volume of the leaf if it is assumed that natural selection will optimise the amount of net energy gained per unit time per unit mass then it becomes apparent that the smaller the leaf the more efficient it is in obtaining energy from the environment uchmański et al 2009 a clone consisting of individuals reproducing by fission of the stylaria lacustris oligochaetes reaches its highest rate of exponential growth when the size of the individual is small and it divides into unequal parts greater one quickly reach a size where it can divide further for the smaller part takes longer to grow but since its whole organism is small it is also quickly ready for further division kaliszewicz et al 2005 stylaria lacustris is subject to predation by for example the larvae of the damselfly ischnura elegans or the tanyponid clinotanypus nervosus kaliszewicz 2003 these are not predators that eat their prey whole provided however that the prey is large enough they merely damage such prey and the prey is able to regenerate the lost parts predation pressure therefore means that stylaria lacustris is not as small as required to maximise the exponential growth rate of the clone but reaches a size that guarantees that it is only damaged by the predator and for the same reason divided equally organisms that reproduce without zygotes in which we will observe a tendency to be small and thus characterised by a short growth period will also have a short generation time populations of such organisms will rapidly grow exponentially and reach numbers leading to a demographic catastrophe uchmański et al 2006 at the end of the season the entire surface of small water bodies sheltered from the wind is repeatedly covered with a layer of lemna minor leaves also the population of stylaria lacustris not subjected to predation pressure reaches exponentially high numbers a means of surviving such demographic crises may be adaptations in individuals that result for example in the production of spore stages under adverse conditions stylaria lacustris in such situations which usually occur towards the end of the season switches to sexual reproduction and overwinters in the form of eggs produced from sexual reproduction availability of nutrients consumers of higher order or parasites are important ecological factor which can limit fast population increase of such organisms kutschera and niklas 2015 the short growth time resulting from the fact that with non zygotic reproduction an individual already has a fairly large body weight at the onset of growth results in little variability in the size of adult individuals they do not have time for individual differentiation to form as a result of interactions between individuals for example intraspecific competition for organisms developing from zygotes and characterised by a long period of individual growth such variability in body weights of competing individuals is well documented uchmański 1985 earlier works show that individual variability plays a key role in population persistence uchmański 1999 2000a 2000b grimm and uchmański 2002 the aim of this work is to identify using methods of individual based modelling the ecological mechanisms that allow populations of low variable individuals to survive the above demographic crises associated with rapid exponential population growth high abundance and depletion of resources the impact of following factors on the dynamics of such a population will be considered winter and summer mortality of different intensity and nature discontinuities in the dynamics of the resources used by the individuals and environmental heterogeneity i e the functioning of the system as a metapopulation 2 the model basic version the model describes the population dynamics of animals with non overlapping generations and the dynamics of resources available to them the life cycle of individuals starts at the beginning of the season they grow over the season and reproduce at the end of the season then they die juveniles overwinter and start growing at the beginning of the next season the individuals represent a parthenogenetic species the growth rate of an individual is assessed as the difference between the rate of resource assimilation and the rate with which these assimilated resources are used for living costs the rate of resource assimilation a and living costs as measured by the rate of respiration r are power functions of body weight w duncan and klekowski 1975 2 1 a a 1 w b 1 2 2 r a 2 w b 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b2 are parameters this gives the following equation of individual growth majkowski and uchmański 1980 2 3 d w d t a 1 w b 1 a 2 w b 2 the rate of asimilation depends on the amount of resources available the rate of assimilation a of a single individual isolated from interactions with other as a function of the amount of resources v can be described by the equation proposed by ivlev 1961 2 4 a a 1 m a x 1 e s v w b 1 where a 1 max is the maximal value of parameter a 1 reached when v and s is constant parameters describing the rate of reaching this maximal value however if individuals live together they may compete for resources we assume that this is a global competition each individual competes with all other individuals in the population by using the common resources this leads to uneven resource partitioning amongst competitors if individuals often compete then the individual who acquired more resources in the past will acquire more of them also in the future a good measure of the amount of resources acquired by an individual in the past accounting also for the energy costs of resource acquisition is its actual weight for this reason the rate of assimilation of an individual in the case of a group of competing individuals is described by eq 2 1 with additionally added dependence on the actual body weight of the individual according to the scheme below at each simulation step individuals with the lowest weight wmin and the highest weight wmax are identified the value of the parameter a 1 for the lightest individual is described as 2 5 a m i n a 1 m a x 1 e s m i n v and that of the heaviest individual as 2 6 a m a x a 1 m a x 1 e s m a x v the assimilation rates of individuals with intermediate weights are calculated by using interpolation between the values amin for wmin and amax for wmax the analysis of the weight distributions of growing and at the same time competing individuals shows that these distributions are positively skewed uchmański 1985 to obtain positively skewed weight distributions a linear or convex function should be used for the above interpolation uchmański 1985 1987 uchmański and dgebuadze 1990 the linear case has been chosen in the present model fig 1a between the values of constant parameters smin and smax of eqs 2 5 and 2 6 there is an inequality 2 7 s m i n s m a x when smin smax individuals in even aged population are equal assimilation of each individual depends in the same way on v when smin smax individuals differ in the rate of assimilation the degree of these differences increases with the increasing difference between smin and smax or decreasing v figs 1b and 1c however the differences disappear for v the greatest weight w at successive time steps of the simulation and at the end of growth w end has a hypothetical individual who is growing under conditions v 2 8 d w d t a 1 m a x w b 1 a 2 w b 2 the maximum final weight w end of an individual asymptotically reached when assimilation is equal to respiration for the growth described by eq 2 8 is 2 9 w e n d a 1 m a x a 2 1 b 2 b 1 an individual growing under condition when v after the end of growth will reach the weight wend w end the number of juveniles produced by an individual after the end of growth is proportional to the difference between its final weight and some threshold weight 2 10 z r o u n d c w e n d w f a k w e n d f o r w e n d w f a k w e n d 0 f o r w e n d w f a k w e n d where c is the parameter describing the intensity of juvenile production and wfak 0 wfak 1 says what part of the maximum end weight w end given by eq 2 9 is the threshold weight which allows the calculation of juvenile production by an individual individuals with body weights lower than or equal to the threshold weight die without producing progeny the function round rounds a real number to the nearest integer as the number of juveniles can only be a natural number the initial weights of juveniles of each individual are drawn from the normal distribution with a mean value w 0 mean and variance w 0 variance but only from the interval w 0 min w 0 max the number of individuals in the population nt 1 at generation t 1 conforms to the following equation 2 11 n t 1 i 1 n t z i where the summation is done over all nt individuals present in the population at generation t this was combined with the equation describing the resource dynamics 2 12 d v d t i 1 n t a i g where v is the amount of resources a i is the resource assimilation by the i th individual and g is the constant amount of resources added at each time step the summation is over all individuals actually present in the population the resources not consumed by individuals in the population will linearly increase at the initial time instant the population consisted of n 0 individuals and they had v 0 available resources their initial weights are taken from the normal distribution with the properties noted above the basic simulation step was that used for the calculation of the number of individuals in the population of successive generations however within each generation the equations describing the growth of individuals and the resource equation were solved by using the euler method in 80 smaller time steps this number of smaller steps allowed a good enough fitting of the numerical solutions to the analytical solutions of the growth eq 2 8 for an individual with the maximum weight weight increases at each smaller time step were calculated in the model with reference to the actual amount of resources available to individuals the changes in the amount of resources were also calculated in smaller time steps after the end of growth the number of juveniles for each individual was calculated their initial weights were assessed and the amount of resources available for the next generation was calculated with respect to its utilisation and supplementation during the previous one this allowed for the same calculations at successive time steps the simulation was stopped when nt 1 0 or vt 1 0 standard values of the parameters used in simulations are shown in table 1 the number dynamics described by the model presented in this chapter are characterised by oscillations in population number and resources which sooner or later lead to the extinction of the population at minimum number of individuals fig 2 a shows the mean from 100 simulations of extinction times of a single population for different ranges of values of the parameters smin and smax the remaining parameters had standard values table 1 fig 3 illustrates in more detail what the dynamics of population number looks like for selected areas of values of the parameters smin and smax in the upper left corner of the parameter space smin and smax the population number repeatedly goes through phases of increase and decrease without extinction on the time scale adopted in the simulations 1000 time steps in the lower right corner of the parameter space smin and smax the population goes extinct most often after the first maximum and this happens after only a few time steps for further analyses we selected a fragment of the parameter space from the bottom right corner of fig 2a it is shown in more detail in fig 2b also in this fragment of the parameter space the longest extinction times on average longer than ten time steps were observed in the top left corner an example of such population dynamics is shown in fig 4 a on the other hand the shortest extinction times equal to 7 time steps in the lower right corner of fig 2b this is illustrated in fig 4b 3 winter mortality the model analysed in this work describes a population with non overlapping generations the offspring produced at the end of a given generation by individuals that have reached a sufficient weight for reproduction constitute the population at the beginning of the next generation in the basic version of the model described in chapter 2 it was not assumed that these offspring were subject to mortality at the transition between two adjacent time steps before starting to grow in the next time step winter mortality was equal to 0 now winter mortality was assumed to be greater than 0 a parameter winter mortality was introduced into the model which is equal to the probability that an offspring produced in the previous generation will survive to the start of the next generation the winter mortality thus defined is random fig 5 a shows the parameter space of smin and smax for winter mortality 0 03 and fig 5b for winter mortality 0 49 an increase in winter mortality will clearly increase the extinction time of the population the nature of the population dynamics also changes fig 6 a illustrates an example of population dynamics for winter mortality 0 03 this is still the familiar from the basic version of the model transition of the number of individuals in the population through several phases of high number of individuals and its extinction in the phase of low population number fig 6b shows that for a much higher value of the parameter winter mortality we already have only a very slow increase in number of individuals which lasts hundreds of time step once the number of individuals reaches approximately the same value as its maximum value in the previous example simulation ends with the immediate extinction of the population further increases in winter mortality only result in a systematic decline in number of individuals to zero within just a few time steps fig 6c fig 7 shows the dependence of the average population extinction time on winter mortality these are the results from 100 repeated simulations for each value of the parameter winter mortality and for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 4 summer mortality 4 1 constant random summer mortality the growth of individuals at each of the large time steps in which the number of individuals in the population was calculated was simulated at 80 small time steps at each smaller time step an individual had probability equal to mort random that it would die and be removed from the population at that moment summer mortality defined in this way was at least an order of magnitude lower than winter mortality in the previous simulations as winter mortality was applied only once while summer mortality was applied multiple times as the individual grew fig 8 a shows the parameter space smin and smax for mort random 0 003 while fig 8b illustrates the same parameter space for mort random 0 008 fig 9 shows two examples of population dynamics for different values of mort random both figures qualitatively show a similar picture a population goes through two phases of high number before it goes extinct the difference is that although the numbers of individuals were similar at the maximum in both cases for the higher value of the mort random parameter the phase of increasing of number of individuals is very slow and extends over many tens of generations whereas for the lower value of mort random it lasts only about 10 generations fig 10 illustrates the dependence of the mean population extinction time on the value of the mort random parameter for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 4 2 summer mortality dependant on the weight of the individual the effect of summer mortality which depends on the weight of the growing individual was also tested at each smaller time step within each larger time step the smallest and largest weight of an individual was searched for the effect of mortality which was an increasing and decreasing function of the weight of the individual was tested in the first case it was assumed that the probability of death for the smallest weight was 0 003 and for the heaviest weight 0 008 in the second case the opposite assumption was made the probability of death for the smallest weight was 0 008 and for the heaviest weight 0 003 for intermediate weights the probability of death was assumed to be equal to the value resulting from a linear interpolation between the two points the extreme values of the probabilities of death had the same values as those applied in the previously described case of constant summer mortality despite the fact that in this previous case the population dynamics for the two extreme probabilities of death were different now in both cases with the probability of death linearly increasing and decreasing with individual weight the parameter space smin and smax had the same form and looked as in fig 8a the effect of weight dependant mortality was small over the entire range of parameter values smin and smax the mean population extinction times were slightly larger than then the largest value for the basic version of the model see fig 2b and its maximal values were around 20 time steps however there were differences in population dynamics between the versions of the model with increasing and decreasing probability of death fig 11 increasing probability leads to small maximum of the number of individuals and then systematic decrease to extinction fig 11a in the case of decreasing probability population goes through two high maxima befor extinction fig 11b 4 3 summer mortality due to slow growth at each smaller time step in which the weight of each individual was simulated the body weight of the individual was compared with the highest possible weight at this time step obtained from eq 2 8 if it was smaller than mort w where mort is a parameter with values 0 mort 1 this individual died and was removed from the population fig 12 a shows the parameter space of smin and smax for mort 0 65 fig 13 shows examples of population dynamics for such parameter values of smin and smax from fig 12a for which mean extinction times are large fig 13a smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 and small fig 13b smin 0 55 10 6 and smax 0 9 10 6 increasing the value of the parameter mort to 0 75 decreases the area covered by the highest population extinction times compared to the case mort 0 65 but at the same time increases slightly the average population extinction times in the rest of the parameter space fig 12b in particular in the bottom right corner of the parameter space the area with the lowest extinction times disappears fig 14 illustrates the dependence of the mean extinction time of a population on the value of the mort parameter for simulations with large extinction times smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 5 the dynamics of metapopulation in this version of the model the dynamics of two local populations were considered which were characterised by the same standard parameters and their dynamics were described by the model presented in section 2 at the beginning only one local habitat was inhabited the population size there was equal to n 0 in both local habitats the amount of resources at the start time was equal to v 0 at the end of each time step when progeny production for all individuals was calculated also candidates for migration were selected from the population the selection was random each individual was assigned the same probability p emig migrants moved to a neighbouring habitat if the neighbouring habitat was unoccupied the migrants reproduced there initiating a second local population if the neighbouring habitat was occupied the migrants died childless each local population sooner or later died out but it was relatively rare for this to happen simultaneously in both local habitats much more often a different situation occurred if the neighbouring population went extinct it was reconstituted with migrants from the settled habitat a metapopulation went extinct only when both local populations went extinct in the same time step fig 15 a illustrates the parameter space of smin and smax for p emig 0 01 fig 16 shows an example of population dynamics in both local habitats for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 fig 17 shows the relationship between the mean extinction time of a metapopulation and p emig for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 6 discontinuous resources in the initial version of the model see section 2 the dynamics of resources were described by a continuous function of time as it was explained earlier two time steps were used in the simulations the number of individuals in the population was described in large time steps generations and the small time steps contained within each large time step were used to simulate the growth of individuals and dynamics of resources during each small time step resources were consumed by growing individuals and renewed by some fixed amount resource continuity meant that the amount of resources that was available at the end of the previous generation was later the initial amount of resources in the next generation in the version of the model with discontinuous resources it was assumed that the resources at the beginning of the next generation vt 1 were given by the equation 6 1 v t 1 α v 0 where α is a fixed parameter which in the basic version of the model with discontinuous resources had a value of 1 this means that at the beginning of each generation the resources were renewed to their initial value and then consumed by growing individuals until the end of this generation fig 15b shows the parameter space smin and smax for α 1 0 fig 18 ilustrates the dynamics of number of individuals in the population and the resources for smin 0 48 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 and α 1 0 examples of population dynamics for three different values of the parameter α for smin 0 48 10 6 and smax 1 1 106 are shown in fig 19 7 discussion competition between individuals in an even aged population implies an unequal partitioning of resources between competing individuals łomnicki 1988 this occurs regardless of the nature of the competition process whether the competition is local or global harper 1977 scramble or contest nicholson 1954 some competitor will get more resources and another will get less we can find this out by observing the shapes of positively skewed weight distributions of individuals in even aged populations since the weight of an individual can be taken as a measure of its net energetic gains i e after deducting the energetic costs of obtaining these resources uchmański 1985 in the model presented in this work the parameters smin and smax are responsible for the differences in the amount of resources obtained by individuals an increase in the differences in the values of these parameters means an increase in the differences in the amount of resources obtained by individuals the behaviour of the single population dynamics model presented in this paper for different values of the above parameters is shown in fig 2a the bottom right corner of this parameter space represents cases when the variation in the amount of resources obtained by individuals is small in the upper left corner we have situations where these variations are large very little is known about the actual differences in the amounts of resources obtained by competing individuals traditionally ecologists are interested in the average values of what characterises individuals in a population it is therefore difficult to adjudicate what the ranges of values of the parameters smin and smax should be for real populations the results of the basic version of the individual based model of single population dynamics with non overlapping generations and explicitly introduced individual variability in the amounts of resources obtained which related the variation in weights of individuals and their offspring production show that the population dynamics depends on the degree of individual variability uchmański 1999 2000a 2000b grimm and uchmański 2002 if the individual variability in the amount of resources obtained is low the population number increases exponentially the rate of this increase decreases as the amount of resources in the environment decreases since all individuals are very similar the production of offspring of each individual is also almost the same and responds in the same way to changes in the level of resources an exponential increase in population number depletes the resources to such a level that no individual is able to produce offspring because they are all very similar the population goes extinct the number of generations after which this happens is usually very small it can be as low as several generations if on the other hand individuals differ in the amount of resources they acquire then at the time of the first demographic crisis when resource levels are so low that most individuals are unable to produce a single offspring there are individuals in the population that will be able to reproduce under these adverse conditions a population at minimum number does not go extinct since the population size is then low the resource has a chance to recover and the population begins another phase of exponential growth with sufficiently high levels of individual variability a population can repeatedly go through phases of exponential growth and then decline in number of course most often at one of the minimum it turns out that there is not a single individual in the population capable of reproduction and the population goes extinct but with a sufficiently high degree of individual variability the population can last for tens hundreds or even thousands of generations the number of generations after which a population goes extinct significantly depends on the degree of individual variability in the amount of food acquire by individuals in the basic version of the model used in this work which is identical to the model used in the previously cited works the resources had very specific and indeed very simple dynamics they were continuous if unexploited they grow linear and their growth was unlimited no matter what the rate of linear growth was in the case of low variable individuals the population reaches only one maximum the population number after an initial exponential growth reaches a maximum then continues to decline until it goes extinct how many generations it takes and what the population number is at the maximum in the case of low variable individuals depends on the rate of resource renewal if it is high the population lasts longer and reaches larger maximum number after a greater number of generations if the rate of resource renewal is low we observe an inverse relationship reaching a lower maximum earlier and also earlier extinction continuous and unlimited resource grow allows the population to recover quickly once it has reached a minimum number if there are conditions for this in the form of individuals capable of reproducing at that time on the other hand it encourages the population to reach such large numbers that the resource level drops to a value that leads to the next population minimum or its extinction the parameter values smin and smax used in the basic version of the model were chosen arbitrarily however since in this paper we are concerned with the cases derived from the lower right corner of the parameter spece smin and smax fig 2a we are interested in this paper in the dynamics of a single population whose individuals either do not compete or whose competition is very weak which leads to low individual variability of these individuals mortality whatever its nature acts as a factor retarding quick extinction of a population of low variable individuals the elimination of certain individuals from the population reduces the intensity of resource exploitation an increase in mortality causes a slower rate of resource depletion so that later resources reach a level at which individuals are able to produce only one offspring and later also a level of resources occurs at which no individual is able to produce a single offspring and the population goes extinct in all analysed model variants with different types of mortality only a moderate increase in mortality resulted in increased population persistence excessive mortality led to very rapid population extinction however as the simulation results show it is not indifferent to the population even when it consists of less variable individuals which of them and at what stage of their life cycle is eliminated from the population ovadia et al 2007 the model whose results are presented in this paper describes the case of a single population with non overlapping generations for example insects whose life cycle closes within one season a particularly effective factor that delays the extinction of a population is winter mortality a mechanism that causes only a random fraction of the offspring produced in the previous season to begin their life cycle in the next season individuals are eliminated before those that survive the winter begin to grow use resources and interact with the rest of the population the eliminated individuals neither consume resources nor affect the amount of resources obtained by the individuals that survived the winter already a few per cent winter mortality significantly extends the extinction time of the population even for such a low diversity population which without winter mortality is characterised by a single maximum in population number and then quickly goes extinct a few per cent winter mortality results in the appearance of several population maxima before the population goes extinct a winter mortality of ca 50 further extends the extinction time of the population fig 6b in this case we can clearly see the way in which mortality affects population dynamics we have in fact not several additional maxima of population number before the population goes extinct but a single maximum which builds up but very slowly before the population drops to zero after reaching the maximum summer mortality i e that which operates during the growth of individuals differs from winter mortality in that it concerns individuals that before they died used resources and interacted with other individuals also with those that will survive to the end of the season and produce offspring thus adversely affecting the amount of resources they obtained in different versions of the model with summer mortality individuals removed from the population were selected in different ways and stayed in the population for different lengths of time nevertheless summer mortality also increases the extinction time of the population the summer mortality associated with slow growth of individuals is most effective it removes individuals that are in a sense useless from the point of view of population dynamics because their growth is too slow and they offer no hope of being able to produce offspring at the end of the season this happens at the first symptoms of their slow growth by this point such individuals are present in the population consuming resources and interacting with other individuals which adversely affects the amount of resources obtained by the better individuals mortality associated with slow growth of individuals is especially beneficial for population dynamics when individuals are more variable because in such population there are candidates to be removed from the population see upper left corner of the parameter space in figs 12a and 12b in contrast for mortality associated with slow growth of individuals to have a beneficial effect on the dynamics of a population composed of low variable individuals its threshold needs to be shifted towards higher weights of individuals see bottom right corner of the parameter space in figs 12a and 12b with low variability of individuals the range of growth curves is narrow if the mortality threshold associated with poor growth of individuals is set too low all individuals survive and mortality of this type does not work the mortality threshold needs to be raised for there to be candidates for removal from the population in the upper left corner of the parameter space the situation is different here the variability of individuals is large enough the range of growth curves wide enough that at both threshold weights for survival used in these simulations there are individuals that are subject to elimination random summer mortality which does not depend on any characteristics of the individuals also increases population extinction times about the same as other types of mortality in the model presented in this paper it is rather strong factor because it operates at each small time step of simulation increasing its value yields even more increased population extinction times but points with longer extinction times are randomly scattered in the parameter space smin and smax this is probably due to the random nature of this mortality the same probability of being eliminated from the population is given to a slow growing individual in the initial growth phase such an event favours for longer population persistence as to a well growing individual in the final growth phase this event in turn favours for faster population extinction mortality linearly dependant on the weight of the growing individual slightly increased the extinction time of the population but the parameter spaces smin and smax look very similar in both cases when the probability of death was positively and negatively correlated with the weights of individuals this is probably due to the fact that in general a population with little individual variability in the weights of individuals was considered the two cases with negative and positive correlation of probability of death with weights of individuals did not then differ so significantly in the probabilities attributed to individuals as to reflect clearly on the nature of the population dynamics only small differences in population dynamics were found between the two versions of the model with this type of mortality for such parameter values smin and smax which correspond to higher individual variability upper left corner of parameter space then the version of the model with the probability of death negatively correlated with the weight of the individual has a slightly higher population extinction time this is because in this version of the model individuals with a low chance of reproduction are removed from the population in the version with positive correlation individuals that are potentially able to reproduce are removed and this increases the chance of population extinction the mechanisms analysed so far to increase the extinction time of populations have tended to result from biological interactions occurring within populations and possibly from interactions with other biological components of the ecological system in light of the consideration of the importance of different mortality variants for population persistence the question of what influence the presence of predators may have on this remains somewhat unsatisfactory to some extent the versions of the model with different kinds of mortality answer this question the presence of predators will cause mortality primarily summer mortality it may be random mortality but may also depend variously on the weight of the prey or on the condition of the prey as determined by how much food it acquires and how it grows it would probably also need to take into account that predation pressure is positively correlated with the number of prey such a variant of mortality was not considered in this paper as this would have required constructing a much more elaborate version of the model and deciding which of its many possible variants to allocate for further analysis new possibilities for increasing the persistence of populations are provided by changes in the nature of the environment in which individuals of the population live if the environment is spatially heterogeneous and offers individuals island like areas in which the population can expand if initiated by migrating individuals this greatly increases the persistence of the population functioning as a metapopulation in this work a very simplified model of metapopulation dynamics was presented the environment consisted of only two local habitats and migration candidates were selected randomly from the local population this already made it possible to obtain long extinction times for the entire metapopulation with sufficiently high migration probabilities an earlier publication uchmański 2016 which used the same local population model as the one presented in chapter 5 shows that the persistence of a metapopulation as measured by its extinction time increases with an increase in the number of local habitats in addition to this the persistence of a metapopulation depends on how candidates for migration are selected in the earlier publication in addition to the random recruitment of individuals into the migrant category the case was analysed when the migrants were those individuals that were unable to reproduce due to poor growth or when the strongest competitors migrated but only when the local population was facing extinction in the generation all these variants of metapopulation functioning increased the persistence of the metapopulation although each to a slightly different degree it is of course conceivable that the above mechanisms different types of mortality together with environmental heterogeneity acting together will have an even stronger positive effect on the persistence of a low variable population the type of resources used by individuals in the population also falls into the category of environmental factors in the basic version of the model presented in this work these were continuous resources that unexploited grew linearly and indefinitely if we replace them by resources with discontinuous dynamics renewed at the beginning of each generation we obtain population dynamics of a completely different nature the population size initially increases only to fluctuate more or less at a certain level later on at the same time the problem of population extinction disappears the population persists this is reminiscent of the classic case of what is traditionally called population regulation in ecology the ideal exemplification of which is the population density dynamics obtained as solutions of the logistic equation in the model analysed in this work such dynamics are the result of two factors firstly it is influenced by the nature of the resource dynamics at the beginning of each generation individuals are offered the same portion of the resources they decrease over the course of each generation as resources are consumed by growing individuals secondly it is important to note that we are dealing with a model in which individuals are individually assigned the amount of resources in the initial generations when the population number increases the amount of resources at the end of time steps decreases this is because the resources at the beginning of the generation are always the same and population number initially increases thus the decreasing resources in the end of successive generations gradually forms a more or less constant hierarchy of individuals even if there is little individual variability a kind of equilibrium is established between the number of individuals in the population at the end of each generation the amount of resources renewed at the beginning of each generation and their dynamics during the season as a result from a certain generation onwards the level of resources at the end of generation starts to be similar so the growth of individuals in the following seasons follows a similar pattern and similar number of individuals reproduce at the end of generation the population number settles at a similar level in subsequent generations its fluctuations are greater for greater value of resources at the beginning of each generations fig 19 it is due to a less pronounced hierarchy of individuals because in better resource conditions the individual variability is smaller when individual variability is higher e g for smaller values of α parameter and therefore the hierarchy of individuals in terms of resource acquisition more pronounced fluctuations in number will be smaller what ecological situation does this last version of the model mimic in which resources are discontinuous well it appears to be a model of population dynamics with non overlapping generations in an environment with clearly marked seasonality 8 conclusions the lack of intraspecies competition in other words the low variability of individuals in a population combined with a type of resources that when not exploited are characterised by unlimited growth is not conducive to population persistence on the other hand competition between individuals which ensures much greater population persistence implies individual variability and this in turn has a high demographic cost someone will survive and another will not someone will have offspring and another will die childless increasing the persistence of a population composed of weakly competing individuals without a significant increase in demographic costs can be achieved by introducing it into a spatially heterogeneous environment and turning the system into a metapopulation this will of course be true provided that migration between local habitats does not involve increased mortality of migrating individuals however any local population will still be at risk of extinction but the persistence of the whole metapopulation is significantly increased other ways of increasing the persistence of low diversity populations come at a significant demographic cost this is particularly clear in the case of triggering different types of mortality each of which regardless of how it works only delays the extinction of the population a radical way to make populations of little variable individuals a persistent system is to change the nature of the resource dynamics and turn them into a renewable resource each generation in a sense this constantly activates in a population of less variable individuals those mechanisms that govern the dynamics of a population composed of more variable individuals but with resources of continuous and unlimited growth in the latter case the mechanism to ensure population persistence is triggered when resources reach minimum now when the resources are renewed to the same level at each generation this mechanism works at each time step even if the individual variability is small however due to the much higher level of renewed resources than their minimum value in the continuous resource model the nature of the number dynamics will be different we will get smaller or larger fluctuations around a certain level of population number rather than dynamics that involve going through successive phases of increase and decrease in population number creditt author statement there are no credits related to this text declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

summer mortality metapopulation seasonality of resources 1 introduction organisms that reproduce by budding or division at the onset of independent life have a body mass that is large compared to that of an adult individual organisms that reproduce sexually start life as a zygote that is very small compared to the body weight of an adult individual this also applies to those organisms that although they reproduce asexually the development of offspring begins with an unfertilised zygote consequently organisms that reproduce without zygotes by budding or by division undergo a short growth process compared to organisms that reproduce with zygotes there are also indications that there will be an evolutionary tendency for organisms that reproduce without zygotes to be small and have low body weight leaves of the common duckweed lemna minor floating on the surface of small water bodies and reproducing by budding take up light and nutrients with their surface while they utilize energy with the entire volume of the leaf if it is assumed that natural selection will optimise the amount of net energy gained per unit time per unit mass then it becomes apparent that the smaller the leaf the more efficient it is in obtaining energy from the environment uchmański et al 2009 a clone consisting of individuals reproducing by fission of the stylaria lacustris oligochaetes reaches its highest rate of exponential growth when the size of the individual is small and it divides into unequal parts greater one quickly reach a size where it can divide further for the smaller part takes longer to grow but since its whole organism is small it is also quickly ready for further division kaliszewicz et al 2005 stylaria lacustris is subject to predation by for example the larvae of the damselfly ischnura elegans or the tanyponid clinotanypus nervosus kaliszewicz 2003 these are not predators that eat their prey whole provided however that the prey is large enough they merely damage such prey and the prey is able to regenerate the lost parts predation pressure therefore means that stylaria lacustris is not as small as required to maximise the exponential growth rate of the clone but reaches a size that guarantees that it is only damaged by the predator and for the same reason divided equally organisms that reproduce without zygotes in which we will observe a tendency to be small and thus characterised by a short growth period will also have a short generation time populations of such organisms will rapidly grow exponentially and reach numbers leading to a demographic catastrophe uchmański et al 2006 at the end of the season the entire surface of small water bodies sheltered from the wind is repeatedly covered with a layer of lemna minor leaves also the population of stylaria lacustris not subjected to predation pressure reaches exponentially high numbers a means of surviving such demographic crises may be adaptations in individuals that result for example in the production of spore stages under adverse conditions stylaria lacustris in such situations which usually occur towards the end of the season switches to sexual reproduction and overwinters in the form of eggs produced from sexual reproduction availability of nutrients consumers of higher order or parasites are important ecological factor which can limit fast population increase of such organisms kutschera and niklas 2015 the short growth time resulting from the fact that with non zygotic reproduction an individual already has a fairly large body weight at the onset of growth results in little variability in the size of adult individuals they do not have time for individual differentiation to form as a result of interactions between individuals for example intraspecific competition for organisms developing from zygotes and characterised by a long period of individual growth such variability in body weights of competing individuals is well documented uchmański 1985 earlier works show that individual variability plays a key role in population persistence uchmański 1999 2000a 2000b grimm and uchmański 2002 the aim of this work is to identify using methods of individual based modelling the ecological mechanisms that allow populations of low variable individuals to survive the above demographic crises associated with rapid exponential population growth high abundance and depletion of resources the impact of following factors on the dynamics of such a population will be considered winter and summer mortality of different intensity and nature discontinuities in the dynamics of the resources used by the individuals and environmental heterogeneity i e the functioning of the system as a metapopulation 2 the model basic version the model describes the population dynamics of animals with non overlapping generations and the dynamics of resources available to them the life cycle of individuals starts at the beginning of the season they grow over the season and reproduce at the end of the season then they die juveniles overwinter and start growing at the beginning of the next season the individuals represent a parthenogenetic species the growth rate of an individual is assessed as the difference between the rate of resource assimilation and the rate with which these assimilated resources are used for living costs the rate of resource assimilation a and living costs as measured by the rate of respiration r are power functions of body weight w duncan and klekowski 1975 2 1 a a 1 w b 1 2 2 r a 2 w b 2 where a 1 a 2 b 1 and b2 are parameters this gives the following equation of individual growth majkowski and uchmański 1980 2 3 d w d t a 1 w b 1 a 2 w b 2 the rate of asimilation depends on the amount of resources available the rate of assimilation a of a single individual isolated from interactions with other as a function of the amount of resources v can be described by the equation proposed by ivlev 1961 2 4 a a 1 m a x 1 e s v w b 1 where a 1 max is the maximal value of parameter a 1 reached when v and s is constant parameters describing the rate of reaching this maximal value however if individuals live together they may compete for resources we assume that this is a global competition each individual competes with all other individuals in the population by using the common resources this leads to uneven resource partitioning amongst competitors if individuals often compete then the individual who acquired more resources in the past will acquire more of them also in the future a good measure of the amount of resources acquired by an individual in the past accounting also for the energy costs of resource acquisition is its actual weight for this reason the rate of assimilation of an individual in the case of a group of competing individuals is described by eq 2 1 with additionally added dependence on the actual body weight of the individual according to the scheme below at each simulation step individuals with the lowest weight wmin and the highest weight wmax are identified the value of the parameter a 1 for the lightest individual is described as 2 5 a m i n a 1 m a x 1 e s m i n v and that of the heaviest individual as 2 6 a m a x a 1 m a x 1 e s m a x v the assimilation rates of individuals with intermediate weights are calculated by using interpolation between the values amin for wmin and amax for wmax the analysis of the weight distributions of growing and at the same time competing individuals shows that these distributions are positively skewed uchmański 1985 to obtain positively skewed weight distributions a linear or convex function should be used for the above interpolation uchmański 1985 1987 uchmański and dgebuadze 1990 the linear case has been chosen in the present model fig 1a between the values of constant parameters smin and smax of eqs 2 5 and 2 6 there is an inequality 2 7 s m i n s m a x when smin smax individuals in even aged population are equal assimilation of each individual depends in the same way on v when smin smax individuals differ in the rate of assimilation the degree of these differences increases with the increasing difference between smin and smax or decreasing v figs 1b and 1c however the differences disappear for v the greatest weight w at successive time steps of the simulation and at the end of growth w end has a hypothetical individual who is growing under conditions v 2 8 d w d t a 1 m a x w b 1 a 2 w b 2 the maximum final weight w end of an individual asymptotically reached when assimilation is equal to respiration for the growth described by eq 2 8 is 2 9 w e n d a 1 m a x a 2 1 b 2 b 1 an individual growing under condition when v after the end of growth will reach the weight wend w end the number of juveniles produced by an individual after the end of growth is proportional to the difference between its final weight and some threshold weight 2 10 z r o u n d c w e

maximum end weight w end given by eq 2 9 is the threshold weight which allows the calculation of juvenile production by an individual individuals with body weights lower than or equal to the threshold weight die without producing progeny the function round rounds a real number to the nearest integer as the number of juveniles can only be a natural number the initial weights of juveniles of each individual are drawn from the normal distribution with a mean value w 0 mean and variance w 0 variance but only from the interval w 0 min w 0 max the number of individuals in the population nt 1 at generation t 1 conforms to the following equation 2 11 n t 1 i 1 n t z i where the summation is done over all nt individuals present in the population at generation t this was combined with the equation describing the resource dynamics 2 12 d v d t i 1 n t a i g where v is the amount of resources a i is the resource assimilation by the i th individual and g is the constant amount of resources added at each time step the summation is over all individuals actually present in the population the resources not consumed by individuals in the population will linearly increase at the initial time instant the population consisted of n 0 individuals and they had v 0 available resources their initial weights are taken from the normal distribution with the properties noted above the basic simulation step was that used for the calculation of the number of individuals in the population of successive generations however within each generation the equations describing the growth of individuals and the resource equation were solved by using the euler method in 80 smaller time steps this number of smaller steps allowed a good enough fitting of the numerical solutions to the analytical solutions of the growth eq 2 8 for an individual with the maximum weight weight increases at each smaller time step were calculated in the model with reference to the actual amount of resources available to individuals the changes in the amount of resources were also calculated in smaller time steps after the end of growth the number of juveniles for each individual was calculated their initial weights were assessed and the amount of resources available for the next generation was calculated with respect to its utilisation and supplementation during the previous one this allowed for the same calculations at successive time steps the simulation was stopped when nt 1 0 or vt 1 0 standard values of the parameters used in simulations are shown in table 1 the number dynamics described by the model presented in this chapter are characterised by oscillations in population number and resources which sooner or later lead to the extinction of the population at minimum number of individuals fig 2 a shows the mean from 100 simulations of extinction times of a single population for different ranges of values of the parameters smin and smax the remaining parameters had standard values table 1 fig 3 illustrates in more detail what the dynamics of population number looks like for selected areas of values of the parameters smin and smax in the upper left corner of the parameter space smin and smax the population number repeatedly goes through phases of increase and decrease without extinction on the time scale adopted in the simulations 1000 time steps in the lower right corner of the parameter space smin and smax the population goes extinct most often after the first maximum and this happens after only a few time steps for further analyses we selected a fragment of the parameter space from the bottom right corner of fig 2a it is shown in more detail in fig 2b also in this fragment of the parameter space the longest extinction times on average longer than ten time steps were observed in the top left corner an example of such population dynamics is shown in fig 4 a on the other hand the shortest extinction times equal to 7 time steps in the lower right corner of fig 2b this is illustrated in fig 4b 3 winter mortality the model analysed in this work describes a population with non overlapping generations the offspring produced at the end of a given generation by individuals that have reached a sufficient weight for reproduction constitute the population at the beginning of the next generation in the basic version of the model described in chapter 2 it was not assumed that these offspring were subject to mortality at the transition between two adjacent time steps before starting to grow in the next time step winter mortality was equal to 0 now winter mortality was assumed to be greater than 0 a parameter winter mortality was introduced into the model which is equal to the probability that an offspring produced in the previous generation will survive to the start of the next generation the winter mortality thus defined is random fig 5 a shows the parameter space of smin and smax for winter mortality 0 03 and fig 5b for winter mortality 0 49 an increase in winter mortality will clearly increase the extinction time of the population the nature of the population dynamics also changes fig 6 a illustrates an example of population dynamics for winter mortality 0 03 this is still the familiar from the basic version of the model transition of the number of individuals in the population through several phases of high number of individuals and its extinction in the phase of low population number fig 6b shows that for a much higher value of the parameter winter mortality we already have only a very slow increase in number of individuals which lasts hundreds of time step once the number of individuals reaches approximately the same value as its maximum value in the previous example simulation ends with the immediate extinction of the population further increases in winter mortality only result in a systematic decline in number of individuals to zero within just a few time steps fig 6c fig 7 shows the dependence of the average population extinction time on winter mortality these are the results from 100 repeated simulations for each value of the parameter winter mortality and for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 4 summer mortality 4 1 constant random summer mortality the growth of individuals at each of the large time steps in which the number of individuals in the population was calculated was simulated at 80 small time steps at each smaller time step an individual had probability equal to mort random that it would die and be removed from the population at that moment summer mortality defined in this way was at least an order of magnitude lower than winter mortality in the previous simulations as winter mortality was applied only once while summer mortality was applied multiple times as the individual grew fig 8 a shows the parameter space smin and smax for mort random 0 003 while fig 8b illustrates the same parameter space for mort random 0 008 fig 9 shows two examples of population dynamics for different values of mort random both figures qualitatively show a similar picture a population goes through two phases of high number before it goes extinct the difference is that although the numbers of individuals were similar at the maximum in both cases for the higher value of the mort random parameter the phase of increasing of number of individuals is very slow and extends over many tens of generations whereas for the lower value of mort random it lasts only about 10 generations fig 10 illustrates the dependence of the mean population extinction time on the value of the mort random parameter for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 4 2 summer mortality dependant on the weight of the individual the effect of summer mortality which depends on the weight of the growing individual was also tested at each smaller time step within each larger time step the smallest and largest weight of an individual was searched for the effect of mortality which was an increasing and decreasing function of the weight of the individual was tested in the first case it was assumed that the probability of death for the smallest weight was 0 003 and for the heaviest weight 0 008 in the second case the opposite assumption was made the probability of death for the smallest weight was 0 008 and for the heaviest weight 0 003 for intermediate weights the probability of death was assumed to be equal to the value resulting from a linear interpolation between the two points the extreme values of the probabilities of death had the same values as those applied in the previously described case of constant summer mortality despite the fact that in this previous case the population dynamics for the two extreme probabilities of death were different now in both cases with the probability of death linearly increasing and decreasing with individual weight the parameter space smin and smax had the same form and looked as in fig 8a the effect of weight dependant mortality was small over the entire range of parameter values smin and smax the mean population extinction times were slightly larger than then the largest value for the basic version of the model see fig 2b and its maximal values were around 20 time steps however there were differences in population dynamics between the versions of the model with increasing and decreasing probability of death fig 11 increasing probability leads to small maximum of the number of individuals and then systematic decrease to extinction fig 11a in the case of decreasing probability population goes through two high maxima befor extinction fig 11b 4 3 summer mortality due to slow growth at each smaller time step in which the weight of each individual was simulated the body weight of the individual was compared with the highest possible weight at this time step obtained from eq 2 8 if it was smaller than mort w where mort is a parameter with values 0 mort 1 this individual died and was removed from the population fig 12 a shows the parameter space of smin and smax for mort 0 65 fig 13 shows examples of population dynamics for such parameter values of smin and smax from fig 12a for which mean extinction times are large fig 13a smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 and small fig 13b smin 0 55 10 6 and smax 0 9 10 6 increasing the value of the parameter mort to 0 75 decreases the area covered by the highest population extinction times compared to the case mort 0 65 but at the same time increases slightly the average population extinction times in the rest of the parameter space fig 12b in particular in the bottom right corner of the parameter space the area with the lowest extinction times disappears fig 14 illustrates the dependence of the mean extinction time of a population on the value of the mort parameter for simulations with large extinction times smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 5 the dynamics of metapopulation in this version of the model the dynamics of two local populations were considered which were characterised by the same standard parameters and their dynamics were described by the model presented in section 2 at the beginning only one local habitat was inhabited the population size there was equal to n 0 in both local habitats the amount of resources at the start time was equal to v 0 at the end of each time step when progeny production for all individuals was calculated also candidates for migration were selected from the population the selection was random each individual was assigned the same probability p emig migrants moved to a neighbouring habitat if the neighbouring habitat was unoccupied the migrants reproduced there initiating a second local population if the neighbouring habitat was occupied the migrants died childless each local population sooner or later died out but it was relatively rare for this to happen simultaneously in both local habitats much more often a different situation occurred if the neighbouring population went extinct it was reconstituted with migrants from the settled habitat a metapopulation went extinct only when both local populations went extinct in the same time step fig 15 a illustrates the parameter space of smin and smax for p emig 0 01 fig 16 shows an example of population dynamics in both local habitats for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 fig 17 shows the relationship between the mean extinction time of a metapopulation and p emig for smin 0 49 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 6 discontinuous resources in the initial version of the model see section 2 the dynamics of resources were described by a continuous function of time as it was explained earlier two time steps were used in the simulations the number of individuals in the population was described in large time steps generations and the small time steps contained within each large time step were used to simulate the growth of individuals and dynamics of resources during each small time step resources were consumed by growing individuals and renewed by some fixed amount resource continuity meant that the amount of resources that was available at the end of the previous generation was later the initial amount of resources in the next generation in the version of the model with discontinuous resources it was assumed that the resources at the beginning of the next generation vt 1 were given by the equation 6 1 v t 1 α v 0 where α is a fixed parameter which in the basic version of the model with discontinuous resources had a value of 1 this means that at the beginning of each generation the resources were renewed to their initial value and then consumed by growing individuals until the end of this generation fig 15b shows the parameter space smin and smax for α 1 0 fig 18 ilustrates the dynamics of number of individuals in the population and the resources for smin 0 48 10 6 and smax 1 1 10 6 and α 1 0 examples of population dynamics for three different values of the parameter α for smin 0 48 10 6 and smax 1 1 106 are shown in fig 19 7 discussion competition between individuals in an even aged population implies an unequal partitioning of resources between competing individuals łomnicki 1988 this occurs regardless of the nature of the competition process whether the competition is local or global harper 1977 scramble or contest nicholson 1954 some competitor will get more resources and another will get less we can find this out by observing the shapes of positively skewed weight distributions of individuals in even aged populations since the weight of an individual can be taken as a measure of its net energetic gains i e after deducting the energetic costs of obtaining these resources uchmański 1985 in the model presented in this work the parameters smin and smax are responsible for the differences in the amount of resources obtained by individuals an increase in the differences in the values of these parameters means an increase in the differences in the amount of resources obtained by individuals the behaviour of the single population dynamics model presented in this paper for different values of the above parameters is shown in fig 2a the bottom right corner of this parameter space represents cases when the variation in the amount of resources obtained by individuals is small in the upper left corner we have situations where these variations are large very little is known about the actual differences in the amounts of resources obtained by competing individuals traditionally ecologists are interested in the average values of what characterises individuals in a population it is therefore difficult to adjudicate what the ranges of values of the parameters smin and smax should be for real populations the results of the basic version of the individual based model of single population dynamics with non overlapping generations and explicitly introduced individual variability in the amounts of resources obtained which related the variation in weights of individuals and their offspring production show that the population dynamics depends on the degree of individual variability uchmański 1999 2000a 2000b grimm and uchmański 2002 if the individual variability in the amount of resources obtained is low the population number increases exponentially the rate of this increase decreases as the amount of resources in the environment decreases since all individuals are very similar the production of offspring of each individual is also almost the same and responds in the same way to changes in the level of resources an exponential increase in population number depletes the resources to such a level that no individual is able to produce offspring because they are all very similar the population goes extinct the number of generations after which this happens is usually very small it can be as low as several generations if on the other hand individuals differ in the amount of resources they acquire then at the time of the first demographic crisis when resource levels are so low that most individuals are unable to produce a single offspring there are individuals in the population that will be able to reproduce under these adverse conditions a population at minimum number does not go extinct since the population size is then low the resource has a chance to recover and the population begins another phase of exponential growth with sufficiently high levels of individual variability a population can repeatedly go through phases of exponential growth and then decline in number of course most often at one of the minimum it turns out that there is not a single individual in the population capable of reproduction and the population goes extinct but with a sufficiently high degree of individual variability the population can last for tens hundreds or even thousands of generations the number of generations after which a population goes extinct significantly depends on the degree of individual variability in the amount of food acquire by individuals in the basic version of the model used in this work which is identical to the model used in the previously cited works the resources had very specific and indeed very simple dynamics they were continuous if unexploited they grow linear and their growth was unlimited no matter what the rate of linear growth was in the case of low variable individuals the population reaches only one maximum the population number after an initial exponential growth reaches a maximum then continues to decline until it goes extinct how many generations it takes and what the population number is at the maximum in the case of low variable individuals depends on the rate of resource renewal if it is high the population lasts longer and reaches larger maximum number after a greater number of generations if the rate of resource renewal is low we observe an inverse relationship reaching a lower maximum earlier and also earlier extinction continuous and unlimited resource grow allows the population to recover quickly once it has reached a minimum number if there are conditions for this in the form of individuals capable of reproducing at that time on the other hand it encourages the population to reach such large numbers that the resource level drops to a value that leads to the next population minimum or its extinction the parameter values smin and smax used in the basic version of the model were chosen arbitrarily however since in this paper we are concerned with the cases derived from the lower right corner of the parameter spece smin and smax fig 2a we are interested in this paper in the dynamics of a single population whose individuals either do not compete or whose competition is very weak which leads to low individual variability of these individuals mortality whatever its nature acts as a factor retarding quick extinction of a population of low variable individuals the elimination of certain individuals from the population reduces the intensity of resource exploitation an increase in mortality causes a slower rate of resource depletion so that later resources reach a level at which individuals are able to produce only one offspring and later also a level of resources occurs at which no individual is able to produce a single offspring and the population goes extinct in all analysed model variants with different types of mortality only a moderate increase in mortality resulted in increased population persistence excessive mortality led to very rapid population extinction however as the simulation results show it is not indifferent to the population even when it consists of less variable individuals which of them and at what stage of their life cycle is eliminated from the population ovadia et al 2007 the model whose results are presented in this paper describes the case of a single population with non overlapping generations for example insects whose life cycle closes within one season a particularly effective factor that delays the extinction of a population is winter mortality a mechanism that causes only a random fraction of the offspring produced in the previous season to begin their life cycle in the next season individuals are eliminated before those that survive the winter begin to grow use resources and interact with the rest of the population the eliminated individuals neither consume resources nor affect the amount of resources obtained by the individuals that survived the winter already a few per cent winter mortality significantly extends the extinction time of the population even for such a low diversity population which without winter mortality is characterised by a single maximum in population number and then quickly goes extinct a few per cent winter mortality results in the appearance of several population maxima before the population goes extinct a winter mortality of ca 50 further extends the extinction time of the population fig 6b in this case we can clearly see the way in which mortality affects population dynamics we have in fact not several additional maxima of population number before the population goes extinct but a single maximum which builds up but very slowly before the population drops to zero after reaching the maximum summer mortality i e that which operates during the growth of individuals differs from winter mortality in that it concerns individuals that before they died used resources and interacted with other individuals also with those that will survive to the end of the season and produce offspring thus adversely affecting the amount of resources they obtained in different versions of the model with summer mortality individuals removed from the population were selected in different ways and stayed in the population for different lengths of time nevertheless summer mortality also increases the extinction time of the population the summer mortality associated with slow growth of individuals is most effective it removes individuals that are in a sense useless from the point of view of population dynamics because their growth is too slow and they offer no hope of being able to produce offspring at the end of the season this happens at the first symptoms of their slow growth by this point such individuals are present in the population consuming resources and interacting with other individuals which adversely affects the amount of resources obtained by the better individuals mortality associated with slow growth of individuals is especially beneficial for population dynamics when individuals are more variable because in such population there are candidates to be removed from the population see upper left corner of the parameter space in figs 12a and 12b in contrast for mortality associated with slow growth of individuals to have a beneficial effect on the dynamics of a population composed of low variable individuals its threshold needs to be shifted towards higher weights of individuals see bottom right corner of the parameter space in figs 12a and 12b with low variability of individuals the range of growth curves is narrow if the mortality threshold associated with poor growth of individuals is set too low all individuals survive and mortality of this type does not work the mortality threshold needs to be raised for there to be candidates for removal from the population in the upper left corner of the parameter space the situation is different here the variability of individuals is large enough the range of growth curves wide enough that at both threshold weights for survival used in these simulations there are individuals that are subject to elimination random summer mortality which does not depend on any characteristics of the individuals also increases population extinction times about the same as other types of mortality in the model presented in this paper it is rather strong factor because it operates at each small time step of simulation increasing its value yields even more increased population extinction times but points with longer extinction times are randomly scattered in the parameter space smin and smax this is probably due to the random nature of this mortality the same probability of being eliminated from the population is given to a slow growing individual in the initial growth phase such an event favours for longer population persistence as to a well growing individual in the final growth phase this event in turn favours for faster population extinction mortality linearly dependant on the weight of the growing individual slightly increased the extinction time of the population but the parameter spaces smin and smax look very similar in both cases when the probability of death was positively and negatively correlated with the weights of individuals this is probably due to the fact that in general a population with little individual variability in the weights of individuals was considered the two cases with negative and positive correlation of probability of death with weights of individuals did not then differ so significantly in the probabilities attributed to individuals as to reflect clearly on the nature of the population dynamics only small differences in population dynamics were found between the two versions of the model with this type of mortality for such parameter values smin and smax which correspond to higher individual variability upper left corner of parameter space then the version of the model with the probability of death negatively correlated with the weight of the individual has a slightly higher population extinction time this is because in this version of the model individuals with a low chance of reproduction are removed from the population in the version with positive correlation individuals that are potentially able to reproduce are removed and this increases the chance of population extinction the mechanisms analysed so far to increase the extinction time of populations have tended to result from biological interactions occurring within populations and possibly from interactions with other biological components of the ecological system in light of the consideration of the importance of different mortality variants for population persistence the question of what influence the presence of predators may have on this remains somewhat unsatisfactory to some extent the versions of the model with different kinds of mortality answer this question the presence of predators will cause mortality primarily summer mortality it may be random mortality but may also depend variously on the weight of the prey or on the condition of the prey as determined by how much food it acquires and how it grows it would probably also need to take into account that predation pressure is positively correlated with the number of prey such a variant of mortality was not considered in this paper as this would have required constructing a much more elaborate version of the model and deciding which of its many possible variants to allocate for further analysis new possibilities for increasing the persistence of populations are provided by changes in the nature of the environment in which individuals of the population live if the environment is spatially heterogeneous and offers individuals island like areas in which the population can expand if initiated by migrating individuals this greatly increases the persistence of the population functioning as a metapopulation in this work a very simplified model of metapopulation dynamics was presented the environment consisted of only two local habitats and migration candidates were selected randomly from the local population this already made it possible to obtain long extinction times for the entire metapopulation with sufficiently high migration probabilities an earlier publication uchmański 2016 which used the same local population model as the one presented in chapter 5 shows that the persistence of a metapopulation as measured by its extinction time increases with an increase in the number of local habitats in addition to this the persistence of a metapopulation depends on how candidates for migration are selected in the earlier publication in addition to the random recruitment of individuals into the migrant category the case was analysed when the migrants were those individuals that were unable to reproduce due to poor growth or when the strongest competitors migrated but only when the local population was facing extinction in the generation all these variants of metapopulation functioning increased the persistence of the metapopulation although each to a slightly different degree it is of course conceivable that the above mechanisms different types of mortality together with environmental heterogeneity acting together will have an even stronger positive effect on the persistence of a low variable population the type of resources used by individuals in the population also falls into the category of environmental factors in the basic version of the model presented in this work these were continuous resources that unexploited grew linearly and indefinitely if we replace them by resources with discontinuous dynamics renewed at the beginning of each generation we obtain population dynamics of a completely different nature the population size initially increases only to fluctuate more or less at a certain level later on at the same time the problem of population extinction disappears the population persists this is reminiscent of the classic case of what is traditionally called population regulation in ecology the ideal exemplification of which is the population density dynamics obtained as solutions of the logistic equation in the model analysed in this work such dynamics are the result of two factors firstly it is influenced by the nature of the resource dynamics at the beginning of each generation individuals are offered the same portion of the resources they decrease over the course of each generation as resources are consumed by growing individuals secondly it is important to note that we are dealing with a model in which individuals are individually assigned the amount of resources in the initial generations when the population number increases the amount of resources at the end of time steps decreases this is because the resources at the beginning of the generation are always the same and population number initially increases thus the decreasing resources in the end of successive generations gradually forms a more or less constant hierarchy of individuals even if there is little individual variability a kind of equilibrium is established between the number of individuals in the population at the end of each generation the amount of resources renewed at the beginning of each generation and their dynamics during the season as a result from a certain generation onwards the level of resources at the end of generation starts to be similar so the growth of individuals in the following seasons follows a similar pattern and similar number of individuals reproduce at the end of generation the population number settles at a similar level in subsequent generations its fluctuations are greater for greater value of resources at the beginning of each generations fig 19 it is due to a less pronounced hierarchy of individuals because in better resource conditions the individual variability is smaller when individual variability is higher e g for smaller values of α parameter and therefore the hierarchy of individuals in terms of resource acquisition more pronounced fluctuations in number will be smaller what ecological situation does this last version of the model mimic in which resources are discontinuous well it appears to be a model of population dynamics with non overlapping generations in an environment with clearly marked seasonality 8 conclusions the lack of intraspecies competition in other words the low variability of individuals in a population combined with a type of resources that when not exploited are characterised by unlimited growth is not conducive to population persistence on the other hand competition between individuals which ensures much greater population persistence implies individual variability and this in turn has a high demographic cost someone will survive and another will not someone will have offspring and another will die childless increasing the persistence of a population composed of weakly competing individuals without a significant increase in demographic costs can be achieved by introducing it into a spatially heterogeneous environment and turning the system into a metapopulation this will of course be true provided that migration between local habitats does not involve increased mortality of migrating individuals however any local population will still be at risk of extinction but the persistence of the whole metapopulation is significantly increased other ways of increasing the persistence of low diversity populations come at a significant demographic cost this is particularly clear in the case of triggering different types of mortality each of which regardless of how it works only delays the extinction of the population a radical way to make populations of little variable individuals a persistent system is to change the nature of the resource dynamics and turn them into a renewable resource each generation in a sense this constantly activates in a population of less variable individuals those mechanisms that govern the dynamics of a population composed of more variable individuals but with resources of continuous and unlimited growth in the latter case the mechanism to ensure population persistence is triggered when resources reach minimum now when the resources are renewed to the same level at each generation this mechanism works at each time step even if the individual variability is small however due to the much higher level of renewed resources than their minimum value in the continuous resource model the nature of the number dynamics will be different we will get smaller or larger fluctuations around a certain level of population number rather than dynamics that involve going through successive phases of increase and decrease in population number creditt author statement there are no credits related to this text declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
