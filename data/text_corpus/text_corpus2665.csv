13325,a novel boron doped diamond bdd flow through cell was used to evaluate the electrochemical oxidation of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in landfill leachates six different leachates with a concentration of individual pfaas in the range of 102 104 ng l were treated the performance of the flow through cell was assessed and compared with synthetic solutions for the oxidation of two representative pfaas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos subsequently the effect of current density and the variability of leachates composition was investigated for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in real landfill leachates non detect levels and 90 degradation was reached for pfos and pfoa after 2 h of treatment for all leachates tested decreasing trends for perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and perfluorohexanesulphonic acid pfhxs and increasing trends for perfluoropentanoic pfpea perfluorobutanoic pfba and perfluorobutanesulphonic acid pfbs were observed the total pfaas removal ranged from 138 6 to 73 5 correlations between the composition of the leachates and pfaas removal percentages were determined overall the results show the potential of electrochemical oxidation to oxidize pfaas present in high strength water such as landfill leachates graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pfas landfill leachates electrochemical oxidation wastewater treatment advanced oxidation process 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of synthetic chemicals widely used in multiple consumer products e g tapestry outdoor clothing cleaning agents non stick cookware and industrial processes e g metal plating fire fighting foams coatings electronics due to their unique surface active properties and high chemical and thermal stability 1 2 an estimate of 3000 pfass have been identified from which perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos are two of the most studied compounds 3 pfass have triggered attention due to their recalcitrant nature and bioaccumulative potential that leads to their accumulation in water sediments soils wildlife and the human body 3 their exposure and accumulation in the human body have been associated with multiple health effects e g inmunotoxicity neurotoxicity testicular and kidney cancer 4 5 as a result the united states environmental protection agency usepa established a health advisory level hal of 0 07 μg l for the combined concentration of pfoa and pfos in drinking water 6 7 multiple pfass end their life cycle in landfills as municipal solid waste and their presence has been reported in landfill leachates in a wide range of concentrations 8 9 in 2013 for example a range of 0 15 9 2 μg l of pfoa was detected in 13 landfill leachate sites in the u s 8 a more recent study 2019 performed in michigan u s estimated a daily flow of leachates from 32 landfills of over 1 million gallons with concentrations in the range of 16 3200 ng l for pfoa and 9 960 ng l for pfos 10 the concentration of pfass in leachates is affected by various factors including the heterogeneity of the waste disposed climate waste age and seasonal variability in infiltration 8 9 according to lang et al the most common pfass present in landfill leachates in the u s are 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 5 3 ftca perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutanoic acid pfba pfoa 6 2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 6 2 ftca and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea 8 overall pfass ranging from c4 c8 chain length dominate the distribution profiles 11 wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive landfill leachates as influents to be treated conventionally masoner et al estimated that although landfill leachates accounted for only 1 7 of the total daily flow that goes into the studied wwtps the contribution of total pfass corresponded to 18 of the total pfass present in the influent of wwtps 12 in addition previous studies have shown higher concentrations of pfass in the effluent compared to the influent 8 13 this observation has been attributed to 1 the non biodegradability of pfas and 2 the fact that multiple polyfluoroalkyl substances i e precursor compounds can be further oxidized to perfluoroalkyl substances during biological treatment 8 14 some of the precursors include fluorotelomer based substances ftcas perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide derivatives fasaas and polyfluoroalkyl phospahate esters paps 15 16 additional treatment technologies including adsorption with granular activated carbon gac and membrane processes i e nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been proposed to treat pfass in landfill leachates 3 however the complex composition of a landfill leachate makes gac inefficient while for the case of membrane processes the concentrate containing pfass require further treatment therefore there is an urgent need for a destructive technology to degrade pfass and break the accumulation cycle generated by other technologies electrochemical oxidation has shown to be a versatile destructive technology due to its capability to degrade a wide range of contaminants operation at ambient temperature and pressure and robust performance 17 18 additionally it does not require auxiliary chemicals and can be operated as a decentralized treatment option 18 multiple studies have been conducted to explore the electrochemical oxidation of pfass in synthetic solutions and groundwater showing promising results 19 20 21 however the effectiveness of the process in complex matrices e g landfill leachate membrane concentrates and ion exchange regenerate solutions has been scarcely reported although the electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos in landfill leachates has recently been reported 17 multiple other pfaas commonly present in leachates have only been identified but their oxidation has yet to be addressed this study explores for the first time the electrochemical oxidation of multiple pfaas in real landfill leachates using a boron doped diamond bdd flow through cell the objectives of this work were to i evaluate and compare the degradation kinetics and energy consumption for the electrochemical oxidation of two commonly studied pfass pfoa and pfos in a synthetic solution with a bdd flow through cell ii assess the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates and iii determine the influence of leachate composition in the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa 97 heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid potassium salt cf3 cf2 7so3k 98 perfluorobutanoic acid pfba 98 sodium sulfate na2so4 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 landfill leachates six leachate samples were collected from august 2019 to february 2020 from three different landfills in michigan usa to maintain the confidentiality of sample locations in this study leachates were labeled as l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and l6 the physico chemical characterization of the samples is depicted in tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si the leachates were collected in 20 l high density polyethylene hdpe containers secured in coolers and shipped to the fraunhofer usa center midwest division for coatings and diamond technologies at michigan state university samples were stored at 4 c upon receipt 2 3 electrochemical oxidation setup experiments were performed at laboratory scale with a flow through cell using niobium supported bdd anodes and cathodes condias germany the electrochemical cell was comprised of eight circular electrode packets each packet was formed by one bdd anode and two bdd cathodes separated by an interelectrode distance of 2 mm each electrode was perforated with 60 holes 1 16 id to generate hydrodynamically turbulent conditions and allow the solution to flow through the packets the schematic of cell design is depicted in fig s1 the total active anodic surface area was 33 6 cm2 the cell was connected in parallel to two power supplies bk precision 9130 b a pvc tank was used as the reservoir feed tank fig 1 shows a diagram of the experimental set up a solution volume of v 2 l was used to perform each experiment the area to volume ratio a v was 16 8 cm2 l solutions were recirculated at a flow rate of 2 l min using a peristaltic pump from the feed tank to the cell in a batch with recirculation set up all experiments were performed under galvanostatic conditions with the application of different current densities the voltage ranged from 4 to 5 v for the lowest and the highest current density in a typical experiment 10 ml of leachate were collected from the reservoir tank every 2 h transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until they were delivered for analysis additional parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and perchlorate clo 4 concentration were also monitored no addition of electrolyte was required as the conductivity of the leachates was high enough to perform the experiments the initial conductivity and ph had an average value of 14 6 1 7 ms cm and 7 9 0 2 respectively control experiments to guarantee the absence of pfass in all the components of the electrochemical reactor set up were conducted pure water was recirculated through the system for 1 h without the application of current the final effluent was sent for pfass analysis and showed no pfass present two additional control experiments without applied current to test for pfass losses e g sorption or volatilization not attributable to electrochemical treatment were performed with a synthetic solution containing pfoa and pfos and a leachate sample gas sampling was not considered in this work 2 4 analytical methods cod and toc were determined using usepa approved hach standard methods anions were analyzed via ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 using an ion exchange resin column ionpac as20 0 4 mm 250 mm based on standard methods 4110b the ph and conductivity were measured with an sg23 b sevengo duo series portable meter mettler toledo the temperature and flow rate were monitored using an in house designed control system pfass analysis was performed following a modified epa 537 method by eurofins testamerica sacramento u s the description of the method is provided in text s1 and tables s3 s4 and s5 the total identified pfass precursors tip 4 2 fts 6 2 fts 8 2 fts netfosaa nmefosaa were below detection levels 2000 ng l for all the samples in this work due to the dilution factor of the samples 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the bdd flow through cell the electrochemical oxidation of two common pfaas pfoa and pfos in a synthetic solution was evaluated with the flow through cell the solution consisted of 70 μg l of pfoa and 70 μg l of pfos dissolved in a 10 mm sodium sulfate na2so4 electrolyte a current density of 50 ma cm2 was applied during electrochemical treatment fig 2 a shows the decrease in concentration of both pfoa and pfos over time both species followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics r2 0 9672 for pfoa and r2 0 9819 for pfos and the calculated values of the kinetic degradation constant for pfoa and pfos were 2 19 10 2 and 3 99 10 2min 1 respectively the degradation of pfoa pfos also followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics r2 0 9873 with a rate constant of 2 63 10 2 min 1 additionally it has been shown that the degradation of long chain pfaas leads to the generation of shorter chain pfaas e g perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa pfhxa perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea pfba and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs as depicted in fig 2b that result from the cleavage of cf2 moieties 26 20 an additional experiment with a bdd parallel plate cell shown in fig s2 was performed for comparison using the same experimental conditions the description of the parallel plate cell used is detailed in text s2 a normalized with respect to current and treatment volume pseudo first order rate constant to describe the removal of pfoa and pfos can be compared for different electrochemical systems 23 table 1 shows the normalized rate constants values for the electrochemical treatment of pfoa and pfos attained in various studies results with the flow through cell showed a higher normalized rate constant for the degradation of pfoa and pfos when compared to the parallel plate cell and other studies performed with similar conditions the electric energy per order ee o wh l required for the electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos was also considered for the evaluation of cell performance as shown in table 1 the ee o values required for 1 log removal 90 degradation of pfoa and pfos with the bdd flow through cell were 5 and 21 times lower respectively than the values obtained with the parallel plate cell the low ee o is ascribed to multiple factors including the geometry of the cell and the area to volume a v ratio the geometry of the cell heavily influences the diffusional limitations and energy losses of the process the introduced flow through cell increases the turbulence generated with the addition of multiple holes with different alignments on the surface area of the anodes and cathodes through which the solution flows as shown in fig s1 that leads to an enhancement in the mass transfer coefficient k m the value of k m was electrochemically determined as described elsewhere 27 and corresponded to 1 22 10 5 and 1 25 10 4 m s 1 for the parallel plate cell and the flow through cell respectively moreover energy losses can be reduced with the minimization of the interelectrode distance that is responsible for the ohmic drop of the cell 28 which was the case for the flow through cell the a v ratio corresponds to the area of electrodes used with respect to the treated water volume an optimization of this parameter allows for reduction of capital costs of the technology which is highly dependent on the electrode area used in this regard as shown in table 1 the present work with the flow through cell for the degradation of pfoa and pfos used the lowest a v ratio reported to date and nonetheless provided high degradation rate constants and low ee o values after evaluating the performance with synthetic solutions the bdd flow through cell was tested with real landfill leachates the results are presented in the following subsections 3 2 influence of current density on the electrochemical treatment of pfaas in landfill leachates the influence of the current density on the degradation of multiple pfaas present in leachate l1 was evaluated this leachate was spiked with 25 μg l of pfoa and 15 μg l of pfos to increase their concentration as these two compounds are the ones currently regulated the detected concentration of pfaas in the spiked leachates from l1 ranged from high to low in the following order pfoa pfos pfbs pfhxa pfba pfpea pfhpa and pfhxs preliminary experiments data not shown were conducted to determine the current density range in which electrochemical oxidation of pfaas occurs for the a v used 16 8 cm2 l current densities lower than 50 ma cm2 led to an increase in pfoa and pfos and only current densities equal to or greater than 50 ma cm2 allowed for their decrease in concentration therefore a range from 50 to 200 ma cm2 was selected for the following experiments fig 3 shows the concentration of detected pfaas over time during the electrochemical treatment of l1 with 50 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 in general the increase in current density allowed for a faster removal of total pfaas in the cases of 50 and 100 ma cm2 the concentration of total pfaas after 8 h of electrochemical treatment was higher than its initial concentration nevertheless most of the final concentration corresponded to pfba and represented 59 0 and 67 4 of the final concentration of total pfaas in l1 treated with 50 and 100 ma cm2 respectively conversely current densities of 150 and 200 ma cm2 led to a decrease of total pfaas after 8 h of treatment and the final concentration of pfba was minimized with 200 ma cm2 the removal of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas had a strong dependence on the current density applied contrary to perfluoroalalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas which removal was independent as shown in fig s3 this observation implies that pfsas 1 are easier to degrade than pfcas and 2 have a degradation mechanism that supports conversion to pfcas this finding is supported by previous research which suggested that the degradation of pfsas initiates with the cleavage of the so3 group from the terminal carbon and formation of perfluoroalkyl radicals followed by multiple chain reactions that lead to the formation of short chain pfcas 17 29 this transformation mechanism was also observed for the electrochemical oxidation of precursor compounds such as 6 2 ftsa 30 additionally it has been suggested that the reaction of precursor compounds with oh leads to the generation of a mixture of pfcas of varying carbon chain length 31 the removal of individual chains was also compared for the case of pfoa pfos after 2 h of treatment a removal 90 was reached with 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 whereas 50 ma cm2 allowed only for 72 removal a treatment time of 8 h was required to reach a removal 90 with 50 ma cm2 the latter followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics k 4 37 10 3 min 1 and r2 0 7998 six times slower than the degradation with the same current density in synthetic solutions the slower degradation was attributed to the presence of multiple other co contaminants in the leachate that compete for oxidation with pfaas in general the concentration of pfaas in a leachate is low relative to other components present in the matrix e g dissolved organic matter dom multiple other xenobiotic organic compounds xocs heavy metals and inorganic salts 3 therefore multiple other co contaminants are oxidized simultaneously the removal of shorter chain pfaas 4 c 8 was also dependent on the current density for the shorter chain pfcas the concentration of pfhpa and pfhxa increased over time 8 h with 50 ma cm2 by a factor of 2 0 and 1 7 respectively and decreased with 150 and 200 ma cm2 the concentration of pfpea and pfba increased with all current densities yet the final concentration after treatment with 200 ma cm2 was lower than with 50 ma cm2 for the shorter chain pfsas the concentration of pfhxs decreased with all the current densities leading to non detect values after 2 h with 150 and 200 ma cm2 conversely the concentration of pfbs increased over time with all the current densities applied however the generation of pfbs was at least 14 times less than pfba the increment of pfpea pfba and pfbs is in agreement with the observations in previous studies for instance gomez ruiz et al showed that the increase in current density for the degradation of 6 2 ftsa in industrial wastewater decreased the total concentration of pfcas but increasing trends for pfhxa and pfba were observed 32 trautmann et al reported the increase of pfba pfpea and pfhxa after 18 h of electrooxidation of simulated groundwater containing various pfass 33 the common pattern of decreasing concentrations of longer chains and increasing concentrations of shorter chains follows the previously proposed pfass unzipping mechanism 20 26 in this mechanism pfass are activated by a direct electron transfer to form perfluoroalkyl radicals which then react with oh in a series of chain reactions to form shorter chain pfass although it has been shown that pfass are inert to radical attack the perfluoroalkyl radicals are vulnerable to oh 34 35 both direct and indirect oxidation occur concurrently until complete mineralization is achieved 34 for the present work the complexity of a leachate matrix likely slows down the mineralization of short chain pfaas the increase in concentration of pfba in all the cases can be attributed to two coexisting processes degradation of longer chains 23 and transformation of potential precursor compounds present in leachates 13 36 that ultimately were oxidized to pfba the latter was confirmed with a mass balance of the organic fluorine for pfaas as shown in figs s4 and s5 the fraction of molar f relative to t 0 in pfcas and pfsas during the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in leachates with different current densities is depicted for the experiments performed with 50 100 and 150 ma cm2 the organic fluorine in pfcas increased by a factor of 2 0 1 8 and 1 3 after 8 h of treatment respectively this excess of fluorine was likely generated from the oxidation of precursors that were oxidized to pfcas this assumption is based on the identification of precursor compounds in previous studies for instance lang et al reported the presence of precursor compounds in concentrations higher than the limit of quantification loq for more than 50 of the leachates 95 samples analyzed from 18 landfills in the u s 8 in addition it has been shown that the transformation of some precursors can lead to the generation of pfoa and pfos 37 38 the identification and study of the transformation of precursors compounds will be presented in future work likewise it has been shown that more hydrophobic pfaas are easier to degrade among all the pfaas studied in this work pfba was the least hydrophobic hence it had the slowest degradation kinetics as shown in a previous study 24 with this precedent a generation rate higher than the degradation rate presumably led to the increase in pfba concentration during the electrochemical oxidation process an additional experiment was performed using synthetic solutions to verify the capability of bdd to oxidize pfba and is shown in fig s6 pfba was degraded by 98 4 and 80 8 with 150 ma cm2 after 6 h of treatment with na2so4 and nacl as supporting electrolytes respectively the low levels of inorganic fluoride loq of 1 mg l low concentrations of total pfaas low μg l range and the complexity of the matrix did not allow us to quantify the fluoride generation additional parameters that influence the electrochemical oxidation process were evaluated in this set of experiments to evaluate the overall oxidation process of leachates these included chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc fig s7 shows the cod evolution over time during the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachates the decrease in cod followed a first order kinetics for all the current densities with degradation constant rates k min 1 proportional to the applied current density table s6 as observed in a previous study 39 a maximum cod removal of 86 was reached after 8 h of treatment with 200 ma cm2 the toc removal was also quantified and corresponded to 17 42 68 and 73 after 8 h of treatment with 50 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 respectively these values suggest incomplete mineralization for all the applied conditions which is in agreement with the generation of multiple observed short chain pfaas and additional non target compounds that remained in the final treated solution 3 3 electrochemical treatment of various leachates in the next part of this study the degradation of pfaas was evaluated for 5 different leachates l2 l3 l4 l5 and l6 the individual characterization of each leachate is depicted in tables s1 and s2 none of the leachates were spiked the goal of this set of experiments was to evaluate the influence of the leachate characteristics on the electrochemical degradation of pfaas and to determine the existing correlations between variables the experiments were performed with a current density of 150 ma cm2 applied for 6 h the latter was chosen over 200 ma cm2 as it showed to be sufficient to oxidize total pfaas and required lower energy consumption fig 4a depicts the initial concentrations of individual pfaas corresponding to 5 different leachate samples pfba pfbs pfhpa pfhxa pfhxs pfoa pfos and pfpea were found in all the samples the total pfaas concentration varied between 11 1 and 24 8 μg l mean 18 4 4 8 μg l the pfcas ranged from 7 6 to 17 1 μg l mean 11 6 3 4 μg l and the pfsas ranged from 3 5 to 8 8 μg l mean 6 8 1 8 μg l indicating that pfcas were the dominant species which has also been observed in previous studies 3 9 initial concentrations of pfcas and pfsas for each landfill leachate are shown in table s7 initial concentrations of individual pfaas ranged from 0 6 to 6 7 μg l table s2 the mean concentration was the highest for pfbs 4 9 1 5 μg l and the lowest for pfos 0 6 0 2 μg l low concentrations of pfos in landfill leachates relative to other pfaas have been also reported elsewhere 40 41 for other pfaas the mean concentrations were from high to low pfhxa 3 8 0 7 μg l pfoa 3 3 2 1 μg l pfba 2 0 0 2 μg l pfpea 1 5 0 3 μg l pfhxs 1 2 0 5 μg l and pfhpa 1 0 0 2 μg l the concentration of pfoa pfos mean 3 9 2 5 μg l was between 23 and 106 times above the usepa hal of 70 ng l in the samples tested other unregulated pfaas pfhxs pfhpa and pfbs were detected at mean concentrations of 39 98 and 55 times higher than their minimum reporting levels of 0 03 0 01 and 0 09 μg l respectively based on the usepa s third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 fig 4b shows the removal percentage of individual pfaas after 2 h of treatment where pfos reached non detect levels mean 100 and pfoa was removed in 97 mean 97 4 for all samples for other pfaas the average removal efficiencies were 88 17 29 13 and 96 7 for pfhpa pfhxa and pfhxs respectively negative removal increasing concentration was observed for pfpea pfba and pfbs with values of 16 31 181 235 and 3 22 respectively increasing the treatment time up to 6 h enhanced the removal efficiency of pfhxa and pfbs but led to a higher negative removal of pfpea and pfba as stated before the increasing concentration of short chain pfaas is a result of the degradation of longer chains preferential conversion of pfsas to pfcas and possible transformation of precursor compounds 23 32 the pfaas compound with the highest concentration after 6 h of treatment was pfba for leachates l2 l3 l4 and pfhxa for leachates l5 and l6 the concentration of pfaas over time during the electrochemical treatment of each leachate treated is depicted in fig s8 the combination of positive and negative removal for individual pfaas led to a negative total pfaas removal for l2 138 6 and l3 64 7 and a positive total pfaas removal for l4 48 3 l5 67 6 and l6 73 5 a pearson s correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the leachates characteristics and total pfaas removal a positive significant correlation was found between initial toc and total pfaas removal r 0 92 p 0 028 cod was moderately correlated r 0 65 p 0 238 although statistically insignificant the initial concentration of total pfaas was negatively and poorly correlated statistically insignificant with the total pfaas removal r 0 23 p 0 706 the significant correlation of initial toc and total pfaas removal shows a dependency between variables where the percentage of pfaas removal is affected by the level of carbon containing compounds with this consideration electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates should be applied as a descentralized treatment option at the point of source as the variability of composition of different leachates determines the necessary treatment time to achieve higher removal efficiencies finally the energy consumption for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates was 28 and 82 wh l for 2 h and 6 h of treatment respectively once again only 2 h 28 wh l were necessary to reach a removal 90 of both pfoa and pfos in all leachates treated although the process was applied to such a complex matrix the energy consumption was still lower than the values reported for leachates in previous research 17 3 4 perchlorate generation in leachates clo4 is a well known byproduct of electrochemical oxidation that results from the oxidation of chlorinated compounds the non selective nature of electrochemical technologies leads to the oxidation of not only the target pollutants but non targeted compounds which can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the matrix and desired compounds to be removed chloride cl is one of the components with the highest concentration in wastewater and landfill leachates 32 in this work the studied leachates presented an average initial cl concentration of 3026 421 mg l it has been shown that the presence of high concentrations of cl in landfill leachates leads to the generation of reactive chlorine cl2 followed by its hydrolytic disproportionation to form hydrochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ions ocl the foregoing contribute to the indirect oxidation of organic pollutants 18 39 and it has been shown that reactive chlorine oxidizes the non fluorinated head groups of pfaas precursors via indirect oxidation mechanisms 35 however cl also can act as scavenger of oh radicals to form products with higher oxidation states including chlorate clo3 and clo4 18 34 the latter being the most common byproduct of electrochemical oxidation 18 fig 5 shows the concentration of clo4 over time during the electrochemical treatment of pfaas with different current densities the kinetics for clo4 followed a zero order generation rate table s8 which was independent on the initial concentration of cl but dependent on the applied current density although avoiding the presence of cl in leachates may be difficult the generation of clo4 can be diminished by using low current densities as shown in fig 5 shorter treatment times 42 or quenching the production of hocl and ocl 34 additionally biological treatment has been proposed as one of the alternatives to treat clo4 after electrochemical oxidation 22 43 for instance schaefer et al yielded a 3 log decrease in clo4 levels generated during electrochemical oxidation using biological reduction 22 all of these alternatives will have to be evaluated in future research to determine their implications 4 conclusions the results presented herein introduced a higher performance cell flow through for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas allowing for lower energy consumption and enhanced mass transfer than a conventional parallel plate cell with the a v ratio used current densities equal to or greater than 150 ma cm2 were necessary to guarantee total pfaas degradation and avoid a faster generation rate from precursors transformation non detect levels and degradation 97 for the electrochemical oxidation of pfos and pfoa respectively were reached for all the leachates treated with 150 ma cm2 although high removal efficiencies for long chain pfaas including pfoa and pfos were achieved for all samples the degradation of short chain pfaas in particular pfba pfbs and pfpea was lower and remains a challenge a further study of the precursors influence and transformation needs to be considered in order to gain a better understanding of their implications for the electrochemical treatment of landfill leachates pretreatment technologies aiming to preconcentrate pfaas in leachates may improve the pfaas degradation efficiency by reducing the treatment volume and eliminating some of the competitive species from the matrix in addition optimizing cell geometries could further enhance pfaas degradation rates with the previous appropriately combined electrochemical oxidation could contribute to multiple integrated treatment processes aiming to destroy pfass declaration of competing interest the

13325,a novel boron doped diamond bdd flow through cell was used to evaluate the electrochemical oxidation of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in landfill leachates six different leachates with a concentration of individual pfaas in the range of 102 104 ng l were treated the performance of the flow through cell was assessed and compared with synthetic solutions for the oxidation of two representative pfaas perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos subsequently the effect of current density and the variability of leachates composition was investigated for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in real landfill leachates non detect levels and 90 degradation was reached for pfos and pfoa after 2 h of treatment for all leachates tested decreasing trends for perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and perfluorohexanesulphonic acid pfhxs and increasing trends for perfluoropentanoic pfpea perfluorobutanoic pfba and perfluorobutanesulphonic acid pfbs were observed the total pfaas removal ranged from 138 6 to 73 5 correlations between the composition of the leachates and pfaas removal percentages were determined

perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa perfluorobutanoic acid pfba pfoa 6 2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 6 2 ftca and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea 8 overall pfass ranging from c4 c8 chain length dominate the distribution profiles 11 wastewater treatment plants wwtps receive landfill leachates as influents to be treated conventionally masoner et al estimated that although landfill leachates accounted for only 1 7 of the total daily flow that goes into the studied wwtps the contribution of total pfass corresponded to 18 of the total pfass present in the influent of wwtps 12 in addition previous studies have shown higher concentrations of pfass in the effluent compared to the influent 8 13 this observation has been attributed to 1 the non biodegradability of pfas and 2 the fact that multiple polyfluoroalkyl substances i e precursor compounds can be further oxidized to perfluoroalkyl substances during biological treatment 8 14 some of the precursors include fluorotelomer based substances ftcas perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide derivatives fasaas and polyfluoroalkyl phospahate esters paps 15 16 additional treatment technologies including adsorption with granular activated carbon gac and membrane processes i e nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have been proposed to treat pfass in landfill leachates 3 however the complex composition of a landfill leachate makes gac inefficient while for the case of membrane processes the concentrate containing pfass require further treatment therefore there is an urgent need for a destructive technology to degrade pfass and break the accumulation cycle generated by other technologies electrochemical oxidation has shown to be a versatile destructive technology due to its capability to degrade a wide range of contaminants operation at ambient temperature and pressure and robust performance 17 18 additionally it does not require auxiliary chemicals and can be operated as a decentralized treatment option 18 multiple studies have been conducted to explore the electrochemical oxidation of pfass in synthetic solutions and groundwater showing promising results 19 20 21 however the effectiveness of the process in complex matrices e g landfill leachate membrane concentrates and ion exchange regenerate solutions has been scarcely reported although the electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos in landfill leachates has recently been reported 17 multiple other pfaas commonly present in leachates have only been identified but their oxidation has yet to be addressed this study explores for the first time the electrochemical oxidation of multiple pfaas in real landfill leachates using a boron doped diamond bdd flow through cell the objectives of this work were to i evaluate and compare the degradation kinetics and energy consumption for the electrochemical oxidation of two commonly studied pfass pfoa and pfos in a synthetic solution with a bdd flow through cell ii assess the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates and iii determine the influence of leachate composition in the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa 97 heptadecafluorooctanesulfonic acid potassium salt cf3 cf2 7so3k 98 perfluorobutanoic acid pfba 98 sodium sulfate na2so4 and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 landfill leachates six leachate samples were collected from august 2019 to february 2020 from three different landfills in michigan usa to maintain the confidentiality of sample locations in this study leachates were labeled as l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 and l6 the physico chemical characterization of the samples is depicted in tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si the leachates were collected in 20 l high density polyethylene hdpe containers secured in coolers and shipped to the fraunhofer usa center midwest division for coatings and diamond technologies at michigan state university samples were stored at 4 c upon receipt 2 3 electrochemical oxidation setup experiments were performed at laboratory scale with a flow through cell using niobium supported bdd anodes and cathodes condias germany the electrochemical cell was comprised of eight circular electrode packets each packet was formed by one bdd anode and two bdd cathodes separated by an interelectrode distance of 2 mm each electrode was perforated with 60 holes 1 16 id to generate hydrodynamically turbulent conditions and allow the solution to flow through the packets the schematic of cell design is depicted in fig s1 the total active anodic surface area was 33 6 cm2 the cell was connected in parallel to two power supplies bk precision 9130 b a pvc tank was used as the reservoir feed tank fig 1 shows a diagram of the experimental set up a solution volume of v 2 l was used to perform each experiment the area to volume ratio a v was 16 8 cm2 l solutions were recirculated at a flow rate of 2 l min using a peristaltic pump from the feed tank to the cell in a batch with recirculation set up all experiments were performed under galvanostatic conditions with the application of different current densities the voltage ranged from 4 to 5 v for the lowest and the highest current density in a typical experiment 10 ml of leachate were collected from the reservoir tank every 2 h transferred to polypropylene tubes and stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until they were delivered for analysis additional parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc and perchlorate clo 4 concentration were also monitored no addition of electrolyte was required as the conductivity of the leachates was high enough to perform the experiments the initial conductivity and ph had an average value of 14 6 1 7 ms cm and 7 9 0 2 respectively control experiments to guarantee the absence of pfass in all the components of the electrochemical reactor set up were conducted pure water was recirculated through the system for 1 h without the application of current the final effluent was sent for pfass analysis and showed no pfass present two additional control experiments without applied current to test for pfass losses e g sorption or volatilization not attributable to electrochemical treatment were performed with a synthetic solution containing pfoa and pfos and a leachate sample gas sampling was not considered in this work 2 4 analytical methods cod and toc were determined using usepa approved hach standard methods anions were analyzed via ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 using an ion exchange resin column ionpac as20 0 4 mm 250 mm based on standard methods 4110b the ph and conductivity were measured with an sg23 b sevengo duo series portable meter mettler toledo the temperature and flow rate were monitored using an in house designed control system pfass analysis was performed following a modified epa 537 method by eurofins testamerica sacramento u s the description of the method is provided in text s1 and tables s3 s4 and s5 the total identified pfass precursors tip 4 2 fts 6 2 fts 8 2 fts netfosaa nmefosaa were below detection levels 2000 ng l for all the samples in this work due to the dilution factor of the samples 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the bdd flow through cell the electrochemical oxidation of two common pfaas pfoa and pfos in a synthetic solution was evaluated with the flow through cell the solution consisted of 70 μg l of pfoa and 70 μg l of pfos dissolved in a 10 mm sodium sulfate na2so4 electrolyte a current density of 50 ma cm2 was applied during electrochemical treatment fig 2 a shows the decrease in concentration of both pfoa and pfos over time both species followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics r2 0 9672 for pfoa and r2 0 9819 for pfos and the calculated values of the kinetic degradation constant for pfoa and pfos were 2 19 10 2 and 3 99 10 2min 1 respectively the degradation of pfoa pfos also followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics r2 0 9873 with a rate constant of 2 63 10 2 min 1 additionally it has been shown that the degradation of long chain pfaas leads to the generation of shorter chain pfaas e g perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa pfhxa perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea pfba and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs as depicted in fig 2b that result from the cleavage of cf2 moieties 26 20 an additional experiment with a bdd parallel plate cell shown in fig s2 was performed for comparison using the same experimental conditions the description of the parallel plate cell used is detailed in text s2 a normalized with respect to current and treatment volume pseudo first order rate constant to describe the removal of pfoa and pfos can be compared for different electrochemical systems 23 table 1 shows the normalized rate constants values for the electrochemical treatment of pfoa and pfos attained in various studies results with the flow through cell showed a higher normalized rate constant for the degradation of pfoa and pfos when compared to the parallel plate cell and other studies performed with similar conditions the electric energy per order ee o wh l required for the electrochemical oxidation of pfoa and pfos was also considered for the evaluation of cell performance as shown in table 1 the ee o values required for 1 log removal 90 degradation of pfoa and pfos with the bdd flow through cell were 5 and 21 times lower respectively than the values obtained with the parallel plate cell the low ee o is ascribed to multiple factors including the geometry of the cell and the area to volume a v ratio the geometry of the cell heavily influences the diffusional limitations and energy losses of the process the introduced flow through cell increases the turbulence generated with the addition of multiple holes with different alignments on the surface area of the anodes and cathodes through which the solution flows as shown in fig s1 that leads to an enhancement in the mass transfer coefficient k m the value of k m was electrochemically determined as described elsewhere 27 and corresponded to 1 22 10 5 and 1 25 10 4 m s 1 for the parallel plate cell and the flow through cell respectively moreover energy losses can be reduced with the minimization of the interelectrode distance that is responsible for the ohmic drop of the cell 28 which was the case for the flow through cell the a v ratio corresponds to the area of electrodes used with respect to the treated water volume an optimization of this parameter allows for reduction of capital costs of the technology which is highly dependent on the electrode area used in this regard as shown in table 1 the present work with the flow through cell for the degradation of pfoa and pfos used the lowest a v ratio reported to date and nonetheless provided high degradation rate constants and low ee o values after evaluating the performance with synthetic solutions the bdd flow through cell was tested with real landfill leachates the results are presented in the following subsections 3 2 influence of current density on the electrochemical treatment of pfaas in landfill leachates the influence of the current density on the degradation of multiple pfaas present in leachate l1 was evaluated this leachate was spiked with 25 μg l of pfoa and 15 μg l of pfos to increase their concentration as these two compounds are the ones currently regulated the detected concentration of pfaas in the spiked leachates from l1 ranged from high to low in the following order pfoa pfos pfbs pfhxa pfba pfpea pfhpa and pfhxs preliminary experiments data not shown were conducted to determine the current density range in which electrochemical oxidation of pfaas occurs for the a v used 16 8 cm2 l current densities lower than 50 ma cm2 led to an increase in pfoa and pfos and only current densities equal to or greater than 50 ma cm2 allowed for their decrease in concentration therefore a range from 50 to 200 ma cm2 was selected for the following experiments fig 3 shows the concentration of detected pfaas over time during the electrochemical treatment of l1 with 50 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 in general the increase in current density allowed for a faster removal of total pfaas in the cases of 50 and 100 ma cm2 the concentration of total pfaas after 8 h of electrochemical treatment was higher than its initial concentration nevertheless most of the final concentration corresponded to pfba and represented 59 0 and 67 4 of the final concentration of total pfaas in l1 treated with 50 and 100 ma cm2 respectively conversely current densities of 150 and 200 ma cm2 led to a decrease of total pfaas after 8 h of treatment and the final concentration of pfba was minimized with 200 ma cm2 the removal of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas had a strong dependence on the current density applied contrary to perfluoroalalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas which removal was independent as shown in fig s3 this observation implies that pfsas 1 are easier to degrade than pfcas and 2 have a degradation mechanism that supports conversion to pfcas this finding is supported by previous research which suggested that the degradation of pfsas initiates with the cleavage of the so3 group from the terminal carbon and formation of perfluoroalkyl radicals followed by multiple chain reactions that lead to the formation of short chain pfcas 17 29 this transformation mechanism was also observed for the electrochemical oxidation of precursor compounds such as 6 2 ftsa 30 additionally it has been suggested that the reaction of precursor compounds with oh leads to the generation of a mixture of pfcas of varying carbon chain length 31 the removal of individual chains was also compared for the case of pfoa pfos after 2 h of treatment a removal 90 was reached with 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 whereas 50 ma cm2 allowed only for 72 removal a treatment time of 8 h was required to reach a removal 90 with 50 ma cm2 the latter followed a pseudo first order degradation kinetics k 4 37 10 3 min 1 and r2 0 7998 six times slower than the degradation with the same current density in synthetic solutions the slower degradation was attributed to the presence of multiple other co contaminants in the leachate that compete for oxidation with pfaas in general the concentration of pfaas in a leachate is low relative to other components present in the matrix e g dissolved organic matter dom multiple other xenobiotic organic compounds xocs heavy metals and inorganic salts 3 therefore multiple other co contaminants are oxidized simultaneously the removal of shorter chain pfaas 4 c 8 was also dependent on the current density for the shorter chain pfcas the concentration of pfhpa and pfhxa increased over time 8 h with 50 ma cm2 by a factor of 2 0 and 1 7 respectively and decreased with 150 and 200 ma cm2 the concentration of pfpea and pfba increased with all current densities yet the final concentration after treatment with 200 ma cm2 was lower than with 50 ma cm2 for the shorter chain pfsas the concentration of pfhxs decreased with all the current densities leading to non detect values after 2 h with 150 and 200 ma cm2 conversely the concentration of pfbs increased over time with all the current densities applied however the generation of pfbs was at least 14 times less than pfba the increment of pfpea pfba and pfbs is in agreement with the observations in previous studies for instance gomez ruiz et al showed that the increase in current density for the degradation of 6 2 ftsa in industrial wastewater decreased the total concentration of pfcas but increasing trends for pfhxa and pfba were observed 32 trautmann et al reported the increase of pfba pfpea and pfhxa after 18 h of electrooxidation of simulated groundwater containing various pfass 33 the common pattern of decreasing concentrations of longer chains and increasing concentrations of shorter chains follows the previously proposed pfass unzipping mechanism 20 26 in this mechanism pfass are activated by a direct electron transfer to form perfluoroalkyl radicals which then react with oh in a series of chain reactions to form shorter chain pfass although it has been shown that pfass are inert to radical attack the perfluoroalkyl radicals are vulnerable to oh 34 35 both direct and indirect oxidation occur concurrently until complete mineralization is achieved 34 for the present work the complexity of a leachate matrix likely slows down the mineralization of short chain pfaas the increase in concentration of pfba in all the cases can be attributed to two coexisting processes degradation of longer chains 23 and transformation of potential precursor compounds present in leachates 13 36 that ultimately were oxidized to pfba the latter was confirmed with a mass balance of the organic fluorine for pfaas as shown in figs s4 and s5 the fraction of molar f relative to t 0 in pfcas and pfsas during the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in leachates with different current densities is depicted for the experiments performed with 50 100 and 150 ma cm2 the organic fluorine in pfcas increased by a factor of 2 0 1 8 and 1 3 after 8 h of treatment respectively this excess of fluorine was likely generated from the oxidation of precursors that were oxidized to pfcas this assumption is based on the identification of precursor compounds in previous studies for instance lang et al reported the presence of precursor compounds in concentrations higher than the limit of quantification loq for more than 50 of the leachates 95 samples analyzed from 18 landfills in the u s 8 in addition it has been shown that the transformation of some precursors can lead to the generation of pfoa and pfos 37 38 the identification and study of the transformation of precursors compounds will be presented in future work likewise it has been shown that more hydrophobic pfaas are easier to degrade among all the pfaas studied in this work pfba was the least hydrophobic hence it had the slowest degradation kinetics as shown in a previous study 24 with this precedent a generation rate higher than the degradation rate presumably led to the increase in pfba concentration during the electrochemical oxidation process an additional experiment was performed using synthetic solutions to verify the capability of bdd to oxidize pfba and is shown in fig s6 pfba was degraded by 98 4 and 80 8 with 150 ma cm2 after 6 h of treatment with na2so4 and nacl as supporting electrolytes respectively the low levels of inorganic fluoride loq of 1 mg l low concentrations of total pfaas low μg l range and the complexity of the matrix did not allow us to quantify the fluoride generation additional parameters that influence the electrochemical oxidation process were evaluated in this set of experiments to evaluate the overall oxidation process of leachates these included chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc fig s7 shows the cod evolution over time during the electrochemical oxidation of landfill leachates the decrease in cod followed a first order kinetics for all the current densities with degradation constant rates k min 1 proportional to the applied current density table s6 as observed in a previous study 39 a maximum cod removal of 86 was reached after 8 h of treatment with 200 ma cm2 the toc removal was also quantified and corresponded to 17 42 68 and 73 after 8 h of treatment with 50 100 150 and 200 ma cm2 respectively these values suggest incomplete mineralization for all the applied conditions which is in agreement with the generation of multiple observed short chain pfaas and additional non target compounds that remained in the final treated solution 3 3 electrochemical treatment of various leachates in the next part of this study the degradation of pfaas was evaluated for 5 different leachates l2 l3 l4 l5 and l6 the individual characterization of each leachate is depicted in tables s1 and s2 none of the leachates were spiked the goal of this set of experiments was to evaluate the influence of the leachate characteristics on the electrochemical degradation of pfaas and to determine the existing correlations between variables the experiments were performed with a current density of 150 ma cm2 applied for 6 h the latter was chosen over 200 ma cm2 as it showed to be sufficient to oxidize total pfaas and required lower energy consumption fig 4a depicts the initial concentrations of individual pfaas corresponding to 5 different leachate samples pfba pfbs pfhpa pfhxa pfhxs pfoa pfos and pfpea were found in all the samples the total pfaas concentration varied between 11 1 and 24 8 μg l mean 18 4 4 8 μg l the pfcas ranged from 7 6 to 17 1 μg l mean 11 6 3 4 μg l and the pfsas ranged from 3 5 to 8 8 μg l mean 6 8 1 8 μg l indicating that pfcas were the dominant species which has also been observed in previous studies 3 9 initial concentrations of pfcas and pfsas for each landfill leachate are shown in table s7 initial concentrations of individual pfaas ranged from 0 6 to 6 7 μg l table s2 the mean concentration was the highest for pfbs 4 9 1 5 μg l and the lowest for pfos 0 6 0 2 μg l low concentrations of pfos in landfill leachates relative to other pfaas have been also reported elsewhere 40 41 for other pfaas the mean concentrations were from high to low pfhxa 3 8 0 7 μg l pfoa 3 3 2 1 μg l pfba 2 0 0 2 μg l pfpea 1 5 0 3 μg l pfhxs 1 2 0 5 μg l and pfhpa 1 0 0 2 μg l the concentration of pfoa pfos mean 3 9 2 5 μg l was between 23 and 106 times above the usepa hal of 70 ng l in the samples tested other unregulated pfaas pfhxs pfhpa and pfbs were detected at mean concentrations of 39 98 and 55 times higher than their minimum reporting levels of 0 03 0 01 and 0 09 μg l respectively based on the usepa s third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 fig 4b shows the removal percentage of individual pfaas after 2 h of treatment where pfos reached non detect levels mean 100 and pfoa was removed in 97 mean 97 4 for all samples for other pfaas the average removal efficiencies were 88 17 29 13 and 96 7 for pfhpa pfhxa and pfhxs respectively negative removal increasing concentration was observed for pfpea pfba and pfbs with values of 16 31 181 235 and 3 22 respectively increasing the treatment time up to 6 h enhanced the removal efficiency of pfhxa and pfbs but led to a higher negative removal of pfpea and pfba as stated before the increasing concentration of short chain pfaas is a result of the degradation of longer chains preferential conversion of pfsas to pfcas and possible transformation of precursor compounds 23 32 the pfaas compound with the highest concentration after 6 h of treatment was pfba for leachates l2 l3 l4 and pfhxa for leachates l5 and l6 the concentration of pfaas over time during the electrochemical treatment of each leachate treated is depicted in fig s8 the combination of positive and negative removal for individual pfaas led to a negative total pfaas removal for l2 138 6 and l3 64 7 and a positive total pfaas removal for l4 48 3 l5 67 6 and l6 73 5 a pearson s correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between the leachates characteristics and total pfaas removal a positive significant correlation was found between initial toc and total pfaas removal r 0 92 p 0 028 cod was moderately correlated r 0 65 p 0 238 although statistically insignificant the initial concentration of total pfaas was negatively and poorly correlated statistically insignificant with the total pfaas removal r 0 23 p 0 706 the significant correlation of initial toc and total pfaas removal shows a dependency between variables where the percentage of pfaas removal is affected by the level of carbon containing compounds with this consideration electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates should be applied as a descentralized treatment option at the point of source as the variability of composition of different leachates determines the necessary treatment time to achieve higher removal efficiencies finally the energy consumption for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas in landfill leachates was 28 and 82 wh l for 2 h and 6 h of treatment respectively once again only 2 h 28 wh l were necessary to reach a removal 90 of both pfoa and pfos in all leachates treated although the process was applied to such a complex matrix the energy consumption was still lower than the values reported for leachates in previous research 17 3 4 perchlorate generation in leachates clo4 is a well known byproduct of electrochemical oxidation that results from the oxidation of chlorinated compounds the non selective nature of electrochemical technologies leads to the oxidation of not only the target pollutants but non targeted compounds which can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the matrix and desired compounds to be removed chloride cl is one of the components with the highest concentration in wastewater and landfill leachates 32 in this work the studied leachates presented an average initial cl concentration of 3026 421 mg l it has been shown that the presence of high concentrations of cl in landfill leachates leads to the generation of reactive chlorine cl2 followed by its hydrolytic disproportionation to form hydrochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ions ocl the foregoing contribute to the indirect oxidation of organic pollutants 18 39 and it has been shown that reactive chlorine oxidizes the non fluorinated head groups of pfaas precursors via indirect oxidation mechanisms 35 however cl also can act as scavenger of oh radicals to form products with higher oxidation states including chlorate clo3 and clo4 18 34 the latter being the most common byproduct of electrochemical oxidation 18 fig 5 shows the concentration of clo4 over time during the electrochemical treatment of pfaas with different current densities the kinetics for clo4 followed a zero order generation rate table s8 which was independent on the initial concentration of cl but dependent on the applied current density although avoiding the presence of cl in leachates may be difficult the generation of clo4 can be diminished by using low current densities as shown in fig 5 shorter treatment times 42 or quenching the production of hocl and ocl 34 additionally biological treatment has been proposed as one of the alternatives to treat clo4 after electrochemical oxidation 22 43 for instance schaefer et al yielded a 3 log decrease in clo4 levels generated during electrochemical oxidation using biological reduction 22 all of these alternatives will have to be evaluated in future research to determine their implications 4 conclusions the results presented herein introduced a higher performance cell flow through for the electrochemical oxidation of pfaas allowing for lower energy consumption and enhanced mass transfer than a conventional parallel plate cell with the a v ratio used current densities equal to or greater than 150 ma cm2 were necessary to guarantee total pfaas degradation and avoid a faster generation rate from precursors transformation non detect levels and degradation 97 for the electrochemical oxidation of pfos and pfoa respectively were reached for all the leachates treated with 150 ma cm2 although high removal efficiencies for long chain pfaas including pfoa and pfos were achieved for all samples the degradation of short chain pfaas in particular pfba pfbs and pfpea was lower and remains a challenge a further study of the precursors influence and transformation needs to be considered in order to gain a better understanding of their implications for the electrochemical treatment of landfill leachates pretreatment technologies aiming to preconcentrate pfaas in leachates may improve the pfaas degradation efficiency by reducing the treatment volume and eliminating some of the competitive species from the matrix in addition optimizing cell geometries could further enhance pfaas degradation rates with the previous appropriately combined electrochemical oxidation could contribute to multiple integrated treatment processes aiming to destroy pfass declaration of competing interest the

13326,the effect of varying cod n ratio 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 10 1 of wastewater and intermittent aeration on treatment efficiency of biochar bc packed with 10 v v biochar vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw planted with colocasia esculenta was assessed in this study three setups of vfcw were prepared in two sets aerated with an airflow rate of 1 0 0 6 l min 1 for 6 h d 1 and non aeration and changes in cod nh4 n no3 n tn and tp total phosphorous in the effluent was investigated in vfcws with intermittent aeration cod nh4 n no3 n tp removal was 99 0 97 0 81 0 and 89 0 significantly higher p 0 05 than non aerated vfcw setups as 91 3 70 9 86 97 and 64 4 respectively in non aerated vfcws bc addition in combination with plantation was advantageous in the nutrient removal process than setups without bc cod n ratio of wastewater did not show a significant impact on the working of vfcws if amended with bc and intermittent aerations suggesting slow adsorption rate and fast aerobic degradation of organic matter the study suggests that oxygen supply management and bc addition in vfcws could be an effective strategy to treat wastewater with a high organic load apart from that study results will be useful for refinement of the operational strategy with varying organic load keywords biochar constructed wetland cod colocasia aeration nitrification denitrification 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are evolved as an eco friendly technique for the treatment of various kinds of wastewater mainly nitrogen reduction from the wastewater 1 3 the excessive discharge of nitrogen into the water bodies causes various adverse effect to aquatic life degrades the quality of water and led to eutrophication 4 therefore wastewater management before the discharge needs specific attention to avoid such circumstances 5 6 the discharged nitrogen into the streams mainly exists in the form of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n which are considered the main forms of inorganic n 7 in general cws are established as the sustainable ecosystem for the removal of contaminants from wastewater mainly due to their cost effectiveness low maintenance low secondary pollution and apart from that they add an aesthetic value to the surrounding 8 but due to the design and structure of cws the dissolved oxygen do levels in the subsurface flow cws generally remain low the limitation of oxygen supply in cws limits the nitrification process and nitrogen removal efficiencies 9 further to overcome such factors artificial aeration can be an effective way to induce do enriched environment in the cws apart from that an insufficient amount of carbon source is also a drawback for cws and its consequence is that it limits the nutrients for the growth of microbes and plants which directly affects the treatment mechanisms 10 to resolve the carbon limitation issue the use of an external source of carbon by adding liquid glucose fructose sucrose methanol and acetic acid and solid apricot pits rice husk wheat straw rice husk corn straw plant husk woody shells and synthetic polymers substances in working cws have been suggested in the published literature 4 11 the recent advancement in the substrate layer of cws has used a variety of substrates apart from conventional ones such as constructional waste agricultural waste biochar etc owing to the advantage as a carbon rich solid prepared in oxygen restricted environment by thermal decomposition of biomass biochar is the most preferred and utilized material in the recent investigations with a wide range of their application 12 13 substrates used in cws is one of the factors on which removal efficiency depends so to achieve better results amendment are continuously done in the substrate layer to check it s relevance in the pollutant removal efficiency of the cws the substratum should offer few important features like the existence of both aerobic and anaerobic pores inside the matrix to boost de nitrification nitrification and organic compounds removal providing an internal carbon source to reduce the reliance of de nitrification metabolism on the carbon availability in the wastewater however gravel substrates which are commonly used in treatment wetlands provide neither carbon nor necessary aerobic conditions thus their reduction capabilities for pollutants is often very limited 14 15 a high load of cod in wastewater could be one of the solutions for carbon deficient environment in cws 15 but it also further affect the nitrification and do utility rates in such systems 16 17 the exogenous carbon source which promotes denitrification which enhances the removal of nitrite n no2 n and nitrate n no3 n by providing electronic donor for the reaction process 5 although literature reported that the cod n ratio plays a dynamic role in the removal of the organics and the n compounds plenty of n removal studies in conventional cws have been observed at different cod n which suggest that complete removal of the tn from the wastewater depends on both nitrification and denitrification processes in the cws to enhance the reduction of pollutants the supply of oxygen by external means such as aeration continuous or intermittent aeration which have proven to be a good alternative for removal of the nitrogenous compounds from cws can be implied as it ensures both nitrification and denitrification process 18 19 to overcome such problems biochar amendment has been widely utilized due to its large surface area strong cation exchange capacity and high porosity enhances the removal of pollutants and reduces the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs 20 21 zhong et al 22 revealed that biochar amendment in cws could be a sustainable approach to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of such systems in their study they found that biochar addition effectively improved the removal of total n and no3 n in wastewater by 59 88 93 03 and 83 14 100 respectively possibly due to improved microclimatic conditions for microorganisms in the substrate and synergetic impact by biochar on heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers in cws bolton et al 23 reported the enhanced removal of phosphorous in sewage water treated in a cw amended with biochar they narrated that adsorption could be the possible mechanism of p removal from wastewater adding to that chand et al 17 also reported the significance of biochar amendment in the cws for the enhanced reduction of the nutrients from the vfcws lately studies with the amendment of biochar in cws and artificial aeration continuous and intermittent has been studied separately to check their significance for the enhanced removal of pollutants and also to see the effect of biochar on greenhouse gas emission 18 21 24 25 however there are only a few studies in a combination of artificial aeration and biochar 5 26 a study by zhou et al 5 reported much higher removal in aerated vfcw system with biochar for cod nh4 n tn 94 9 99 1 52 7 respectively and lower n2o emission 60 54 μg m 2 h 1 a similar kind of investigation conducted by jia et al 26 in vfcw with agricultural biomass and intermittent aeration which reported the optimal removal of cod nh4 n and tn 97 99 and 96 respectively at an influent c n ratio of 0 5 suggesting that the biomass load and c n ratio of the influent should be further improved to achieve the better removal of n in vfcws while treating wastewater with low carbon loads the present study is another step towards sustainable development for treating wastewater to the best of the author s knowledge the study for refinement of the design operational strategy and evaluate its acceptability feasibility and the minimum period for treating wastewater has not to be examined with intermittent aeration in combination with biochar cow dung and colocasia esculenta based vfcws simultaneously therefore this study targets to explore the increasing organic load under intermittent aeration with 72 h retention time each under ambient conditions combination in vfcws this study aimed 1 to investigate the impact of increasing load in vfcws with and without aeration 2 the study aimed to see the significance of biochar and plantation in vfcw at different cod n and 3 to see the relevance of plant stand and biochar with intermittent aeration in vfcws on the nutrient removal process this study could provide a better understanding on the impact of influent cod n load in vfcws in combination with intermittent aeration and biochar addition in terms of its functioning and the removal of n and organics substances from the wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental setup of vfcw six independent identical down flow mesoscale vfcws units were designed which were operated as reactor column with biochar dose no colocasia plantation vfcw 1 and vfcw 4 vfcw 1 system with no artificial aeration and vfcw 4 with intermittent aeration the system with colocasia without biochar vfcw 2 and vfcw 5 vfcw 2 column was designed without aeration and vfcw 4 was established with intermittent aeration column planted with colocasia and amended with biochar vfcw 3 and vfcw 6 vfcw 3 column without aeration and vfcw 6 was designed with artificial intermittent aeration the three systems with aeration were externally aerated by a peristaltic pump at an airflow rate of 1 0 0 6 l min 1 for 6 h d 1 with aeration time of 3 h in the morning and 3 h at night the gap between the two aeration periods was kept at 9 h five treatments consisting of cod n ratios of 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 were administered in this present study in six mesoscale constructed wetlands to check the effectiveness and the stability of vfcws the study was conducted in two phases each phase of 45 days the first phase of 45 days in which each ratio was studied in triplicate before starting the second phase study the vfcws were kept for restoration the vfcws were filled with regular water for 30 days and after each 10 days water was drawn out through the outlet from the vfcws and for the proper growth of microbes activated sludge was added in small quantity after 10 days all the setups were kept in the outdoors of doon university dehradun india from may to august with a monsoon climate of medium latitudes all setups were established in a plastic circular reactor of 30 l capacity ø 33 5 cm and 37 cm height having the same bottom filling with four different substrate layers having a depth of 40 cm the influent synthetic wastewater was pumped to the reactor column and the effluent after passing through all the layers was collected at the bottom the reactor bed was filled with following composite layer down to top 5 cm gravels ø 20 21 mm 10 cm coarse gravel ø 8 12 mm 10 cm fine gravels ø 4 6 mm 15 cm rhizome layer made of a homogenized mixture of biochar 0 25 1 mm particle size and river bottom sand fig 1 the biochar was applied 10 dose v v of the top layer as suggested in the literature 17 for the intermittent aeration and determination of the do and ph values pvc pipes were incorporated into the systems reactor units were initially acclimatized for some time of 30 days and thereafter the formal experiment began which was operated for 120 days from the period may to august 2019 to take the observation of wastewater parameters in studied vfcws 2 2 experimental procedure to evaluate the effect of cod n ratio variation in six vfcw in may 2019 the established wetlands were fed with synthetic domestic wastewater with increasing strength of organic load to examine the reduction in vfcws the influent cod n ratio of synthetic wastewater was manipulated by changing the sucrose amount to prepare the five cod n ratios 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater used in this experiment included sucrose nh4 2so4 kh2po4 mgso4 cacl2 and feso4 which were prepared by mixing in tap water 21 table 1 shows the influent composition fed to the vfcws which were operated in fill and draw operational mode with a hydraulic retention time of 72 h 3 days the synthetic wastewater prepared was fed to the cws through peristaltic pumps at the start of each cycle at about 7 00 am until the water overflowed effluents of all the vfcws were collected from the outlet at the bottom of the reactor column the whole experimental process has been illustrated in fig 1 each cycle was conducted in triplicate during the experimental period and the whole experiment lasted from four may to august which was the growth period of colocasia 2 3 observation and analytical procedures for each cycle influent and effluent water samples 150 ml were collected at 6 30 am to analyze the transformation of nitrogen and organics in vfcws every 3rd day to get more reliable results the samples were collected in three batches keeping a gap of 15 min from the outlet of vfcw setups and then mixed to make a grab sample for analysis the characteristics of synthetic wastewater cod no3 n nh4 n tn and tp were estimated using standard methods as described in apha 27 apart from that do was determined using do meter hq40d hach usa and ph values of the samples were determined by ph meter all ar grade chemicals with 99 purity were utilized for the preparation of standards and solutions which were mostly provided by merck germany 2 4 statistical analysis all observations were recorded in triplicate and an average of three was reported as final results an analysis of variance anova was also calculated to see the difference among treatment setups the aerated and non aerated vfcw results were compared to find statistically significant differences using a t test all results were reported at a significance level of p 0 05 spss 17 0 window version software was used for all statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of cod n ratio on cod removal in vfcws the different operational strategies and varying influent load cod n in vfcws had a significant difference in the performance of vfcws as compared to the inlet cod load table 1 of 103 73 1 1 cod n ratio 313 13 3 1 cod n ratio 509 33 5 1 cod n ratio 817 28 8 1 cod n ratio and 1046 54 10 1 cod n ratio mg l 1 the effluent of cod was found to be in the ranges of 1 21 3 08 79 3 7 01 154 3 12 98 324 3 and 14 93 464 3 mg l 1 respectively showing significant difference among vfcws for overall cod removal rates fig 2 the removal of cod in different vfcws with varied cod n load is described in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for cod was found to be in 91 31 1 1 cod n ratio 87 08 3 1 cod n ratio 81 48 5 1 cod n ratio 75 02 8 1 cod n ratio and 68 53 10 1 cod n ratio in vfcw 3 colocasia biochar setup the maximum removal efficiency for cod was found to be in the range of 90 03 to 99 03 among intermittently aerated vfcws setups table 2 the regression between cod n ratio and removal rate is plotted in fig 3 it is clear from the regression analysis that a straight line could be seen in aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 76 to 0 91 showing no significant difference among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of cod while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 87 to 0 89 results indicate a high removal efficacy 90 of intermittently aerated vfcws for cod during this study in comparison to conventional wetland 55 without aerations the abundance of oxygen in setup vfcw 6 vfcw 5 and vfcw 4 by the supply of oxygen from external sources helped to create the oxygen rich environment by the virtue of which enhanced results were obtained the phenomenon behind the reduction of cod among vfcws is the aerobic degradation of microorganisms and the kinetics of oxidative reactions in the medium in all the vfcws without any external source of the air supply the main source of oxygen in conventional wetland becomes the atmospheric diffusion and the oxygen supply from the roots of plants 21 28 in the present study the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 87 to 0 89 this was mainly because of oxygen deficient conditions the minimum cod concentration among all the non aerated systems was recorded in vfcw 3 9 01 mg l 1 at cod n ratio 1 1 afterwards there was a gradual increase in the concentration of the effluent up to ratio 10 which was attributed due to do limitation this decrease in the removal efficiency with increasing organic load is because of the competitive environment created by the nitrification process for the consumption of oxygen due to two processes organic matter degradation nitrification process a sharp decline in do level by the virtue of which lower removal rates were observed as oxygen released by plants roots and through atmospheric diffusion is not sufficient for degradation when the organic load is high in the comparison of results with aerated wetlands the results were having a significant difference in the cod removal the removal rates for physicochemical parameters in different cws are described in table 3 in comparison with the present study however in the present study non aerated setups also showed promising results the maximum removal was observed in vfcw 3 followed by vfcw 2 and vfcw 1 vfcw 3 colocasia biochar setup which indicates the importance of plant species and biochar as a modified substrate in wetlands which led to higher cod removal significantly in cws employing the adsorption which was also acknowledged in previous literature 29 and apart from that it provides habitat to microbes during acclimatization period in cws further the addition of biochar in the wetland in planted wetland showed promising results as it offers enormous porosity and surface area which led to high adsorption and upgrades redox responses whenever applied in an appropriate sum in cws 30 31 one of the factors in enhanced cod reduction mechanism could be as the π π interaction electrostatic attraction repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bonding phenomenon among the molecules and the biochar 31 32 further biochar addition in the substratum also offers favourable space for microbial activity 33 which results into enhanced reduction an investigation by zhou et al 21 reported 91 80 cod removal in biochar added ssfcw and 83 49 in non biochar added which are quite similar to this study as well vfcw 1 showed lower removal results as compared to the other to system vfcw 2 and vfcw 3 the possible reason is documented in the previous literature as the supply of oxygen apart from atmospheric diffusion is mainly by the plant rhizome which supplies the oxygen to the submerged substrate in the cws 34 and which was missing the vfcw 1 which further also facilitates the microbial growth by the virtue of rapid degradation of organic load in wastewater 21 35 the results in this study in intermittently aerated systems were on the much higher side because of the presence of the abundant amount of oxygen due to artificial aeration which greatly elevates aerobic biodegradation of organic matter which is promoted by the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria 36 another factor for the removal on the higher side because the composition of synthetic wastewater only consisted of sucrose as an organic compound in the influent which is easily biodegradable and the summer temperature is also favourable for the degradation further previous literature also acknowledges the importance of the oxygen supply in the cws by external means for the degradation of the organic matter 5 15 a slight difference in the reduction was observed in vfcw 5 vfcw 6 which could be due to the biochar presence and absence in the wetland moreover the efficacy is quite similar in both systems suggesting that slow adsorption in comparison to a fast aerobic degradation whereas the slightly lower efficacy in vfcw 4 than that of vfcw 6 could be due to the absence of plant stand which also releases the oxygen in the substratum adding to that li et al 37 has also documented that correlation of do with the degradation of the organic matter the cod removal results of this study were comparable with the previous studies fan et al 18 reported 96 removal intermittent aerated vfcw similar to that jia et al 38 reported 96 in ssfcw with intermittent feeding strategies similar results also reported by ong et al 39 90 94 with continuous aeration sun et al 40 82 with tidal flow operation foladori et al 41 84 with effluent recirculation ju et al 42 85 with electrolysis tidal cw oon et al 43 100 with a microbial fuel cell vf cw zhou et al 5 also suggested that intermittent aeration and addition of biochar could scale up the wetland for the removal of wastewater pollutants 3 2 influence of aeration biochar and cod n ratio on the nh4 n dynamics in vfcw the transformation of nitrogen in wetland takes place under both nitrification and denitrification processes which is directly affected by the presence of oxygen in substratum 44 45 during the study period the inlet nh4 n load was 88 11 88 43 87 01 89 13 and 87 73 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 1 89 57 2 1 98 59 88 2 39 66 64 2 98 73 91 and 3 03 76 02 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio after treatment by different setups of vfcws the effluent concentration of nh4 n among all the vfcws was showing a significant difference fig 2 the regression curve plotted for nh4 n in fig 3 indicates a straight line that could be seen for the aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 84 to 0 96 showing no significant difference in the reduction among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of nh4 n while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 85 to 0 99 results indicate a high removal efficacy 85 of intermittently aerated vfcws for nh4 n during this study in comparison to conventional wetland with low reduction were observed in without aerations setups the possible mechanism in vfcws for the nh4 n reduction could be understood by the nitrification process which plays a vital role in nitrogen removal as it is a chemo autotrophic microbial aerobic process that promotes nitrogen removal 16 44 46 for having efficient and effective nitrification the wetlands often require a high do level but generally in vfcws oxygen deficit conditions occurs especially with high organic load 47 possibly this could be one of the reasons behind the poor performance of non aerated systems as the variation in effluents concentration could be seen in vfcw 1 varied from 57 2 to 76 02 mg l 1 similarly vfcw 2 55 22 to 73 99 mg l 1 and vfcw 3 41 01 to 70 97 mg l 1 with increase in the cod n ratios the effluent concentration reveals that vfcw 3 showed significantly better removal results the reason for the higher removals with vfcw 3 colocasia biochar system could be the potential of biochar to adsorb more nh4 n at the same time biochar also facilitates plants growth and through roots of plants nh4 n assimilation could take place as a result the higher reduction is attained then the other systems 21 48 an investigation by guo et al 24 reported a decrease in nh4 n removal efficacy from 53 9 to 43 1 in non biochar cws and from 66 3 to 54 8 in the biochar added cws when the cod n ratio increased from 3 to 12 this suggested that biochar addition in the wetland as a substrate could improve the performance of the wetland moreover an investigation in ssfw by zhou et al 21 also revealed the importance of biochar in a constructed wetland where they reported the maximum removal of 50 in the biochar added system and 39 97 in the non biochar added system the difference for nh4 n degradation rate between two systems with biochar and without biochar suggested that biochar addition in planted wetland could have improved plant growth and conditions for nh4 n oxidizing bacteria which plays an important role in nh4 n reduction 32 49 the porous structure of biochar acts as ideal habitats for the growth of microbes which could be supportive for further removal of nh4 n in vfcws 50 and allows atmospheric oxygen in the medium through diffusion 51 looking at the overall performance of the non aerated systems the performance was mainly affected due to the competitive environment for do in the vfcws system which leads to restrained nitrification with increasing organic load 21 34 52 transformation of nh4 n in wetlands implies the conversion of oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n and then further converted to no3 n which is largely impacted by do level 50 the nitrification process easily takes place when the concentration of do exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 24 53 the significant difference can be observed in the reduction rates as shown in fig 3 nh4 n reduction in the aerated system could reach above 97 under different cod n ratios as the effect of supplementary oxygen supply by intermittent aeration the comparison of a non aerated system with an intermittently aerated system indicated that increasing organic load in the influent cod n ratio was not able to consume all the oxygen provided by intermittent aeration by the virtue of which enhance nitrification results are observed during this study results revealed the higher reduction of the nh4 n in vfcw 6 up to 97 85 which outperformed the other two systems vfcw 2 up to 94 30 and vfcw 3 up to 87 37 suggesting the importance of biochar plant stand and the aeration in the cws the effluent nh4 n load suggested that there is a minor or negligible effect of increasing organic load in aerated vfcw which is acknowledged by the previous literature 6 53 further previous studies also reveals the importance of aeration for nh4 n removal 59 98 with continuous aeration 39 73 with effluent recirculation 41 84 with tidal flow operation 40 84 removal with bioaugmentation 54 and 96 1 with intermittently aerated system 18 3 3 influence of aeration biochar and cod n ratio on the no3 n dynamics in vfcw nitrification is restricted with the increase in the cod n ratio as the do levels decreases at the same time the essential do concentration 1 50 mg l 1 is suggested for optimal nitrification while do below 0 50 mg l 1 triggers anaerobic microbial processes 44 55 56 during the study the inlet no3 n load was 10 46 10 61 10 66 11 19 and 10 66 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 3 87 8 02 3 28 7 08 2 24 6 11 1 61 5 28 and 1 39 4 79 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio setups after treatment by different vfcws the effluent no3 n load among all the vfcws showed a significant difference the regression analysis suggested an increasing trend among the all vfcws vfcw 1 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 96 to 0 99 indicating a significant difference among vfcws for reducing rate of overall no3 n removals concerning increasing cod n load in influents in the non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate increased significantly over the increasing load of cod n results indicate a high removal efficacy reaching the maximum of 86 96 in non aerated vfcws the positive response for no3 n reduction with an increasing cod n ratio among the vfcws could be due to the competitive environment for do for organic degradation and nitrification process which leads to restrained nitrification with increasing organic load and could cause an oxygen deficient condition restricting denitrification 21 34 52 vfcw 1 showed an increase in removal efficacy from 63 69 to 86 96 by far this was the best output among all the six setups in the present study this could be mainly because of the absence of plants and the presence of biochar as the biochar has characteristics such as high porosity large surface area and also helps to provide the anoxic condition for the formation of microbial biofilm and that possibly could be another reason for the significant reductions in no3 n in the case of vfcw similarly in vfcw 2 the effluent concentration decreased from 7 22 to 4 05 mg l 1 with an increase in the cod n ratio to 10 this suggests the importance of the biochar in the vfcw for the reduction of no3 n which was further supported by the results of vfcw 3 that showed an increase in the efficiency from 44 93 to 78 14 with an increasing cod n ratio this indicates that a carbon source may provide an electron donor for denitrification 53 this finding attribute to the reduction of the organics and the consumption of oxygen which cause an appropriate environment for denitrification no3 n concentration in the effluent is mainly affected by the do level and thus cod n ratio and biochar in the substratum could acts as valuable source of carbon promoting denitrification in wetlands 5 in comparison intermittently aerated system the trend for the removal of no3 n was similar to that of non aerated with increasing cod n ratio the increasing cod n ratio 1 10 reflected in the decreased effluent concentration of vfcw 4 5 03 to 2 05 mg l 1 and from 6 11 to 3 01 mg l 1 in vfcw 6 the possible reason for the decrease in the effluent concentration with the increase in the cod n ratio in the aerated system could be the formation of aerobic and anoxic anaerobic zones together in aerated vfcws it is also reported and acknowledged in previous literature that intermittent aeration at a higher cod n ratio could lead to the formation of micro aerobic anaerobic regions through the stratification of biofilms 44 57 apart from that vfcw 5 showed removal efficacy from 24 76 to 55 06 which was quite on the lower side this signifies the amendment of biochar in vfcw for the enhanced reduction of no3 n li et al 37 investigating the role of influent concentration in sf cws reported a decrease in the effluent concentration from 21 82 to 2 55 mg l 1 with an increase in ratio cod n from 0 to 12 similarly lai et al 6 reported no3 n reduction from 57 94 to 81 18 in intermittently aerated vfcws with an increase in the cod n ratio 3 4 removal of tn the influent tn load was table 1 100 03 mg l 1 1 1 cod n ratio 100 23 mg l 1 3 1 cod n ratio 99 83 mg l 1 5 1 cod n ratio 100 83 mg l 1 8 1 cod n ratio and 100 13 mg l 1 10 1 cod n ratio and that changed to 13 01 66 31 mg l 1 8 01 71 09 mg l 1 8 54 75 09 mg l 1 8 96 78 72 mg l 1 and 9 19 81 22 mg l 1 respectively among vfcws fig 2 the removal of tn in different vfcws with varied cod n load is described in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for tn was found to be 87 01 1 1 cod n ratio 92 3 1 cod n ratio 91 47 5 1 cod n ratio 91 05 8 1 cod n ratio and 90 82 10 1 cod n ratio in vfcw 6 colocasia biochar intermittent aeration setup the removal efficiency for tn was found to be in the ranges of 18 88 to 45 79 among non aerated vfcws setups the regression between cod n ratio and tn removal rate is plotted in fig 3 it is clear from the regression analysis that a straight line could be seen in aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 49 to 0 51 showing no significant difference among vfcws for removal of tn with increasing cod n load while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 84 to 0 95 results indicate a high removal efficacy 75 in intermittently aerated vfcws for tn reduction than systems without aeration 50 the mechanism for the reduction of tn in non aerated systems could be understood by oxygen deficient conditions with the increasing ratio of con n that created a competitive environment for consumption of oxygen for nitrification and organics degradation in non aerated systems thus restraining the nitrification though it showed effective denitrification the poor nitrification with increasing ratio led to low tn removal 52 zhou et al 21 investigated in ssfcws with and without biochar in which they reported tn removal efficacy of 20 75 49 90 in biochar added and 10 02 39 23 in the non biochar systems in the present study among all the non aerated systems vfcw 3 showed a bit lower effluent tn load 54 28 75 33 mg l 1 in comparison to the other non aerated system this could be possibly due to the presence of biochar and the plant stand which possibly improved the performance of vfcw 3 biochar supports plant growth by the virtue of which nitrification was possible by providing a surface for nitrifying bacterial communities apart from that porous structures leads to an enriched do environment in setups the previous literature has also acknowledged the importance of biochar in n adsorption and further in its reduction through nitrification denitrification mechanisms 50 58 vymazal and kropfelova 47 reported that n removal in most wetlands was just changing between 40 and 55 because of inappropriate environment for nitrification and denitrification simultaneously after nitrification in an aerobic environment the no3 n and no2 n as electron accepters couldn t be reduced effectively unless adequate organic carbon acted as an extra electron donor carbon inadequacy could be the key limiting factor for tn reduction under low cod n conditions in aerated vfcw setup and thus no3 n was could be aided in the effluent tn loads 59 in comparison with the intermittently aerated vfcws showed promising results for tn reduction under varying influent cod n ratios possibly factors that account for promising results for tn removal in vfcws in the present study are sufficient carbon source the addition of biochar and intermittent aeration tn reduction results attained were greater than 70 and reaching to highest efficacy of 92 the possible explanation for higher removals during this study in the aerated system could lead to the formation of micro aerobic anaerobic regions through stratification of biofilms 44 57 for the n removal through nitrification denitrification and apart from that adsorption is also a key factor in n reduction in contradiction to the reduction of nh4 n and tn in conventional wetlands the present study was to seek an alternative for enhanced reduction of n in vfcws an investigation by zhu et al 60 reported that after attaining maximum reduction of tn value at cod n ratio 5 reduction of tn doesn t increase cod n ratio in this study the highest removal efficiency for tn was recorded in vfcw 6 from 87 to 92 the removal of tn showed an upwards trend with the increasing cod n ratio 1 3 and then suddenly follows a stable reduction of tn from cod n 5 high efficacy in vfcw 6 followed by vfcw 5 and vfcw 4 was due to the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification simultaneously with an intermittent aerated system the results in comparison with previously reported results for tn removal were similar or higher than that of lai et al 6 87 65 with intermittent aeration in vfcw fan et al 18 86 with intermittent aeration in ssfcw zhao et al 54 74 with bioaugmentation ong et al 39 with continuous aeration cws 69 92 where continuous aeration intermittent aeration and bioaugmentation was used to boots do in the cws however it is also noted that the initial n load is also important in the performance of cws 56 61 a comparative reduction of tn with different operation parameters substrate material is also given in table 3 3 5 tp transformation in vfcw during the study the inlet tp load was 4 02 4 12 4 07 4 01 and 4 08 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 1 01 2 03 0 91 2 1 0 74 2 35 0 56 2 33 and 0 43 2 41 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio setups after treatment by different setups of vfcws the effluent concentration of tp among all the vfcws was showing a significant difference fig 2 the regression curve plotted for tp in fig 3 indicates an increasing trend among all the vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 94 to 0 99 showing a significant difference in the reduction among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of tp in the non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased over the increasing load of cod n results indicate the removal efficacy reaching the maximum of 64 42 in non aerated vfcws tp reduction efficacy decreased in all the non aerated treatment setups with increasing cod n ratio but initially there was negligible difference in the removal efficacy from ratio 1 3 then afterwards it showed the downwards trend and among all non aerated systems vfcw 3 was dominant in the reduction of the tp from 64 42 51 71 followed by vfcw 2 56 96 44 11 and vfcw 1 49 50 40 93 the possible reason for improved results in vfcw 3 could be the presence of plants and the biochar amendment which can be responsible for tp reduction in cws includes physical chemical accumulation processes in the mineral media such as precipitation adsorption or accumulation in the substrate layer 29 32 apart from that the transformation of available p into microbial biomass was driven by microbes that inhabit the porous structure of biochar the mesoporous biochar could act as storage sites for dissolved organic substances as feeds for these microbes that possibly also boosted p biostabilization as well 62 ayaz et al 63 revealed that zeolites play a vital role in phosphate reduction from wastewater and thus the type of substrate layer in cws directly affects the phosphate reduction from the system literature also suggested microbial mediated p transformation and plant uptake in cws 64 65 apart from that operational such as flooding aeration intermittent tidal etc also influence the removal of the tp in the cws during the present study much higher results have been observed in aerated vfcws tp reduction efficacy was found to be better in vfcw 6 74 87 89 24 followed by the vfcw 5 66 91 76 71 and vfcw 4 63 93 76 22 an upward trend was observed reverse to that of non aerated systems the possible explanation for results in aerated systems could be the formation of anaerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones simultaneously the polyphosphates synthesis by the associated microbial communities in general found to be effective under aerobiosis but sometimes shows reversible reactions causing phosphate releasing under anaerobiosis conditions 45 66 67 jia et al 45 reported that the anaerobic condition may decrease tp removal in an investigation fan et al 52 reported the difference in the effluent concentration of tp in intermittent aerated 1 34 0 47 0 02 0 06 mg l 1 and non aerated system 2 05 0 50 1 15 0 57 mg l 1 with increasing cod n ratio similarly in the system with intermittent aeration jia et al 45 reported average effluent concentrations of tp ranged between 0 34 0 22 and 0 33 0 17 mg l 1 at f d 1 2 and 2 1 respectively the possible reason for enhanced reduction of tp in the intermittently aerated system is because of the oxidative condition of the substrate at the same time tp concentration in water is

13326,the effect of varying cod n ratio 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 10 1 of wastewater and intermittent aeration on treatment efficiency of biochar bc packed with 10 v v biochar vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw planted with colocasia esculenta was assessed in this study three setups of vfcw were prepared in two sets aerated with an airflow rate of 1 0 0 6 l min 1 for 6 h d 1 and non aeration and changes in cod nh4 n no3 n tn and tp total phosphorous in the effluent was investigated in vfcws with intermittent aeration cod nh4 n no3 n tp removal was 99 0 97 0 81 0 and 89 0 significantly higher p 0 05 than non aerated vfcw setups as 91 3 70 9 86 97 and 64 4 respectively in non aerated vfcws bc addition in combination with plantation was advantageous in the nutrient removal process than setups without bc cod n ratio of wastewater did not show a significant impact on the working of vfcws if amended with bc and intermittent aerations suggesting slow adsorption rate and fast aerobic degradation of organic matter the study suggests that oxygen supply management and bc addition in vfcws could be an effective strategy to treat wastewater with a high organic load apart from that study results will be useful for refinement of the operational strategy with varying organic load keywords biochar constructed wetland cod colocasia aeration nitrification denitrification 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are evolved as an eco friendly technique for the treatment of various kinds of wastewater mainly nitrogen reduction from the wastewater 1 3 the excessive discharge of nitrogen into the water bodies causes various adverse effect to aquatic life degrades the quality of water and led to eutrophication 4 therefore wastewater management before the discharge needs specific attention to avoid such circumstances 5 6 the discharged nitrogen into the streams mainly exists in the form of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n which are considered the main forms of inorganic n 7 in general cws are established as the sustainable ecosystem for the removal of contaminants from wastewater mainly due to their cost effectiveness low maintenance low secondary pollution and apart from that they add an aesthetic value to the surrounding 8 but due to the design and structure of cws the dissolved oxygen do levels in the subsurface flow cws generally remain low the limitation of oxygen supply in cws limits the nitrification process and nitrogen removal efficiencies 9 further to overcome such factors artificial aeration can be an effective way to induce do enriched environment in the cws apart from that an insufficient amount of carbon source is also a drawback for cws and its consequence is that it limits the nutrients for the growth of microbes and plants which directly affects the treatment mechanisms 10 to resolve the carbon limitation issue the use of an external source of carbon by adding liquid glucose fructose sucrose methanol and acetic acid and solid apricot pits rice husk wheat straw rice husk corn straw plant husk woody shells and synthetic polymers substances in working cws have been suggested in the published literature 4 11 the recent advancement in the substrate layer of cws has used a variety of substrates apart from conventional ones such as constructional waste agricultural waste biochar etc owing to the advantage as a carbon rich solid prepared in oxygen restricted environment by thermal decomposition of biomass biochar is the most preferred and utilized material in the recent investigations with a wide range of their application 12 13 substrates used in cws is one of the factors on which removal efficiency depends so to achieve better results amendment are continuously done in the substrate layer to check it s relevance in the pollutant removal efficiency of the cws the substratum should offer few important features like the existence of both aerobic and anaerobic pores inside the matrix to boost de nitrification nitrification and organic compounds removal providing an internal carbon source to reduce the reliance of de nitrification metabolism on the carbon availability in the wastewater however gravel substrates which are commonly used in treatment wetlands provide neither carbon nor necessary aerobic conditions thus their reduction capabilities for pollutants is often very limited 14 15 a high load of cod in wastewater could be one of the solutions for carbon deficient environment in cws 15 but it also further affect the nitrification and do utility rates in such systems 16 17 the exogenous carbon source which promotes denitrification which enhances the removal of nitrite n no2 n and nitrate n no3 n by providing electronic donor for the reaction process 5 although literature reported that the cod n ratio plays a dynamic role in the removal of the organics and the n compounds plenty of n removal studies in conventional cws have been observed at different cod n which suggest that complete removal of the tn from the wastewater depends on both nitrification and denitrification processes in the cws to enhance the reduction of pollutants the supply of oxygen by external means such as aeration continuous or intermittent aeration which have proven to be a good alternative for removal of the nitrogenous compounds from cws can be implied as it ensures both nitrification and denitrification process 18 19 to overcome such problems biochar amendment has been widely utilized due to its large surface area strong cation exchange capacity and high porosity enhances the removal of pollutants and reduces the emission of greenhouse gases ghgs 20 21 zhong et al 22 revealed that biochar amendment in cws could be a sustainable approach to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of such systems in their study they found that biochar addition effectively improved the removal of total n and no3 n in wastewater by 59 88 93 03 and 83 14 100 respectively possibly due to improved microclimatic conditions for microorganisms in the substrate and synergetic impact by biochar on heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers in cws bolton et al 23 reported the enhanced removal of phosphorous in sewage water treated in a cw amended with biochar they narrated that adsorption could be the possible mechanism of p removal from wastewater adding to that chand et al 17 also reported the significance of biochar amendment in the cws for the enhanced reduction of the nutrients from the vfcws lately studies with the amendment of biochar in cws and artificial aeration continuous and intermittent has been studied separately to check their significance for the enhanced removal of pollutants and also to see the effect of biochar on greenhouse gas emission 18 21 24 25 however there are only a few studies in a combination of artificial aeration and biochar 5 26 a study by zhou et al 5 reported much higher removal in aerated vfcw system with biochar for cod nh4 n tn 94 9 99 1 52 7 respectively and lower n2o emission 60 54 μg m 2 h 1 a similar kind of investigation conducted by jia et al 26 in vfcw with agricultural biomass and intermittent aeration which reported the optimal removal of cod nh4 n and tn 97 99 and 96 respectively at an influent c n ratio of 0 5 suggesting that the biomass load and c n ratio of the influent should be further improved to achieve the better removal of n in vfcws while treating wastewater with low carbon loads the present study is another step towards sustainable development for treating wastewater to the best of the author s knowledge the study for refinement of the design operational strategy and evaluate its acceptability feasibility and the minimum period for treating wastewater has not to be examined with intermittent aeration in combination with biochar cow dung and colocasia esculenta based vfcws simultaneously therefore this study targets to explore the increasing organic load under intermittent aeration with 72 h retention time each under ambient conditions combination in vfcws this study aimed 1 to investigate the impact of increasing load in vfcws with and without aeration 2 the study aimed to see the significance of biochar and plantation in vfcw at different cod n and 3 to see the relevance of plant stand and biochar with intermittent aeration in vfcws on the nutrient removal process this study could provide a better understanding on the impact of influent cod n load in vfcws in combination with intermittent aeration and biochar addition in terms of its functioning and the removal of n and organics substances from the wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental setup of vfcw six independent identical down flow mesoscale vfcws units were designed which were operated as reactor column with biochar dose no colocasia plantation vfcw 1 and vfcw 4 vfcw 1 system with no artificial aeration and vfcw 4 with intermittent aeration the system with colocasia without biochar vfcw 2 and vfcw 5 vfcw 2 column was designed without aeration and vfcw 4 was established with intermittent aeration column planted with colocasia and amended with biochar vfcw 3 and vfcw 6 vfcw 3 column without aeration and vfcw 6 was designed with artificial intermittent aeration the three systems with aeration were externally aerated by a peristaltic pump at an airflow rate of 1 0 0 6 l min 1 for 6 h d 1 with aeration time of 3 h in the morning and 3 h at night the gap between the two aeration periods was kept at 9 h five treatments consisting of cod n ratios of 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 were administered in this present study in six mesoscale constructed wetlands to check the effectiveness and the stability of vfcws the study was conducted in two phases each phase of 45 days the first phase of 45 days in which each ratio was studied in triplicate before starting the second phase study the vfcws were kept for restoration the vfcws were filled with regular water for 30 days and after each 10 days water was drawn out through the outlet from the vfcws and for the proper growth of microbes activated sludge was added in small quantity after 10 days all the setups were kept in the outdoors of doon university dehradun india from may to august with a monsoon climate of medium latitudes all setups were established in a plastic circular reactor of 30 l capacity ø 33 5 cm and 37 cm height having the same bottom filling with four different substrate layers having a depth of 40 cm the influent synthetic wastewater was pumped to the reactor column and the effluent after passing through all the layers was collected at the bottom the reactor bed was filled with following composite layer down to top 5 cm gravels ø 20 21 mm 10 cm coarse gravel ø 8 12 mm 10 cm fine gravels ø 4 6 mm 15 cm rhizome layer made of a homogenized mixture of biochar 0 25 1 mm particle size and river bottom sand fig 1 the biochar was applied 10 dose v v of the top layer as suggested in the literature 17 for the intermittent aeration and determination of the do and ph values pvc pipes were incorporated into the systems reactor units were initially acclimatized for some time of 30 days and thereafter the formal experiment began which was operated for 120 days from the period may to august 2019 to take the observation of wastewater parameters in studied vfcws 2 2 experimental procedure to evaluate the effect of cod n ratio variation in six vfcw in may 2019 the established wetlands were fed with synthetic domestic wastewater with increasing strength of organic load to examine the reduction in vfcws the influent cod n ratio of synthetic wastewater was manipulated by changing the sucrose amount to prepare the five cod n ratios 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 the composition of synthetic wastewater used in this experiment included sucrose nh4 2so4 kh2po4 mgso4 cacl2 and feso4 which were prepared by mixing in tap water 21 table 1 shows the influent composition fed to the vfcws which were operated in fill and draw operational mode with a hydraulic retention time of 72 h 3 days the synthetic wastewater prepared was fed to the cws through peristaltic pumps at the start of each cycle at about 7 00 am until the water overflowed effluents of all the vfcws were collected from the outlet at the bottom of the reactor column the whole experimental process has been illustrated in fig 1 each cycle was conducted in triplicate during the experimental period and the whole experiment lasted from four may to august which was the growth period of colocasia 2 3 observation and analytical procedures for each cycle influent and effluent water samples 150 ml were collected at 6 30 am to analyze the transformation of nitrogen and organics in vfcws every 3rd day to get more reliable results the samples were collected in three batches keeping a gap of 15 min from the outlet of vfcw setups and then mixed to make a grab sample for analysis the characteristics of synthetic wastewater cod no3 n nh4 n tn and tp were estimated using standard methods as described in apha 27 apart from that do was determined using do meter hq40d hach usa and ph values of the samples were determined by ph meter all ar grade chemicals with 99 purity were utilized for the preparation of standards and solutions which were mostly provided by merck germany 2 4 statistical analysis all observations were recorded in triplicate and an average of three was reported as final results an analysis of variance anova was also calculated to see the difference among treatment setups the aerated and non aerated vfcw results were compared to find statistically significant differences using a t test all results were reported at a significance level of p 0 05 spss 17 0 window version software was used for all statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of cod n ratio on cod removal in vfcws the different operational strategies and varying influent load cod n in vfcws had a significant difference in the performance of vfcws as compared to the inlet cod load table 1 of 103 73 1 1 cod n ratio 313 13 3 1 cod n ratio 509 33 5 1 cod n ratio 817 28 8 1 cod n ratio and 1046 54 10 1 cod n ratio mg l 1 the effluent of cod was found to be in the ranges of 1 21 3 08 79 3 7 01 154 3 12 98 324 3 and 14 93 464 3 mg l 1 respectively showing significant difference among vfcws for overall cod removal rates fig 2 the removal of cod in different vfcws with varied cod n load is described in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for cod was found to be in 91 31 1 1 cod n ratio 87 08 3 1 cod n ratio 81 48 5 1 cod n ratio 75 02 8 1 cod n ratio and 68 53 10 1 cod n ratio in vfcw 3 colocasia biochar setup the maximum removal efficiency for cod was found to be in the range of 90 03 to 99 03 among intermittently aerated vfcws setups table 2 the regression between cod n ratio and removal rate is plotted in fig 3 it is clear from the regression analysis that a straight line could be seen in aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 76 to 0 91 showing no significant difference among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of cod while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 87 to 0 89 results indicate a high removal efficacy 90 of intermittently aerated vfcws for cod during this study in comparison to conventional wetland 55 without aerations the abundance of oxygen in setup vfcw 6 vfcw 5 and vfcw 4 by the supply of oxygen from external sources helped to create the oxygen rich environment by the virtue of which enhanced results were obtained the phenomenon behind the reduction of cod among vfcws is the aerobic degradation of microorganisms and the kinetics of oxidative reactions in the medium in all the vfcws without any external source of the air supply the main source of oxygen in conventional wetland becomes the atmospheric diffusion and the oxygen supply from the roots of plants 21 28 in the present study the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 87 to 0 89 this was mainly because of oxygen deficient conditions the minimum cod concentration among all the non aerated systems was recorded in vfcw 3 9 01 mg l 1 at cod n ratio 1 1 afterwards there was a gradual increase in the concentration of the effluent up to ratio 10 which was attributed due to do limitation this decrease in the removal efficiency with increasing organic load is because of the competitive environment created by the nitrification process for the consumption of oxygen due to two processes organic matter degradation nitrification process a sharp decline in do level by the virtue of which lower removal rates were observed as oxygen released by plants roots and through atmospheric diffusion is not sufficient for degradation when the organic load is high in the comparison of results with aerated wetlands the results were having a significant difference in the cod removal the removal rates for physicochemical parameters in different cws are described in table 3 in comparison with the present study however in the present study non aerated setups also showed promising results the maximum removal was observed in vfcw 3 followed by vfcw 2 and vfcw 1 vfcw 3 colocasia biochar setup which indicates the importance of plant species and biochar as a modified substrate in wetlands which led to higher cod removal significantly in cws employing the adsorption which was also acknowledged in previous literature 29 and apart from that it provides habitat to microbes during acclimatization period in cws further the addition of biochar in the wetland in planted wetland showed promising results as it offers enormous porosity and surface area which led to high adsorption and upgrades redox responses whenever applied in an appropriate sum in cws 30 31 one of the factors in enhanced cod reduction mechanism could be as the π π interaction electrostatic attraction repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bonding phenomenon among the molecules and the biochar 31 32 further biochar addition in the substratum also offers favourable space for microbial activity 33 which results into enhanced reduction an investigation by zhou et al 21 reported 91 80 cod removal in biochar added ssfcw and 83 49 in non biochar added which are quite similar to this study as well vfcw 1 showed lower removal results as compared to the other to system vfcw 2 and vfcw 3 the possible reason is documented in the previous literature as the supply of oxygen apart from atmospheric diffusion is mainly by the plant rhizome which supplies the oxygen to the submerged substrate in the cws 34 and which was missing the vfcw 1 which further also facilitates the microbial growth by the virtue of rapid degradation of organic load in wastewater 21 35 the results in this study in intermittently aerated systems were on the much higher side because of the presence of the abundant amount of oxygen due to artificial aeration which greatly elevates aerobic biodegradation of organic matter which is promoted by the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria 36 another factor for the removal on the higher side because the composition of synthetic wastewater only consisted of sucrose as an organic compound in the influent which is easily biodegradable and the summer temperature is also favourable for the degradation further previous literature also acknowledges the importance of the oxygen supply in the cws by external means for the degradation of the organic matter 5 15 a slight difference in the reduction was observed in vfcw 5 vfcw 6 which could be due to the biochar presence and absence in the wetland moreover the efficacy is quite similar in both systems suggesting that slow adsorption in comparison to a fast aerobic degradation whereas the slightly lower efficacy in vfcw 4 than that of vfcw 6 could be due to the absence of plant stand which also releases the oxygen in the substratum adding to that li et al 37 has also documented that correlation of do with the degradation of the organic matter the cod removal results of this study were comparable with the previous studies fan et al 18 reported 96 removal intermittent aerated vfcw similar to that jia et al 38 reported 96 in ssfcw with intermittent feeding strategies similar results also reported by ong et al 39 90 94 with continuous aeration sun et al 40 82 with tidal flow operation foladori et al 41 84 with effluent recirculation ju et al 42 85 with electrolysis tidal cw oon et al 43 100 with a microbial fuel cell vf cw zhou et al 5 also suggested that intermittent aeration and addition of biochar could scale up the wetland for the removal of wastewater pollutants 3 2 influence of aeration biochar and cod n ratio on the nh4 n dynamics in vfcw the transformation of nitrogen in wetland takes place under both nitrification and denitrification processes which is directly affected by the presence of oxygen in substratum 44 45 during the study period the inlet nh4 n load was 88 11 88 43 87 01 89 13 and 87 73 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 1 89 57 2 1 98 59 88 2 39 66 64 2 98 73 91 and 3 03 76 02 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio after treatment by different setups of vfcws the effluent concentration of nh4 n among all the vfcws was showing a significant difference fig 2 the regression curve plotted for nh4 n in fig 3 indicates a straight line that could be seen for the aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 84 to 0 96 showing no significant difference in the reduction among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of nh4 n while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 85 to 0 99 results indicate a high removal efficacy 85 of intermittently aerated vfcws for nh4 n during this study in comparison to conventional wetland with low reduction were observed in without aerations setups the possible mechanism in vfcws for the nh4 n reduction could be understood by the nitrification process which plays a vital role in nitrogen removal as it is a chemo autotrophic microbial aerobic process that promotes nitrogen removal 16 44 46 for having efficient and effective nitrification the wetlands often require a high do level but generally in vfcws oxygen deficit conditions occurs especially with high organic load 47 possibly this could be one of the reasons behind the poor performance of non aerated systems as the variation in effluents concentration could be seen in vfcw 1 varied from 57 2 to 76 02 mg l 1 similarly vfcw 2 55 22 to 73 99 mg l 1 and vfcw 3 41 01 to 70 97 mg l 1 with increase in the cod n ratios the effluent concentration reveals that vfcw 3 showed significantly better removal results the reason for the higher removals with vfcw 3 colocasia biochar system could be the potential of biochar to adsorb more nh4 n at the same time biochar also facilitates plants growth and through roots of plants nh4 n assimilation could take place as a result the higher reduction is attained then the other systems 21 48 an investigation by guo et al 24 reported a decrease in nh4 n removal efficacy from 53 9 to 43 1 in non biochar cws and from 66 3 to 54 8 in the biochar added cws when the cod n ratio increased from 3 to 12 this suggested that biochar addition in the wetland as a substrate could improve the performance of the wetland moreover an investigation in ssfw by zhou et al 21 also revealed the importance of biochar in a constructed wetland where they reported the maximum removal of 50 in the biochar added system and 39 97 in the non biochar added system the difference for nh4 n degradation rate between two systems with biochar and without biochar suggested that biochar addition in planted wetland could have improved plant growth and conditions for nh4 n oxidizing bacteria which plays an important role in nh4 n reduction 32 49 the porous structure of biochar acts as ideal habitats for the growth of microbes which could be supportive for further removal of nh4 n in vfcws 50 and allows atmospheric oxygen in the medium through diffusion 51 looking at the overall performance of the non aerated systems the performance was mainly affected due to the competitive environment for do in the vfcws system which leads to restrained nitrification with increasing organic load 21 34 52 transformation of nh4 n in wetlands implies the conversion of oxidation of nh4 n to no2 n and then further converted to no3 n which is largely impacted by do level 50 the nitrification process easily takes place when the concentration of do exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 1 24 53 the significant difference can be observed in the reduction rates as shown in fig 3 nh4 n reduction in the aerated system could reach above 97 under different cod n ratios as the effect of supplementary oxygen supply by intermittent aeration the comparison of a non aerated system with an intermittently aerated system indicated that increasing organic load in the influent cod n ratio was not able to consume all the oxygen provided by intermittent aeration by the virtue of which enhance nitrification results are observed during this study results revealed the higher reduction of the nh4 n in vfcw 6 up to 97 85 which outperformed the other two systems vfcw 2 up to 94 30 and vfcw 3 up to 87 37 suggesting the importance of biochar plant stand and the aeration in the cws the effluent nh4 n load suggested that there is a minor or negligible effect of increasing organic load in aerated vfcw which is acknowledged by the previous literature 6 53 further previous studies also reveals the importance of aeration for nh4 n removal 59 98 with continuous aeration 39 73 with effluent recirculation 41 84 with tidal flow operation 40 84 removal with bioaugmentation 54 and 96 1 with intermittently aerated system 18 3 3 influence of aeration biochar and cod n ratio on the no3 n dynamics in vfcw nitrification is restricted with the increase in the cod n ratio as the do levels decreases at the same time the essential do concentration 1 50 mg l 1 is suggested for optimal nitrification while do below 0 50 mg l 1 triggers anaerobic microbial processes 44 55 56 during the study the inlet no3 n load was 10 46 10 61 10 66 11 19 and 10 66 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 3 87 8 02 3 28 7 08 2 24 6 11 1 61 5 28 and 1 39 4 79 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio setups after treatment by different vfcws the effluent no3 n load among all the vfcws showed a significant difference the regression analysis suggested an increasing trend among the all vfcws vfcw 1 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 96 to 0 99 indicating a significant difference among vfcws for reducing rate of overall no3 n removals concerning increasing cod n load in influents in the non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate increased significantly over the increasing load of cod n results indicate a high removal efficacy reaching the maximum of 86 96 in non aerated vfcws the positive response for no3 n reduction with an increasing cod n ratio among the vfcws could be due to the competitive environment for do for organic degradation and nitrification process which leads to restrained nitrification with increasing organic load and could cause an oxygen deficient condition restricting denitrification 21 34 52 vfcw 1 showed an increase in removal efficacy from 63 69 to 86 96 by far this was the best output among all the six setups in the present study this could be mainly because of the absence of plants and the presence of biochar as the biochar has characteristics such as high porosity large surface area and also helps to provide the anoxic condition for the formation of microbial biofilm and that possibly could be another reason for the significant reductions in no3 n in the case of vfcw similarly in vfcw 2 the effluent concentration decreased from 7 22 to 4 05 mg l 1 with an increase in the cod n ratio to 10 this suggests the importance of the biochar in the vfcw for the reduction of no3 n which was further supported by the results of vfcw 3 that showed an increase in the efficiency from 44 93 to 78 14 with an increasing cod n ratio this indicates that a carbon source may provide an electron donor for denitrification 53 this finding attribute to the reduction of the organics and the consumption of oxygen which cause an appropriate environment for denitrification no3 n concentration in the effluent is mainly affected by the do level and thus cod n ratio and biochar in the substratum could acts as valuable source of carbon promoting denitrification in wetlands 5 in comparison intermittently aerated system the trend for the removal of no3 n was similar to that of non aerated with increasing cod n ratio the increasing cod n ratio 1 10 reflected in the decreased effluent concentration of vfcw 4 5 03 to 2 05 mg l 1 and from 6 11 to 3 01 mg l 1 in vfcw 6 the possible reason for the decrease in the effluent concentration with the increase in the cod n ratio in the aerated system could be the formation of aerobic and anoxic anaerobic zones together in aerated vfcws it is also reported and acknowledged in previous literature that intermittent aeration at a higher cod n ratio could lead to the formation of micro aerobic anaerobic regions through the stratification of biofilms 44 57 apart from that vfcw 5 showed removal efficacy from 24 76 to 55 06 which was quite on the lower side this signifies the amendment of biochar in vfcw for the enhanced reduction of no3 n li et al 37 investigating the role of influent concentration in sf cws reported a decrease in the effluent concentration from 21 82 to 2 55 mg l 1 with an increase in ratio cod n from 0 to 12 similarly lai et al 6 reported no3 n reduction from 57 94 to 81 18 in intermittently aerated vfcws with an increase in the cod n ratio 3 4 removal of tn the influent tn load was table 1 100 03 mg l 1 1 1 cod n ratio 100 23 mg l 1 3 1 cod n ratio 99 83 mg l 1 5 1 cod n ratio 100 83 mg l 1 8 1 cod n ratio and 100 13 mg l 1 10 1 cod n ratio and that changed to 13 01 66 31 mg l 1 8 01 71 09 mg l 1 8 54 75 09 mg l 1 8 96 78 72 mg l 1 and 9 19 81 22 mg l 1 respectively among vfcws fig 2 the removal of tn in different vfcws with varied cod n load is described in fig 3 the maximum removal efficiency for tn was found to be 87 01 1 1 cod n ratio 92 3 1 cod n ratio 91 47 5 1 cod n ratio 91 05 8 1 cod n ratio and 90 82 10 1 cod n ratio in vfcw 6 colocasia biochar intermittent aeration setup the removal efficiency for tn was found to be in the ranges of 18 88 to 45 79 among non aerated vfcws setups the regression between cod n ratio and tn removal rate is plotted in fig 3 it is clear from the regression analysis that a straight line could be seen in aerated vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 49 to 0 51 showing no significant difference among vfcws for removal of tn with increasing cod n load while in non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased significantly over the increasing load of cod n in the setups r 2 0 84 to 0 95 results indicate a high removal efficacy 75 in intermittently aerated vfcws for tn reduction than systems without aeration 50 the mechanism for the reduction of tn in non aerated systems could be understood by oxygen deficient conditions with the increasing ratio of con n that created a competitive environment for consumption of oxygen for nitrification and organics degradation in non aerated systems thus restraining the nitrification though it showed effective denitrification the poor nitrification with increasing ratio led to low tn removal 52 zhou et al 21 investigated in ssfcws with and without biochar in which they reported tn removal efficacy of 20 75 49 90 in biochar added and 10 02 39 23 in the non biochar systems in the present study among all the non aerated systems vfcw 3 showed a bit lower effluent tn load 54 28 75 33 mg l 1 in comparison to the other non aerated system this could be possibly due to the presence of biochar and the plant stand which possibly improved the performance of vfcw 3 biochar supports plant growth by the virtue of which nitrification was possible by providing a surface for nitrifying bacterial communities apart from that porous structures leads to an enriched do environment in setups the previous literature has also acknowledged the importance of biochar in n adsorption and further in its reduction through nitrification denitrification mechanisms 50 58 vymazal and kropfelova 47 reported that n removal in most wetlands was just changing between 40 and 55 because of inappropriate environment for nitrification and denitrification simultaneously after nitrification in an aerobic environment the no3 n and no2 n as electron accepters couldn t be reduced effectively unless adequate organic carbon acted as an extra electron donor carbon inadequacy could be the key limiting factor for tn reduction under low cod n conditions in aerated vfcw setup and thus no3 n was could be aided in the effluent tn loads 59 in comparison with the intermittently aerated vfcws showed promising results for tn reduction under varying influent cod n ratios possibly factors that account for promising results for tn removal in vfcws in the present study are sufficient carbon source the addition of biochar and intermittent aeration tn reduction results attained were greater than 70 and reaching to highest efficacy of 92 the possible explanation for higher removals during this study in the aerated system could lead to the formation of micro aerobic anaerobic regions through stratification of biofilms 44 57 for the n removal through nitrification denitrification and apart from that adsorption is also a key factor in n reduction in contradiction to the reduction of nh4 n and tn in conventional wetlands the present study was to seek an alternative for enhanced reduction of n in vfcws an investigation by zhu et al 60 reported that after attaining maximum reduction of tn value at cod n ratio 5 reduction of tn doesn t increase cod n ratio in this study the highest removal efficiency for tn was recorded in vfcw 6 from 87 to 92 the removal of tn showed an upwards trend with the increasing cod n ratio 1 3 and then suddenly follows a stable reduction of tn from cod n 5 high efficacy in vfcw 6 followed by vfcw 5 and vfcw 4 was due to the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification simultaneously with an intermittent aerated system the results in comparison with previously reported results for tn removal were similar or higher than that of lai et al 6 87 65 with intermittent aeration in vfcw fan et al 18 86 with intermittent aeration in ssfcw zhao et al 54 74 with bioaugmentation ong et al 39 with continuous aeration cws 69 92 where continuous aeration intermittent aeration and bioaugmentation was used to boots do in the cws however it is also noted that the initial n load is also important in the performance of cws 56 61 a comparative reduction of tn with different operation parameters substrate material is also given in table 3 3 5 tp transformation in vfcw during the study the inlet tp load was 4 02 4 12 4 07 4 01 and 4 08 mg l 1 and that reduced to a range of 1 01 2 03 0 91 2 1 0 74 2 35 0 56 2 33 and 0 43 2 41 mg l 1 respectively in 1 1 3 1 5 1 8 1 and 10 1 cod n ratio setups after treatment by different setups of vfcws the effluent concentration of tp among all the vfcws was showing a significant difference fig 2 the regression curve plotted for tp in fig 3 indicates an increasing trend among all the vfcws vfcw 4 to vfcw 6 r 2 0 94 to 0 99 showing a significant difference in the reduction among vfcws with increasing cod n load for overall removal of tp in the non aerated setups vfcw 1 to vfcw 3 the removal rate decreased over the increasing load of cod n results indicate the removal efficacy reaching the maximum of 64 42 in non aerated vfcws tp reduction efficacy decreased in all the non aerated treatment setups with increasing cod n ratio but initially there was negligible difference in the removal efficacy from ratio 1 3 then afterwards it showed the downwards trend and among all non aerated systems vfcw 3 was dominant in the reduction of the tp from 64 42 51 71 followed by vfcw 2 56 96 44 11 and vfcw 1 49 50 40 93 the possible reason for improved results in vfcw 3 could be the presence of plants and the biochar amendment which can be responsible for tp reduction in cws includes physical chemical accumulation processes in the mineral media such as precipitation adsorption or accumulation in the substrate layer 29 32 apart from that the transformation of available p into microbial biomass was driven by microbes that inhabit the porous structure of biochar the mesoporous biochar could act as storage sites for dissolved organic substances as feeds for these microbes that possibly also boosted p biostabilization as well 62 ayaz et al 63 revealed that zeolites play a vital role in phosphate reduction from wastewater and thus the type of substrate layer in cws directly affects the phosphate reduction from the system literature also suggested microbial mediated p transformation and plant uptake in cws 64 65 apart from that operational such as flooding aeration intermittent tidal etc also influence the removal of the tp in the cws during the present study much higher results have been observed in aerated vfcws tp reduction efficacy was found to be better in vfcw 6 74 87 89 24 followed by the vfcw 5 66 91 76 71 and vfcw 4 63 93 76 22 an upward trend was observed reverse to that of non aerated systems the possible explanation for results in aerated systems could be the formation of anaerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones simultaneously the polyphosphates synthesis by the associated microbial communities in general found to be effective under aerobiosis but sometimes shows reversible reactions causing phosphate releasing under anaerobiosis conditions 45 66 67 jia et al 45 reported that the anaerobic condition may decrease tp removal in an investigation fan et al 52 reported the difference in the effluent concentration of tp in intermittent aerated 1 34 0 47 0 02 0 06 mg l 1 and non aerated system 2 05 0 50 1 15 0 57 mg l 1 with increasing cod n ratio similarly in the system with intermittent aeration jia et al 45 reported average effluent concentrations of tp ranged between 0 34 0 22 and 0 33 0 17 mg l 1 at f d 1 2 and 2 1 respectively the possible reason for enhanced reduction of tp in the intermittently aerated system is because of the oxidative condition of the substrate at the same time tp concentration in water is negatively correlated with redox potential 45 68 4 conclusions results of this study signifies the importance of the do supply biochar addition in planted systems influent cod n ratio etc on n reduction and regulating the n transformation pathway in intermittently aerated systems the optimal removal results during the study were obtained with the aerated vfcws for cod 99 nh4 n 97 tn 87 and tp 89 except to no3 n which showed better removal rate 87 in no aerated system the alternate cycle of the aerobic and anoxic cycle was developed possibly due to the intermittent aeration supporting the nitrification and denitrification processes in the vfcws the results of this study could be beneficial for the refinement of the design operational strategy for the treatment of wastewater using

13327,the effects of the three carbon sources glucose sodium acetate and sucrose on the transformation of nitrogen and phosphorous forms in an aerobic granular sludge ags system were investigated in addition the microbial community in the sludge was analyzed dissolved organic nitrogen removal efficiency in the sodium acetate group remained good throughout the experimental period with a removal rate of around 90 the members of paracoccus and anaerorhabdus could hardly use saccharides and therefore accounted for a small amount of the overall bacteria in the groups with glucose and sucrose the proportion of membrane transport function genes was the largest in the sodium acetate group with the value reaching to 14 05 the gene abundance of glycolysis in three groups were 1 12 1 06 and 1 09 respectively meanwhile the genes nirk norb c and nosz responsible for the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen in the sodium acetate group were higher than the glucose and sucrose groups gene abundance of glycolysis was largest in the glucose group graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge carbon source nitrogen form kegg nitrogen metabolism 1 introduction more and more attention is being paid to the adverse effects of anthropogenic emissions of excess nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus into surface water bodies 1 uncontrolled discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus may result in eutrophication bringing undesirable consequences such as oxygen depletion algae blooms and the death of organisms 2 4 at present the standards of municipal wastewater treatment plants are constantly strict which puts forward higher requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus standard discharge in practice the removal of biological nutrient is regarded as the most sustainable and economical way to meet increasingly stringent global emission standards biological nutrient 5 in the traditional activated sludge process the solid residence time is shorter while the generation time of nitrifying bacteria is longer which affects the efficiency of nitrogen removal due to the contradiction of denitrification and phosphorus removal it is difficult to realize efficient denitrification and phosphorus removal by traditional activated sludge method deng et al 6 investigated the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater through nitritation denitritation coupling improved anammox process with an optimal anaerobic oxic anoxic strategy yan et al 7 had improved performance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification via nitrite in an oxygen limited sequencing batch reactor sbr by alternating the dissolved oxygen do therefore new techniques are needed to improve the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus 8 a new generation of bioreactor based on aerobic granular sludge ags has a high removal efficiency for nutrients from wastewater relies on excellent settleability of sludge small footprint of reactor high organic load capacity high biomass retention rate and biological activity and the ability for simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 5 9 10 therefore ags is therefore considered as a sustainable and promising alternative for nutrient removal 11 12 zhang et al 13 systematically reviewed the effect of short settling time cation ion s coagulant or inert carrier addition seeding pellets crushed or intact granules and self aggregation bacteria on rapid ags formation the research laid a foundation for the establishment of aerobic granular sludge rapid formation system in wastewater treatment the performance of ags was affected by many factors such as organic load rate carbon nitrogen ratio type of sludge inoculation etc and the carbon source was also an important factor 14 15 carbon source plays a vital role in nitrogen and phosphorus removal because denitrification and phosphorus release processes require carbon source 16 carbon source not only had an important impact on the performance of biological treatment reactor but also had a great impact on the microbial communities in the sludge 16 some authors have indicated that different carbon sources had a crucial effect on the sludge characteristics of ags and also affects on ags system performance and microbial communities 14 15 17 du et al 18 observed that acetate could lead to spherical and dense granules while granules fed by propionate were stable and dense rollemberg et al 19 had indicated that glucose often led to filamentous granules to date few studies have investigated the impact of the carbon source type on nitrogen forms in wastewater and phosphorus forms in aerobic granular sludge 20 moreover the genetic influence of different carbon sources on carbohydrate metabolism in microorganisms in the ags has also been rarely explored respective studies can provide a deeper understanding of the forms and transformation of nitrogen pollution consequently improving nutrient removal efficiencies hence we applied glucose sodium acetate and sucrose as carbon sources for the operation of an ags system the study aims to reveal the effects of these three carbon sources on the transformation of nitrogen forms in the ags system in addition the effects of carbon sources on microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput sequencing technique were further explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device and operation the experiment was carried out by using three 800 ml beakers a b c as reactors the effective volume of each reactor was 500 ml the operating cycle of the reactor was 12 h which comprised of 8 h aeration 0 5 h settling and 3 5 h standing the experiment was run constantly for 40 days the reactors were parallelly operated as follows a feeding with glucose as carbon source b feeding with sodium acetate and c feeding with sucrose ags was taken from an environmental protection company in nanning city guangxi province china the particle size of aerobic granular sludge was approximately 2 3 mm with compact structure each reactor was inoculated 200 ml ags the influent used in the experiment was domestic wastewater which was obtained from the qilidian wastewater treatment plant guilin guangxi with a cod concentration of about 200 mg l glucose sodium acetate and sucrose were added to the influent respectively the total cod concentration of the influent was set at 500 mg l ammonia chloride nh4cl was the nitrogen source and potassium phosphate monobasic kh2po4 was used as the phosphorus source which contained approximately 20 mg l ammonia nitrogen and 3 mg l total phosphorus 5 2 2 analyses and calculations the cod ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen concentrations of the influent and effluent were measured in accordance with standard methods 21 extraction of extracellular polymeric substance eps from ags was performed using an ultrasound and heat method according to the literature 22 eps was analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the 150 w xenon lamp was used as the excitation light source the scanning speed was set at 2400 nm min both the emission and excitation slit widths were set to 5 nm the range of the excitation wavelength ex from 220 nm to 500 nm and the range of the emission wavelength em from 220 nm to 550 nm the electron transport system ets activity of the ags was quantified using 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int following the method of wang et al 23 and 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc according to the method of cheng et al 24 nitrogen morphological analysis was performed according to a previous study 25 after 40 days of experimental operation 2 ml ags samples were collected from the three beakers a b and c for high throughput sequencing analysis the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega usa was used to extract the dna from the sludge samples 26 the general primer 341f and 805r sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china targeted at the v3 4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna were used for amplification 27 the performing of pcr amplification was used following the methods by li et al 28 the raw tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by 97 identity 29 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to generate a functional profile based on the 16s rrna gene data illumina miseq usa 30 the functional genes and metabolic pathways were annotated by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases 64 the glycolytic pathway was separated from kegg viewer module 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different carbon sources on cod removal from ags the removal of cod by adding different carbon sources a glucose b sodium acetate c sucrose to the ags system is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the experiment the carbon source only slightly influenced the ags system and the average cod removal rate of the three beakers reached about 92 within the first 10 days over time the influence of the carbon source on the cod removal could be observed the removal effect of cod in the a reactor with glucose as carbon source was basically stable and the cod removal effect was slightly improved at the end of the experiment at days 31 40 the average cod removal rate was 93 46 in the a group in the b group with sodium acetate as carbon source the cod removal efficiency decreased gradually and the removal rate of cod fluctuated greatly at the end of the experiment showing a downward trend the average cod removal rate decreased to 87 27 at days 11 20 86 75 at days 21 30 and 85 96 at days 31 40 the removal rate of cod in the c group with sucrose as external carbon source was also basically stable with an average cod removal rate of 88 79 from days 31 40 which decreased slightly compared with the cod removal rate at the beginning of the experiment the addition of glucose carbon source improved the efficiency of the microorganisms in the ags and the removal of cod in the group a was more stable the average cod removal rate was 92 33 which was the highest among the three groups the effect of sodium acetate on the ags was small and the removal rate of cod fluctuated greatly with 88 05 the average removal rate of cod in the sodium acetate group was the smallest of the three groups on the whole different carbon sources had a minor effect on the cod removal rate in the ags system 3 2 effects of different carbon sources on nitrogen forms in the effluent different carbon sources have different effects on the particle size sludge stability and pollutants removal efficiency of ags 14 15 as shown in table s1 and fig 2 the influent used in the experiment mainly consisted of dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved ammonia nitrogen d ammonia particulate organic nitrogen pon and adsorbed ammonia nitrogen a ammonia groups a b and c were better in removing these nitrogen forms on the first day of the experiment total nitrogen tn removal was highest in the group b with sodium acetate as carbon source which decreased from 50 17 to 11 67 mg l during the experiments the removal efficiency of the groups a b and c for tn increased with the group b showing the highest total nitrogen removal at the middle and end period of the experiment on days 1 and 40 the d ammonia removal efficiency of the group b was relatively high in groups a and c d ammonia removal efficiency at day 20 was decreased at day 40 for groups a and b d ammonia removal efficiency improved fig 2 granule disintegration of ags was observed during the experiment rollemberg et al 19 also found that nh4 removal was reduced during granule disintegration which may be due to the loss of nitrifying bacteria present in the broken granules during the experiment the inoculated ags was affected by entering the new experimental environment which led to the disintegration of ags granules over time new granules were formed which were lighter in color and smaller in diameter all groups were similarly effective in removing pon but showed differences in removing don the don removal effect in the group b remained good throughout the experimental period with a removal rate of around 90 in the groups a and c the don removal showed a slight decline and then an upward trend which may be related to the disintegration of carbon sources and particles 32 3 3 analysis of electron transport system activity of ags electron transport system activity is an important index to evaluate the metabolic activity of microorganism 23 biological denitrification and dehydrogenase depend on the electron transport and consumption system 33 34 fig s1 shows the influence of different carbon sources on the electron transport system activity of ags when sodium acetate was added as a carbon source the int est activity of ags reached its maximum value of 15 43 μg mg h at the 20 day glucose and sucrose as carbon sources showed little difference in int est activity at the initial stage finally the int est activities of ags in a b and c groups were 5 48 μg mg h 6 72 μg mg h and 5 99 μg mg h respectively over time three groups of ttc ets activity showed significant growth especially with glucose as carbon source the ttc ets activity at day 40 were 96 26 48 48 and 46 50 μg mg h 1 respectively glucose is a simple sugar and can be directly used in sugar metabolism via glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in contrast sucrose a disaccharide needs to be broken down first sodium acetate can be used directly by denitrifying bacteria ets activity results proved the facilitated electron transfer system with glucose addition the quantity and quality of carbon sources determine the regulation of denitrification methane production microbial growth and respiration while carbon sources control electron transport 35 3 4 eem analysis of eps eps secreted by bacterial cells play a critical role in the physiochemical characteristics settleability performance and aggregation capacity of ags 36 fluorescence spectroscopy is an efficient tool in discriminating among different fluorescent fractions of protein like fulvic like humic like components and other aromatic xenobiotics owing to its easy and fast detection 37 here eem can be employed for the quantitative analysis of eps 38 the location and intensity of a fluorescence peak can show the composition and content of sludge eps fig s2 shows the eem fluorescence spectrogram of eps from ags samples at day 0 20 and 40 on day 0 there were three fluorescence peaks in the eps of initial ags peak a ex em 225 240 nm 340 370 nm represented aromatic protein like substances peak b ex em 395 430 nm 455 510 nm represented coenzyme f420 and peak c ex em 280 295 340 370 nm represented tryptophan protein like substances 39 41 over time two peaks occurred peaks a and c in the group a of which peak c only occurred in the groups b and c at day 20 at the end of the experiment only one peak was observed peak c in all samples as shown in table s2 the intensity of peak c of eps from initial ags 0 day was 545 5 a u on day 20 the intensities of peak c in the groups a b and c were 248 8 256 7 and 172 6 a u respectively on day 40 the intensity of peak c of each sample was increased while that of peak c in the group b was still the largest one most likely this was because after the initial ags had adapted to the new experimental conditions eps was affected peaks a and b disappeared and glucose as carbon source will delay the disappearance of peak a based on previous studies tryptophan protein like substances contribute to the structural stability of ags 41 42 in the experiments over time the sludge stability was improved and the addition of sodium acetate as an external carbon source made the structure of the ags more stable rollemberg et al 43 also found that the addition of acetate as carbon source resulted in denser and more compact granules 3 5 effects of different carbon source on the microbial community of ags 3 5 1 microbial characteristics as shown in table s3 the coverage rate of the three sludge samples in this study was 99 and 78 551 93 935 and 92 844 sequences were detected from the ags in the three groups of a b and c respectively overall 2797 and 2962 operational taxonomic units otus were clustered in the a and c samples respectively and 1715 otus in the b sample indicating that the addition of glucose and sucrose as carbon sources resulted in a more diverse microbial community chao1 index shannon index and ace index values showed similar trends the microbial communities with glucose and sucrose as carbon sources were more diverse than those with sodium acetate as carbon source relatively complex organic substrates such as carbohydrates need to be degraded through relatively complex processes and produce ags with complex microstructures and greater microbial diversity while simple carbon substrates such as acetate and formate lead to simple homogeneous microstructures 44 3 5 2 microbial community compositions the main phyla were identified and are shown in fig s3 in a b and c groups the major phyla were proteobacteria 33 2 59 52 and 41 79 bacteroidetes 17 44 11 56 and 17 08 and saccharibacteria 18 74 9 05 and 16 83 proteobacteria dominated the microbial community they are the most common bacteria in wastewater treatment plants and involved in biological nitrogen removal processes 45 47 proteobacteria had the largest percentage in the acetate feeding group there were more bacteria in the phylum proteobacteria that preferred to use sodium acetate firmicutes also increased with the addition of sodium acetate and accounted for 7 90 in the group b 1 08 in the a group and 1 89 in the c group firmicutes were mainly responsible for denitrifying processes 47 saccharibacteria considerably changed from 9 05 in the group b to 16 83 18 74 in the a and c groups bacteroidetes and acidobacteria showed similar variations this phenomenon indicates that saccharibacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria prefer saccharides based on a previous study saccharibacteria degrades various organic and sugar compounds 48 and no genes for nitrogen metabolism enzymes have been identified so far 49 bacteroidetes are related to denitrification processes 45 and can degrade high molecular weight compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins 50 in the study planctomycetes accounted for 7 03 in a 2 in b and 3 29 in c groups indicating that the addition of glucose as an external carbon source could promote their growth ding et al 45 found that planctomycetes were generally associated with biological nitrogen removal the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria were are generally associated with the key anaerobic steps including acetogenesis and methanogenesis 51 results show that the different carbon sources had a significant impact on microbial community composition because different carbon sources were metabolized via different metabolic pathways that involve different bacteria 16 fig 3 showed the variation of microbial communities in the different groups at genus level the members of saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis preferred saccharides and sodium acetate as a carbon source resulted in a significant decrease in abundance rhodobacter litorilinea terrimonas novosphingobium and ferruginibacter were less affected by the type of carbon source although their abundances were slightly higher in the saccharide group than in the sodium acetate group rhodobacter and novosphingobium belong to the phylum proteobacteria the members of paracoccus anaerorhabdus pseudomonas rhizobium acetoanaerobium and dethiosulfatibacter could hardly use saccharides and therefore accounted for a small amount of the overall bacteria in groups a and c the effect of the type of carbon source on these genera was obvious paracoccus can use n oxides as terminal electron acceptors for respiration under anaerobic conditions some strains of paracoccus such as paracoccus versutus dsm 582t can use either glucose or acetate while paracoccus halophilus jcm 14014t can use acetate but not glucose other strains such as 05503t paracoccus sphaerophysae hambi 3106t and paracoccus denitrificans dsm 413t cannot use glucose and acetate 52 paracoccus accounted for 0 26 and 0 12 in groups a and c respectively and for 34 92 in the group b therefore ags may contain bacteria belonging to paracoccus which could only use sodium acetate such as paracoccus halophilus jcm 14014t anaerorhabdus is gram negative anaerobic and nonsaccharolytic bacterial genus 53 pseudomonas can use nitrates 49 and is a denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organism paracoccus rhodobacter rhizobium novosphingobium and ferruginibacter are denitrifying heterotrophic organisms 54 nitrospirillum accounted for 3 01 in the group a but only for 0 11 and 0 97 in groups b and c respectively indicating that glucose as carbon source facilitates the growth of this genus however sucrose was not as effective as glucose but still better than sodium acetate in a previous study nitrospirillum has been described to belong to ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and to nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 55 3 5 3 metabolic pathway analysis in kegg the carbon source not only changes the microbial community structure but also alters the abundance of functional genes as shown in fig 4 the primary classification of functional genes in the ags mainly includes four types most of the functional genes in samples a b and c were clustered in metabolism accounting for about 50 genetic information processing accounting for 16 77 15 19 and 16 82 respectively showed significant differences among samples a b and c environmental information processing accounted for up to 16 39 in the group b however the percentages of environmental information processing were 12 76 and 12 62 in groups a and c respectively the smallest category of functional genes was cellular processes accounting for only about 4 in the secondary classification the largest proportion was found for membrane transport accounting for 10 58 14 05 and 10 39 of samples a b and c respectively this was also the reason for the obvious differences in environmental information processing the cellular homeostasis of an organism mainly depends on the transport of specific molecules on the cell membrane 56 acetate transport involves the acetate uptake transporter family tcdb 2 a 96 56 there are three types of sugar transport systems in bacteria the phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system pts electrochemical cation gradient driven and binding protein dependent adenosine triphosphate binding cassette abc import systems 57 the carbon source impacts the membrane transporters which was also the reason for the different contents of genes for the function membrane transport sodium acetate slightly promoted the cell motility signal transduction xenobiotics biodegradation and the metabolism of functional genes xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism functional genes in the three groups reached 3 20 2 98 and 3 02 respectively this was also reflected in the removal of nitrogen the differences between functional genes caused by glucose and sucrose as carbon sources were mainly reflected in the cell motility membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism of functional genes when glucose was used as carbon source the abundance of functional genes of cell motility was relatively low in the three groups 2 75 while the relatively high in the three groups 10 48 was found for carbohydrate metabolism further analysis based on the carbohydrate metabolism function genes in samples from the three groups is presented in fig s4 there was little difference in carbohydrate metabolism function genes between the group a and c while there was slight difference in the group b which used sodium acetate as carbon source in carbohydrate metabolism glycolysis is an important part of carbohydrate metabolism as the influent used in the experiment was domestic wastewater there were organics including starch cellulose therefore glycolysis also existed in the group b the gene abundance of glycolysis gluconeogenesis in three groups were 1 12 1 06 and 1 09 respectively for citrate cycle tca cycle the abundance of functional genes showed the same trend accounting for 0 92 0 72 and 0 90 respectively in tca cycle acetate and succinyl coa are transformed into succinate and acetyl coa under the catalysis of succinyl coa ec 2 8 3 18 the functional gene abundance of starch and sucrose metabolism was 0 61 0 50 and 0 60 respectively which may be the influence of carbon source glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and releases free energy as shown in fig 5 the different carbon sources result in the difference of gene abundance of glycolytic enzymes α d glucose can be phosphorylated to α d glucose 6 phosphate which is connected to the pentose phosphate pathway and important to carbohydrate metabolism 58 the phosphofructokinase pfk ec 2 7 1 11 catalyzes the conversion of β d fructose 6 phosphate to β d fructose 1 6 bisphosphate pfk is usually the key point that determines the overall reaction rate in glycolysis 59 the gene abundance of pfk in three groups was 0 088 0 064 and 0 080 respectively thus the glycolysis rate of the group b was lower than that of the other two groups the pyruvate produced by glycolysis can be further decomposed into volatile fatty acid 60 3 5 4 changes in nitrogen metabolism gene abundance in order to understand the effects of different carbon sources on the nitrogen removal process the relative abundances of nitrogen metabolism genes were investigated based on picrust prediction ten typical nitrogen transformation genes were identified amo hao nar nap nirk norbc nosz nxrab nirbd and nfra fig 6 50 gene amo encoding ammonia monooxygenase amo is responsible for the conversion of nh4 n to nh2oh 31 the relative abundance of amo in nitrogen metabolism genes was the smallest and was almost nonexistent in the group b gene hao encoding hydroxylamine oxidase hao converts nh2oh to no2 which had the relatively high in the group a and the relatively low in the group b gene nxrab showed the same trend as hao however with glucose as carbon source this process was particularly facilitated the genes responsible for denitrification include nar nap nirk norb c and nosz 31 as shown in table s4 with glucose as carbon source the abundance of genes nar and nap responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite was the largest 0 016987 and 0 003798 followed by sucrose 0 016934 and 0 002743 and sodium acetate 0 008152 and 0 002002 the differences in the gene abundances of nirk norb c and nosz in a b and c groups were opposite to the differences in nar and nap it was indicated that glucose could promote the conversion of no3 to no2 and that the addition of sodium acetate had a more significant effect on the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen this obvious difference was due to the fact that denitrifying reductases require electrons which were generally originated from carbon metabolism during denitrification 50 and the sodium acetate was an electron donor that can be used more easily by microorganisms gene nirk has been reported in the phylogenetic range of archaea and bacteria 61 the nitrite reductase encoded by nirk is a cu containing enzyme 62 the nosz gene can be used as a target for different populations of denitrifying bacteria capable of reducing nitrous oxide 62 genes nirbd and nfra indicate the presence of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra pathway in ags which causes no2 to be reduced to nh4 n gene nrfa the cytochrome c552 structural gene is responsible for the terminal reductase of the formate dependent pathway for nitrite reduction to ammonia darwin et al 63 had pointed out that nrfa was almost completely inhibited during aerobic growth and partially induced during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate or in the absence of nitrite but fully induced during anaerobic growth with only nitrite 4 conclusions this study analyzed the carbohydrate metabolism and nitrogen metabolism with different carbon sources in the ags system when glucose was added as carbon source cod removal rate showed the highest stability the removal of dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved ammonia nitrogen by ags was highest by adding sodium acetate as carbon source proteobacteria had the largest proportion 59 52 when sodium acetate was added as carbon source bacteroidetes accounted for 17 44 and 17 08 with glucose and sucrose respectively and for 11 56 with sodium acetate the glycolysis rate of ags with sodium acetate as carbon source was lower than that with glucose and sucrose as carbon source the relative abundances of

13327,the effects of the three carbon sources glucose sodium acetate and sucrose on the transformation of nitrogen and phosphorous forms in an aerobic granular sludge ags system were investigated in addition the microbial community in the sludge was analyzed dissolved organic nitrogen removal efficiency in the sodium acetate group remained good throughout the experimental period with a removal rate of around 90 the members of paracoccus and anaerorhabdus could hardly use saccharides and therefore accounted for a small amount of the overall bacteria in the groups with glucose and sucrose the proportion of membrane transport function genes was the largest in the sodium acetate group with the value reaching to 14 05 the gene abundance of glycolysis in three groups were 1 12 1 06 and 1 09 respectively meanwhile the genes nirk norb c and nosz responsible for the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen in the sodium acetate group were higher than the glucose and sucrose groups gene abundance of glycolysis was largest in the glucose group graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aerobic granular sludge carbon source nitrogen form kegg nitrogen metabolism 1 introduction more and more attention is being paid to the adverse effects of anthropogenic emissions of excess nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus into surface water bodies 1 uncontrolled discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus may result in eutrophication bringing undesirable consequences such as oxygen depletion algae blooms and the death of organisms 2 4 at present the standards of municipal wastewater treatment plants are constantly strict which puts forward higher requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus standard discharge in practice the removal of biological nutrient is regarded as the most sustainable and economical way to meet increasingly stringent global emission standards biological nutrient 5 in the traditional activated sludge process the solid residence time is shorter while the generation time of nitrifying bacteria is longer which affects the efficiency of nitrogen removal due to the contradiction of denitrification and phosphorus removal it is difficult to realize efficient denitrification and phosphorus removal by traditional activated sludge method deng et al 6 investigated the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal from domestic wastewater through nitritation denitritation coupling improved anammox process with an optimal anaerobic oxic anoxic strategy yan et al 7 had improved performance of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification via nitrite in an oxygen limited sequencing batch reactor sbr by alternating the dissolved oxygen do therefore new techniques are needed to improve the removal efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus 8 a new generation of bioreactor based on aerobic granular sludge ags has a high removal efficiency for nutrients from wastewater relies on excellent settleability of sludge small footprint of reactor high organic load capacity high biomass retention rate and biological activity and the ability for simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal 5 9 10 therefore ags is therefore considered as a sustainable and promising alternative for nutrient removal 11 12 zhang et al 13 systematically reviewed the effect of short settling time cation ion s coagulant or inert carrier addition seeding pellets crushed or intact granules and self aggregation bacteria on rapid ags formation the research laid a foundation for the establishment of aerobic granular sludge rapid formation system in wastewater treatment the performance of ags was affected by many factors such as organic load rate carbon nitrogen ratio type of sludge inoculation etc and the carbon source was also an important factor 14 15 carbon source plays a vital role in nitrogen and phosphorus removal because denitrification and phosphorus release processes require carbon source 16 carbon source not only had an important impact on the performance of biological treatment reactor but also had a great impact on the microbial communities in the sludge 16 some authors have indicated that different carbon sources had a crucial effect on the sludge characteristics of ags and also affects on ags system performance and microbial communities 14 15 17 du et al 18 observed that acetate could lead to spherical and dense granules while granules fed by propionate were stable and dense rollemberg et al 19 had indicated that glucose often led to filamentous granules to date few studies have investigated the impact of the carbon source type on nitrogen forms in wastewater and phosphorus forms in aerobic granular sludge 20 moreover the genetic influence of different carbon sources on carbohydrate metabolism in microorganisms in the ags has also been rarely explored respective studies can provide a deeper understanding of the forms and transformation of nitrogen pollution consequently improving nutrient removal efficiencies hence we applied glucose sodium acetate and sucrose as carbon sources for the operation of an ags system the study aims to reveal the effects of these three carbon sources on the transformation of nitrogen forms in the ags system in addition the effects of carbon sources on microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput sequencing technique were further explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device and operation the experiment was carried out by using three 800 ml beakers a b c as reactors the effective volume of each reactor was 500 ml the operating cycle of the reactor was 12 h which comprised of 8 h aeration 0 5 h settling and 3 5 h standing the experiment was run constantly for 40 days the reactors were parallelly operated as follows a feeding with glucose as carbon source b feeding with sodium acetate and c feeding with sucrose ags was taken from an environmental protection company in nanning city guangxi province china the particle size of aerobic granular sludge was approximately 2 3 mm with compact structure each reactor was inoculated 200 ml ags the influent used in the experiment was domestic wastewater which was obtained from the qilidian wastewater treatment plant guilin guangxi with a cod concentration of about 200 mg l glucose sodium acetate and sucrose were added to the influent respectively the total cod concentration of the influent was set at 500 mg l ammonia chloride nh4cl was the nitrogen source and potassium phosphate monobasic kh2po4 was used as the phosphorus source which contained approximately 20 mg l ammonia nitrogen and 3 mg l total phosphorus 5 2 2 analyses and calculations the cod ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen concentrations of the influent and effluent were measured in accordance with standard methods 21 extraction of extracellular polymeric substance eps from ags was performed using an ultrasound and heat method according to the literature 22 eps was analyzed by three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi japan the 150 w xenon lamp was used as the excitation light source the scanning speed was set at 2400 nm min both the emission and excitation slit widths were set to 5 nm the range of the excitation wavelength ex from 220 nm to 500 nm and the range of the emission wavelength em from 220 nm to 550 nm the electron transport system ets activity of the ags was quantified using 2 p iodophenyl 3 p nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int following the method of wang et al 23 and 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc according to the method of cheng et al 24 nitrogen morphological analysis was performed according to a previous study 25 after 40 days of experimental operation 2 ml ags samples were collected from the three beakers a b and c for high throughput sequencing analysis the e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega usa was used to extract the dna from the sludge samples 26 the general primer 341f and 805r sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china targeted at the v3 4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna were used for amplification 27 the performing of pcr amplification was used following the methods by li et al 28 the raw tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by 97 identity 29 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust was used to generate a functional profile based on the 16s rrna gene data illumina miseq usa 30 the functional genes and metabolic pathways were annotated by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg databases 64 the glycolytic pathway was separated from kegg viewer module 31 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of different carbon sources on cod removal from ags the removal of cod by adding different carbon sources a glucose b sodium acetate c sucrose to the ags system is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of the experiment the carbon source only slightly influenced the ags system and the average cod removal rate of the three beakers reached about 92 within the first 10 days over time the influence of the carbon source on the cod removal could be observed the removal effect of cod in the a reactor with glucose as carbon source was basically stable and the cod removal effect was slightly improved at the end of the experiment at days 31 40 the average cod removal rate was 93 46 in the a group in the b group with sodium acetate as carbon source the cod removal efficiency decreased gradually and the removal rate of cod fluctuated greatly at the end of the experiment showing a downward trend the average cod removal rate decreased to 87 27 at days 11 20 86 75 at days 21 30 and 85 96 at days 31 40 the removal rate of cod in the c group with sucrose as external carbon source was also basically stable with an average cod removal rate of 88 79 from days 31 40 which decreased slightly compared with the cod removal rate at the beginning of the experiment the addition of glucose carbon source improved the efficiency of the microorganisms in the ags and the removal of cod in the group a was more stable the average cod removal rate was 92 33 which was the highest among the three groups the effect of sodium acetate on the ags was small and the removal rate of cod fluctuated greatly with 88 05 the average removal rate of cod in the sodium acetate group was the smallest of the three groups on the whole different carbon sources had a minor effect on the cod removal rate in the ags system 3 2 effects of different carbon sources on nitrogen forms in the effluent different carbon sources have different effects on the particle size sludge stability and pollutants removal efficiency of ags 14 15 as shown in table s1 and fig 2 the influent used in the experiment mainly consisted of dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved ammonia nitrogen d ammonia particulate organic nitrogen pon and adsorbed ammonia nitrogen a ammonia groups a b and c were better in removing these nitrogen forms on the first day of the experiment total nitrogen tn removal was highest in the group b with sodium acetate as carbon source which decreased from 50 17 to 11 67 mg l during the experiments the removal efficiency of the groups a b and c for tn increased with the group b showing the highest total nitrogen removal at the middle and end period of the experiment on days 1 and 40 the d ammonia removal efficiency of the group b was relatively high in groups a and c d ammonia removal efficiency at day 20 was decreased at day 40 for groups a and b d ammonia removal efficiency improved fig 2 granule disintegration of ags was observed during the experiment rollemberg et al 19 also found that nh4 removal was reduced during granule disintegration which may be due to the loss of nitrifying bacteria present in the broken granules during the experiment the inoculated ags was affected by entering the new experimental environment which led to the disintegration of ags granules over time new granules were formed which were lighter in color and smaller in diameter all groups were similarly effective in removing pon but showed differences in removing don the don removal effect in the group b remained good throughout the experimental period with a removal rate of around 90 in the groups a and c the don removal showed a slight decline and then an upward trend which may be related to the disintegration of carbon sources and particles 32 3 3 analysis of electron transport system activity of ags electron transport system activity is an important index to evaluate the metabolic activity of microorganism 23 biological denitrification and dehydrogenase depend on the electron transport and consumption system 33 34 fig s1 shows the influence of different carbon sources on the electron transport system activity of ags when sodium acetate was added as a carbon source the int est activity of ags reached its maximum value of 15 43 μg mg h at the 20 day glucose and sucrose as carbon sources showed little difference in int est activity at the initial stage finally the int est activities of ags in a b and c groups were 5 48 μg mg h 6 72 μg mg h and 5 99 μg mg h respectively over time three groups of ttc ets activity showed significant growth especially with glucose as carbon source the ttc ets activity at day 40 were 96 26 48 48 and 46 50 μg mg h 1 respectively glucose is a simple sugar and can be directly used in sugar metabolism via glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway in contrast sucrose a disaccharide needs to be broken down first sodium acetate can be used directly by denitrifying bacteria ets activity results proved the facilitated electron transfer system with glucose addition the quantity and quality of carbon sources determine the regulation of denitrification methane production microbial growth and respiration while carbon sources control electron transport 35 3 4 eem analysis of eps eps secreted by bacterial cells play a critical role in the physiochemical characteristics settleability performance and aggregation capacity of ags 36 fluorescence spectroscopy is an efficient tool in discriminating among different fluorescent fractions of protein like fulvic like humic like components and other aromatic xenobiotics owing to its easy and fast detection 37 here eem can be employed for the quantitative analysis of eps 38 the location and intensity of a fluorescence peak can show the composition and content of sludge eps fig s2 shows the eem fluorescence spectrogram of eps from ags samples at day 0 20 and 40 on day 0 there were three fluorescence peaks in the eps of initial ags peak a ex em 225 240 nm 340 370 nm represented aromatic protein like substances peak b ex em 395 430 nm 455 510 nm represented coenzyme f420 and peak c ex em 280 295 340 370 nm represented tryptophan protein like substances 39 41 over time two peaks occurred peaks a and c in the group a of which peak c only occurred in the groups b and c at day 20 at the end of the experiment only one peak was observed peak c in all samples as shown in table s2 the intensity of peak c of eps from initial ags 0 day was 545 5 a u on day 20 the intensities of peak c in the groups a b and c were 248 8 256 7 and 172 6 a u respectively on day 40 the intensity of peak c of each sample was increased while that of peak c in the group b was still the largest one most likely this was because after the initial ags had adapted to the new experimental conditions eps was affected peaks a and b disappeared and glucose as carbon source will delay the disappearance of peak a based on previous studies tryptophan protein like substances contribute to the structural stability of ags 41 42 in the experiments over time the sludge stability was improved and the addition of sodium acetate as an external carbon source made the structure of the ags more stable rollemberg et al 43 also found that the addition of acetate as carbon source resulted in denser and more compact granules 3 5 effects of different carbon source on the microbial community of ags 3 5 1 microbial characteristics as shown in table s3 the coverage rate of the three sludge samples in this study was 99 and 78 551 93 935 and 92 844 sequences were detected from the ags in the three groups of a b and c respectively overall 2797 and 2962 operational taxonomic units otus were clustered in the a and c samples respectively and 1715 otus in the b sample indicating that the addition of glucose and sucrose as carbon sources resulted in a more diverse microbial community chao1 index shannon index and ace index values showed similar trends the microbial communities with glucose and sucrose as carbon sources were more diverse than those with sodium acetate as carbon source relatively complex organic substrates such as carbohydrates need to be degraded through relatively complex processes and produce ags with complex microstructures and greater microbial diversity while simple carbon substrates such as acetate and formate lead to simple homogeneous microstructures 44 3 5 2 microbial community compositions the main phyla were identified and are shown in fig s3 in a b and c groups the major phyla were proteobacteria 33 2 59 52 and 41 79 bacteroidetes 17 44 11 56 and 17 08 and saccharibacteria 18 74 9 05 and 16 83 proteobacteria dominated the microbial community they are the most common bacteria in wastewater treatment plants and involved in biological nitrogen removal processes 45 47 proteobacteria had the largest percentage in the acetate feeding group there were more bacteria in the phylum proteobacteria that preferred to use sodium acetate firmicutes also increased with the addition of sodium acetate and accounted for 7 90 in the group b 1 08 in the a group and 1 89 in the c group firmicutes were mainly responsible for denitrifying processes 47 saccharibacteria considerably changed from 9 05 in the group b to 16 83 18 74 in the a and c groups bacteroidetes and acidobacteria showed similar variations this phenomenon indicates that saccharibacteria bacteroidetes and acidobacteria prefer saccharides based on a previous study saccharibacteria degrades various organic and sugar compounds 48 and no genes for nitrogen metabolism enzymes have been identified so far 49 bacteroidetes are related to denitrification processes 45 and can degrade high molecular weight compounds such as polysaccharides and proteins 50 in the study planctomycetes accounted for 7 03 in a 2 in b and 3 29 in c groups indicating that the addition of glucose as an external carbon source could promote their growth ding et al 45 found that planctomycetes were generally associated with biological nitrogen removal the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria were are generally associated with the key anaerobic steps including acetogenesis and methanogenesis 51 results show that the different carbon sources had a significant impact on microbial community composition because different carbon sources were metabolized via different metabolic pathways that involve different bacteria 16 fig 3 showed the variation of microbial communities in the different groups at genus level the members of saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis preferred saccharides and sodium acetate as a carbon source resulted in a significant decrease in abundance rhodobacter litorilinea terrimonas novosphingobium and ferruginibacter were less affected by the type of carbon source although their abundances were slightly higher in the saccharide group than in the sodium acetate group rhodobacter and novosphingobium belong to the phylum proteobacteria the members of paracoccus anaerorhabdus pseudomonas rhizobium acetoanaerobium and dethiosulfatibacter could hardly use saccharides and therefore accounted for a small amount of the overall bacteria in groups a and c the effect of the type of carbon source on these genera was obvious paracoccus can use n oxides as terminal electron acceptors for respiration under anaerobic conditions some strains of paracoccus such as paracoccus versutus dsm 582t can use either glucose or acetate while paracoccus halophilus jcm 14014t can use acetate but not glucose other strains such as 05503t paracoccus sphaerophysae hambi 3106t and paracoccus denitrificans dsm 413t cannot use glucose and acetate 52 paracoccus accounted for 0 26 and 0 12 in groups a and c respectively and for 34 92 in the group b therefore ags may contain bacteria belonging to paracoccus which could only use sodium acetate such as paracoccus halophilus jcm 14014t anaerorhabdus is gram negative anaerobic and nonsaccharolytic bacterial genus 53 pseudomonas can use nitrates 49 and is a denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organism paracoccus rhodobacter rhizobium novosphingobium and ferruginibacter are denitrifying heterotrophic organisms 54 nitrospirillum accounted for 3 01 in the group a but only for 0 11 and 0 97 in groups b and c respectively indicating that glucose as carbon source facilitates the growth of this genus however sucrose was not as effective as glucose but still better than sodium acetate in a previous study nitrospirillum has been described to belong to ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and to nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 55 3 5 3 metabolic pathway analysis in kegg the carbon source not only changes the microbial community structure but also alters the abundance of functional genes as shown in fig 4 the primary classification of functional genes in the ags mainly includes four types most of the functional genes in samples a b and c were clustered in metabolism accounting for about 50 genetic information processing accounting for 16 77 15 19 and 16 82 respectively showed significant differences among samples a b and c environmental information processing accounted for up to 16 39 in the group b however the percentages of environmental information processing were 12 76 and 12 62 in groups a and c respectively the smallest category of functional genes was cellular processes accounting for only about 4 in the secondary classification the largest proportion was found for membrane transport accounting for 10 58 14 05 and 10 39 of samples a b and c respectively this was also the reason for the obvious differences in environmental information processing the cellular homeostasis of an organism mainly depends on the transport of specific molecules on the cell membrane 56 acetate transport involves the acetate uptake transporter family tcdb 2 a 96 56 there are three types of sugar transport systems in bacteria the phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system pts electrochemical cation gradient driven and binding protein dependent adenosine triphosphate binding cassette abc import systems 57 the carbon source impacts the membrane transporters which was also the reason for the different contents of genes for the function membrane transport sodium acetate slightly promoted the cell motility signal transduction xenobiotics biodegradation and the metabolism of functional genes xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism functional genes in the three groups reached 3 20 2 98 and 3 02 respectively this was also reflected in the removal of nitrogen the differences between functional genes caused by glucose and sucrose as carbon sources were mainly reflected in the cell motility membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism of functional genes when glucose was used as carbon source the abundance of functional genes of cell motility was relatively low in the three groups 2 75 while the relatively high in the three groups 10 48 was found for carbohydrate metabolism further analysis based on the carbohydrate metabolism function genes in samples from the three groups is presented in fig s4 there was little difference in carbohydrate metabolism function genes between the group a and c while there was slight difference in the group b which used sodium acetate as carbon source in carbohydrate metabolism glycolysis is an important part of carbohydrate metabolism as the influent used in the experiment was domestic wastewater there were organics including starch cellulose therefore glycolysis also existed in the group b the gene abundance of glycolysis gluconeogenesis in three groups were 1 12 1 06 and 1 09 respectively for citrate cycle tca cycle the abundance of functional genes showed the same trend accounting for 0 92 0 72 and 0 90 respectively in tca cycle acetate and succinyl coa are transformed into succinate and acetyl coa under the catalysis of succinyl coa ec 2 8 3 18 the functional gene abundance of starch and sucrose metabolism was 0 61 0 50 and 0 60 respectively which may be the influence of carbon source glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and releases free energy as shown in fig 5 the different carbon sources result in the difference of gene abundance of glycolytic enzymes α d glucose can be phosphorylated to α d glucose 6 phosphate which is connected to the pentose phosphate pathway and important to carbohydrate metabolism 58 the phosphofructokinase pfk ec 2 7 1 11 catalyzes the conversion of β d fructose 6 phosphate to β d fructose 1 6 bisphosphate pfk is usually the key point that determines the overall reaction rate in glycolysis 59 the gene abundance of pfk in three groups was 0 088 0 064 and 0 080 respectively thus the glycolysis rate of the group b was lower than that of the other two groups the pyruvate produced by glycolysis can be further decomposed into volatile fatty acid 60 3 5 4 changes in nitrogen metabolism gene abundance in order to understand the effects of different carbon sources on the nitrogen removal process the relative abundances of nitrogen metabolism genes were investigated based on picrust prediction ten typical nitrogen transformation genes were identified amo hao nar nap nirk norbc nosz nxrab nirbd and nfra fig 6 50 gene amo encoding ammonia monooxygenase amo is responsible for the conversion of nh4 n to nh2oh 31 the relative abundance of amo in nitrogen metabolism genes was the smallest and was almost nonexistent in the group b gene hao encoding hydroxylamine oxidase hao converts nh2oh to no2 which had the relatively high in the group a and the relatively low in the group b gene nxrab showed the same trend as hao however with glucose as carbon source this process was particularly facilitated the genes responsible for denitrification include nar nap nirk norb c and nosz 31 as shown in table s4 with glucose as carbon source the abundance of genes nar and nap responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite was the largest 0 016987 and 0 003798 followed by sucrose 0 016934 and 0 002743 and sodium acetate 0 008152 and 0 002002 the differences in the gene abundances of nirk norb c and nosz in a b and c groups were opposite to the differences in nar and nap it was indicated that glucose could promote the conversion of no3 to no2 and that the addition of sodium acetate had a more significant effect on the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen this obvious difference was due to the fact that denitrifying reductases require electrons which were generally originated from carbon metabolism during denitrification 50 and the sodium acetate was an electron donor that can be used more easily by microorganisms gene nirk has been reported in the phylogenetic range of archaea and bacteria 61 the nitrite reductase encoded by nirk is a cu containing enzyme 62 the nosz gene can be used as a target for different populations of denitrifying bacteria capable of reducing nitrous oxide 62 genes nirbd and nfra indicate the presence of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra pathway in ags which causes no2 to be reduced to nh4 n gene nrfa the cytochrome c552 structural gene is responsible for the terminal reductase of the formate dependent pathway for nitrite reduction to ammonia darwin et al 63 had pointed out that nrfa was almost completely inhibited during aerobic growth and partially induced during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate or in the absence of nitrite but fully induced during anaerobic growth with only nitrite 4 conclusions this study analyzed the carbohydrate metabolism and nitrogen metabolism with different carbon sources in the ags system when glucose was added as carbon source cod removal rate showed the highest stability the removal of dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved ammonia nitrogen by ags was highest by adding sodium acetate as carbon source proteobacteria had the largest proportion 59 52 when sodium acetate was added as carbon source bacteroidetes accounted for 17 44 and 17 08 with glucose and sucrose respectively and for 11 56 with sodium acetate the glycolysis rate of ags with sodium acetate as carbon source was lower than that with glucose and sucrose as carbon source the relative abundances of the genes nirk norb c and nosz with sodium acetate as the carbon source were higher than glucose and sucrose the effects of carbon sources on the nitrogen metabolism can be understood from the

13328,in brazil a large amount of liquid wastewater generated during orange juice production has a significant negative impact on the citric industries the treatment of this wastewater has been carried out in biological treatment plants however low organic removal efficiency has been achieved while using anaerobic or and aerobic processes probably due to biological inhibition by toxic compounds like limonene in this context the objective of this study was to evaluate the limonene removal by a bench scale horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass haib bioreactor 12l and the transformation products formed during the applied treatment the bioreactor was filled with three different matrices mineral coal polyurethane foam and gravel containing immobilized anaerobic sludge the used substrate contained chemical oxygen demand cod of 480 to 1251 mg l 1 and the concentrations of limonene ranging from 10 period i to 500 mg l 1 period x were monitored by gc ms the haib bioreactor removed organic matter 60 and limonene was removed with high efficiency 95 while operated at hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 and 24 h graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords limonene horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor inert media support transformation products 1 introduction according to fao food and agriculture organization united nations citrus fruits especially orange have been recognized as some of the most high consumption fruits worldwide 1 the world production of citrus reached out 145 million tons in 2017 2 about 40 to 60 of citrus fruits are processed to produce orange juice generating about 50 to 60 of liquid and solid residues 3 4 the transformation of citrus fruits generates wide amounts of liquid waste especially from concentrated orange juice manufacturing dried orange peel waste composed of peel seeds and membrane residues and pomace hence appropriate technology is required to ensure the efficient management of the involved resources the entire processing requires large amounts of water and consequently generates a large volume of wastewater around 1 96 m3 of wastewater ton of fruit 5 the citric wastewater has high organic matter content in terms of cod and bod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus 6 which are ideal for biological conversion anaerobic and aerobic processes are commonly used by the orange juice factories such as anaerobic aerobic facultative or combined pond systems more compact wastewater treatment systems including activated sludge 7 8 and high rate anaerobic reactors 9 have been studied to treat this wastewater however citrus fruits have a defense structure for protection against microorganism invasion that includes anti microbial compounds e g limonene so citrus waste can negatively affect the biological processes 5 10 in fact limonene has been shown to inhibit both methanogenic and hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria 11 12 several investigations have been carried out to solve the problem of inhibition of anaerobic digestion caused by the limonene which can consist in the conversion of limonene into less toxic compounds 13 mizuki et al 14 reported a maximum limonene concentration of 400 mg l 1 to avoid the inhibition of anaerobic digestion in a semi continuous system with mesophilic temperature while forgács et al 15 reported compliance values between 450 and 900 mg l 1 for inhibition in anaerobic digestion at thermophilic temperature according to ruiz and flotats 12 the inhibition concentrations of anaerobic digestion batch reactors by terpene are around 3000 mg l 1 when low in inhibitory concentrations the compounds can serve as carbon and energy source for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms 16 the presence of terpene limonene an essential oil in the citric wastewater as well as few studies related to the limonene removal by anaerobic processes reinforces the necessity of new alternatives to promote the preexistent biological treatments 12 the process of biomass attachment i e immobilization process allows high cellular concentration and retention in the anaerobic bioreactors in this case the main objective is to enhance the cellular retention time as wells as to improve the diverse microbial community interactions consequently the metabolic interactions among microorganisms can facilitate the conversion of primary and intermediate substrates between the diverse community participating in the complex anaerobic digestion process 17 18 the horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor haib presents an interesting alternative treatment of a wide range of wastewater this design has been successfully applied to the treatment of toxic and recalcitrant compounds such as pentachlorophenol 19 20 phenol 21 formaldehyde 22 benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex 23 24 and las surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 25 26 as well as sulfate removal from sulfate rich wastewaters 27 28 therefore these studies indicate the suitability of haib bioreactor to assess the anaerobic treatment for citric industry wastewater in this context this study aimed to evaluate the biological removal of limonene by immobilized anaerobic biomass bioreactor using three different inert media support mineral coal polyurethane foam and gravel additionally this study also focused on identifying the transformation products formed during the applied anaerobic treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate characteristic the substrate basal medium was composed of beef extract sodium bicarbonate and detergent to produce a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of approximately 500 mgo2 l 1 the concentration of each component was stoichiometrically measured and calculated in terms of cod according to apha 29 following the cod n p of 350 5 1 ratio 30 as shown in table 1 the used commercial limonene was r limonene c10h16 technical sigma aldrich 62 122 90 sum of enantiomers the terpene theoretical cod 3 3 mgcod mglimonene was dosed in crescent concentration in the substrate table 1 to produce the desired total cod concentration of feed 480 1150 mgo2 l 1 for limonene concentration of 5 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 however limonene has high volatility at room temperature which hampered its manipulation and homogenization in liquid medium especially in water due to its nature as an essential oil in order to avoid this problem the feed was maintained with constant agitation besides an increased addition of detergent to promote a better dilution of the limonene at a high concentration 2 2 haib bioreactor and experimental procedure the bench scale horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor haib was made of a pvc tube with 150 cm of length l and an internal diameter d of 10 cm resulting in a length diameter l d ratio of 15 the bioreactor presented four intermediates equally spaced 30 cm sampling ports l d 0 substrate 3 6 9 12 and 15 effluent the total and useful volumes bed porosity of 50 were 12 l and 6 0 l respectively the biogas was collected through three sampling ports located in the upper part of the haib fig 1 the bioreactor was completely filled with cubic polyurethane foam mineral coal and gravel matrices with approximately 1 0 to 1 5 cm of side anaerobic granular sludge from a uasb bioreactor applied for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater was used as inoculum the sludge with total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss of 42 2 and 36 5 g l 1 respectively was immobilized in matrices inert supports according to the methodology described by zaiat et al 17 the matrices were introduced inside the bioreactor around 30 of each material with immobilized biomass occupied approximately 12 l which means 4 l of each one the characteristics of the applied support media are presented in table 2 it should be noted that all the matrices were previously washed before the bioreactor inoculation initially during the start up period the limonene concentration in the feed 500 mgo2 l 1 was maintained at 5 mg l 1 for 60 days hrt 48 h in this way the acclimatization of the microbial biomass was facilitated after the start up the bioreactor was continuously fed with limonene based on substrate substrate reservoir 20 l for 168 days and maintained at 25 2 c in a controlled room temperature sludge discharge was not provided as well as cellular retention time was not controlled during the experimental period table 3 presents the operational conditions applied in the haib in terms of cod limonene concentration and flowrate 2 2 1 bioreactor monitoring haib bioreactor 168 days was monitored through physical chemical analysis substrate and effluent samples such as chemical oxygen demand cod total and filtered membrane 1 2 μm volatile suspended solids vss total suspend solids tss and ph according apha 29 determinations of volatile fatty acids vfa as acetic acid hac and bicarbonate alkalinity ba followed the methodology described by dilallo albertson 31 modified by ripley et al 32 respectively the biogas methane concentrations was evaluated through gas chromatography gc and was performed in a shimadzu gas chromatography gc 2014 model with thermal conductivity detector and a hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm 40 μm hydrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the temperatures of the injection port oven and detector were 158 c 36 c and 172 c respectively the biogas samples were collected from the hydraulic seal and gas sample of 0 5 ml was injected in duplicate in order to monitor the limonene concentration in the substrate and haib effluent a headspace followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry hs gc ms method was used according to camargo et al 2020 33 a gc ms model 7890b gas chromatograph and ms 5977a mass spectrometer and ctc pal system rsi in the headspace mode was used during the sample preparation with 250 μl of injection volume the transformation products tps were also determined by hs gc ms the ms was used in the scan mode mass range 50 to 550 u to obtain the compounds spectra and for limonene quantification to identify the tps a control sample from the substrate without limonene and bioreactor effluent before the limonene introduction in the treatment was compared to the effluent samples and samples from the bioreactor profiles the method parameters are shown in table 4 2 2 2 spatial profiles samples from the spatial profiles were collected from the intermediate sampling ports l d 0 3 6 9 12 and 15 as shown in fig 1 each l d ratio implies a partial hrt and represented a specific step of the treatment the haib bioreactor provided the segregation of different microbial communities which were responsible for carrying out the different biochemical reactions involved in the anaerobic digestion in addition to providing favorable conditions for the development of biofilms 34 the partial hrt was calculated considering the haib proportional volume from the entrance until each sampling port the spatial profiles for limonene and filtered cod were obtained after the haib bioreactor had achieved a pseudo steady state flow variations lower than 10 in the efficiency removal total cod at the end of each operation period table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the haib bioreactor for the acclimatization of biomass inoculum to the limonene the first 60 days of operation a low concentration 5 mg l 1 of this compound was applied to start up the bioreactor after this stage the limonene concentration gradually increased from 10 to 500 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 the cod removal varied from 62 to 73 in the period i v and 61 to 75 in period vi x it was also noted that the methane concentration in the biogas 65 5 70 1 obtained in the start up period was not maintained during the experimental periods i x from the first period i it was observed low methane contents 10 1 13 2 with the largest portion of the biogas composed of co2 thus biogas production values were insignificant indicating only partial degradation of the substrate these removal values were very relevant since the biomass was exposed only to the limonene as a sole carbon source it is well known that this citrus compound is toxic to anaerobic digestion due to its antimicrobial properties 12 a wide range of limonene concentrations was applied and the hrt was further reduced from 48 to 24 h after period v therefore the cod substrate increased slightly as the limonene concentration was increased in the substrate at each operation period during the periods i to x the total and filtered cod from substrate varied between 480 28 mg l 1 i to 1150 120 mgl 1 x and 456 37 mgl 1 i to 1038 100 mgl 1 x respectively as it can be observed in fig 2 total and filtered effluent were very similar cod ranging from 162 13 mg l 1 iii to 332 23 mg l 1 x and 147 12 mg l 1 iii to 312 29 mg l 1 x respectively hence slightly low values of total and volatile suspended solids concentrations of the effluent were obtained as 14 mg l 1 tss and 9 mg l 1 vss respectively the carbonate carbonic gas relation is responsible for maintaining the ph stable in order to provide buffering i e ideal conditions in the anaerobic bioreactors 35 the bicarbonate alkalinity already provided by the substrate in addition to the ba produced by the system was essential for the proper control of ph both substrate and effluent ph were stable in the range of 7 26 to 7 54 and 7 06 to 7 29 respectively fig 3 depicts the ba and vfa values the negligible concentration of vfa in the effluent during all operational periods is strictly related to ba generation by the bioreactor the effluent alkalinity fluctuated between 300 39 mgcaco3 l 1 at the operation condition v and 345 18 mg caco3 l 1 at experimental condition vii while the substrate mean ba concentration was 280 18 mgcaco3 l 1 iv moreover the vfa in the effluent was maintained in 47 3 mghac l 1 iii to 64 3 mghac l 1 x with substrate vfa slightly higher value ranging from 57 5 mghac l 1 v and 68 8 mghac l 1 x such results indicate the successful establishment of anaerobic biomass able to carry out simultaneously cod and limonene removal 3 2 limonene removal for the periods with hrt of 48 h each intermediate point l d ratio of 3 6 9 12 and 15 had the individual hrt of 9 6 19 2 28 8 38 4 e 48 h while periods vi to x the individual hrt were 4 8 9 6 14 4 19 2 e 24 h respectively as shown in fig 4 in the point l d 3 hrt 9 6 h limonene removal percentages higher than 95 were achieved during periods i to v 10 50 mg l 1 the exponential curve observed in fig 4 was expected however limonene residual concentration was detected in the range of 0 05 a 0 21 mg l 1 in the sample point l d 15 as well as cod total and filtered the cod residual can be related to intermediate products produced during the limonene anaerobic biodegradation from the point l d 3 that were not metabolized along the bioreactor l d 6 9 e 12 in periods vi to xi the limonene concentration in the substrate was maintained between 100 and 500 mg l 1 although hrt was reduced from 48 to 24 h limonene removal upper 95 was reached only in the point l d 9 and 12 hrt 14 4 and 19 2 h as it can be seen in fig 4 at l d 15 the residual concentration of limonene varied from 1 57 to 14 7 mg l 1 as well as it was observed the increased cod concentration at this point similar as shown in fig 2 as previously mentioned the limonene biodegradation can produce by products that probably were not metabolized by the anaerobic microorganisms transformation products as observed in fig 5 the haib bioreactor requires at least hrt of 10 h to guarantee an efficient limonene removal for the concentration between 10 and 400 mg l 1 in the substrate specifically in period x the maximum efficiency removal achieved was 96 residual limonene concentration of 36 mg l 1 in l d 15 or hrt of 24 h hence the threshold limonene concentration that possibly is inhibitory to the anaerobic microorganism was 500 mg l 1 in limonene in the substrate there is some controversy regarding the limiting dosage of limonene for a stable anaerobic process the specific concentration range of limonene as the main source of organic matter of anaerobic degradation is unknown 12 analyzing the data available in the literature 36 38 it was found that the studies have investigated the limonene inhibition concentration values presented in the liquid and solid wastes that are commonly produced by the citric industries peel waste pressed pulp and peel press liquor unlike the present study the author s investigations carried out on waste in which residual limonene is present and therefore it is not the main organic source the limonene content in the waste treated by those studies is residual not the main organic source the inhibitory effect of limonene is related to its biocide property 10 also some researchers have observed that limonene inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in cells i e energy producing process and causes membrane damage in microorganisms 39 3 3 hs gc ms method limonene is required only 10 min in incubation to be extracted using static headspace since is a volatile compound the retention time tr of limonene was 9 5 min as shown in a total chromatographic run of 20 min the separation was designed to obtain volatile tps less and more retained than limonene the method presented linearity of 2 0 to 40 mg l 1 the linearity and lack of fit were tested by anova the lack of fit was not present and the linearity was statistically significant a wlsr was applied the lowest relative residual error obtained was using 1 x0 5 when compared to the other wlsr weights and non weighted regression the method loq was 2 0 mg l 1 and the intra day precision varied from 6 20 to 12 1 the data is demonstrated in table 5 3 4 transformation products tps identified this study was made in period x of the bioreactor operation to obtain high intensity signals from the limonene and possible transformation products tps the bioreactor samples from effluent and the bioreactor profiles l d of 3 6 9 12 and 15 corresponding to 4 8 9 6 14 4 19 2 and 24 h were analyzed by hs gc ms to evaluate the volatile formed tps in order to obtain a high signal from the tps the samples were collected during period x of bioreactor operation all compounds found in the samples were compared with control substrate and bioreactor effluent in start up period and the present compounds in both were discarded moreover lc ms ms was applied to evaluate soluble tps in the same sample bioreactor effluents previously analyzed by the hs gc ms method however the found compounds were not different from the control samples six volatile tps were found after haib treatment table 6 presents a summary of volatile tps tp 1 and tp 4 were present in bioreactor effluent samples and also in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 6 9 and 12 tp 2 and tp 6 were found only in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 9 tp 3 and tp 5 were found only in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 6 fig 6 presents the detected and identified tps molecular structures these volatile tps are reported for the first time using haib bioreactor after biological treatment with anaerobic biomass immobilized for removal of limonene among the obtained compounds tps only p cymene tp2 has been reported as the main transformation product of anaerobic biodegradation of limonene essential oils on orange peel waste by batch studies in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions 12 40 41 according to the authors limonene may be partially degraded through a metabolic pathway dehydrogenation then transformed in p cymene as the main intermediate in methanogenic cultures the p cymene is a product that is commonly used in the fine chemical industry and pharmaceutical products fragrances flavorings and herbicides 42 according to ruiz and flotats 12 p cymene increases the inhibitory effect of other terpenes despite the high limonene removal efficiencies no apparent effect of inhibition of the anaerobic consortium was detected for all tested limonene concentrations it is emphasized that a higher limonene concentration upper to 100 mg l 1 required longer hrt 14 4 and 19 2 h to reach higher removal efficiency 95 in l d 9 and 12 for hrt of 24 h l d 15 fig 5 4 conclusions the biomass inoculum was adequate for the immobilization into the support materials polyurethane foam mineral coal and gravel in the anaerobic bioreactor during the acclimatization period 60 days to the low limonene concentration 5 mg l 1 as a sole carbon source regardless of the hrt 48 or 24 h the bioreactor showed high removal efficiencies 95 for limonene concentration from 10 to 500 mg l 1 the mean total and filtered cod analyzed from substrate varied between 480 and 1150 mg l 1 and 456 to 1038 100 mg l 1 respectively while the organic matter removal attained average values of 62 73 hrt 48 h and 61 to 75 hrt 24 h also after the start up period the reactor was able to biologically remove limonene by the establishment of a microbial community adhered to support material which probably promoted the selection of several organisms about others biological limonene degradation was verified by hs gc ms method to evaluate soluble tps in the bioreactor effluent the only found compound that has been already reported by previous studies was p cymene however other compounds might have been probably obtained for the first time in the process of anaerobic degradation of limonene as the sole organic source declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13328,in brazil a large amount of liquid wastewater generated during orange juice production has a significant negative impact on the citric industries the treatment of this wastewater has been carried out in biological treatment plants however low organic removal efficiency has been achieved while using anaerobic or and aerobic processes probably due to biological inhibition by toxic compounds like limonene in this context the objective of this study was to evaluate the limonene removal by a bench scale horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass haib bioreactor 12l and the transformation products formed during the applied treatment the bioreactor was filled with three different matrices mineral coal polyurethane foam and gravel containing immobilized anaerobic sludge the used substrate contained chemical oxygen demand cod of 480 to 1251 mg l 1 and the concentrations of limonene ranging from 10 period i to 500 mg l 1 period x were monitored by gc ms the haib bioreactor removed organic matter 60 and limonene was removed with high efficiency 95 while operated at hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 and 24 h graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords limonene horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor inert media support transformation products 1 introduction according to fao food and agriculture organization united nations citrus fruits especially orange have been recognized as some of the most high consumption fruits worldwide 1 the world production of citrus reached out 145 million tons in 2017 2 about 40 to 60 of citrus fruits are processed to produce orange juice generating about 50 to 60 of liquid and solid residues 3 4 the transformation of citrus fruits generates wide amounts of liquid waste especially from concentrated orange juice manufacturing dried orange peel waste composed of peel seeds and membrane residues and pomace hence appropriate technology is required to ensure the efficient management of the involved resources the entire processing requires large amounts of water and consequently generates a large volume of wastewater around 1 96 m3 of wastewater ton of fruit 5 the citric wastewater has high organic matter content in terms of cod and bod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus 6 which are ideal for biological conversion anaerobic and aerobic processes are commonly used by the orange juice factories such as anaerobic aerobic facultative or combined pond systems more compact wastewater treatment systems including activated sludge 7 8 and high rate anaerobic reactors 9 have been studied to treat this wastewater however citrus fruits have a defense structure for protection against microorganism invasion that includes anti microbial compounds e g limonene so citrus waste can negatively affect the biological processes 5 10 in fact limonene has been shown to inhibit both methanogenic and hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria 11 12 several investigations have been carried out to solve the problem of inhibition of anaerobic digestion caused by the limonene which can consist in the conversion of limonene into less toxic compounds 13 mizuki et al 14 reported a maximum limonene concentration of 400 mg l 1 to avoid the inhibition of anaerobic digestion in a semi continuous system with mesophilic temperature while forgács et al 15 reported compliance values between 450 and 900 mg l 1 for inhibition in anaerobic digestion at thermophilic temperature according to ruiz and flotats 12 the inhibition concentrations of anaerobic digestion batch reactors by terpene are around 3000 mg l 1 when low in inhibitory concentrations the compounds can serve as carbon and energy source for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms 16 the presence of terpene limonene an essential oil in the citric wastewater as well as few studies related to the limonene removal by anaerobic processes reinforces the necessity of new alternatives to promote the preexistent biological treatments 12 the process of biomass attachment i e immobilization process allows high cellular concentration and retention in the anaerobic bioreactors in this case the main objective is to enhance the cellular retention time as wells as to improve the diverse microbial community interactions consequently the metabolic interactions among microorganisms can facilitate the conversion of primary and intermediate substrates between the diverse community participating in the complex anaerobic digestion process 17 18 the horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor haib presents an interesting alternative treatment of a wide range of wastewater this design has been successfully applied to the treatment of toxic and recalcitrant compounds such as pentachlorophenol 19 20 phenol 21 formaldehyde 22 benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex 23 24 and las surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 25 26 as well as sulfate removal from sulfate rich wastewaters 27 28 therefore these studies indicate the suitability of haib bioreactor to assess the anaerobic treatment for citric industry wastewater in this context this study aimed to evaluate the biological removal of limonene by immobilized anaerobic biomass bioreactor using three different inert media support mineral coal polyurethane foam and gravel additionally this study also focused on identifying the transformation products formed during the applied anaerobic treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrate characteristic the substrate basal medium was composed of beef extract sodium bicarbonate and detergent to produce a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of approximately 500 mgo2 l 1 the concentration of each component was stoichiometrically measured and calculated in terms of cod according to apha 29 following the cod n p of 350 5 1 ratio 30 as shown in table 1 the used commercial limonene was r limonene c10h16 technical sigma aldrich 62 122 90 sum of enantiomers the terpene theoretical cod 3 3 mgcod mglimonene was dosed in crescent concentration in the substrate table 1 to produce the desired total cod concentration of feed 480 1150 mgo2 l 1 for limonene concentration of 5 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 however limonene has high volatility at room temperature which hampered its manipulation and homogenization in liquid medium especially in water due to its nature as an essential oil in order to avoid this problem the feed was maintained with constant agitation besides an increased addition of detergent to promote a better dilution of the limonene at a high concentration 2 2 haib bioreactor and experimental procedure the bench scale horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor haib was made of a pvc tube with 150 cm of length l and an internal diameter d of 10 cm resulting in a length diameter l d ratio of 15 the bioreactor presented four intermediates equally spaced 30 cm sampling ports l d 0 substrate 3 6 9 12 and 15 effluent the total and useful volumes bed porosity of 50 were 12 l and 6 0 l respectively the biogas was collected through three sampling ports located in the upper part of the haib fig 1 the bioreactor was completely filled with cubic polyurethane foam mineral coal and gravel matrices with approximately 1 0 to 1 5 cm of side anaerobic granular sludge from a uasb bioreactor applied for the treatment of poultry slaughterhouse wastewater was used as inoculum the sludge with total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss of 42 2 and 36 5 g l 1 respectively was immobilized in matrices inert supports according to the methodology described by zaiat et al 17 the matrices were introduced inside the bioreactor around 30 of each material with immobilized biomass occupied approximately 12 l which means 4 l of each one the characteristics of the applied support media are presented in table 2 it should be noted that all the matrices were previously washed before the bioreactor inoculation initially during the start up period the limonene concentration in the feed 500 mgo2 l 1 was maintained at 5 mg l 1 for 60 days hrt 48 h in this way the acclimatization of the microbial biomass was facilitated after the start up the bioreactor was continuously fed with limonene based on substrate substrate reservoir 20 l for 168 days and maintained at 25 2 c in a controlled room temperature sludge discharge was not provided as well as cellular retention time was not controlled during the experimental period table 3 presents the operational conditions applied in the haib in terms of cod limonene concentration and flowrate 2 2 1 bioreactor monitoring haib bioreactor 168 days was monitored through physical chemical analysis substrate and effluent samples such as chemical oxygen demand cod total and filtered membrane 1 2 μm volatile suspended solids vss total suspend solids tss and ph according apha 29 determinations of volatile fatty acids vfa as acetic acid hac and bicarbonate alkalinity ba followed the methodology described by dilallo albertson 31 modified by ripley et al 32 respectively the biogas methane concentrations was evaluated through gas chromatography gc and was performed in a shimadzu gas chromatography gc 2014 model with thermal conductivity detector and a hp plot column 30 m 0 53 mm 40 μm hydrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml min 1 the temperatures of the injection port oven and detector were 158 c 36 c and 172 c respectively the biogas samples were collected from the hydraulic seal and gas sample of 0 5 ml was injected in duplicate in order to monitor the limonene concentration in the substrate and haib effluent a headspace followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry hs gc ms method was used according to camargo et al 2020 33 a gc ms model 7890b gas chromatograph and ms 5977a mass spectrometer and ctc pal system rsi in the headspace mode was used during the sample preparation with 250 μl of injection volume the transformation products tps were also determined by hs gc ms the ms was used in the scan mode mass range 50 to 550 u to obtain the compounds spectra and for limonene quantification to identify the tps a control sample from the substrate without limonene and bioreactor effluent before the limonene introduction in the treatment was compared to the effluent samples and samples from the bioreactor profiles the method parameters are shown in table 4 2 2 2 spatial profiles samples from the spatial profiles were collected from the intermediate sampling ports l d 0 3 6 9 12 and 15 as shown in fig 1 each l d ratio implies a partial hrt and represented a specific step of the treatment the haib bioreactor provided the segregation of different microbial communities which were responsible for carrying out the different biochemical reactions involved in the anaerobic digestion in addition to providing favorable conditions for the development of biofilms 34 the partial hrt was calculated considering the haib proportional volume from the entrance until each sampling port the spatial profiles for limonene and filtered cod were obtained after the haib bioreactor had achieved a pseudo steady state flow variations lower than 10 in the efficiency removal total cod at the end of each operation period table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the haib bioreactor for the acclimatization of biomass inoculum to the limonene the first 60 days of operation a low concentration 5 mg l 1 of this compound was applied to start up the bioreactor after this stage the limonene concentration gradually increased from 10 to 500 mg l 1 as shown in fig 2 the cod removal varied from 62 to 73 in the period i v and 61 to 75 in period vi x it was also noted that the methane concentration in the biogas 65 5 70 1 obtained in the start up period was not maintained during the experimental periods i x from the first period i it was observed low methane contents 10 1 13 2 with the largest portion of the biogas composed of co2 thus biogas production values were insignificant indicating only partial degradation of the substrate these removal values were very relevant since the biomass was exposed only to the limonene as a sole carbon source it is well known that this citrus compound is toxic to anaerobic digestion due to its antimicrobial properties 12 a wide range of limonene concentrations was applied and the hrt was further reduced from 48 to 24 h after period v therefore the cod substrate increased slightly as the limonene concentration was increased in the substrate at each operation period during the periods i to x the total and filtered cod from substrate varied between 480 28 mg l 1 i to 1150 120 mgl 1 x and 456 37 mgl 1 i to 1038 100 mgl 1 x respectively as it can be observed in fig 2 total and filtered effluent were very similar cod ranging from 162 13 mg l 1 iii to 332 23 mg l 1 x and 147 12 mg l 1 iii to 312 29 mg l 1 x respectively hence slightly low values of total and volatile suspended solids concentrations of the effluent were obtained as 14 mg l 1 tss and 9 mg l 1 vss respectively the carbonate carbonic gas relation is responsible for maintaining the ph stable in order to provide buffering i e ideal conditions in the anaerobic bioreactors 35 the bicarbonate alkalinity already provided by the substrate in addition to the ba produced by the system was essential for the proper control of ph both substrate and effluent ph were stable in the range of 7 26 to 7 54 and 7 06 to 7 29 respectively fig 3 depicts the ba and vfa values the negligible concentration of vfa in the effluent during all operational periods is strictly related to ba generation by the bioreactor the effluent alkalinity fluctuated between 300 39 mgcaco3 l 1 at the operation condition v and 345 18 mg caco3 l 1 at experimental condition vii while the substrate mean ba concentration was 280 18 mgcaco3 l 1 iv moreover the vfa in the effluent was maintained in 47 3 mghac l 1 iii to 64 3 mghac l 1 x with substrate vfa slightly higher value ranging from 57 5 mghac l 1 v and 68 8 mghac l 1 x such results indicate the successful establishment of anaerobic biomass able to carry out simultaneously cod and limonene removal 3 2 limonene removal for the periods with hrt of 48 h each intermediate point l d ratio of 3 6 9 12 and 15 had the individual hrt of 9 6 19 2 28 8 38 4 e 48 h while periods vi to x the individual hrt were 4 8 9 6 14 4 19 2 e 24 h respectively as shown in fig 4 in the point l d 3 hrt 9 6 h limonene removal percentages higher than 95 were achieved during periods i to v 10 50 mg l 1 the exponential curve observed in fig 4 was expected however limonene residual concentration was detected in the range of 0 05 a 0 21 mg l 1 in the sample point l d 15 as well as cod total and filtered the cod residual can be related to intermediate products produced during the limonene anaerobic biodegradation from the point l d 3 that were not metabolized along the bioreactor l d 6 9 e 12 in periods vi to xi the limonene concentration in the substrate was maintained between 100 and 500 mg l 1 although hrt was reduced from 48 to 24 h limonene removal upper 95 was reached only in the point l d 9 and 12 hrt 14 4 and 19 2 h as it can be seen in fig 4 at l d 15 the residual concentration of limonene varied from 1 57 to 14 7 mg l 1 as well as it was observed the increased cod concentration at this point similar as shown in fig 2 as previously mentioned the limonene biodegradation can produce by products that probably were not metabolized by the anaerobic microorganisms transformation products as observed in fig 5 the haib bioreactor requires at least hrt of 10 h to guarantee an efficient limonene removal for the concentration between 10 and 400 mg l 1 in the substrate specifically in period x the maximum efficiency removal achieved was 96 residual limonene concentration of 36 mg l 1 in l d 15 or hrt of 24 h hence the threshold limonene concentration that possibly is inhibitory to the anaerobic microorganism was 500 mg l 1 in limonene in the substrate there is some controversy regarding the limiting dosage of limonene for a stable anaerobic process the specific concentration range of limonene as the main source of organic matter of anaerobic degradation is unknown 12 analyzing the data available in the literature 36 38 it was found that the studies have investigated the limonene inhibition concentration values presented in the liquid and solid wastes that are commonly produced by the citric industries peel waste pressed pulp and peel press liquor unlike the present study the author s investigations carried out on waste in which residual limonene is present and therefore it is not the main organic source the limonene content in the waste treated by those studies is residual not the main organic source the inhibitory effect of limonene is related to its biocide property 10 also some researchers have observed that limonene inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in cells i e energy producing process and causes membrane damage in microorganisms 39 3 3 hs gc ms method limonene is required only 10 min in incubation to be extracted using static headspace since is a volatile compound the retention time tr of limonene was 9 5 min as shown in a total chromatographic run of 20 min the separation was designed to obtain volatile tps less and more retained than limonene the method presented linearity of 2 0 to 40 mg l 1 the linearity and lack of fit were tested by anova the lack of fit was not present and the linearity was statistically significant a wlsr was applied the lowest relative residual error obtained was using 1 x0 5 when compared to the other wlsr weights and non weighted regression the method loq was 2 0 mg l 1 and the intra day precision varied from 6 20 to 12 1 the data is demonstrated in table 5 3 4 transformation products tps identified this study was made in period x of the bioreactor operation to obtain high intensity signals from the limonene and possible transformation products tps the bioreactor samples from effluent and the bioreactor profiles l d of 3 6 9 12 and 15 corresponding to 4 8 9 6 14 4 19 2 and 24 h were analyzed by hs gc ms to evaluate the volatile formed tps in order to obtain a high signal from the tps the samples were collected during period x of bioreactor operation all compounds found in the samples were compared with control substrate and bioreactor effluent in start up period and the present compounds in both were discarded moreover lc ms ms was applied to evaluate soluble tps in the same sample bioreactor effluents previously analyzed by the hs gc ms method however the found compounds were not different from the control samples six volatile tps were found after haib treatment table 6 presents a summary of volatile tps tp 1 and tp 4 were present in bioreactor effluent samples and also in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 6 9 and 12 tp 2 and tp 6 were found only in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 9 tp 3 and tp 5 were found only in bioreactor profile samples with l d of 6 fig 6 presents the detected and identified tps molecular structures these volatile tps are reported for the first time using haib bioreactor after biological treatment with anaerobic biomass immobilized for removal of limonene among the obtained compounds tps only p cymene tp2 has been reported as the main transformation product of anaerobic biodegradation of limonene essential oils on orange peel waste by batch studies in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions 12 40 41 according to the authors limonene may be partially degraded through a metabolic pathway dehydrogenation then transformed in p cymene as the main intermediate in methanogenic cultures the p cymene is a product that is commonly used in the fine chemical industry and pharmaceutical products fragrances flavorings and herbicides 42 according to ruiz and flotats 12 p cymene increases the inhibitory effect of other terpenes despite the high limonene removal efficiencies no apparent effect of inhibition of the anaerobic consortium was detected for all tested limonene concentrations it is emphasized that a higher limonene concentration upper to 100 mg l 1 required longer hrt 14 4 and 19 2 h to reach higher removal efficiency 95 in l d 9 and 12 for hrt of 24 h l d 15 fig 5 4 conclusions the biomass inoculum was adequate for the immobilization into the support materials polyurethane foam mineral coal and gravel in the anaerobic bioreactor during the acclimatization period 60 days to the low limonene concentration 5 mg l 1 as a sole carbon source regardless of the hrt 48 or 24 h the bioreactor showed high removal efficiencies 95 for limonene concentration from 10 to 500 mg l 1 the mean total and filtered cod analyzed from substrate varied between 480 and 1150 mg l

biologically remove limonene by the establishment of a microbial community adhered to support material which probably promoted the selection of several organisms about others biological limonene

13329,this study investigated detailed characterization of hospital wastewater size distribution of major organic pollutants and cod fractionation in order to estimate the amount of wastewater water consumption values and number of patients from 1156 hospitals were assessed statistically and hourly water consumption data of a middle size hospital were recorded significant differences were observed in the total water consumption of the hospitals even among the ones having similar bed capacities the average daily water consumption per hospital was about 140 m3 while the 1st and 3rd quartile were 25 m3 and 150 m3 respectively pollutant size distribution psd analysis provided specific fingerprints for cod bod colour and aox parameters of hospital wastewater size distribution analyses resulted that about 20 of the aox was in size range smaller than 1 kda which might be attributed to adsorbable iodinated compounds aoi generated in iodinated x ray process according to the psd results it can be estimated that up to 85 90 of the total cod and 75 80 of the total aox can be removed by direct filtration process using an ultrafiltration sized membrane cod fractionation experiments revealed that hospital wastewater has more soluble inert cod content than domestic wastewater with a similar cod concentration therefore slightly higher cod concentrations can be expected at the biological treatment effluent of hospital wastewater compared to domestic wastewaters with similar cod concentrations the difference may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and cleaning agents of inert properties graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations aox adsorbable organic halogens aoi adsorbable iodinated compounds ct0 total cod mgcod l 1 cs0 biodegradable cod

sector requiring high amounts of water usage and are known for the variety and high rates of wastewater pollution amount and characteristics of wastewater generated by hospitals vary widely depending on the types of services provided by the facilities number of beds number of patients and availability of laboratories water usage in hospitals ranges largely from 200 to 1200 l bed 1 d 1 and commonly around 200 400 bed 1 d 1 1 2 and 5 10 l outpatient day and 100 l surgical procedure day 3 furthermore it is emphasized that there is no significant correlation between the number of patients and the amount of water used 2 hospital wastewater generated by various services laboratories surgery polyclinic laundry kitchen etc contains a wide range of macropollutants bod5 cod ss etc and micropollutants aox pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disruptors other drugs etc in various concentrations 2 4 5 as the main source of micropollutants in the environment many studies 6 10 point at the discharge of hospital wastewater due to the fact that micropollutant concentrations in hospital wastewater are much higher than those in municipal wastewater on the other hand hospital wastewater is considered to have similar pollutant characteristics with domestic wastewater in terms of conventional parameters therefore it is usually directly discharged into the sewer without any pretreatment in many countries if there is a line nearby 11 recently it is argued that municipal wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove micropollutants 12 17 and failure to remove them would allow the entry of a broad spectrum of compounds into the environment 18 causing harm to human health and ecosystem 9 10 18 22 hospitals that do not have a sewage line in the immediate vicinity need to treat their wastewater on site however detailed characterization of hospital wastewater which is required for both prevention of pollution at source and selection of the treatment technology is missing in the literature another risk of untreated hospital wastewater discharges directly into the receiving environment is the transmission of diseases especially in the presence of epidemic conditions such as sars cov 2 the half life of sars cov 2 in hospital wastewater is estimated to be between 4 8 and 7 2 h at 20 c 23 the virus is excreted with human urine and feces and mixes with other wastewater sources 24 sewer systems and hospital wastewaters may be a potential route of spread 25 therefore presence of pathogenic viruses and other pathogens needs to be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate treatment technology and disinfection method especially for hospital wastewaters among the major pollutants detected in hospital wastewater aox is one of the cumulative and hazardous pollutant parameters mostly generated by the x ray contrast media solvents disinfectants and sterilization chemicals etc and requires special attention aox has toxic effects on aquatic organisms it can accumulate in the food chain and cause persistent effects on the environment 26 aox is a measure of halogenated compounds trihalomethanes thms organic solvents such as trichloroethene tetrachloroethene and other halogenated alkanes and alkenes chlorinated and brominated pesticides and herbicides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs chlorinated aromatics such as hexachlorobenzene and 2 4 di chlorophenol and high molecular weight partially chlorinated aquatic humic substances 27 one of the main sources of aox in municipal wastewaters is thought to be hospital wastewater 28 despite the importance of treatment and management at source there is a very limited number of studies in the literature about the sources of aox discharges in various services of hospitals 29 jekel and wischnak 30 attributes high rates of aoi fraction in total aox observed in municipal wastewater to discharges from hospitals in the same study it is reported that most organic iodine x ray contrast media are in the range of 700 900 da size and 80 of the organic substances in the aoi falls under the low molecular fraction with a molar mass below 1 000 da accordingly the size distribution of the aox parameter may contribute to a better understanding of the sources of aox discharges in hospitals activated sludge systems and membrane bioreactors mbrs are the most common treatment technologies used for treating hospital wastewater 31 36 however various advanced treatment technologies such as membrane processes ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis 37 38 adsorption 39 and advanced oxidation processes 40 such as heterogeneous photocatalysis ozonation 41 fenton 42 photo fenton 43 electro fenton 44 47 and uv h202 48 49 have also been used for the removal of micropollutants in hospital wastewater in recent years the particle size distribution psd method has become an important tool for physical characterization of pollutant in wastewater size distribution of pollutants can be an important index to evaluate the treatability of wastewater by biological physical and chemical processes 50 psd gives an idea when estimating the performance of chemical settling process and is also very useful in the evaluation of the separation efficiency of the membrane systems 51 52 in addition the size of pollutants can affect the membrane fouling mechanisms in mbr systems 53 54 the sizes of the organic pollutants can significantly affect the biochemical degradation the small size organics can pass easily through the cell membranes of bacteria while the larger particles need to be hydrolysed before the uptake 51 55 psd has a significant potential in completing respirometric methods to better interpret cod fractionation in relation to biological degradation cod fractionation is also considered as an important tool for the selection of proper wastewater treatment technology 52 to the best of our knowledge there is no study in the literature on the size distribution of major organic pollutants and cod fractionation of hospital wastewater which may provide substantial information for the treatment efficiency with different technologies and also for management of pollutants at source in this context this study aims to investigate the detailed characterization of hospital wastewater to contribute to the selection of treatment methods and prevention of pollution at source in this scope the water consumption data of 1156 hospitals were evaluated statistically the wastewaters generated from three hospitals were monitored for one year the breakdown of water use for main hospital activities were assessed and the non biodegradable cod fractions of hospital wastewater were experimentally determined besides particle size distribution of major organic pollutants was assessed by the filtration method 2 material and method 2 1 water consumption in this study annual water usage data of 1156 hospitals in turkey with different sizes and bed capacities varying from 10 to 3500 were collected moreover data on the number of employees inpatients and outpatients including the number of days served were also recorded water consumption data were collected by conducting a survey through the ministry of environment and urbanization and provincial environment directorates patient statistics for the relevant period are the official data provided by the ministry of health the water consumption profile was evaluated based on person equivalent which was calculated according to 8 working hours in addition hourly water consumption in a full fledged and medium sized state run hospital was monitored for 10 weeks 2 5 weeks for each season and evaluated for a better understanding of the variation of water consumption in a day and from day to day in addition water consumption resulting from main hospital activities such as analyses sterilization and dialysis in laboratories was estimated using the water consumption of all these equipment and analyzers along with the test numbers this hospital which had a capacity of 201 beds an average of approximately 765 000 outpatients and 49 000 hospitalization days per year and various laboratories including biochemistry microbiology and pathology revealed an average water consumption of 44 000 m3 year 115 m3 day 2 2 analytical methods for wastewater characterization flow proportional composite samples were collected quarterly from the wastewaters of three hospitals at final discharge points into the public sewerage system for this purpose sampling equipment teledyne isco 6712 was installed in the manholes just before the points of discharge to the sewer wastewater samples were collected for 24 h and flow proportional composite wastewater samples were prepared by mixing the samples according to the water consumption in the respective period samples were analyzed immediately and stored at 4 c the ph parameter was measured by a ph meter hach hq40d multimeter the cod values of samples were determined using standard methods 5220d 27 adsorbable organic halogen aox and formaldehyde were determined using spectrophotometer cell test with merck prove 600 metal analyses were conducted with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkinelmer nexion 300xx icp ms other analytical measurements were conducted according to standard methods 27 the true colour was determined as ptco using the spectrophotometric single wavelength method as defined in standard methods 27 and also the absorbance values at wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm were measured according to the din en iso 7887 standard 56 the results were presented as spectral absorption coefficient sac according to the following equation 1 sac λ a d f sac λ sac value at wavelength λ m 1 a absorbance value of the sample at wavelength λ d cuvette size of spectrophotometer mm f factor to obtain spectral absorbance value in m 1 unit f 1000 as both colour measurement methods require the removal of particulate matter before analysis the colour measurements were conducted only on the permeates of 0 45 μm and smaller size filters all of the other analyses were carried out on all filtration ultrafiltration samples including raw wastewater and permeates of 1 2 μm filtration 2 3 cod fractionation cod fractionation involves the identification of inert and biodegradable cod together with readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable fractions total cod was measured according to the standard methods 5220 b open reflux method and the soluble cod was measured after filtration with a 0 45 μm filter non biodegradable cod fractions of hospital wastewater were experimentally determined according to the procedure proposed by orhon et al 57 for this purpose two reactors were run one fed with raw hospital wastewater and the other with hospital wastewater filtered using a 0 45 μm filter both reactors were seeded with a small amount of biomass taken from a laboratory scale mbr reactor treating hospital wastewater nutrient and buffer solutions were added to the reactor prior to testing to avoid nutrient limitation furthermore plenty of alkalinity was provided to both of the reactors the reactors were continuously aerated for approximately 45 days to ensure the reduction of all biodegradable organics and the mineralization of biomass final threshold values of the total and soluble cod ct and st were measured and the results were evaluated as defined in the procedure initially the reactor fed with raw wastewater consisted of biodegradable cod fraction and soluble and particulate inert cod fractions at the end of the experiment it was assumed that all biodegradable cod was biodegraded and the mineralization of biomass was completed therefore at the end of the experiment the soluble cod in the reactor fed with filtered wastewater consisted of only the soluble microbial products and the initially soluble inert cod the total cod in the reactor fed with raw wastewater comprised soluble and particulate microbial products and initially soluble and particulate inert cod by using mass balance calculations soluble and particulate inert cod fractions were estimated as follows initially the reactor fed with raw wastewater consists of total biodegradable cod soluble inert cod and particulate inert cod 2 c t0 c s0 s i x i at the end of the experiment upon the completion of biological activity assuming ss xs xh 0 the unfiltered effluent becomes the sum of soluble and particulate inert cod of wastewater and soluble and particulate microbial products 3 c t1 x i x p1 s i s p1 and the filtered effluent becomes the sum of soluble inert cod of wastewater and soluble microbial products 4 s t1 s p1 s i therefore if we rewrite the eq 1 by replacing total soluble cod in the effluent the eq becomes 5 c t1 s t1 x i x p1 the amount of total cod removed is 6 c t1 c t0 c t1 c s0 x p1 s p1 7 c t2 s t0 c t2 s s0 x p2 s p2 particulate inert cod concentration xi can be calculated using the amount of total cod removed in both of the reactors as follows 8 x i c t 1 s t 1 c t 2 s t 2 δ c t 1 δ c t 2 initial soluble inert cod concentration si can be calculated using soluble cod and generated soluble microbial products 9 s i s t 1 s p 1 2 4 particle size distribution filtration and ultrafiltration experiments determination of size distribution of pollutants in wastewater is an important parameter for the selection of suitable treatment specifically when making use of membrane integrated treatment technologies therefore batch filtration experiments were conducted to estimate the size distribution of pollutants in hospital wastewater smaller than 1 2 μm filtration tests were carried out using the sterlitech dead end filtration test system model tmhp4750 us with a total volume and membrane area of 300 ml and 14 6 cm2 respectively the room temperature was kept at about 20 c during the filtration tests inert n2 gas was used to provide positive pressure during the filtration the filtration pressure was set to lower values than those recommended by the manufacturer continuous mixing was applied to avoid concentration polarization on the membrane the procedure for determining the size distribution of pollutants by filtration method was well documented as stipulated in the study of hocaoglu and orhon 52 the samples were first filtered through a glass fiber filter with a nominal pore size of 1 2 mm millipore ap40 and filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm durapore pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride respectively then the filtered sample was sequentially passed through ultrafiltration membranes for ultrafiltration experiments series of chemically compatible cellulose membrane discs were used with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 100 30 10 5 3 and 1 kda millipore uf filters ultracel pl series usa the size of the pollutant that passes through the filter represents the cumulative value of all fractions below the pore size of the filter therefore the ratio of the parameter remaining in the size range between two consecutive filters can be calculated as the difference measured in the corresponding permeates to this end nominal mwco values expressed in kda were converted into size values in nm using the approach proposed by mcgregor 58 and karahan et al 55 3 results and discussion 3 1 water consumption in this study the annual water consumption data of 1156 hospitals with different service levels and services were statistically evaluated based on the number of patients per year the average daily water consumption per hospital was calculated to be approximately 140 m3 day with a variation range from 2 to 2650 m3 day the median value was approximately 60 m3 day while the 1st quartile was approximately 25 m3 day and the 3rd quartile was 150 m3 day significant differences were observed in the total water consumptions of the hospitals even among the ones having similar bed capacities only the size number of beds and or the number of patients were insufficient to determine a correlation and to estimate water consumption this is because other factors such as laboratory services number of operations presence of laundry and kitchen services and differences in water usage patterns of users inpatients outpatients employees etc affect the total consumption in this study a stronger relationship was revealed with total water consumption by taking into account the total number of people tnp which is the sum of the number of outpatients inpatients and employees compared to only a limited aspect the bed capacity or the numbers of inpatients outpatients or employees fig 1 also in order to establish a stronger correlation with the unit water consumption of hospitals the person equivalent pe approach was applied on the basis of 8 working hours and by this way the contributions of water usage by different groups were normalized according to their residence time in hospitals this method allowed a better relationship with unit water consumption especially in hospitals with a significant number of inpatients the water consumption profile of pe is followed by the log normal distribution fig 1b the average water consumption per pe was estimated to be about 120 l day varying from 25 to 870 l day the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile values were approximately 100 l day 70 l day and 150 l day respectively however it was still possible to observe quite significant variations on the average unit water consumption value due to the uncertainty of the contributions of healthcare facility services such as the availability of medical laboratories operation rooms and the number of operations the presence of laundry and kitchen services and size of irrigated area etc in order to evaluate the change of water consumption in a day and from day to day water consumption of a hospital with 201 bed capacity was monitored on a two hour basis for a total of 10 weeks in four seasons the average daily water consumption of the hospital was 115 m3 day 1 with fluctuation ranges from 88 to 130 m3 day 1 during the study period fig 2a the difference was drastic over the weekend as expected the highest average flowrate was recorded on tuesday with a flowrate approximately 130 m3 day 1 while the lowest was recorded on sunday with 88 m3 day 1 overall about 77 of the hospital s total water consumption occurred on weekdays the average hourly water consumption of the hospital was approximately 4 9 m3 h 1 with variations ranging from 4 1 to 5 6 m3 h 1 fig 2b three small peaks were observed in a day morning hours 04 00 06 00 noon hours 12 00 14 00 and evening hours 20 00 22 00 the peak demands of the hospital might be due to the daily routine activities before during and after working hours the peak observed at noon may be explained with the extensive use by outpatients and employees and the lunchtime of inpatients while the peak observed at early morning and evening hours may be mainly attributed to the water use of inpatients and the cleaning works in general the daily water consumption values were in the range of literature values however differences were observed in hourly water consumption data while orengard et al 9 reported only one significant peak between 5 and 10 a m a more distributed profile was observed in this study with 3 small peaks the difference may be attributed to the patient visiting hours cleaning times working hours of employees etc water consumption in hospitals varies depending on many factors such as the capacity services provided by the hospital availability of laboratories etc in order to better understand the contribution of hospital activities to the water use consumptions resulting from main hospital activities and services such as laboratories sterilization and hemodialysis were estimated for this purpose water consumption of each analyzer and equipment was calculated along with the test numbers the breakdown of water uses in total water consumption including hospital activities and uses by laboratories are presented in fig 3 the results revealed that the share of hospital activities in total water consumption is considerably low compared to domestic type uses and other uses such as water consumption in toilets showers by patients and employees uses for food preparation washing laundry and cooling losses in water softening services etc on average about 97 6 of the total water consumed was used for domestic type needs and others while the rest 2 4 is consumed for hospital activities among the hospital activities consumption for hemodialysis accounts for the majority which is followed by the uses in laboratories and sterilization when we look at the breakdown of water consumption by laboratory types biochemistry laboratory uses the highest amount of water which is followed by blood center and pathology laboratory to sum up in this study the share of hospital activities and laboratories in total water consumption was found to be much lower than the literature values which were reported to be in a range of 15 35 for hospital activities and 10 20 for laboratories 59 60 the main reason for this difference may be attributed to the method applied for the estimation in this study the amount of water used in the laboratories only represents the amount of water used in the analysis consumption by analyzers and for device cleaning etc and does not include the personal consumption such as the use by technicians for hand washing toilet shower etc furthermore differences between hospitals parameters analyzed and types of equipment may also have an effect on the difference 3 2 wastewater characterization physicochemical characterization of hospital wastewater was made through monitoring on daily composite samples collected every three months in a year to have full coverage of seasonal variations the characteristics revealed in terms of major parameters like average concentrations minimums maximums and standard deviations are presented in table 1 along with the relevant hospital and domestic wastewater characterization data from the literature the average concentrations of cod bod5 tkn and nh4 n were 785 mg l 221 mg l 69 mg l and 41 mg l respectively and these results are consistent with the literature values for hospital wastewater whereas total phosphorus concentration was measured to range from 0 7 mg l to 15 5 mg l which is lower than the values reported for hospital wastewater this may be explained by the use of non phosphorus detergents in the hospitals sampled various toxic mutagenic or carcinogenic dyes such as eosin hematoxylin oil red o and sudan black are used in hospitals especially in pathology and microbiology laboratories the use of such dyes may contribute significantly to the increase of wastewater colour 43 61 in this study the average colour value for hospital wastewater was 98 ptco varying from 41 to 219 ptco which was significantly lower than reported values for hospital wastewater but much higher than that of domestic wastewater the lower concentration than the literature may be attributed to management at source which includes the collection of dyes as hazardous waste due to their toxic mutagenic and or carcinogenic properties in the hospitals sampled the colour parameter may be used as an indicator to detect the discharge of hazardous dyes by hospitals in this study aox concentration ranging from 3 2 to 32 mg l with an average of 8 3 mg l was found to be very high compared to the literature values for hospital wastewater as well as for domestic wastewater the high aox value observed in this study may be attributed to the intensive use of chlorinated disinfectants and detergents and or a high amount of iodinated contrast media discharge due to the extensive use of x ray one of the other important pollutants found in hospital wastewater is formaldehyde which is frequently used as a sterilant and for the protection of samples mainly in pathology laboratories although formaldehyde is biodegradable its direct discharge to the receiving environment has negative effects 62 and should be avoided at high concentrations in this study formaldehyde was found to be slightly higher with an average value of 0 4 mg l than the literature values the phenol concentration was lower than the literature values for hospital wastewater but slightly higher than that of domestic wastewater with an average value of 0 2 mg l regarding heavy metal concentrations copper and zinc values are consistent with the literature while the chromium and nickel concentrations were lower than the literature values reported for hospital wastewater 3 3 size distribution of pollutants determination of the size distribution of pollutants in wastewater is of great importance to estimate the removal efficiencies of pollutants by physical chemical and biological processes especially when incorporating wastewater treatment with membrane technologies however the typical conventional methods of characterization could only differentiate between soluble and particulate components in this study the size of organic pollutants which are important in terms of discharge standard were investigated at a wider range of sizes from 2 nm to 1200 nm by conducting sequential filtration experiments table 2 shows the cumulative fraction of pollutants with respect to different separation methods the total cod and bod measured were 480 mg l and 165 mg l respectively which remain within the concentration range for hospital wastewater table 3 shows the cod fractionation in of initial value for hospital wastewater at various particle size distributions psd and includes the literature values for domestic wastewater and black water for comparison other organic pollutant parameters such as bod aox and colour for hospital wastewater were also tabulated results revealed that the psd for bod and cod was compatible with domestic wastewater the concentration of aox and true colour were measured to be 3 mg l and 146 pt co respectively the differing bod profiles exhibited similar patterns closely matching the relevant cod profiles a significant proportion of both cod and bod with 47 and 48 respectively revealed a size range greater than 1200 nm over 80 of the bod contained in hospital wastewater was in particulate form 450 nm while the fraction 2 nm was 11 the second significant portion the distribution of bod in these ranges was well partitioned with small differences however slight differences were observed as compared to the cod distributions in domestic wastewater from 220 nm to 2 nm which may be explained with the difference in the biodegradability of organics in these ranges also the slight differences may be due to the lower sensitivity of the bod test compared to the cod test aox is a measure of organically bound halogens in a sample and it is a sum of several substances with different degradability some of those substances may also be persistent and tend to bioaccumulate in the environment and some are toxic to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations therefore understanding the type and source of aox may contribute to the decision of the appropriate management method the size distribution of aox may give an idea about the source and or type of the halogenated organics as can be seen in table 3 and fig 4 the psd of the aox parameter for hospital wastewater seems to have a specific fingerprint slightly different from the profiles of cod in general about 49 of the aox contained in hospital wastewater occurred in a range from 450 nm to 1200 nm while the largest portion was in the size of 1200 nm for cod overall about 68 3 of the aox contained in hospital wastewater was in the size of 220 nm the second significant portion in the aox parameter was the size range smaller than 2 nm 1 kda with 20 which was almost two times bigger than the cod portion the molecular weights of most organic iodine x ray contrast media fall in the range from 700 to 900 da 90 in this study the second largest peak was observed in the size range smaller than 1 kda 2 nm this may indicate that about 20 of the aox in the hospital wastewater was in the form of aoi originating mainly from iodinated x ray contrast media being consistent with the aoi proportion results in the literature 90 since iodinated x ray contrast media are not completely biodegradable 91 92 their removal is of great importance according to the characterization results of this study avg aox concentration of 8 3 mg l the total amount of aox discharged from a hospital of this size 201 bed capacity annually 765 000 outpatients and 49 000 days of hospitalization in total with an average daily wastewater flow rate of 115 m3 is estimated to be around 70 kg per year in mass based on the estimated ratio of aoi to the total aox revealed in psd of this study it may be concluded that separation of urine from the toilets used by x ray given patients at source could reduce the discharge of aox by approximately 20 kg per year the colour parameter is one of the collective and indicator parameters and may be important for hospitals due to the use of toxic mutagenic and or carcinogenic dyes in pathology and microbiology laboratories true colour measurements and absorbance readings at the wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm were performed only on the permeates of 450 nm and smaller size filters as defined in the standard methods the results revealed that the colour fraction followed bimodal patterns which concentrated mainly between 8 and 450 nm and below 3 nm similar bimodal patterns were also observed in the sac values of the all wavelengths measured the main true colour fractions were 44 and 42 for the size range of 8 450 nm and 3 nm respectively compared to black water 52 a significant difference was the size range smaller than 3 nm which was not available in the black water the difference may be explained with the post staining washes performed in pathology and microbiology laboratories in the hospital psd provides information to predict the performance of the chemical precipitation process and the separation efficiency of direct membrane filtration systems according to the psd results of this study it can be estimated that 75 80 of the total cod and 65 70 of the total aox can be removed as a result of an efficient chemical precipitation process or direct filtration with a microfiltration sized membrane furthermore removal of up to 85 90 of total cod and 75 80 of total aox and 65 70 of true colour and 65 70 of sac can be achieved with an ultrafiltration sized membrane separation process for comparison fig 5 shows the psd of different types of wastewaters including black water 52 tannery wastewater 55 domestic wastewater and textile wastewater 51 it should be noted that 47 of the cod in hospital wastewater was in particulate form size of 1200 nm while the particulate cod ratio was 65 in domestic wastewater and 61 4 in black water however unlike the domestic wastewater and black water a high amount of cod fraction between 450 and 1200 nm was observed in hospital wastewater this may be explained by the disintegration of some particulate cods due to the high concentration of oxidants in the hospital wastewater and the shift of the cod fraction between 450 and 1200 nm below 450 nm a small peak was also observed in the size range of 4 5 nm which is slightly different from domestic wastewater this may be explained by the use of high amount of oxidants and various chemicals and cleaning agents in the clinical laboratories of the hospital on the other hand cod concentration at the size range of 2 nm in hospital wastewater was found to be slightly lower than that of the domestic wastewater this may result from the oxidation of some easily biodegradable organics in wastewater due to the discharge of oxidants into hospital wastewater in general size distribution analyses revealed specific fingerprints for cod bod aox and colour in hospital wastewater the cod distribution pattern in hospital wastewater was similar to that of domestic wastewater and black water apart from slight differences in soluble sizes 450 nm although there was a significant difference between their cod concentrations the similarity of the cod fingerprints may be explained by the fact that a significant portion of these wastewaters is of fecal origin on the other hand significant differences were observed between the cod size distribution patterns of hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater unlike the textile and leather industry wastewaters revealing similar intermediate peaks of cod distributions neither hospital wastewater nor domestic wastewaters reveal significant intermediate peaks fig 5 therefore the size distribution of pollutants may be helpful not only for treatment purposes but also for a better understanding of the wastewater characterization 3 4 cod fractionation an experimental direct procedure was used for the assessment of the soluble inert cod sı and particulate inert cod xı by running two reactors one fed with raw the other with filtered hospital wastewater for about 45 days the difference between the total cod ct and the total residual cod ci covering the soluble and particulate inert cod fractions gives the total biodegradable cod cs for this purpose two reactors were run one fed with raw hospital wastewater and the other with hospital wastewater filtered using a 450 nm filter the reactors were continuously aerated for approximately 45 days to ensure the reduction of all biodegradable organics and mineralization of the biomass the total and soluble cod was measured in the reactors to evaluate the variations during the test and final threshold values of the total and soluble cod ct1 and st1 were recorded therefore at the end of the experiment the soluble cod in the reactor fed with filtered wastewater contains soluble microbial products and initially soluble inert cod on the other hand the total cod in the raw wastewater fed reactor contains particulate microbial products and initially particulate soluble cod in addition to soluble fractions of soluble microbial products and initially soluble inert cod total and soluble cod in the raw wastewater were 310 mg l and 120 mg l respectively all cod fractions detected in the hospital wastewater were in the range found in domestic wastewater as stated in the literature table 4 however a slightly higher value was revealed in the soluble cod percentage of hospital wastewater as compared to domestic wastewater the soluble inert cod concentration gives an idea about the removal efficiency that can be achieved by biological treatment therefore higher cod concentrations can be expected at the biological treatment effluent of hospital wastewater compared to domestic wastewaters with similar cod concentrations the high soluble inert cod concentration observed in hospital wastewater may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and cleaning agents in the clinical laboratories on the other hand compared to fresh black water the hospital wastewater revealed slightly lower biodegradable cod percentage in the total cod this also may be attributed to the use of various chemicals with inert properties furthermore some of easily biodegradable organics in hospital wastewater may be oxidized with the discharge of oxidants and as a result of the biodegradation the percentage of biodegradable organics may be reduced 4 conclusion in the light of the evaluations in the preceding sections the following conclusions can be stated as the final remarks of this study in this study the average daily water consumption per hospital was about 140 m3 while the 1st and 3rd quartiles were 25 m3 and 150 m3 respectively there are several factors affecting the water use of hospitals and it is difficult to estimate the contribution of each factor in this study a better relationship was found with the total number of people which may be used to estimate the total water consumption similarly the person equivalent approach in which the contribution of different user groups is normalized according to their residence time in hospital may also be helpful in estimating the total water consumption the average water consumption per pe was estimated to be about 120 l day varying from 25 to 870 l day the 1st and 3rd quartiles were about 100 l day and 150 l day respectively the results revealed that the share of hospital activities in total water consumption was quite low compared to domestic like uses and others on average about 97 6 of the total water consumption was used for domestic like needs and other purposes while the remaining 2 4 was consumed for hospital activities considering the distribution of water consumption by laboratory types the biochemistry laboratory used the highest amount of water 68 6 of the laboratories which was followed by the blood center and pathology laboratory size distribution analyses revealed specific fingerprints for cod bod colour and aox parameters of hospital wastewater in this study almost 20 of the aox in the hospital wastewater was found to be in the size range smaller than 1 kda which may be attributed to the aoi proportion resulting from iodinated x ray imaging process therefore urine separation from the toilets of x ray patients may contribute to the reduction of aox discharge load furthermore size distribution of pollutants can be an important index to evaluate the treatability of wastewater by biological physical and chemical processes according to the psd results it can be estimated that 75 80 of the total cod and 65 70 of the total aox can be removed by direct filtration process using a microfiltration membrane or an efficient chemical precipitation process furthermore removal of up to 85 90 of total cod and 75 80 of total aox and 65 70 of true colour and 65 70 of sac can be achieved by membrane filtration of an ultrafiltration membrane the average value of the colour parameter for hospital wastewater was significantly higher than that of domestic wastewater therefore the colour parameter may be used as an indicator of the discharge of hazardous dyes which should not be discharged to the sewer due to their hazardous characteristics and to monitor the effectiveness of pollution prevention at source for hospitals the cod fractionation experiments revealed that the soluble inert content of hospital wastewater is higher than that of domestic wastewater with a similar cod concentration which may indicate the removal efficiency that can be achieved by biological treatment compared to fresh black water hospital wastewater revealed a slightly lower biodegradable cod percentage in the total cod which may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and cleaning agents with inert properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13329,this study investigated detailed characterization of hospital wastewater size distribution of major organic pollutants and cod fractionation in order to estimate the amount of wastewater water consumption values and number of patients from 1156 hospitals were assessed statistically and hourly water consumption data of a middle size hospital were recorded significant differences were observed in the total water consumption of the hospitals even among the ones having similar bed capacities the average daily water consumption per hospital was about 140 m3 while the 1st and 3rd quartile were 25 m3 and 150 m3 respectively pollutant size distribution psd analysis provided specific fingerprints for cod bod colour and aox parameters of hospital wastewater size distribution analyses resulted that about 20 of the aox was in size range smaller than 1 kda which might be attributed to adsorbable iodinated compounds aoi generated in iodinated x ray process according to the psd results it can be estimated that up to 85 90 of the total cod and 75 80 of the total aox can be removed by direct filtration process using an ultrafiltration sized membrane cod fractionation experiments revealed that hospital wastewater has more soluble inert cod content than domestic wastewater with a similar cod concentration therefore slightly higher cod concentrations can be expected at the biological treatment effluent of hospital wastewater compared to domestic wastewaters with similar cod concentrations the difference may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and

sector requiring high amounts of water usage and are known for the variety and high rates of wastewater pollution amount and characteristics of wastewater generated by hospitals vary widely depending on the types of services provided by the facilities number of beds number of patients and availability of laboratories water usage in hospitals ranges largely from 200 to 1200 l bed 1 d 1 and commonly around 200 400 bed 1 d 1 1 2 and 5 10 l outpatient day and 100 l surgical procedure day 3 furthermore it is emphasized that there is no significant correlation between the number of patients and the amount of water used 2 hospital wastewater generated by various services laboratories surgery polyclinic laundry kitchen etc contains a wide range of macropollutants bod5 cod ss etc and micropollutants aox pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disruptors other drugs etc in various concentrations 2 4 5 as the main source of micropollutants in the environment many studies 6 10 point at the discharge of hospital wastewater due to the fact that micropollutant concentrations in hospital wastewater are much higher than those in municipal wastewater on the other hand hospital wastewater is considered to have similar pollutant characteristics with domestic wastewater in terms of conventional parameters therefore it is usually directly discharged into the sewer without any pretreatment in many countries if there is a line nearby 11 recently it is argued that municipal wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove micropollutants 12 17 and failure to remove them would allow the entry of a broad spectrum of compounds into the environment 18 causing harm to human health and ecosystem 9 10 18 22 hospitals that do not have a sewage line in the immediate vicinity need to treat their wastewater on site however detailed characterization of hospital wastewater which is required for both prevention of pollution at source and selection of the treatment technology is missing in the literature another risk of untreated hospital wastewater discharges directly into the receiving environment is the transmission of diseases especially in the presence of epidemic conditions such as sars cov 2 the half life of sars cov 2 in hospital wastewater is estimated to be between 4 8 and 7 2 h at 20 c 23 the virus is excreted with human urine and feces and mixes with other wastewater sources 24 sewer systems and hospital wastewaters may be a potential route of spread 25 therefore presence of pathogenic viruses and other pathogens needs to be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate treatment technology and disinfection method especially for hospital wastewaters among the major pollutants detected in hospital wastewater aox is one of the cumulative and hazardous pollutant parameters mostly generated by the x ray contrast media solvents disinfectants and sterilization chemicals etc and requires special attention aox has toxic effects on aquatic organisms it can accumulate in the food chain and cause persistent effects on the environment 26 aox is a measure of halogenated compounds trihalomethanes thms organic solvents such as trichloroethene tetrachloroethene and other halogenated alkanes and alkenes chlorinated and brominated pesticides and herbicides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs chlorinated aromatics such as hexachlorobenzene and 2 4 di chlorophenol and high molecular weight partially chlorinated aquatic humic substances 27 one of the main sources of aox in municipal wastewaters is thought to be hospital wastewater 28 despite the importance of treatment and management at source there is a very limited number of studies in the literature about the sources of aox discharges in various services of hospitals 29 jekel and wischnak 30 attributes high rates of aoi fraction in total aox observed in municipal wastewater to discharges from hospitals in the same study it is reported that most organic iodine x ray contrast media are in the range of 700 900 da size and 80 of the organic substances in the aoi falls under the low molecular fraction with a molar mass below 1 000 da accordingly the size distribution of the aox parameter may contribute to a better understanding of the sources of aox discharges in hospitals activated sludge systems and membrane bioreactors mbrs are the most common treatment technologies used for treating hospital wastewater 31 36 however various advanced treatment technologies such as membrane processes ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis 37 38 adsorption 39 and advanced oxidation processes 40 such as heterogeneous photocatalysis ozonation 41 fenton 42 photo fenton 43 electro fenton 44 47 and uv h202 48 49 have also been used for the removal of micropollutants in hospital wastewater in recent years the particle size distribution psd method has become an important tool for physical characterization of pollutant in wastewater size distribution of pollutants can be an important index to evaluate the treatability of wastewater by biological physical and chemical processes 50 psd gives an idea when estimating the performance of chemical settling process and is also very useful in the evaluation of the separation efficiency of the membrane systems 51 52 in addition the size of pollutants can affect the membrane fouling mechanisms in mbr systems 53 54 the sizes of the organic pollutants can significantly affect the biochemical degradation the small size organics can pass easily through the cell membranes of bacteria while the larger particles need to be hydrolysed before the uptake 51 55 psd has a significant potential in completing respirometric methods to better interpret cod fractionation in relation to biological degradation cod fractionation is also considered as an important tool for the selection of proper wastewater treatment technology 52 to the best of our knowledge there is no study in the literature on the size distribution of major organic pollutants and cod fractionation of hospital wastewater which may provide substantial information for the treatment efficiency with different technologies and also for management of pollutants at source in this context this study aims to investigate the detailed characterization of hospital wastewater to contribute to the selection of treatment methods and prevention of pollution at source in this scope the water consumption data of 1156 hospitals were evaluated statistically the wastewaters generated from three hospitals were monitored for one year the breakdown of water use for main hospital activities were assessed and the non biodegradable cod fractions of hospital wastewater were experimentally determined besides particle size distribution of major organic pollutants was assessed by the filtration method 2 material and method 2 1 water consumption in this study annual water usage data of 1156 hospitals in turkey with different sizes and bed capacities varying from 10 to 3500 were collected moreover data on the number of employees inpatients and outpatients including the number of days served were also recorded water consumption data were collected by conducting a survey through the ministry of environment and urbanization and provincial environment directorates patient statistics for the relevant period are the official data provided by the ministry of health the water consumption profile was evaluated based on person equivalent which was calculated according to 8 working hours in addition hourly water consumption in a full fledged and medium sized state run hospital was monitored for 10 weeks 2 5 weeks for each season and evaluated for a better understanding of the variation of water consumption in a day and from day to day in addition water consumption resulting from main hospital activities such as analyses sterilization and dialysis in laboratories was estimated using the water consumption of all these equipment and analyzers along with the test numbers this hospital which had a capacity of 201 beds an average of approximately 765 000 outpatients and 49 000 hospitalization days per year and various laboratories including biochemistry microbiology and pathology revealed an average water consumption of 44 000 m3 year 115 m3 day 2 2 analytical methods for wastewater characterization flow proportional composite samples were collected quarterly from the wastewaters of three hospitals at final discharge points into the public sewerage system for this purpose sampling equipment teledyne isco 6712 was installed in the manholes just before the points of discharge to the sewer wastewater samples were collected for 24 h and flow proportional composite wastewater samples were prepared by mixing the samples according to the water consumption in the respective period samples were analyzed immediately and stored at 4 c the ph parameter was measured by a ph meter hach hq40d multimeter the cod values of samples were determined using standard methods 5220d 27 adsorbable organic halogen aox and formaldehyde were determined using spectrophotometer cell test with merck prove 600 metal analyses were conducted with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry perkinelmer nexion 300xx icp ms other analytical measurements were conducted according to standard methods 27 the true colour was determined as ptco using the spectrophotometric single wavelength method as defined in standard methods 27 and also the absorbance values at wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm were measured according to the din en iso 7887 standard 56 the results were presented as spectral absorption coefficient sac according to the following equation 1 sac λ a d f sac λ sac value at wavelength λ m 1 a absorbance value of the sample at wavelength λ d cuvette size of spectrophotometer mm f factor to obtain spectral absorbance value in m 1 unit f 1000 as both colour measurement methods require the removal of particulate matter before analysis the colour measurements were conducted only on the permeates of 0 45 μm and smaller size filters all of the other analyses were carried out on all filtration ultrafiltration samples including raw wastewater and permeates of 1 2 μm filtration 2 3 cod fractionation cod fractionation involves the identification of inert and biodegradable cod together with readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable fractions total cod was measured according to the standard methods 5220 b open reflux method and the soluble cod was measured after filtration with a 0 45 μm filter non biodegradable cod fractions of hospital wastewater were experimentally determined according to the procedure proposed by orhon et al 57 for this purpose two reactors were run one fed with raw hospital wastewater and the other with hospital wastewater filtered using a 0 45 μm filter both reactors were seeded with a small amount of biomass taken from a laboratory scale mbr reactor treating hospital wastewater nutrient and buffer solutions were added to the reactor prior to testing to avoid nutrient limitation furthermore plenty of alkalinity was provided to both of the reactors the reactors were continuously aerated for approximately 45 days to ensure the reduction of all biodegradable organics and the mineralization of biomass final threshold values of the total and soluble cod ct and st were measured and the results were evaluated as defined in the procedure initially the reactor fed with raw wastewater consisted of biodegradable cod fraction and soluble and particulate inert cod fractions at the end of the experiment it was assumed that all biodegradable cod was biodegraded and the mineralization of biomass was completed therefore at the end of the experiment the soluble cod in the reactor fed with filtered wastewater consisted of only the soluble microbial products and the initially soluble inert cod the total cod in the reactor fed with raw wastewater comprised soluble and particulate microbial products and initially soluble and particulate inert cod by using mass balance calculations soluble and particulate inert cod fractions were estimated as follows initially the reactor fed with raw wastewater consists of total biodegradable cod soluble inert cod and particulate inert cod 2 c t0 c s0 s i x i at the end of the experiment upon the completion of biological activity assuming ss xs xh 0 the unfiltered effluent becomes the sum of soluble and particulate inert cod of wastewater and soluble and particulate microbial products 3 c t1 x i x p1 s i s p1 and the filtered effluent becomes the sum of soluble inert cod of wastewater and soluble microbial products 4 s t1 s p1 s i therefore if we rewrite the eq 1 by replacing total soluble cod in the effluent the eq becomes 5 c t1 s t1 x i x p1 the amount of total cod removed is 6 c t1 c t0 c t1 c s0 x p1 s p1 7 c t2 s t0 c t2 s s0 x p2 s p2 particulate inert cod concentration xi can be calculated using the amount of total cod removed in both of the reactors as follows 8 x i c t 1 s t 1 c t 2 s t 2 δ c t 1 δ c t 2 initial soluble inert cod concentration si can be calculated using soluble cod and generated soluble microbial products 9 s i s t 1 s p 1 2 4 particle size distribution filtration and ultrafiltration experiments determination of size distribution of pollutants in wastewater is an important parameter for the selection of suitable treatment specifically when making use of membrane integrated treatment technologies therefore batch filtration experiments were conducted to estimate the size distribution of pollutants in hospital wastewater smaller than 1 2 μm filtration tests were carried out using the sterlitech dead end filtration test system model tmhp4750 us with a total volume and membrane area of 300 ml and 14 6 cm2 respectively the room temperature was kept at about 20 c during the filtration tests inert n2 gas was used to provide positive pressure during the filtration the filtration pressure was set to lower values than those recommended by the manufacturer continuous mixing was applied to avoid concentration polarization on the membrane the procedure for determining the size distribution of pollutants by filtration method was well documented as stipulated in the study of hocaoglu and orhon 52 the samples were first filtered through a glass fiber filter with a nominal pore size of 1 2 mm millipore ap40 and filters with a pore size of 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm durapore pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride respectively then the filtered sample was sequentially passed through ultrafiltration membranes for ultrafiltration experiments series of chemically compatible cellulose membrane discs were used with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 100 30 10 5 3 and 1 kda millipore uf filters ultracel pl series usa the size of the pollutant that passes through the filter represents the cumulative value of all fractions below the pore size of the filter therefore the ratio of the parameter remaining in the size range between two consecutive filters can be calculated as the difference measured in the corresponding permeates to this end nominal mwco values expressed in kda were converted into size values in nm using the approach proposed by mcgregor 58 and karahan et al 55 3 results and discussion 3 1 water consumption in this study the annual water consumption data of 1156 hospitals with different service levels and services were statistically evaluated based on the number of patients per year the average daily water consumption per hospital was calculated to be approximately 140 m3 day with a variation range from 2 to 2650 m3 day the median value was approximately 60 m3 day while the 1st quartile was approximately 25 m3 day and the 3rd quartile was 150 m3 day significant differences were observed in the total water consumptions of the hospitals even among the ones having similar bed capacities only the size number of beds and or the number of patients were insufficient to determine a correlation and to estimate water consumption this is because other factors such as laboratory services number of operations presence of laundry and kitchen services and differences in water usage patterns of users inpatients outpatients employees etc affect the total consumption in this study a stronger relationship was revealed with total water consumption by taking into account the total number of people tnp which is the sum of the number of outpatients inpatients and employees compared to only a limited aspect the bed capacity or the numbers of inpatients outpatients or employees fig 1 also in order to establish a stronger correlation with the unit water consumption of hospitals the person equivalent pe approach was applied on the basis of 8 working hours and by this way the contributions of water usage by different groups were normalized according to their residence time in hospitals this method allowed a better relationship with unit water consumption especially in hospitals with a significant number of inpatients the water consumption profile of pe is followed by the log normal distribution fig 1b the average water consumption per pe was estimated to be about 120 l day varying from 25 to 870 l day the 1st quartile median and 3rd quartile values were approximately 100 l day 70 l day and 150 l day respectively however it was still possible to observe quite significant variations on the average unit water consumption value due to the uncertainty of the contributions of healthcare facility services such as the availability of medical laboratories operation rooms and the number of operations the presence of laundry and kitchen services and size of irrigated area etc in order to evaluate the change of water consumption in a day and from day to day water consumption of a hospital with 201 bed capacity was monitored on a two hour basis for a total of 10 weeks in four seasons the average daily water consumption of the hospital was 115 m3 day 1 with fluctuation ranges from 88 to 130 m3 day 1 during the study period fig 2a the difference was drastic over the weekend as expected the highest average flowrate was recorded on tuesday with a flowrate approximately 130 m3 day 1 while the lowest was recorded on sunday with 88 m3 day 1 overall about 77 of the hospital s total water consumption occurred on weekdays the average hourly water consumption of the hospital was approximately 4 9 m3 h 1 with variations ranging from 4 1 to 5 6 m3 h 1 fig 2b three small peaks were observed in a day morning hours 04 00 06 00 noon hours 12 00 14 00 and evening hours 20 00 22 00 the peak demands of the hospital might be due to the daily routine activities before during and after working hours the peak observed at noon may be explained with the extensive use by outpatients and employees and the lunchtime of inpatients while the peak observed at early morning and evening hours may be mainly attributed to the water use of inpatients and the cleaning works in general the daily water consumption values were in the range of literature values however differences were observed in hourly water consumption data while orengard et al 9 reported only one significant peak between 5 and 10 a m a more distributed profile was observed in this study with 3 small peaks the difference may be attributed to the patient visiting hours cleaning times working hours of employees etc water consumption in hospitals varies depending on many factors such as the capacity services provided by the hospital availability of laboratories etc in order to better understand the contribution of hospital activities to the water use consumptions resulting from main hospital activities and services such as laboratories sterilization and hemodialysis were estimated for this purpose water consumption of each analyzer and equipment was calculated along with the test numbers the breakdown of water uses in total water consumption including hospital activities and uses by laboratories are presented in fig 3 the results revealed that the share of hospital activities in total water consumption is considerably low compared to domestic type uses and other uses such as water consumption in toilets showers by patients and employees uses for food preparation washing laundry and cooling losses in water softening services etc on average about 97 6 of the total water consumed was used for domestic type needs and others while the rest 2 4 is consumed for hospital activities among the hospital activities consumption for hemodialysis accounts for the majority which is followed by the uses in laboratories and sterilization when we look at the breakdown of water consumption by laboratory types biochemistry laboratory uses the highest amount of water which is followed by blood center and pathology laboratory to sum up in this study the share of hospital activities and laboratories in total water consumption was found to be much lower than the literature values which were reported to be in a range of 15 35 for hospital activities and 10 20 for laboratories 59 60 the main reason for this difference may be attributed to the method applied for the estimation in this study the amount of water used in the laboratories only represents the amount of water used in the analysis consumption by analyzers and for device cleaning etc and does not include the personal consumption such as the use by technicians for hand washing toilet shower etc furthermore differences between hospitals parameters analyzed and types of equipment may also have an effect on the difference 3 2 wastewater characterization physicochemical characterization of hospital wastewater was made through monitoring on daily composite samples collected every three months in a year to have full coverage of seasonal variations the characteristics revealed in terms of major parameters like average concentrations minimums maximums and standard deviations are presented in table 1 along with the relevant hospital and domestic wastewater characterization data from the literature the average concentrations of cod bod5 tkn and nh4 n were 785 mg l 221 mg l 69 mg l and 41 mg l respectively and these results are consistent with the literature values for hospital wastewater whereas total phosphorus concentration was measured to range from 0 7 mg l to 15 5 mg l which is lower than the values reported for hospital wastewater this may be explained by the use of non phosphorus detergents in the hospitals sampled various toxic mutagenic or carcinogenic dyes such as eosin hematoxylin oil red o and sudan black are used in hospitals especially in pathology and microbiology laboratories the use of such dyes may contribute significantly to the increase of wastewater colour 43 61 in this study the average colour value for hospital wastewater was 98 ptco varying from 41 to 219 ptco which was significantly lower than reported values for hospital wastewater but much higher than that of domestic wastewater the lower concentration than the literature may be attributed to management at source which includes the collection of dyes as hazardous waste due to their toxic mutagenic and or carcinogenic properties in the hospitals sampled the colour parameter may be used as an indicator to detect the discharge of hazardous dyes by hospitals in this study aox concentration ranging from 3 2 to 32 mg l with an average of 8 3 mg l was found to be very high compared to the literature values for hospital wastewater as well as for domestic wastewater the high aox value observed in this study may be attributed to the intensive use of chlorinated disinfectants and detergents and or a high amount of iodinated contrast media discharge due to the extensive use of x ray one of the other important pollutants found in hospital wastewater is formaldehyde which is frequently used as a sterilant and for the protection of samples mainly in pathology laboratories although formaldehyde is biodegradable its direct discharge to the receiving environment has negative effects 62 and should be avoided at high concentrations in this study formaldehyde was found to be slightly higher with an average value of 0 4 mg l than the literature values the phenol concentration was lower than the literature values for hospital wastewater but slightly higher than that of domestic wastewater with an average value of 0 2 mg l regarding heavy metal concentrations copper and zinc values are consistent with the literature while the chromium and nickel concentrations were lower than the literature values reported for hospital wastewater 3 3 size distribution of pollutants determination of the size distribution of pollutants in wastewater is of great importance to estimate the removal efficiencies of pollutants by physical chemical and biological processes especially when incorporating wastewater treatment with membrane technologies however the typical conventional methods of characterization could only differentiate between soluble and particulate components in this study the size of organic pollutants which are important in terms of discharge standard were investigated at a wider range of sizes from 2 nm to 1200 nm by conducting sequential filtration experiments table 2 shows the cumulative fraction of pollutants with respect to different separation methods the total cod and bod measured were 480 mg l and 165 mg l respectively which remain within the concentration range for hospital wastewater table 3 shows the cod fractionation in of initial value for hospital wastewater at various particle size distributions psd and includes the literature values for domestic wastewater and black water for comparison other organic pollutant parameters such as bod aox and colour for hospital wastewater were also tabulated results revealed that the psd for bod and cod was compatible with domestic wastewater the concentration of aox and true colour were measured to be 3 mg l and 146 pt co respectively the differing bod profiles exhibited similar patterns closely matching the relevant cod profiles a significant proportion of both cod and bod with 47 and 48 respectively revealed a size range greater than 1200 nm over 80 of the bod contained in hospital wastewater was in particulate form 450 nm while the fraction 2 nm was 11 the second significant portion the distribution of bod in these ranges was well partitioned with small differences however slight differences were observed as compared to the cod distributions in domestic wastewater from 220 nm to 2 nm which may be explained with the difference in the biodegradability of organics in these ranges also the slight differences may be due to the lower sensitivity of the bod test compared to the cod test aox is a measure of organically bound halogens in a sample and it is a sum of several substances with different degradability some of those substances may also be persistent and tend to bioaccumulate in the environment and some are toxic to aquatic organisms even at low concentrations therefore understanding the type and source of aox may contribute to the decision of the appropriate management method the size distribution of aox may give an idea about the source and or type of the halogenated organics as can be seen in table 3 and fig 4 the psd of the aox parameter for hospital wastewater seems to have a specific fingerprint slightly different from the profiles of cod in general about 49 of the aox contained in hospital wastewater occurred in a range from 450 nm to 1200 nm while the largest portion was in the size of 1200 nm for cod overall about 68 3 of the aox contained in hospital wastewater was in the size of 220 nm the second significant portion in the aox parameter was the size range smaller than 2 nm 1 kda with 20 which was almost two times bigger than the cod portion the molecular weights of most organic iodine x ray contrast media fall in the range from 700 to 900 da 90 in this study the second largest peak was observed in the size range smaller than 1 kda 2 nm this may indicate that about 20 of the aox in the hospital wastewater was in the form of aoi originating mainly from iodinated x ray contrast media being consistent with the aoi proportion results in the literature 90 since iodinated x ray contrast media are not completely biodegradable 91 92 their removal is of great importance according to the characterization results of this study avg aox concentration of 8 3 mg l the total amount of aox discharged from a hospital of this size 201 bed capacity annually 765 000 outpatients and 49 000 days of hospitalization in total with an average daily wastewater flow rate of 115 m3 is estimated to be around 70 kg per year in mass based on the estimated ratio of aoi to the total aox revealed in psd of this study it may be concluded that separation of urine from the toilets used by x ray given patients at source could reduce the discharge of aox by approximately 20 kg per year the colour parameter is one of the collective and indicator parameters and may be important for hospitals due to the use of toxic mutagenic and or carcinogenic dyes in pathology and microbiology laboratories true colour measurements and absorbance readings at the wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm were performed only on the permeates of 450 nm and smaller size filters as defined in the standard methods the results revealed that the colour fraction followed bimodal patterns which concentrated mainly between 8 and 450 nm and below 3 nm similar bimodal patterns were also observed in the sac values of the all wavelengths measured the main true colour fractions were 44 and 42 for the size range of 8 450 nm and 3 nm respectively compared to black water 52 a significant difference was the size range smaller than 3 nm which was not available in the black water the difference may be explained with the post staining washes performed in pathology and microbiology laboratories in the hospital psd provides information to predict the performance of the chemical precipitation process and the separation efficiency of direct membrane filtration systems according to the psd results of this study it can be estimated that 75 80 of the total cod and 65 70 of the total aox can be removed as a result of an efficient chemical precipitation process or direct filtration with a microfiltration sized membrane furthermore removal of up to 85 90 of total cod and 75 80 of total aox and 65 70 of true colour and 65 70 of sac can be achieved with an ultrafiltration sized membrane separation process for comparison fig 5 shows the psd of different types of wastewaters including black water 52 tannery wastewater 55 domestic wastewater and textile wastewater 51 it should be noted that 47 of the cod in hospital wastewater was in particulate form size of 1200 nm while the particulate cod ratio was 65 in domestic wastewater and 61 4 in black water however unlike the domestic wastewater and black water a high amount of cod fraction between 450 and 1200 nm was observed in hospital wastewater this may be explained by the disintegration of some particulate cods due to the high concentration of oxidants in the hospital wastewater and the shift of the cod fraction between 450 and 1200 nm below 450 nm a small peak was also observed in the size range of 4 5 nm which is slightly different from domestic wastewater this may be explained by the use of high amount of oxidants and various chemicals and cleaning agents in the clinical laboratories of the hospital on the other hand cod concentration at the size range of 2 nm in hospital wastewater was found to be slightly lower than that of the domestic wastewater this may result from the oxidation of some easily biodegradable organics in wastewater due to the discharge of oxidants into hospital wastewater in general size distribution analyses revealed specific fingerprints for cod bod aox and colour in hospital wastewater the cod distribution pattern in hospital wastewater was similar to that of domestic wastewater and black water apart from slight differences in soluble sizes 450 nm although there was a significant difference between their cod concentrations the similarity of the cod fingerprints may be explained by the fact that a significant portion of these wastewaters is of fecal origin on the other hand significant differences were observed between the cod size distribution patterns of hospital wastewater and industrial wastewater unlike the textile and leather industry wastewaters revealing similar intermediate peaks of cod distributions neither hospital wastewater nor domestic wastewaters reveal significant intermediate peaks fig 5 therefore the size distribution of pollutants may be helpful not only for treatment purposes but also for a better understanding of the wastewater characterization 3 4 cod fractionation an experimental direct procedure was used for the assessment of the soluble inert cod sı and particulate inert cod xı by running two reactors one fed with raw the other with filtered hospital wastewater for about 45 days the difference between the total cod ct and the total residual cod ci covering the soluble and particulate inert cod fractions gives the total biodegradable cod cs for this purpose two reactors were run one fed with raw hospital wastewater and the other with hospital wastewater filtered using a 450 nm filter the reactors were continuously aerated for approximately 45 days to ensure the reduction of all biodegradable organics and mineralization of the biomass the total and soluble cod was measured in the reactors to evaluate the variations during the test and final threshold values of the total and soluble cod ct1 and st1 were recorded therefore at the end of the experiment the soluble cod in the reactor fed with filtered wastewater contains soluble microbial products and initially soluble inert cod on the other hand the total cod in the raw wastewater fed reactor contains particulate microbial products and initially particulate soluble cod in addition to soluble fractions of soluble microbial products and initially soluble inert cod total and soluble cod in the raw wastewater were 310 mg l and 120 mg l respectively all cod fractions detected in the hospital wastewater were in the range found in domestic wastewater as stated in the literature table 4 however a slightly higher value was revealed in the soluble cod percentage of hospital wastewater as compared to domestic wastewater the soluble inert cod concentration gives an idea about the removal efficiency that can be achieved by biological treatment therefore higher cod concentrations can be expected at the biological treatment effluent of hospital wastewater compared to domestic wastewaters with similar cod concentrations the high soluble inert cod concentration observed in hospital wastewater may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and cleaning agents in the clinical laboratories on the other hand compared to fresh black water the hospital wastewater revealed slightly lower biodegradable cod percentage in the total cod this also may be attributed to the use of various chemicals with inert properties furthermore some of easily biodegradable organics in hospital wastewater may be oxidized with the discharge of oxidants and as a result of the biodegradation the percentage of biodegradable organics may be reduced 4 conclusion in the light of the evaluations in the preceding sections the following conclusions can be stated as the final remarks of this study in this study the average daily water consumption per hospital was about 140 m3 while the 1st and 3rd quartiles were 25 m3 and 150 m3 respectively there are several factors affecting the water use of hospitals and it is difficult to estimate the contribution of each factor in this study a better relationship was found with the total number of people which may be used to estimate the total water consumption similarly the person equivalent approach in which the contribution of different user groups is normalized according to their residence time in hospital may also be helpful in estimating the total water consumption the average water consumption per pe was estimated to be about 120 l day varying from 25 to 870 l day the 1st and 3rd quartiles were about 100 l day and 150 l day respectively the results revealed that the share of hospital activities in total water consumption was quite low compared to domestic like uses and others on average about 97 6 of the total water consumption was used for domestic like needs and other purposes while the remaining 2 4 was consumed for hospital activities considering the distribution of water consumption by laboratory types the biochemistry laboratory used the highest amount of water 68 6 of the laboratories which was followed by the blood center and pathology laboratory size distribution analyses revealed specific fingerprints for cod bod colour and aox parameters of hospital wastewater in this study almost 20 of the aox in the hospital wastewater was found to be in the size range smaller than 1 kda which may be attributed to the aoi proportion resulting from iodinated x ray imaging process therefore urine separation from the toilets of x ray patients may contribute to the reduction of aox discharge load furthermore size distribution of pollutants can be an important index to evaluate the treatability of wastewater by biological physical and chemical processes according to the psd results it can be estimated that 75 80 of the total cod and 65 70 of the total aox can be removed by direct filtration process using a microfiltration membrane or an efficient chemical precipitation process furthermore removal of up to 85 90 of total cod and 75 80 of total aox and 65 70 of true colour and 65 70 of sac can be achieved by membrane filtration of an ultrafiltration membrane the average value of the colour parameter for hospital wastewater was significantly higher than that of domestic wastewater therefore the colour parameter may be used as an indicator of the discharge of hazardous dyes which should not be discharged to the sewer due to their hazardous characteristics and to monitor the effectiveness of pollution prevention at source for hospitals the cod fractionation experiments revealed that the soluble inert content of hospital wastewater is higher than that of domestic wastewater with a similar cod concentration which may indicate the removal efficiency that can be achieved by biological treatment compared to fresh black water hospital wastewater revealed a slightly lower biodegradable cod percentage in the total cod which may be attributed to the use of various chemicals and cleaning agents with inert properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
