22610,we present the modeling and dynamic analysis of a mobile underwater turbine system a novel integration of autonomous underwater vehicles and hydrokinetic turbines for harvesting marine hydrokinetic energy from the gulf stream the gulf stream an ocean current that flows off the coast of north carolina is a source of hydrokinetic energy however the meandering nature of the gulf stream makes it challenging to harvest the full energy potential of the stream using fixed turbine systems one possible solution for increasing the amount of energy that can be extracted from the gulf stream involves using a mobile underwater energy harvester system that can follow the meandering stream so as to remain in regions of maximum energy potential the framework for the conceptual design and studies focusing on the feasibility of such a system have been presented previously in divi 2017 the focus of this paper is a mathematical model of the system which has been developed to analyze the dynamics of such a system along with parametric studies utilizing this model to come up with a system with an optimized set of design parameters a 6 dof analytical model of the system is developed to gain an understanding of the system s dynamic behavior and stability a bead based tether model is further developed to analyze the behavior of the system when it is anchored and harvesting energy a study regarding the effects of tether parameters such as the number of tether elements the spring constant and the damping coefficient of the tether on the tether behavior and computation time required for analysis is put forth to help determine an optimal set of tether parameters in addition a set of system parameters such as turbine diameter hull diameter l d ratio of the hull and ballast tank size are analyzed to see how they affect the net energy produced and the maximum distance travelled by the system finally three modes of power transfer to the shore are considered and an optimization algorithm is presented and used to find the best set of parameters suited for maximum energy transfer for each mode keywords relocatable energy harvester autonomous underwater vehicle renewable energy hydrokinetic energy ocean current energy tether modeling 1 introduction the importance of fossil fuels as a source of energy in human development is undisputed however their finite supply and impact on the environment has led to a surge in the usage and development of renewable energy sources renewable sources are the world s fastest growing energy source u s energy information administration 2016 with 50 of us population living within 50 miles of the coast d o e office of energy efficiency and renewable energy 2016 hydrokinetic energy is a vital form of renewable energy hydrokinetic energy refers to harnessing energy from flowing water bodies such as ocean currents river currents tides etc one such hydrokinetic energy source is the gulf stream an ocean current that originates in the gulf of mexico and flows off the eastern coast of us it comes close to the coastline within 50 km at two locations near fort lauderdale and near cape hatteras off the coast of north carolina which makes them prime spots for harvesting energy due to their relatively close proximity to the mainland haas et al 2017 it has been estimated that the gulf stream has the potential to deliver an annual average of 500 1000 w m2 bane et al 2017a even though the power potential of the gulf stream has been known for a long time it has not yet been effectively exploited the primary reason for this is that the maximum stream velocities are available in a very narrow region within the stream and decrease both laterally and with depth see fig 1 schematic showing cross section of gulf stream bane et al 2017b moreover the stream follows a meandering path see fig 2 and moves laterally over time the wavelike meandering path of the stream which can measure up to a few hundred kms may take 3 21 days to pass any fixed location along the stream and the lateral meandering of the stream shifts the stream laterally by as much as a 100 km and can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months this means that at a particular location within the stream the power fluctuates significantly as can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 all the existing ocean tidal current energy harvesting designs in the world are based on turbine systems fixed at a particular location wu et al 2018 shirasawa 2016 fairley 2009 lago et al 2010 however fluctuation in stream location makes installing a permanent turbine system an inefficient option although vertical turbine systems are capable of handling omni directional flow of water they cannot handle lateral shifting of water divi 2017 shows that the energy harvested from a movable turbine system in the gulf stream can be as much as double that harvested from a fixed turbine system hence the solution to this problem lies in developing a novel design which utilizes a relocatable energy harvester which can extract energy from the gulf stream in an efficient manner such a device can be created by integrating autonomous underwater vehicles auv with hydrokinetic turbines for brevity the term auv harvester shall be used to denote the mobile underwater turbine system for the rest of this paper a detailed discussion pertaining to the conceptual design of the auv harvester and its subsystems can be found in divi 2017 and tandon 2017 and parametric design studies various modes of operation and feasibility studies for an auv harvester can be found in divi 2017 the system design was broken down into two major components turbines for power generation and a hull design for providing safe housing for smaller components such as batteries ballast tank motors for propellers and electronics subsystems a submarine shaped hull was chosen for the harvester since it is hydrodynamic in shape and has a proven ability to withstand high hydrostatic pressures when designing a buoyant system the position of center of mass cm and center of buoyancy defined as the geometric center of the fluid displaced by the submerged body denoted by cb play a key role in the system s passive stability i e the tendency of a body to return to its original state following any disturbance for achieving passive stability the cm must lie directly beneath the cb along the earth s gravity vector passing through the cb this results in restoring torques acting on the system under any disturbance until the body finally reaches a stable position in which the cm lies below the cb to ensure the system has passive stability the auv harvester s hull is designed to have the bulk of its weight in the bottom half see fig 5 since the position of the cm of the system will vary depending on the amount of water in the ballast tank this may lead to situations where the cm of the overall system rises above the cb especially when the ballast tank is partially filled and the system is in tilted position to avoid this the ballast tank can be compartmentalized to restrict the movement of water in the ballast tank finally the turbines are placed such that their cm s lie in the same plane as the cm and the cb of the hull see fig 6 2 analytical model a dynamic model is needed to understand the stability characteristics and dynamic behavior of the proposed system under different environmental conditions to which the system will be exposed the dynamic model is developed and presented below 2 1 frames of reference formulating the dynamic model for any system starts with defining frames of reference and a set of variables which specify the configuration of the system two frames of references are involved in modeling the auv harvester see fig 7 the reference frame o i o j o k o also referred to as the o frame will be used as an inertial reference frame irf for our analysis and is described as follows the o frame is fixed with respect to the earth with its origin point o taken as an arbitrary fixed underwater point axis i o is parallel to the longitude lines pointing towards the north axis j o is parallel to the latitude lines pointing towards the east and axis k o points towards the center of the earth reference frame b i b j b k b also referred to as the b frame is a body frame of reference that is fixed to the body of the auv harvester with its origin b located at the center of buoyancy cb of the harvester it is a common practice to choose cb as the origin of the body reference frame since the cb of a fully submerged system stays fixed whereas the center of mass cm moves as the amount of water inside the ballast tank is varied axis i b points to the front of the vehicle j b points towards the right hand starboard side of the vehicle and k b is defined by the right hand rule 2 2 kinematic equations the complete state of any rigid body can be defined by six variables three components describing the position in space of a particular point in the body along with three euler angles which describe the orientation in space of a body frame e g the b frame described above with respect to an inertial reference frame when deriving equations of motion for our system we find it convenient to introduce six additional variables namely the components of the inertial velocity of the origin of the b frame and the components of the angular velocity of the b frame with respect to the inertial reference frame the o frame these twelve variables are then used to generate twelve equations of motion which together describe the dynamics of the rigid body the kinematic relations between these variables are described in detail below components of the position vector of cb with respect to point o expressed in the irf were chosen as the first three variables see figure 8 as indicated in eq 1 the distance between cm and cb for the vehicle is denoted by z b and z b is measured along k b as indicated in eq 2 1 r b o o x y z 2 r c m b b 0 0 z b a 3 2 1 euler angle rotation sequence is used for the transformation from the o frame to the b frame and the euler angles φ θ ψ form the next three variables where φ represents rotation about the x axis θ represents rotation about the y axis and ψ represents rotation about the z axis of the frame eq 3 4 show the matrix required to transform vectors from the irf to the body frame and vice versa s and c stand for sine and cosine respectively with the subscripts indicating the angles of which the sine and cosine are taken 3 c b o r ϕ x r θ y r ψ z 4 c o

of the cb of the auv harvester with respect to the irf as expressed in the b frame see eq 5 eq 6 describes the transformation of the components of the velocity of the cb from the b frame to the o frame the velocity of cb expressed in the o frame can also be expressed as the rate of change of its position vector as defined in eq 1 substituting this definition in eq 6 defines the relationship between x y and z and u v and w which forms the first set of kinematic relations eq 7 5 v b o o b u v w 6 v b o o o c o b v o b o b 7 x y z c θ c ψ s θ c ψ s ϕ s ψ c ϕ s θ c ψ c ϕ s ψ s ϕ c θ s ψ s θ

of the angular velocity components the relationship between the angular velocity components and euler angles can be expressed via eq 9 see section 3 2 of tandon 2017 for additional details 8 ω b o b p

acting on the body to its linear acceleration using the transport theorem to obtain the relation for acceleration of the cm with respect to o eq 11 and substituting it into eq 10 components of external forces can be expressed as a function of the variables u v w p q r and their time derivatives eq 12 10 f e x t m s y s a c m o o 11 a c m o o d d t b v b o o ω b o v b o o α b o r c m b ω b o

newton euler approach to describe the rotational dynamics of a rigid body i e eq 13 and eq 14 applying eq 13 in eq 14 and applying the transport theorem gives eq 15 eq 15 provides the relationship between the sum of the external torques about point b see eq 16 and the variables u v w p q and r eq 15 expressed in component form provides eq 17 19 which completes the set of twelve equations needed to study to the evolution of the variables u v w p q and r over time note more details on these derivations can be found in tandon 2017 13 o o h b s y s m s y s r c m b v b o o i b ω b o 14 σ τ b e x

behavior of a system is governed by the external forces and moments acting on it the source of the external forces and moments acting on the auv are discussed below 2 3 2 hydrostatic forces these are the forces applied to the body in a static fluid environment they are comprised of the buoyancy force and the gravitational force acting on the body 2 3 3 hydrodynamic forces these are the forces applied on the body due to its interaction with the surrounding fluid during relative motion estimation of this interaction requires knowledge of the precise shape of the body and the flow regime surrounding it these forces are further divided into the following categories skin friction the resistance offered by the fluid due to relative motion of a body moving through it is called skin friction drag prandtl and von karman models as presented by hoerner 1965 provide empirical relations for calculating the local drag coefficients the total drag force can be calculated by integrating the local forces over the entire wetted surface for the system pressure drag motion of a solid body through a fluid leads to increase in fluid pressure in the forward end of the body and decrease in pressure towards the aft end of the body this pressure difference leads to a resistive force called the pressure drag this force was calculated by assuming ellipsoidal and cylindrical shapes for the hull and turbines respectively and using standard drag coefficients for these shapes cross flow drag this is similar to the pressure drag except it acts when the body moves laterally i e normal to the longitudinal axis of the hull this force becomes dominant during turning maneuvers added mass effect as a submerged body moves through a fluid it needs to move the fluid mass surrounding it hence additional energy is needed to move this mass of fluid this energy becomes significant when the mass of the fluid is comparable to the mass of the body in motion traditionally this phenomenon is accounted in dynamic modeling by increasing the apparent mass of the moving body and is called the added mass effect most researchers represent this force with a coefficient based model fossen 2011 humphreys and watkinson 1978 newman and landweber 1978 tracey and watts 1986 numerous methods have been used to estimate these hydrodynamic coefficients such as experimental determination using cdf software or using empirical formulae for standard shapes of revolution due to its simplicity we used the empirical relation method to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficient of the system by assuming the hull and turbines to be ellipsoidal and cylindrically shaped of equivalent volume respectively added mass effects of the entire system were assumed to be the summation of the added mass effects of the system s individual elements 2 3 4 forces from propeller and control surfaces the combined forces from the propeller and the control surfaces control the trajectory of the system these forces become extremely important while developing the controller for the system however developing controllers is not within the scope of this paper so very simple models will be used to represent the forces from the propeller and control surfaces for the dynamic stability studies presented in this paper 2 4 simulation solving for the twelve equations of motions derived earlier gives us the evolution of the state variables over time under different scenarios three basic scenarios were considered for simulation 1 constant forward thrust acting on an auv harvester moving against varying water currents and in a neutrally buoyant condition 2 passive stability of the system roll and pitch stability and 3 forward thrust with varying buoyancy table 1 shows the system parameters used in the simulations fig 9 shows the time evolution of the translational and rotational velocities for scenario 1 with water velocity kept as zero the axial velocity u of the auv harvester increases initially due to thrust action until it reaches a terminal velocity when the drag forces balance out the force due to propeller thrust the angular velocity components remain stable throughout the simulation period now the water velocity was gradually increased and its effect on the axial velocity of the system is shown in fig 10 as expected the terminal velocity decreases with increasing water velocity due to higher drag forces acting on the body as discussed earlier having the cm below the cb makes the system passively stable this is demonstrated in fig 11 and fig 12 where the system is given an initial rotation of 1 5 radians in roll and pitch angles independently and the behavior of the euler angles is observed scenario 2 in both cases the auv harvester exhibits a damped oscillation before setting into a stable position we note here that the auv harvester oscillates with a higher frequency for the pitch stability case the reason for this higher frequency is the fact that the principal moment of inertia around the i b axis is larger than that around the j b axis due to the length of the auv harvester being much larger than the distance between the hull and the turbines and this lower moment of inertia along the j b axis leads to faster oscillations for the pitching case fig 13 demonstrates scenario 3 where the path traced out by the auv harvester is plotted when the system s buoyancy is varied and a constant forward thrust is input to the system this scenario is presented here to provide a qualitative validation that the system behaves as expected when the thrust and buoyancy are varied 2 5 tether modeling to simulate the behavior of the system when it is tethered to the ocean floor a tether model is developed fig 14 shows a 2 d schematic of the bead model used for the tether modeling this is a similar model to the one used in yoder 2016 the model divides the entire tether into n equal segments and n 1 nodes which are called beads hence the term bead model the first node is placed at the location at the bottom of the auv harvester where the tether is connected this point is fixed with respect to the b frame i e it moves with the harvester the last node i e the n 1 node is chosen to be the point where the tether is anchored to the seabed this point remains fixed with respect to the inertial reference frame any two nodes of the tether are assumed to be connected by an extensible cylindrical tether which can be modelled as a mass spring damper system with the mass of the segment divided equally between the two nodes it connects based on this set up the free body diagram for each node is developed and is shown in fig 15 the physical properties of the tether are assumed based on commercial tethers available in the market which can withstand the required tension forces the mass is calculated by assuming equal distribution of tether mass in each tether segment buoyancy force for each segment is estimated by calculating the volume of each segment to calculate the lift and drag coefficients hoerner s hoerner 1965 method of estimating coefficients for an obliquely placed cylinder is used the tension force in each tether segment is the sum of the forces due to the spring and the damper they are calculated based on the position and velocities of each node the spring force is calculated using the difference between the un stretched length l i and the stretched length d i see eq 22 the stretched length d i is calculated using coordinate positions of neighboring nodes eq 22 while the unstretched length is known in advance by dividing the total unstretched tether length into n equal segments the damping force is calculated using the rate of change of the segment length which can be obtained by differentiating eq 20 with respect to time which gives us eq 21 it is to be noted that the flexible tether considered for this case provides force only in tension and this should be reflected in the model as well this is taken care of by forcing the change in length as well as the rate of change in length of the tether segment to zero if the current length of a segment becomes less than its un stretched length for any given step in the numerical integration process multiplying the net tension force with the appropriate direction cosines e i x e i y and e i z see eq 23 give us the components of the tension force in each direction 20 d i x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 21 d i x i x i 1 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 y i y i 1 z i z i 1 z i z i 1 x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 22 i f d i l i

state space formulation was derived note that the coordinates of the first and last tether nodes are not state variables since they depend on the location of the connection points of the tether to the auv and seabed respectively 2 6 tether parameter sweep for the model to represent accurate dynamic behavior of the actual system good estimations of the tether parameters are needed physical properties like weight length and diameter can be obtained from the technical specification sheets for standard anchors available in the market other parameters are estimated based on parametric sweeps the following parameters control the behavior of the tethers number of tether elements the bead model as described above divides the tether into n segments to gain an insight into what the value of n should be simulations were run by varying the value of n and comparing the steady state node locations of the tether and the final positions of the auv the computation time needed to reach the steady state were also observed see fig 16 and fig 17 note that while the qualitative profile of the tether does not change much while increasing the tether segments there is a difference in the steady state position of the auv see fig 16 furthermore the biggest difference in steady state auv position is seen when increasing the tether segment from 1 to 5 to see the same difference when further increasing the number of segments the number of segments had to be increased to 50 the final position of the auv is important since the water flow decreases gradually with increase in depth which will directly affect the calculated power generation although the final position of auv does vary when increasing the tether segments beyond 5 the computation time needed to reach the steady state increases exponentially see fig 17 to seek the benefits of a low computation time without significantly compromising the accuracy of the dynamic analysis 10 segments were chosen for all further analyses presented in this paper the calculated depth of the tethered auv changed by less than 10 when increasing the number of segments from 10 to 50 see fig 16 effect of tether stiffness the tether stiffness can be calculated directly using the young s modulus of the tether material k e a l which is a readily available physical property however a parametric sweep was done to understand the effects of varying the tether spring constant on both tether node locations and computation time fig 18 shows that as k is increased beyond 102 n m there is not much qualitative difference in the node locations of the tether over a range of simulation times also as k is increased beyond 102 n m the mean percent extension of the tether stays below 1 see fig 19 and is in fact close to zero for k greater than or equal to 103 n m on the other hand from fig 19 we also see that the computation time needed to reach steady state follows the exact opposite trend compared to the mean tether extension hence if the actual stiffness of the tether is calculated as being greater than 103 n m we can use a value of 103 n m with minimal effect on accuracy with the advantage of only requiring a reasonable amount of computation time as opposed to using higher stiffness values effect of tether damping coefficient the need for parametrically studying the tether damping coefficient arose from the fact that its value is extremely difficult to calculate from physical properties of the material unlike the spring constant which can be calculated based on the young s modulus of the material surprisingly our results show that the qualitative steady state node locations of the tether remain unchanged for the entire range of values chosen for the tether damping coefficients see fig 20 and in particular the system reaches steady state even when the damping coefficient is kept at 0 n m this is because there are other external damping forces present in the form of skin friction pressure drag etc although the tether node locations remains unchanged the computation time needed to reach steady state increases significantly when the tether damping coefficient value is increased beyond a certain value this is because the tether damping coefficient affects the transient state of the system and thus affects the time needed for the system to reach steady state it is observed that the computation time decreases as the tether damping coefficient is increased from 0 n m to 102 n m but it increases thereafter see fig 21 this can be best understood by taking a simply analogy of a spring mass damper system which takes the least time to reach steady state when the damping coefficient is set to the critical damping coefficient value as the shortest computation time is needed for a tether damping coefficient value of 102 n m this is an approximate value as we only tested eight different damping coefficients this value was chosen for our tethered auv dynamics analyses 3 design parameter sweep an auv capable of harvesting energy from the gulf stream has to excel in multiple tasks to be a feasible design it will need to remain anchored safely in a favorable location and harvest the maximum possible energy from that location it will need to periodically relocate when a more favorable location becomes available and will need to expend minimal energy in doing so finally it will need to be able to transfer the harvested energy to the mainland with minimal energy expenditures with these three tasks in mind key design parameters are identified and their effect on system performance is studied the design parameters identified for the auv are 3 1 turbine diameter the turbine is the keystone of the entire system as its size and design directly affect the primary functionality of the system i e its power generation potential common sense dictates that a bigger diameter turbine should be used since it will generate more energy however it must be noted that the turbine is a negatively buoyant system which means that it requires the ballast tanks in the hull to keep it afloat a bigger and hence heavier turbine needs a bigger ballast tank which in turn reduces the space available for on board energy storage as seen in fig 22 a reduced on board energy storage system increases the frequency of trips needed for the system to offload its energy on shore furthermore a bigger turbine generates a higher drag which in turn will reduce the distance which the system can travel in search of places with better energy generation potential analysis was done to find the maximum distance that a system can travel in three different water flow conditions no flow cross flow and against the flow assuming that the auv starts its journey with its batteries fully charged as expected the distance travelled by the system decreases with increase in turbine diameter see fig 23 and fig 24 for all the flow conditions the increased system drag leads to another problem the increased drag results in the system being pushed downstream more by the water and pulled down by the tether more when compared to a smaller system as shown in fig 25 this reduces the power generation potential of the system as the stream velocity is maximum at the surface and decreases with depth 3 2 hull diameter the hull is another key component of the auv harvester as it affects the space available and hence the capacity of the on board energy storage the maximum size of the turbine that can be kept afloat and the net drag generated by the system the diameter keeping the l d ratio same was varied to study its effects on all these factors the volume of the hull is directly proportional to the cube of its diameter hence a bigger diameter hull allows for more energy to be stored on board see fig 22 and also allows for a bigger ballast tank to be installed see fig 28 the increase in hull diameter also increases the drag forces but this increase is proportional to the square of hull diameter also the net drag forces experienced by the system are dominated mostly by the turbine diameter see fig 27 since the hull is more hydrodynamic in shape and also the diameter range considered for the hull is smaller than the range considered for the turbine the final effect is seen in fig 28 which shows that the buoyancy increases significantly more than drag forces with an increase in hull diameter the results of this effect can be seen in fig 26 where a higher buoyant force in a bigger diameter hull keeps the system in a more upright position compared to a smaller diameter hull even though a bigger hull is facing higher drag force a similar explanation can be given for the effect of hull diameter on distance travelled by the system in different water flow conditions see figs 23 and 24 3 3 l d ratio of the hull l d ratio of the hull is another parameter that directly affects hull shape keeping the diameter of the hull fixed increasing the l d ratio increases both the length and volume of the hull this leads to a linear increase in buoyancy see fig 29 and skin friction see fig 30 and fig 31 however as explained above the net drag force acting on the system is dominated mostly by the turbines due to their blunt shape and bigger sizes but the buoyancy force is controlled mostly by the hull diameter hence the increase in hull diameter increases the buoyancy force more than the increase in drag forces which can be seen from the positive slope of the plot for buoyancy force drag force see fig 32 thus a lower l d ratio results in the auv being pushed downstream more when compared to a higher l d ration hull see fig 33 another effect of an increase in l d ratio is that the amount of battery storage capacity increases similar to the increase in buoyancy force this increase is proportional to the cube of l d ratio this increased battery storage capacity leads to the increase in the maximum range that can be travelled by the system see fig 34 and fig 35 in all types of flow conditions 3 4 ballast tank size ideally a submerged system should be positively buoyant when the ballast tank is completely empty and negatively buoyant when it is completely filled that is it should rise to the surface when the ballast tank is completely empty and it should sink when the ballast tank is completely filled the net vertical force acting on the system during these two conditions depends on the size and design of the ballast tank based on this two parameters are defined as follows m a r g i n e m p t y is defined as the ratio of auv weight to that of the buoyancy force when the ballast space is empty similarly m a r g i n f u l l is defined as the ratio of auv weight to that of the buoyancy force when the ballast space is full see eq 25 below marginempty system weight when ballast is completely empty buoyancy force 25 marginfull system weight when ballast is completely full buoyancy force note that buoyancy force remains constant for a fully submerged system and is independent of the size of the ballast tank however it directly affects the weight of the system depending on its water holding capacity for a given hull volume the ballast tank size also affects the capacity of on board energy storage fig 36 and fig 37 show the battery capacity for different buoyancy margins the battery capacity is maximum when both the margins are closer to unity when both the margins are closer to unity it means that the weight of the system does not vary much when the ballast tank is empty as compared to when it completely filled this indicates the presence of a small ballast tank which allows for maximum space for batteries as the margins move away from unity the size of ballast tanks increase and the space available for batteries is reduced quickly to zero since the buoyancy margins control the vertical forces acting on the system they also control the vertical position of the system when it is anchored as m a r g i n e m p t y moves away from unity the amount of vertical force acting on the system increases and as a result the system is able to maintain a higher position under the surface of the water see fig 38 all the parameters discussed above affect the system performance in their own way combinations of all the above parameters lead to a large number of possible design cases in fact there are an infinite number of possibilities if a continuous design space is considered for the l d ratio hull diameter and buoyancy margins an optimization algorithm is thus needed to search for optimal design cases amongst all possible cases that satisfy all the desired requirements for the system using an optimization algorithm not only reduces the tedious task of comparing each design case it also makes the design process more flexible the same algorithm can also be used to find optimized designs for different operating conditions 3 5 optimization algorithm the design space at hand has four design parameters hence it is difficult to visualize the design space and perform qualitative analyses it is difficult to determine for example if the design has local minima therefore we have chosen to implement a stochastic algorithm for this problem another advantage of using a stochastic algorithm is that it can find multiple optimal points the objective function used for the optimization along with the constraint equations are listed in eq 26 and eq 27 below minimize 26 f o b j power produced max power production possible λ i max 0 g i 2 reward term image 1 the overall objective of the auv harvester design is to maximize the net power transferred from the point of generation to the shore while being within the physical design constraints discussed below based on this idea the optimization problem is set up see eq 26 eq 27 each term in the problem has been normalized to manage their weight in the objective function and to allow the optimization algorithm to be equally sensitive towards variation in all the variables traditionally optimization problems are handled as minimization problems to align with this the objective function was formulated such that minimization of the objective function helps us meet our overall objective the first term of the objective function is taken as the negative of net power produced by the system normalized the second term is a penalty term which acts to keep the design variables within the constraints represented by the equation eq 27 this term attains its minimum value of zero only if all the constraints satisfy their limits the value of λ determines the speed of convergence towards an acceptable design space higher values of λ will force the design variable to be within a viable design space at a faster rate the value of λ is determined through trial and error the last term is a reward term the reward term can be modified as per the mode of power transferred considered for the problem this is explained in detail later each constraint in eq 27 represents a physical limitation on the design variable considered in the problem the first limitation g 1 g 6 is the diameter of turbine considered a range of 0 5 2 m was chosen based on the availability of existing underwater turbines the second limitation g 2 g 7 is the hull diameter which was again chosen based on the availability of existing auv submarines the third limitation was the l d ratio range g 3 g 8 which was chosen to be within 2 units of what is considered an ideal l d ratio for submarine shaped hulls the last constraint g 5 describes the requirement for the auv to have enough energy capacity on board to travel the breadth of the gulf stream in search of better energy harvesting locations the problem set up was run for three different modes of power transfer case i using permanent cables to transfer energy to the mainland case ii using a ship to collect the energy from each auv and collectively transport the energy to the mainland case iii using the auv harvesters themselves to transport the energy to the mainland additional details on the aforementioned cases can be found in divi 2017 for each case 200 independent runs of the algorithm were executed to ensure that the algorithm did not get stuck in local minima 3 5 1 optimization results permanent cable case case i most of the 200 independent runs yielded similar values of the objective function thus providing some certainty that the particular value of the objective function is not a local minimum note that even though the value of objective function was similar the design parameter combinations which yielded those values were different one parameter remains constant in all of the optimization results turbine diameter and the algorithm drives the turbine diameter to its maximum value of 5 m this makes sense because a higher turbine size increases the power output although higher turbine size increases the overall drag the given constraints can be met by adjusting other parameters to differentiate between the different optimal design parameters all the design combinations were segregated based on the mass of the system they resulted in it was assumed that the lighter system would lead to less material and fabrication cost fig 39 shows the 3d scatter plot showing the design parameters in different mass ranges figs 40 42 show the 2d scatter sub plots extracted from the 3d scatter plot note that the blue dots represent the least mass scenarios based on the mass criteria discussed above the best design scenarios are summarized in table 2 these cases were obtained by rounding off the physical dimensions such as turbine diameter hull diameter and l d ratio to one decimal point accuracy and rounding the buoyancy margin to two decimal point accuracy this led to five distinct design scenarios ship case case 2 for the ship case the cost function is modified and is set to the negative of the net energy transferred by the system in a week s time divided by 105 to obtain the objective function values note that for this particular optimization the algorithm failed to find best function values for some of the runs and only those scenarios are considered whose best objective function value lies within 5 of the best value just like the previous case case 1 the permanent cable case multiple design scenarios were able to achieve similar optimal values of the objective function however unlike the previous case the maximum turbine diameter did not give the best results this is because in this mode of power transfer the system has to make frequent travels hence the higher energy generated by a larger turbine is lost in compensating for the higher drag forces generated by this size for better visualization of the four design parameters 2d scatter plots were generated by taking each design parameters along the axis in turns see fig 43 fig 44 and the design parameters were again distributed into five mass ranges of the system fig 43 shows that turbine diameters are limited to a 2 2 5 m range similarly figs 44 and 45 shows that buoyancy margins and l d are limited to 0 87 0 9 and 8 5 10 value ranges respectively based on the minimum mass range the best design scenarios are summarized in table 3 based on the same procedure followed in case i using the auv harvesters themselves to transfer power case 3 in this case the entire system moves to the shore to offload energy the distance from the harvesting point to the shore is assumed to be 125 km where the first 30 km is covered in the cross flow stream velocities of the gulf stream while the rest of the distance is in the negligible cross flow velocity region the objective function for this case is the same as the objective function used for the ship case 2 model as in the previous case case 2 only those objective function values are considered which lie within 5 of the best value due to the increased distance which the auv harvester now has to travel the algorithm tries to push the turbine size to its lowest limit of 2 m see fig 46 to limit the drag and hence the energy lost in travelling back and forth to the shore to offload energy other parameters remain in a similar range as the previous case see fig 47 and fig 48 following the same procedure as the above two cases table 4 was populated it is clearly seen from the optimization result summary tables that different design requirements lead to different optimal design parameters comparing the mass of the optimal systems from the three cases shows that the permanent cable case gives the lightest system this is understandable since for this case the on board energy storage is needed for only relocation and hence the weight of the energy storage system is reduced another thing to note is the objective function value which is the net energy transferred is less in case iii than in case ii since in case iii the auvs themselves are travelling back and forth to offload energy which leads to more energy losses when transferring energy to the shore 4 summary and conclusions a 6 dof dynamic model of a mobile underwater turbine system to be used to harvest energy from the gulf stream is presented the stability of the system is illustrated by running simulations for three basic motions i constant forward thrust acting on the auv harvester moving against varying water currents ii passive stability of the system roll pitch stability iii constant forward thrust with varying buoyancy it is observed that the auv harvester is stable in all three aforementioned cases in addition a bead based tether model is developed and incorporated into the dynamic model to study the behavior of the auv harvester when it is anchored the effects of the following tether parameters on the tether behavior and computation time are presented i number of tether elements ii tether element spring constant iii tether element damping coefficient it is seen that using a total of 10 tether elements with each element having a spring constant and damping coefficient of 102 n m and 102 n m respectively captures the behavior of the system with reasonable accuracy while keeping computation times low the system performance in terms of the on board battery capacity maximum travel range and the position of the system while it is anchored is then parameterized with respect to four system parameters turbine diameter hull diameter l d ratio of the hull and the ballast tank size m a r g i n e m p t y a stochastic optimization algorithm is further implemented to obtain a desirable set of design parameters for three different cases concerning how harvested energy is transmitted to the mainland i case i using an underwater cable ii case ii using a ship to collect the energy from each auv and collectively transport the harvested energy to the mainland iii case iii using each auv harvester to shuttle between the gulf stream and the mainland and offload the harvested energy at the mainland it is observed that the optimal designs for case i are smaller and involve bigger turbines thus generating energy more quickly than the optimal designs for the cases 2 and 3 this is because case i involves the auv harvester transmitting the harvested energy directly to the mainland through underwater transmission cables while storing a part of this harvested energy onboard to meet its reserve energy needs local navigation requirements and powering auxiliary sub systems 4 1 acknowledgement the authors would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the north carolina coastal studies institute csi 
22610,we present the modeling and dynamic analysis of a mobile underwater turbine system a novel integration of autonomous underwater vehicles and hydrokinetic turbines for harvesting marine hydrokinetic energy from the gulf stream the gulf stream an ocean current that flows off the coast of north carolina is a source of hydrokinetic energy however the meandering nature of the gulf stream makes it challenging to harvest the full energy potential of the stream using fixed turbine systems one possible solution for increasing the amount of energy that can be extracted from the gulf stream involves using a mobile underwater energy harvester system that can follow the meandering stream so as to remain in regions of maximum energy potential the framework for the conceptual design and studies focusing on the feasibility of such a system have been presented previously in divi 2017 the focus of this paper is a mathematical model of the system which has been developed to analyze the dynamics of such a system along with parametric studies utilizing this model to come up with a system with an optimized set of design parameters a 6 dof analytical model of the system is developed to gain an understanding of the system s dynamic behavior and stability a bead based tether model is further developed to analyze the behavior of the system when it is anchored and harvesting energy a study regarding the effects of tether parameters such as the number of tether elements the spring constant and the damping coefficient of the tether on the tether behavior and computation time required for analysis is put forth to help determine an optimal set of tether parameters in addition a set of system parameters such as turbine diameter hull diameter l d ratio of the hull and ballast tank size are analyzed to see how they affect the net energy produced and the maximum distance travelled by the system finally three modes of power transfer to the shore are considered and an optimization algorithm is presented and used to find the best set of parameters suited for maximum energy transfer for each mode keywords relocatable energy harvester autonomous underwater vehicle renewable energy hydrokinetic energy ocean current energy tether modeling 1 introduction the importance of fossil fuels as a source of energy in human development is undisputed however their finite supply and impact on the environment has led to a surge in the usage and development of renewable energy sources renewable sources are the world s fastest growing energy source u s energy information administration 2016 with 50 of us population living within 50 miles of the coast d o e office of energy efficiency and renewable energy 2016 hydrokinetic energy is a vital form of renewable energy hydrokinetic energy refers to harnessing energy from flowing water bodies such as ocean currents river currents tides etc one such hydrokinetic energy source is the gulf stream an ocean current that originates in the gulf of mexico and flows off the eastern coast of us it comes close to the coastline within 50 km at two locations near fort lauderdale and near cape hatteras off the coast of north carolina which makes them prime spots for harvesting energy due to their relatively close proximity to the mainland haas et al 2017 it has been estimated that the gulf stream has the potential to deliver an annual average of 500 1000 w m2 bane et al 2017a even though the power potential of the gulf stream has been known for a long time it has not yet been effectively exploited the primary reason for this is that the maximum stream velocities are available in a very narrow region within the stream and decrease both laterally and with depth see fig 1 schematic showing cross section of gulf stream bane et al 2017b moreover the stream follows a meandering path see fig 2 and moves laterally over time the wavelike meandering path of the stream which can measure up to a few hundred kms may take 3 21 days to pass any fixed location along the stream and the lateral meandering of the stream shifts the stream laterally by as much as a 100 km and can last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months this means that at a particular location within the stream the power fluctuates significantly as can be seen in fig 3 and fig 4 all the existing ocean tidal current energy harvesting designs in the world are based on turbine systems fixed at a particular location wu et al 2018 shirasawa 2016 fairley 2009 lago et al 2010 however fluctuation in stream location makes installing a permanent turbine system an inefficient option although vertical turbine systems are capable of handling omni directional flow of water they cannot handle lateral shifting of water divi 2017 shows that the energy harvested from a movable turbine system in the gulf stream can be as much as double that harvested from a fixed turbine system hence the solution to this problem lies in developing a novel design which utilizes a relocatable energy harvester which can extract energy from the gulf stream in an efficient manner such a device can be created by integrating autonomous underwater vehicles auv with hydrokinetic turbines for brevity the term auv harvester shall be used to denote the mobile underwater turbine system for the rest of this paper a detailed discussion pertaining to the conceptual design of the auv harvester and its subsystems can be found in divi 2017 and tandon 2017 and parametric design studies various modes of operation and feasibility studies for an auv harvester can be found in divi 2017 the system design was broken down into two major components turbines for power generation and a hull design for providing safe housing for smaller components such as batteries ballast tank motors for propellers and electronics subsystems a submarine shaped hull was chosen for the harvester since it is hydrodynamic in shape and has a proven ability to withstand high hydrostatic pressures when designing a buoyant system the position of center of mass cm and center of buoyancy defined as the geometric center of the fluid displaced by the submerged body denoted by cb play a key role in the system s passive stability i e the tendency of a body to return to its original state following any disturbance for achieving passive stability the cm must lie directly beneath the cb along the earth s gravity vector passing through the cb this results in restoring torques acting on the system under any disturbance until the body finally reaches a stable position in which the cm lies below the cb to ensure the system has passive stability the auv harvester s hull is designed to have the bulk of its weight in the bottom half see fig 5 since the position of the cm of the system will vary depending on the amount of water in the ballast tank this may lead to situations where the cm of the overall system rises above the cb especially when the ballast tank is partially filled and the system is in tilted position to avoid this the ballast tank can be compartmentalized to restrict the movement of water in the ballast tank finally the turbines are placed such that their cm s lie in the same plane as the cm and the cb of the hull see fig 6 2 analytical model a dynamic model is needed to understand the stability characteristics and dynamic behavior of the proposed system under different environmental conditions to which the system will be exposed the dynamic model is developed and presented below 2 1 frames of reference formulating the dynamic model for any system starts with defining frames of reference and a set of variables which specify the configuration of the system two frames of references are involved in modeling the auv harvester see fig 7 the reference frame o i o j o k o also referred to as the o frame will be used as an inertial reference frame irf for our analysis and is described as follows the o frame is fixed with respect to the earth with its origin point o taken as an arbitrary fixed underwater point axis i o is parallel to the longitude lines pointing towards the north axis j o is parallel to the latitude lines pointing towards the east and axis k o points towards the center of the earth reference frame b i b j b k b also referred to as the b frame is a body frame of reference that is fixed to the body of the auv harvester with its origin b located at the center of buoyancy cb of the harvester it is a common practice to choose cb as the origin of the body reference frame since the cb of a fully submerged system stays fixed whereas the center of mass cm moves as the amount of water inside the ballast tank is varied axis i b points to the front of the vehicle j b points towards the right hand starboard side of the vehicle and k b is defined by the right hand rule 2 2 kinematic equations the complete state of any rigid body can be defined by six variables three components describing the position in space of a particular point in the body along with three euler angles which describe the orientation in space of a body frame e g the b frame described above with respect to an inertial reference frame when deriving equations of motion for our system we find it convenient to introduce six additional variables namely the components of the inertial velocity of the origin of the b frame and the components of the angular velocity of the b frame with respect to the inertial reference frame the o frame these twelve variables are then used to generate twelve equations of motion which together describe the dynamics of the rigid body the kinematic relations between these variables are described in detail below components of the position vector of cb with respect to point o expressed in the irf were chosen as the first three variables see figure 8 as indicated in eq 1 the distance between cm and cb for the vehicle is denoted by z b and z b is measured along k b as indicated in eq 2 1 r b o o x y z 2 r c m b b 0 0 z b a 3 2 1 euler angle rotation sequence is used for the transformation from the o frame to the b frame and the euler angles φ θ ψ form the next three variables where φ represents rotation about the x axis θ represents rotation about the y axis and ψ represents rotation about the z axis of the frame eq 3 4 show the matrix required to transform vectors from the irf to the body frame and vice versa s and c stand for sine and cosine respectively with the subscripts indicating the angles of which the sine and cosine are taken 3 c b o r ϕ x r θ y r ψ z 4 c o

of the cb of the auv harvester with respect to the irf as expressed in the b frame see eq 5 eq 6 describes the transformation of the components of the velocity of the cb from the b frame to the o frame the velocity of cb expressed in the o frame can also be expressed as the rate of change of its position vector as defined in eq 1 substituting this definition in eq 6 defines the relationship between x y and z and u v and w which forms the first set of kinematic relations eq 7 5 v b o o b u v w 6 v b o o o c o b v o b o b 7 x y z c θ c ψ s θ c ψ s ϕ s ψ c ϕ s θ c ψ c ϕ s ψ s ϕ c θ s ψ s θ

of the angular velocity components the relationship between the angular velocity components and euler angles can be expressed via eq 9 see section 3 2 of tandon 2017 for additional details 8 ω b o b p

acting on the body to its linear acceleration using the transport theorem to obtain the relation for acceleration of the cm with respect to o eq 11 and substituting it into eq 10 components of external forces can be expressed as a function of the variables u v w p q r and their time derivatives eq 12 10 f e x t m s y s a c m o o 11 a c m o o d d t b v b o o ω b o v b o o α b o r c m b ω b o

between the sum of the external torques about point b see eq 16 and the variables u v w p q and r eq 15 expressed in component form provides eq 17 19 which completes the set of twelve equations needed

behavior of a system is governed by the external forces and moments acting on it the source of the external forces and moments acting on the auv are discussed below 2 3 2 hydrostatic forces these are the forces applied to the body in a static fluid environment they are comprised of the buoyancy force and the gravitational force acting on the body 2 3 3 hydrodynamic forces these are the forces applied on the body due to its interaction with the surrounding fluid during relative motion estimation of this interaction requires knowledge of the precise shape of the body and the flow regime surrounding it these forces are further divided into the following categories skin friction the resistance offered by the fluid due to relative motion of a body moving through it is called skin friction drag prandtl and von karman models as presented by hoerner 1965 provide empirical relations for calculating the local drag coefficients the total drag force can be calculated by integrating the local forces over the entire wetted surface for the system pressure drag motion of a solid body through a fluid leads to increase in fluid pressure in the forward end of the body and decrease in pressure towards the aft end of the body this pressure difference leads to a resistive force called the pressure drag this force was calculated by assuming ellipsoidal and cylindrical shapes for the hull and turbines respectively and using standard drag coefficients for these shapes cross flow drag this is similar to the pressure drag except it acts when the body moves laterally i e normal to the longitudinal axis of the hull this force becomes dominant during turning maneuvers added mass effect as a submerged body moves through a fluid it needs to move the fluid mass surrounding it hence additional energy is needed to move this mass of fluid this energy becomes significant when the mass of the fluid is comparable to the mass of the body in motion traditionally this phenomenon is accounted in dynamic modeling by increasing the apparent mass of the moving body and is called the added mass effect most researchers represent this force with a coefficient based model fossen 2011 humphreys and watkinson 1978 newman and landweber 1978 tracey and watts 1986 numerous methods have been used to estimate these hydrodynamic coefficients such as experimental determination using cdf software or using empirical formulae for standard shapes of revolution due to its simplicity we used the empirical relation method to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficient of the system by assuming the hull and turbines to be ellipsoidal and cylindrically shaped of equivalent volume respectively added mass effects of the entire system were assumed to be the summation of the added mass effects of the system s individual elements 2 3 4 forces from propeller and control surfaces the combined forces from the propeller and the control surfaces control the trajectory of the system these forces become extremely important while developing the controller for the system however developing controllers is not within the scope of this paper so very simple models will be used to represent the forces from the propeller and control surfaces for the dynamic stability studies presented in this paper 2 4 simulation solving for the twelve equations of motions derived earlier gives us the evolution of the state variables over time under different scenarios three basic scenarios were considered for simulation 1 constant forward thrust acting on an auv harvester moving against varying water currents and in a neutrally buoyant condition 2 passive stability of the system roll and pitch stability and 3 forward thrust with varying buoyancy table 1 shows the system parameters used in the simulations fig 9 shows the time evolution of the translational and rotational velocities for scenario 1 with water velocity kept as zero the axial velocity u of the auv harvester increases initially due to thrust action until it reaches a terminal velocity when the drag forces balance out the force due to propeller thrust the angular velocity components remain stable throughout the simulation period now the water velocity was gradually increased and its effect on the axial velocity of the system is shown in fig 10 as expected the terminal velocity decreases with increasing water velocity due to higher drag forces acting on the body as discussed earlier having the cm below the cb makes the system passively stable this is demonstrated in fig 11 and fig 12 where the system is given an initial rotation of 1 5 radians in roll and pitch angles independently and the behavior of the euler angles is observed scenario 2 in both cases the auv harvester exhibits a damped oscillation before setting into a stable position we note here that the auv harvester oscillates with a higher frequency for the pitch stability case the reason for this higher frequency is the fact that the principal moment of inertia around the i b axis is larger than that around the j b axis due to the length of the auv harvester being much larger than the distance between the hull and the turbines and this lower moment of inertia along the j b axis leads to faster oscillations for the pitching case fig 13 demonstrates scenario 3 where the path traced out by the auv harvester is plotted when the system s buoyancy is varied and a constant forward thrust is input to the system this scenario is presented here to provide a qualitative validation that the system behaves as expected when the thrust and buoyancy are varied 2 5 tether modeling to simulate the behavior of the system when it is tethered to the ocean floor a tether model is developed fig 14 shows a 2 d schematic of the bead model used for the tether modeling this is a similar model to the one used in yoder 2016 the model divides the entire tether into n equal segments and n 1 nodes which are called beads hence the term bead model the first node is placed at the location at the bottom of the auv harvester where the tether is connected this point is fixed with respect to the b frame i e it moves with the harvester the last node i e the n 1 node is chosen to be the point where the tether is anchored to the seabed this point remains fixed with respect to the inertial reference frame any two nodes of the tether are assumed to be connected by an extensible cylindrical tether which can be modelled as a mass spring damper system with the mass of the segment divided equally between the two nodes it connects based on this set up the free body diagram for each node is developed and is shown in fig 15 the physical properties of the tether are assumed based on commercial tethers available in the market which can withstand the required tension forces the mass is calculated by assuming equal distribution of tether mass in each tether segment buoyancy force for each segment is estimated by calculating the volume of each segment to calculate the lift and drag coefficients hoerner s hoerner 1965 method of estimating coefficients for an obliquely placed cylinder is used the tension force in each tether segment is the sum of the forces due to the spring and the damper they are calculated based on the position and velocities of each node the spring force is calculated using the difference between the un stretched length l i and the stretched length d i see eq 22 the stretched length d i is calculated using coordinate positions of neighboring nodes eq 22 while the unstretched length is known in advance by dividing the total unstretched tether length into n equal segments the damping force is calculated using the rate of change of the segment length which can be obtained by differentiating eq 20 with respect to time which gives us eq 21 it is to be noted that the flexible tether considered for this case provides force only in tension and this should be reflected in the model as well this is taken care of by forcing the change in length as well as the rate of change in length of the tether segment to zero if the current length of a segment becomes less than its un stretched length for any given step in the numerical integration process multiplying the net tension force with the appropriate direction cosines e i x e i y and e i z see eq 23 give us the components of the tension force in each direction 20 d i x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 21 d i x i x i 1 x i x i 1 y i y i 1 y i y i 1 z i z i 1 z i z i 1 x i x i 1 2 y i y i 1 2 z i z i 1 2 22 i f d i l i

state space formulation was derived note that the coordinates of the first and last tether nodes are not state variables since they depend on the location of the connection points of the tether to the auv and seabed respectively 2 6 tether parameter sweep for the model to represent accurate dynamic behavior of the actual system good estimations of the tether parameters are needed physical properties like weight length and diameter can be obtained from the technical specification sheets for standard anchors available in the market other parameters are estimated based on parametric sweeps the following parameters control the behavior of the tethers number of tether elements the bead model as described above divides the tether into n segments to gain an insight into what the value of n should be simulations were run by varying the value of n and comparing the steady state node locations of the tether and the final positions of the auv the computation time needed to reach the steady state were also observed see fig 16 and fig 17 note that while the qualitative profile of the tether does not change much while increasing the tether segments there is a difference in the steady state position of the auv see fig 16 furthermore the biggest difference in steady state auv position is seen when increasing the tether segment from 1 to 5 to see the same difference when further increasing the number of segments the number of segments had to be increased to 50 the final position of the auv is important since the water flow decreases gradually with increase in depth which will directly affect the calculated power generation although the final position of auv does vary when increasing the tether segments beyond 5 the computation time needed to reach the steady state increases exponentially see fig 17 to seek the benefits of a low computation time without significantly compromising the accuracy of the dynamic analysis 10 segments were chosen for all further analyses presented in this paper the calculated depth of the tethered auv changed by less than 10 when increasing the number of segments from 10 to 50 see fig 16 effect of tether stiffness the tether stiffness can be calculated directly using the young s modulus of the tether material k e a l which is a readily available physical property however a parametric sweep was done to understand the effects of varying the tether spring constant on both tether node locations and computation time fig 18 shows that as k is increased beyond 102 n m there is not much qualitative difference in the node locations of the tether over a range of simulation times also as k is increased beyond 102 n m the mean percent extension of the tether stays below 1 see fig 19 and is in fact close to zero for k greater than or equal to 103 n m on the other hand from fig 19 we also see that the computation time needed to reach steady state follows the exact opposite trend compared to the mean tether extension hence if the actual stiffness of the tether is calculated as being greater than 103 n m we can use a value of 103 n m with minimal effect on accuracy with the advantage of only requiring a reasonable amount of computation time as opposed to using higher stiffness values effect of tether damping coefficient the need for parametrically studying the tether damping coefficient arose from the fact that its value is extremely difficult to calculate from physical properties of the material unlike the spring constant which can be calculated based on the young s modulus of the material surprisingly our results show that the qualitative steady state node locations of the tether remain unchanged for the entire range of values chosen for the tether damping coefficients see fig 20 and in particular the system reaches steady state even when the damping coefficient is kept at 0 n m this is because there are other external damping forces present in the form of skin friction pressure drag etc although the tether node locations remains unchanged the computation time needed to reach steady state increases significantly when the tether damping coefficient value is increased beyond a certain value this is because the tether damping coefficient affects the transient state of the system and thus affects the time needed for the system to reach steady state it is observed that the computation time decreases as the tether damping coefficient is increased from 0 n m to 102 n m but it increases thereafter see fig 21 this can be best understood by taking a simply analogy of a spring mass damper system which takes the least time to reach steady state when the damping coefficient is set to the critical damping coefficient value as the shortest computation time is needed for a tether damping coefficient value of 102 n m this is an approximate value as we only tested eight different damping coefficients this value was chosen for our tethered auv dynamics analyses 3 design parameter sweep an auv capable of harvesting energy from the gulf stream has to excel in multiple tasks to be a feasible design it will need to remain anchored safely in a favorable location and harvest the maximum possible energy from that location it will need to periodically relocate when a more favorable location becomes available and will need to expend minimal energy in doing so finally it will need to be able to transfer the harvested energy to the mainland with minimal energy expenditures with these three tasks in mind key design parameters are identified and their effect on system performance is studied the design parameters identified for the auv are 3 1 turbine diameter the turbine is the keystone of the entire system as its size and design directly affect the primary functionality of the system i e its power generation potential common sense dictates that a bigger diameter turbine should be used since it will generate more energy however it must be noted that the turbine is a negatively buoyant system which means that it requires the ballast tanks in the hull to keep it afloat a bigger and hence heavier turbine needs a bigger ballast tank which in turn reduces the space available for on board energy storage as seen in fig 22 a reduced on board energy storage system increases the frequency of trips needed for the system to offload its energy on shore furthermore a bigger turbine generates a higher drag which in turn will reduce the distance which the system can travel in search of places with better energy generation potential analysis was done to find the maximum distance that a system can travel in three different water flow conditions no flow cross flow and against the flow assuming that the auv starts its journey with its batteries fully charged as expected the distance travelled by the system decreases with increase in turbine diameter see fig 23 and fig 24 for all the flow conditions the increased system drag leads to another problem the increased drag results in the system being pushed downstream more by the water and pulled down by the tether more when compared to a smaller system as shown in fig 25 this reduces the power generation potential of the system as the stream velocity is maximum at the surface and decreases with depth 3 2 hull diameter the hull is another key component of the auv harvester as it affects the space available and hence the capacity of the on board energy storage the maximum size of the turbine that can be kept afloat and the net drag generated by the system the diameter keeping the l d ratio same was varied to study its effects on all these factors the volume of the hull is directly proportional to the cube of its diameter hence a bigger diameter hull allows for more energy to be stored on board see fig 22 and also allows for a bigger ballast tank to be installed see fig 28 the increase in hull diameter also increases the drag forces but this increase is proportional to the square of hull diameter also the net drag forces experienced by the system are dominated mostly by the turbine diameter see fig 27 since the hull is more hydrodynamic in shape and also the diameter range considered for the hull is smaller than the range considered for the turbine the final effect is seen in fig 28 which shows that the buoyancy increases significantly more than drag forces with an increase in hull diameter the results of this effect can be seen in fig 26 where a higher buoyant force in a bigger diameter hull keeps the system in a more upright position compared to a smaller diameter hull even though a bigger hull is facing higher drag force a similar explanation can be given for the effect of hull diameter on distance travelled by the system in different water flow conditions see figs 23 and 24 3 3 l d ratio of the hull l d ratio of the hull is another parameter that directly affects hull shape keeping the diameter of the hull fixed increasing the l d ratio increases both the length and volume of the hull this leads to a linear increase in buoyancy see fig 29 and skin friction see fig 30 and fig 31 however as explained above the net drag force acting on the system is dominated mostly by the turbines due to their blunt shape and bigger sizes but the buoyancy force is controlled mostly by the hull diameter hence the increase in hull diameter increases the buoyancy force more than the increase in drag forces which can be seen from the positive slope of the plot for buoyancy force drag force see fig 32 thus a lower l d ratio results in the auv being pushed downstream more when compared to a higher l d ration hull see fig 33 another effect of an increase in l d ratio is that the amount of battery storage capacity increases similar to the increase in buoyancy force this increase is proportional to the cube of l d ratio this increased battery storage capacity leads to the increase in the maximum range that can be travelled by the system see fig 34 and fig 35 in all types of flow conditions 3 4 ballast tank size ideally a submerged system should be positively buoyant when the ballast tank is completely empty and negatively buoyant when it is completely filled that is it should rise to the surface when the ballast tank is completely empty and it should sink when the ballast tank is completely filled the net vertical force acting on the system during these two conditions depends on the size and design of the ballast tank based on this two parameters are defined as follows m a r g i n e m p t y is defined as the ratio of auv weight to that of the buoyancy force when the ballast space is empty similarly m a r g i n f u l l is defined as the ratio of auv weight to that of the buoyancy force when the ballast space is full see eq 25 below marginempty system weight when ballast is completely empty buoyancy force 25 marginfull system weight when ballast is completely full buoyancy force note that buoyancy force remains constant for a fully submerged system and is independent of the size of the ballast tank however it directly affects the weight of the system depending on its water holding capacity for a given hull volume the ballast tank size also affects the capacity of on board energy storage fig 36 and fig 37 show the battery capacity for different buoyancy margins the battery capacity is maximum when both the margins are closer to unity when both the margins are closer to unity it means that the weight of the system does not vary much when the ballast tank is empty as compared to when it completely filled this indicates the presence of a small ballast tank which allows for maximum space for batteries as the margins move away from unity the size of ballast tanks increase and the space available for batteries is reduced quickly to zero since the buoyancy margins control the vertical forces acting on the system they also control the vertical position of the system when it is anchored as m a r g i n e m p t y moves away from unity the amount of vertical force acting on the system increases and as a result the system is able to maintain a higher position under the surface of the water see fig 38 all the parameters discussed above affect the system performance in their own way combinations of all the above parameters lead to a large number of possible design cases in fact there are an infinite number of possibilities if a continuous design space is considered for the l d ratio hull diameter and buoyancy margins an optimization algorithm is thus needed to search for optimal design cases amongst all possible cases that satisfy all the desired requirements for the system using an optimization algorithm not only reduces the tedious task of comparing each design case it also makes the design process more flexible the same algorithm can also be used to find optimized designs for different operating conditions 3 5 optimization algorithm the design space at hand has four design parameters hence it is difficult to visualize the design space and perform qualitative analyses it is difficult to determine for example if the design has local minima therefore we have chosen to implement a stochastic algorithm for this problem another advantage of using a stochastic algorithm is that it can find multiple optimal points the objective function used for the optimization along with the constraint equations are listed in eq 26 and eq 27 below minimize 26 f o b j power produced max power production possible λ i max 0 g i 2 reward term image 1 the overall objective of the auv harvester design is to maximize the net power transferred from the point of generation to the shore while being within the physical design constraints discussed below based on this idea the optimization problem is set up see eq 26 eq 27 each term in the problem has been normalized to manage their weight in the objective function and to allow the optimization algorithm to be equally sensitive towards variation in all the variables traditionally optimization problems are handled as minimization problems to align with this the objective function was formulated such that minimization of the objective function helps us meet our overall objective the first term of the objective function is taken as the negative of net power produced by the system normalized the second term is a penalty term which acts to keep the design variables within the constraints represented by the equation eq 27 this term attains its minimum value of zero only if all the constraints satisfy their limits the value of λ determines the speed of convergence towards an acceptable design space higher values of λ will force the design variable to be within a viable design space at a faster rate the value of λ is determined through trial and error the last term is a reward term the reward term can be modified as per the mode of power transferred considered for the problem this is explained in detail later each constraint in eq 27 represents a physical limitation on the design variable considered in the problem the first limitation g 1 g 6 is the diameter of turbine considered a range of 0 5 2 m was chosen based on the availability of existing underwater turbines the second limitation g 2 g 7 is the hull diameter which was again chosen based on the availability of existing auv submarines the third limitation was the l d ratio range g 3 g 8 which was chosen to be within 2 units of what is considered an ideal l d ratio for submarine shaped hulls the last constraint g 5 describes the requirement for the auv to have enough energy capacity on board to travel the breadth of the gulf stream in search of better energy harvesting locations the problem set up was run for three different modes of power transfer case i using permanent cables to transfer energy to the mainland case ii using a ship to collect the energy from each auv and collectively transport the energy to the mainland case iii using the auv harvesters themselves to transport the energy to the mainland additional details on the aforementioned cases can be found in divi 2017 for each case 200 independent runs of the algorithm were executed to ensure that the algorithm did not get stuck in local minima 3 5 1 optimization results permanent cable case case i most of the 200 independent runs yielded similar values of the objective function thus providing some certainty that the particular value of the objective function is not a local minimum note that even though the value of objective function was similar the design parameter combinations which yielded those values were different one parameter remains constant in all of the optimization results turbine diameter and the algorithm drives the turbine diameter to its maximum value of 5 m this makes sense because a higher turbine size increases the power output although higher turbine size increases the overall drag the given constraints can be met by adjusting other parameters to differentiate between the different optimal design parameters all the design combinations were segregated based on the mass of the system they resulted in it was assumed that the lighter system would lead to less material and fabrication cost fig 39 shows the 3d scatter plot showing the design parameters in different mass ranges figs 40 42 show the 2d scatter sub plots extracted from the 3d scatter plot note that the blue dots represent the least mass scenarios based on the mass criteria discussed above the best design scenarios are summarized in table 2 these cases were obtained by rounding off the physical dimensions such as turbine diameter hull diameter and l d ratio to one decimal point accuracy and rounding the buoyancy margin to two decimal point accuracy this led to five distinct design scenarios ship case case 2 for the ship case the cost function is modified and is set to the negative of the net energy transferred by the system in a week s time divided by 105 to obtain the objective function values note that for this particular optimization the algorithm failed to find best function values for some of the runs and only those scenarios are considered whose best objective function value lies within 5 of the best value just like the previous case case 1 the permanent cable case multiple design scenarios were able to achieve similar optimal values of the objective function however unlike the previous case the maximum turbine diameter did not give the best results this is because in this mode of power transfer the system has to make frequent travels hence the higher energy generated by a larger turbine is lost in compensating for the higher drag forces generated by this size for better visualization of the four design parameters 2d scatter plots were generated by taking each design parameters along the axis in turns see fig 43 fig 44 and the design parameters were again distributed into five mass ranges of the system fig 43 shows that turbine diameters are limited to a 2 2 5 m range similarly figs 44 and 45 shows that buoyancy margins and l d are limited to 0 87 0 9 and 8 5 10 value ranges respectively based on the minimum mass range the best design scenarios are summarized in table 3 based on the same procedure followed in case i using the auv harvesters themselves to transfer power case 3 in this case the entire system moves to the shore to offload energy the distance from the harvesting point to the shore is assumed to be 125 km where the first 30 km is covered in the cross flow stream velocities of the gulf stream while the rest of the distance is in the negligible cross flow velocity region the objective function for this case is the same as the objective function used for the ship case 2 model as in the previous case case 2 only those objective function values are considered which lie within 5 of the best value due to the increased distance which the auv harvester now has to travel the algorithm tries to push the turbine size to its lowest limit of 2 m see fig 46 to limit the drag and hence the energy lost in travelling back and forth to the shore to offload energy other parameters remain in a similar range as the previous case see fig 47 and fig 48 following the same procedure as the above two cases table 4 was populated it is clearly seen from the optimization result summary tables that different design requirements lead to different optimal design parameters comparing the mass of the optimal systems from the three cases shows that the permanent cable case gives the lightest system this is understandable since for this case the on board energy storage is needed for only relocation and hence the weight of the energy storage system is reduced another thing to note is the objective function value which is the net energy transferred is less in case iii than in case ii since in case iii the auvs themselves are travelling back and forth to offload energy which leads to more energy losses when transferring energy to the shore 4 summary and conclusions a 6 dof dynamic model of a mobile underwater turbine system to be used to harvest energy from the gulf stream is presented the stability of the system is illustrated by running simulations for three basic motions i constant forward thrust acting on the auv harvester moving against varying water currents ii passive stability of the system roll pitch stability iii constant forward thrust with varying buoyancy it is observed that the auv harvester is stable in all three aforementioned cases in addition a bead based tether model is developed and incorporated into the dynamic model to study the behavior of the auv harvester when it is anchored the effects of the following tether parameters on the tether behavior and computation time are presented i number of tether elements ii tether element spring constant iii tether element damping coefficient it is seen that using a total of 10 tether elements with each element having a spring constant and damping coefficient of 102 n m and 102 n m respectively captures the behavior of the system with reasonable accuracy while keeping computation times low the system performance in terms of the on board battery capacity maximum travel range and the position of the system while it is anchored is then parameterized with respect to four system parameters turbine diameter hull diameter l d ratio of the hull and the ballast tank size m a r g i n e m p t y a stochastic optimization algorithm is further implemented to obtain a desirable set of design parameters for three different cases concerning how harvested energy is transmitted to the mainland i case i using an underwater cable ii case ii using a ship to collect the energy from each auv and collectively transport the harvested energy to the mainland iii case iii using each auv harvester to shuttle between the gulf stream and the mainland and offload the harvested energy at the mainland it is observed that the optimal designs for case i are smaller and involve bigger turbines thus generating energy more quickly than the optimal designs for the cases 2 and 3 this is because case i involves the auv harvester transmitting the harvested energy directly to the mainland through underwater transmission cables while storing a part of this harvested energy onboard to meet its reserve energy needs local navigation requirements and powering auxiliary sub systems 4 1 acknowledgement the authors would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the north carolina coastal studies institute csi

and ocean engineering college dalian maritime university no 1 linghai road dalian china a physics based simulation for auv docking with a stationary dock was performed with the multi block hybrid dynamic grids method mhdg and a discretized propeller urans equations were coupled to 6dof equations via udf to predict the instantaneous velocity and position the mhdg method uses a multi block mesh topology moving mesh and dynamic layer method to grid the domain move the rigid body and its sub domain and re mesh the skewed mesh respectively which can improve computation accuracy and speed the numerical methods were validated by a comparison with open water curves and the velocity history in auv free running between simulation and tests two docking modes were validated constant rpm docking and brake docking in constant rpm docking the auv velocity increased gradually by approximately 11 5 in 6 0 s the dock had less effect on auv resistance except that the resistance increased and then declined as the auv passed through the neck point of the dock the tip vortex pairs extended and damped downstream of the rotating propeller in brake docking the propeller acted as a resistance part and led to a decrement of 46 2 in the velocity in nearly 9 s the viscous pressure resistance occurred after the braking propeller keywords auv underwater docking self propulsion discretized propeller dynamic mesh physics based simulation 1 introduction underwater docking is very important for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv to extend its work duration and improve its working ability in sustainable scientific missions this topic has been researched and some results have been achieved with some docking systems having conducted sea experiments before they came to application allen et al 2006 fletcher et al 2017 kawasaki et al 2003 robert et al 2008 one of the major reasons for docking failure hydroid 2012 yan and wu 2007 is the inability to predict hydrodynamic intervention from the dock ocean currents or other oceanic obstacles the best way to determine the hydrodynamic performance is to perform a physics based simulation or conduct a test the former is fast costs less and can be used to investigate the physics of complex flow phenomena which was proposed by the navy in the 1990s but it was not until recent years that the technique of physics based simulation of marine vehicles equipped with a discretized propeller was achieved due to the disparity in the length and time scales within the problem due to the geometric complexity and relative motions of components there are two methods used for physics based simulations the multi frames of reference mfr method choi et al 2010 and the dynamic mesh method lübke 2005 modeled a kcs kriso korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering container ship under self propelled conditions by imposing the ship speed and propeller rps revolutions per second in the field wang et al 2011 investigated the interaction of hull and fins using the mfr method wei and wang 2013 used the mfr method to obtain the propulsion factors and approaching velocity of a fully appended submarine by varying the rotation speed while maintaining the inflow velocity the dynamic mesh method includes the overset mesh and the moving mesh method carrica et al 2010 2011 2012 2013a 2013b used an overset mesh to perform self propulsion maneuvering computations of surface ships such as freeing to sink and trim in head waves for a kcs tanker the broaching turn and zigzag maneuvers of a twin propeller fully appended surface combatant dtmb david taylor model basin model 5613 the onr tumblehome model the onr tumblehome is the research version of the us navy surface combatant ddg 1000 zumwalt class the self propelled running of a kcs container ship without a rudder and the darpa defense advanced research projects agency suboff submarine model these simulations modeled a rotating propeller and conducted a self propulsion simulation in which the propulsion data at the self propulsion point was compared between simulations and experiments detailed flow fields were observed and analyzed the moving mesh method has been used in 2 d dimensional problems such as the vortex induced vibrations of a circular cylinder furquan et al 2016 and flow over a flexible fish like body zhang et al 2008 as well as 3 d moving boundary simulations such as deflection of a tail wing murayama et al 2002 relative motion with a large distance such as storage separation cavallo et al 2004 snyder 2005 an auv swimming from a tube wu et al 2010 and an auv approaching with a dock wu et al 2014 however moving mesh methods suffer from problems of severe mesh distortion and high rates of re meshing zhang et al 2010 which restrict their application in systems with complex relative motions such as self propulsion with a high speed rotating propeller pankajakshan et al 2002 used the interpolation of pre deformed grids to improve the mesh quality this was solved in this study by using the multi block hybrid dynamic grids mhdg method presented by zhan et al 2017 it is resource intensive to conduct a physics based simulation of marine maneuvering motions with a rotating propeller owing to the small time steps required for solving the flow of the propeller therefore it is necessary to rely on a high capability of calculation such as a supercomputer center or on a method to deal with the problem in order to decrease the mesh number and re meshing time the mhdg is one of the latter methods it uses multi block mesh topology moving mesh and a dynamic layer method to grid the domain move the rigid body and its sub domain and re mesh the skewed mesh respectively which can improve computation accuracy and speed the mhdg method was used in this study to conduct a physics based simulation of an auv docking with a dock to investigate the hydrodynamic effect of dock on the auv two docking modes at the final docking were simulated constant rpm revolutions per minute docking and brake docking in the former case the auv is approaching the dock pushed by its constant rotating propeller in the latter case the auv is much like an airplane braking when landing on the runway forces and velocities were recorded for both docking modes numerous flow details were obtained including the velocity pressure contours and velocity vectors two animations of velocity contours for the two docking modes were also provided 2 geometries and the mhdg method the simulated cases of auv underwater docking herein concern the final docking in which the auv s hydrodynamic performance may be affected by the dock the auv started docking at a position about 1 78 times the length of the auv in front of the dock s entrance shown in fig 1 the dock shape is the same as the shape a dock from wu et al 2014 and includes a nozzle and a tube though it is a little longer than the shape a dock due to the longer auv selected the auv is a remus remote environmental monitoring units like auv shown in fig 2 it is developed for underwater docking as in allen et al 2006 which adds an additional inertial navigation system modular front end cap and digital ultra short baseline usbl acoustic homing sensor on the nose the auv is 0 191 m in diameter by 1 74 m long this is an enhanced auv and a little longer compared with the original remus 100 the hull is composed of three parts a nose section bow with a semi elliptical radius a middle section with a constant radius and a tail section with a semi conical radius four identical tail planes are arranged in a symmetrical configuration and a mau 4 40 propeller is attached to the tail section the earth coordinate system is oxyz where ox coincides with the longitudinal axis of the auv hull oy points to the starboard and oz points to the global center its original point is located at the front point of the auv s bow at the initial time when the auv starts docking as the docking proceeds the distance of auv will be shown in the earth coordinate system the thought of improving the mesh quality near the wall leads to the adoption of moving the sub domain instead of moving only the boundary as in the moving mesh method this operates similarly to the dynamic overset mesh method where the sub domain is moving and the background is kept stationary therefore the mhdg meshes and re meshes the flow domain which includes three parts firstly it meshes the domain with multi block topology secondly a moving mesh method is used for both the moving boundary and its dynamic region as adopted in the overset mesh method thirdly a dynamic layer method is used for re meshing to improve the mesh quality and decrease re meshing time the whole fluid domain is divided into six zones numbered ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ and ⅵ as shown in fig 3 zoneⅰis meshed with structured grids which involves the surface mesh of the auv hull tail planes and prismatic layer mesh filling in the remaining zone zoneⅱinvolves the rotating propeller the unstructured surface mesh of propeller blades and the remaining unstructured volume mesh rotating with the propeller the meshed auv is shown in fig 2 zone ⅲ is meshed with structured grids which surrounds zones ⅱand ⅰ zone ⅳis meshed with structured grids which extends forward from the auv bow to the dock end zone ⅴ is meshed with structured grids which extends backwards from the auv stern to the far domain lastly zone ⅵ is filled with unstructured tetrahedral grids the dock is meshed with unstructured grids to solve the flow near the walls including auv hull tail planes propeller four blades and a hub and dock the standard wall function is used ten layer prism mesh is built the average y of the walls is satisfied with 30 y 300 which could be referred to wu et al 2014 details of the grids of each zone are summarized in table 1 in auv docking simulation zone ⅱis rotating with the propeller zonesⅰand ⅲ are moving straight forward with the auv zone ⅳ and ⅴare moving zones the front wall of zone ⅳis stationary the first layer from this wall is split when the auv is moving the last wall of zone ⅴis stationary too whereas the first layer collapses when the auv moves forward the purpose of setting the collapsed layer and the split layer at a distance from the moving boundary is to reduce the time for re meshing because the further the position the larger the mesh size the outer zone ⅵ is a deformed one this meshing topology can obtain a high accuracy for skin friction force owing to good mesh quality in prismatic layers close to the moving boundary since the moving zones include the disturbed areas around the moving boundary and are not deformed the disturbed areas have a high mesh quality and can retain the accuracy of pressure force the re meshing method is a dynamic layer method which improves the mesh quality and re meshing speed since the mhdg method can improve computation accuracy and speed the inertia of the auv was not reduced to speed up the computation in self propulsion running or self propulsion docking the unsteady acceleration process of auv self propulsion motions could be analyzed and useful 3 user defined functions the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans coupled 6dof six degrees of freedom equations of motion bettle et al 2009 and user defined functions udfs were used to solve the physics based simulation of the final docking process three udfs were compiled to call for urans to compute forces 6dof to solve the motion factors and transfer dynamic factors among different zones the udfs were a propeller udf an auv udf and a fluid udf the flow chart for these udfs is shown in fig 4 in the propeller udf the propeller was rotating at an rpm n and affected by the inflow velocity the thrust t was calculated and saved in file f1 roll motion from the propeller s rotation was excluded the thrust t was transferred to the auv udf where the resistance r was calculated with urans equations the velocity v and the distance s of the auv were obtained by solving the 6dof the data of t r v and s was saved in file f2 the auv velocity v was read from f2 to the moving zones zones ⅰand ⅲ the motions of zones ⅰand ⅲ were transferred to zone ⅳ and ⅴ which were re meshed with the dynamic layer method the motions in interfaces were transferred into zone ⅵ which were deformed subsequently the whole domain was re meshed the propeller udf would read f2 to get the velocity v and distance s which would be used to control the rotating speed n the calculation was repeated until the distance s arrived at the aim distance sa the whole process of auv docking ended all the histories of data t t r v s sa and n were recorded and saved 4 experiment validations the grid convergence research has been done in wu et al 2014 for mesh effect on the auv s hydrodynamic coefficients and for mesh effect on the propeller s hydrodynamics in open water tests then the meshing method was used to simulate the propeller rotating in open water the numerical and experimental results for the thrust torque and efficiency of the propeller working in open water were shown in fig 5 it could be seen from fig 5 that the differences in kt kq and η0 between the simulated and experimental results were very small a series of tests of free running of auv appended with the tail planes and the propeller were carried out at the lab ocean basin in sia shenyang institute of automation chinese academy of science in november of 2013 the tests were performed at constant depth and heading the size of the basin is l 25 m b 15 m d 9 m fig 6 showed the auv on the bank a remus like auv named sarv in the basin and in the sea from left to right to avoid collisions between the auv and the basin wall the revolution of the motor was set at a medium speed occasionally the start point was not acceptable requiring the auv to make a turn to avoid the collision a number of 13 tests of auv free running was conducted the experiments recorded the motor rotation speed the auv velocity auv heading and its position from the analysis of the heading and position data five experiments with less heading change were selected for validation for the simulation of auv free running the auv velocity history in free running recorded in the simulation referred to henceforth as the cfd at the same rotating speed was compared with the five tests named exp1 exp2 exp3 exp4 and exp5 respectively shown in fig 7 each test recorded velocity per 0 5 s while the cfd calculated the velocity per time step time for 1 degree of propeller rotating therefore in order to make a good comparison the negative initial velocity in each test has been deleted and the first positive velocity in tests was kept since the cfd velocity started from 0 then each positive velocity in the tests will be passed through in the cfd owing to the effect of the basin wall the maximum time for free running in the experiment that is whilst avoiding collision is nearly 12 s however the time in simulation could be longer which is shown to be approximately 14 s the velocity before 12 s is compared the velocity in exp1 agreed well with the simulation at lower velocities and is a little higher than the simulation at a medium velocity the velocity of exp2 agreed well with the cfd except for two scatter points which may owe to inaccuracies in the measuring instruments the detailed error of tests compared with the cfd is shown in fig 8 the velocities in experiments agreed well with the cfd results after 5 s where all the errors were less than 10 but in some time parts the error are larger there are a maximum error of 10 at 4 5 s 20 at 1 8 s 30 at 2 s 24 at 1 s 25 at 1 s for exp1 exp2 exp3 exp4 and exp5 respectively the maximum error occurred mostly at the initial time parts which may due to the instrument precision in tests and small velocity value 5 numerical results 5 1 constant rpm docking for the purpose of investigating the effect of the dock on the hydrodynamic performance of the auv a constant rpm docking is first performed in which the auv is propelled to the stationary dock by a constantly rotating propeller the whole length of the docking process is about 2 5 times the auv length which could be longer if not limited by the simulation time the auv has a starting velocity of 0 68 m s the reynolds number was changing as auv s velocity changed the initial reynolds number was 2 149 106 at a constant rpm the auv continued cruising straight along the docking centerline toward the dock the total time for the constant rpm docking was about 6 s the thrust and resistance of the auv vs time are shown in fig 9 and its velocity in fig 10 these two figures demonstrated that the auv had a continuing increase of velocity because the thrust was slightly greater than the resistance before auv entered the entrance of the nozzle the inflow velocity upstream of the propeller was increasing however slightly the thrust was decreasing which agreed with the open water curve in fig 5 the resistance increased smoothly as the velocity increased until the auv arrived at the nozzle s entrance subsequently the resistance increased in oscillation when the auv moved in front of the neck point of b the resistance arrived at its maximum the maximum increment of resistance after the auv entering point a was about 6 7 thereafter there was a slump in resistance when the auv entered the tube part of the dock it meant that the auv had the opposite effect from the dock a pressure force before the neck point b and a suction force after the neck point b which would be depicted more clearly in the flow field later the variation of resistance influenced the velocity which experienced a decrease in acceleration before point b and an increase in acceleration after point b shown in fig 10 since the curvature of the velocity is not obvious the points of a b and c are marked beside the intersection points to indicate the line variation clearly the increment of velocity during the docking time duration of 6 0 s is about 11 5 with an end velocity of 0 76 m s the end velocity should be controlled less than 1 m s which is demanded in engineering to avoid a large collision force suggested in reference robert et al 2008 therefore using this constant rpm docking is accepted to meet the collision demand the flow field between 0 s and 6 s was discussed as follows cross sectional cuts at the plane of y 0 showing the instantaneous axial velocity at six different times t 0 s 1 2 s 2 4 s 3 6 s 4 8 s and 6 0 s during constant rpm docking is shown in fig 11 with the same color map for comparison the far field velocity was v 0 because the auv was cruising in an earth coordinate system the right figures in fig 11 described the entire velocity contour at the cut plane while those on the left showed a zoomed in wake astern the propeller to see the discrepancies more clearly among the six time points in the right figures it is obvious that the wake extends downstream of the propeller the variation of the velocity contour close to the bow is not obvious except after the time when auv entered the dock s entrance t 4 8s and t 6 0s when the auv passed through the nozzle t 4 8s the velocity contours before the auv s bow enlarged and narrowed t 4 8s which meant more water before auv s bow had obtained velocity the velocity contours near the bow was also larger these two differences around auv s bow meant that the auv s resistance was increasing beside there was flow moving out through the holes of the nozzle in the left figures the propeller pushed the water afterwards and the tip vortex pairs generated by the rotating propeller were obvious the strength of propeller wake decreased as the auv velocity was increasing besides a root vortex downstream of the hub was obvious which was chasing the auv and accelerated as auv s velocity accelerated an animation of the auv wake in constant rpm docking is shown in the electronic annex fig 12 showed three dimensional pressure contours in constant rpm docking in which the two low pressure areas were obvious on both the auv s bow and its stern due to the high velocity the high pressure on the blade face and the low pressure on the tail planes were both showed clearly which meant that the propeller acted as a provider of thrust the pressures on the auv and the dock did not change until the auv entered the dock s nozzle a slight increase in t 3 6 s a large increase in t 4 8 s when the auv s bow entered the dock there was an increased pressure distributed around the nozzle the narrower the section the higher the pressure shown in t 4 8 s which meant that the auv passed through the nozzle with difficulty but when auv s bow passed through the nozzle and entered the tube the pressure contours on the nozzle were on the contrary the narrower the section the lower the pressure consequently the nozzle would now push the auv forward since the thrust on the propeller had not changed significantly only one time point t 0s was selected for depicting the pressure contours on the propeller blades as shown in fig 13 5 2 brake docking in auv underwater docking there is a need to slow down the docking velocity to avoid collision as with an airplane braking when landing on the runway a brake process could be used for the final docking the duration of the brake process and how fast the velocity will decrease will be discussed herein the tests of auv braking were conducted at the sia lab basin one of the braking processes was depicted in fig 14 it showed that the braking process took about 40s from the starting velocity of 0 67 m s to the final velocity of 0 06 m s approximately stationary in the first 10 s the velocity decreased rapidly after that the velocity decreased more and more slowly this takes too long to simulate to decrease the simulation time the fast deceleration time in the brake process is selected for simulation in brake docking the propeller stopped rotating at the starting position of the final docking shown in fig 1 the auv had an initial velocity and slowed down with only resistance acting on it the propeller would not produce thrust it produced a resistance r p added to the resistance of the hull r h shown in fig 15 where r t is the sum of r p and r h the two resistances acted on the auv causing its velocity to decrease quickly at the initial time the resistance of the propeller was larger than the hull resistance as velocity decreased the two resistances also decreased though the r p decreased more quickly than r h thereafter r p became smaller than r h r h oscillated a little especially when the auv entered the dock shown in point a b and c there was a slump when the auv entered the neck point b this showed that the nozzle had two opposite effects on the auv when the nozzle was in front of the auv it generated resistance which drew the auv back when the auv passed the nozzle it generated a suction force which could push the auv forward fig 16 showed the velocity histories for brake docking cfd and braking processes in the experiments exp1 exp2 exp3 and exp4 the velocity in the first 6s of brake docking was used for comparison with the tests due to being less affected by the dock before point a the velocity error between cfd and tests in brake process may due to the heading deviation of the tests before each brake process the auv performed a self propulsion motion and cruised for some distance therefore there was a limited range in the sia basin left for the brake process thus the auv had to turn to avoid the collision the larger the heading deviation the larger the velocity decrease the velocity decrease is 38 6 42 1 43 2 and 42 8 related to heading change of 15 19 4 13 3 12 7 shown in fig 17 for exp1 exp2 exp3 and exp4 respectively shown in table 2 why exp1 has less velocity decrease with a larger heading deviation compared to exp3 exp4 because the initial several points in exp1 where the velocity decrease ratio is the largest stayed with the same heading angles which would make velocity decrease less in brake docking the velocity decreased from 0 65 m s to 0 35 m s in nearly 9 s the decrement was about 46 2 the whole distance of the braking process is about 4 3 m nearly 2 5 times the auv s length shown in fig 18 fig 19 showed the velocity contours in brake docking at six time points t 0s 1 4s 3 0s 4 8s 6 8s and 9 1s it was clear to see that the propeller acted as a source of resistance when it stopped rotating there were two velocity areas after the propeller one was close to the propeller with a positive velocity pointing to the direction of the auv docking which acted as a viscous pressure resistance the value was comparatively large and decreasing from the propeller to its downstream the other was farther away from the propeller with a negative velocity which was a vortex flow produced by the rotating propeller at the initial time and left in damping the value is smaller as brake docking continued the velocity of the auv decreased and the positive velocity after the propeller also decreased the velocity close to the auv had three obvious areas the first one before the bow was pointing in the docking direction the second was at the neck area connecting the bow and the middle part pointing to the auv stern the third was the boundary layer flow along the auv surface when the bow entered the dock s nozzle the second area was affected first becoming larger then smaller this showed a variation in the resistance fig 15 fig 20 showed the velocity vectors around the auv stern between constant rpm docking and brake docking at the initial time it could be seen that the rotating propeller appended after the cruising auv would produce two flows one pushing water downstream by the propeller blades the other chasing the auv which is downstream of the hub the main hydrodynamic forces acted by propeller lies on the 0 66r 0 75r area of blades not the tip area but in brake docking the flow after the propeller just chases the cruising auv upstream of the propeller the velocity in constant rpm docking is chasing the auv but its value is less than that in brake docking due to the absorption force produced by the rotating propeller the pressure contours during brake docking were shown in fig 21 since the auv velocity decreased as brake docking continued the auv would not be affected by the dock until it entered the middle of the nozzle shown in t 6 8 s therefore it is safer to dock because the auv could enter the dock in freedom without a large added resistance when it passed through the neck point b a negative pressure acted on the bow thus a suction force acted on the auv which would pull the auv to dock but the magnitude of the suction force was lower than that in constant rpm docking 6 conclusion the physics based simulation of auv underwater docking was investigated in this work by employing the mhdg method combined with urans 6dof and udf using the mhdg method and substituting an ordinary moving mesh method the mesh quality after mesh moving and boundary moving can be retained and re meshing takes less time the physics based simulation was running rapidly which required only 7 14 days on a desktop computer with the following specifications intel r core tm i5 6400 cpu 2 70 ghz 2 70 ghz ram 16 0 gb the numerical results were verified by comparison of open water curves and velocity histories of auv free running between simulations and tests the two docking modes of constant rpm docking and brake docking were simulated and the results were shown as follows in constant rpm docking 1 the effect of the dock on auv hydrodynamic performance was less pronounced except when the auv was passing through the neck point b where there was a contrary effect from the dock the resistance increased and then declined when the auv passed through the neck point this resulted in a decrease in acceleration and an increase in acceleration respectively 2 when the auv bow entered the dock there was an increased pressure distributed around the nozzle the narrower the section the higher the pressure auv passed through the nozzle with difficulty however when the auv bow passed through the nozzle and entered the tube the pressure contours on the nozzle were on the contrary 3 during constant rpm docking the propeller pushed the water afterwards and the tip vortex pairs generated by the rotating propeller were pronounced the strength of the vortex pairs had a damping effect there was a root vortex downstream of hub chasing the auv which increased as the auv velocity was increasing 4 the increment of resistance and velocity during the docking time of 6 0 s was approximately 6 7 and 11 5 respectively in brake docking 1 it showed that the braking process took about 40 s from the starting velocity of 0 67 m s to the final velocity of 0 06 m s in the experiments during the first 10 s the velocity would decrease rapidly 2 the velocity history showed that brake docking would decrease the velocity from 0 65 m s to 0 35 m s in nearly 9 s the decrement was about 46 2 3 the propeller created a force of resistance when it stopped rotating there were two velocity areas after the propeller one was close to the propeller with a positive velocity pointing in the direction of auv docking which acted as a viscous pressure resistance the other was at a distance from the propeller with a negative velocity which was the vortex flow produced by the rotating propeller at the initial time and continuing with a damping effect as the brake docking proceeded the value was smaller 4 the velocity close to the auv resided in three obvious areas the first one was before the bow which was positive pointing in the auv docking direction the second was negative and at the neck area connecting the bow and the middle part pointing to the auv stern the third was the boundary layer flow shown in green along the auv surface 5 the velocity decreased significantly when the auv entered the nozzle therefore the drag and push forces from the nozzle were comparatively less than those in constant rpm docking thus it was safer to dock since the auv could enter the dock in freedom without a large added force it is possible to control the docking velocity effectively at the initial position using the two docking modes discussed above the velocities at the end of point c are acceptable compared with the literature however a more useful and convenient way to control docking velocity which is necessary to avoid collision between the auv and the dock and to have the propeller and tail planes working effectively to overcome unexpected currents is embedding a function of velocity control into udf this will be investigated in the future acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the chinese scholarship council csc the natural

dynamic grids method mhdg and a discretized propeller urans equations were coupled to 6dof equations via udf to predict the instantaneous velocity and position the mhdg method uses a multi block mesh

numerical methods were validated by a comparison with open water curves and the velocity history in auv free running between simulation and tests two docking modes were validated constant rpm docking and brake docking in constant rpm docking the auv velocity increased gradually by approximately 11 5 in 6 0 s the dock had less effect on auv resistance except that the resistance increased and then declined as the auv passed through the neck point of the dock the tip vortex pairs extended and damped downstream of the rotating propeller in brake docking the propeller acted as a resistance part and led to a decrement of 46 2 in the velocity in nearly 9 s the viscous pressure resistance occurred after the braking propeller keywords auv underwater docking self propulsion discretized propeller dynamic mesh physics based simulation 1 introduction underwater docking is very important for an autonomous underwater vehicle auv to extend its work duration and improve its working ability in sustainable scientific missions this topic has been researched and some results have been achieved with some docking systems having conducted sea experiments before they came to application allen et al 2006 fletcher et al 2017 kawasaki et al 2003 robert et al 2008 one of the major reasons for docking failure hydroid 2012 yan and wu 2007 is the inability to predict hydrodynamic intervention from the dock ocean currents or other oceanic obstacles the best way to determine the hydrodynamic performance is to perform a physics based simulation or conduct a test the former is fast costs less and can be used to investigate the physics of complex flow phenomena which was proposed by the navy in the 1990s but it was not until recent years that the technique of physics based simulation of marine vehicles equipped with a discretized propeller was achieved due to the disparity in the length and time scales within the problem due to the geometric complexity and relative motions of components there are two methods used for physics based simulations the multi frames of reference mfr method choi et al 2010 and the dynamic mesh method lübke 2005 modeled a kcs kriso korea research institute for ships and ocean engineering container ship under self propelled conditions by imposing the ship speed and propeller rps revolutions per second in the field wang et al 2011 investigated the interaction of hull and fins using the mfr method wei and wang 2013 used the mfr method to obtain the propulsion factors and approaching velocity of a fully appended submarine by varying the rotation speed while maintaining the inflow velocity the dynamic mesh method includes the overset mesh and the moving mesh method carrica et al 2010 2011 2012 2013a 2013b used an overset mesh to perform self propulsion maneuvering computations of surface ships such as freeing to sink and trim in head waves for a kcs tanker the broaching turn and zigzag maneuvers of a twin propeller fully appended surface combatant dtmb david taylor model basin model 5613 the onr tumblehome model the onr tumblehome is the research version of the us navy surface combatant ddg 1000 zumwalt class the self propelled running of a kcs container ship without a rudder and the darpa defense advanced research projects agency suboff submarine model these simulations modeled a rotating propeller and conducted a self propulsion simulation in which the propulsion data at the self propulsion point was compared between simulations and experiments detailed flow fields were observed and analyzed the moving mesh method has been used in 2 d dimensional problems such as the vortex induced vibrations of a circular cylinder furquan et al 2016 and flow over a flexible fish like body zhang et al 2008 as well as 3 d moving boundary simulations such as deflection of a tail wing murayama et al 2002 relative motion with a large distance such as storage separation cavallo et al 2004 snyder 2005 an auv swimming from a tube wu et al 2010 and an auv approaching with a dock wu et al 2014 however moving mesh methods suffer from problems of severe mesh distortion and high rates of re meshing zhang et al 2010 which restrict their application in systems with complex relative motions such as self propulsion with a high speed rotating propeller pankajakshan et al 2002 used the interpolation of pre deformed grids to improve the mesh quality this was solved in this study by using the multi block hybrid dynamic grids mhdg method presented by zhan et al 2017 it is resource intensive to conduct a physics based simulation of marine maneuvering motions with a rotating propeller owing to the small time steps required for solving the flow of the propeller therefore it is necessary to rely on a high capability of calculation such as a supercomputer center or on a method to deal with the problem in order to decrease the mesh number and re meshing time the mhdg is one of the latter methods it uses multi block mesh topology moving mesh and a dynamic layer method to grid the domain move the rigid body and its sub domain and re mesh the skewed mesh respectively which can improve computation accuracy and speed the mhdg method was used in this study to conduct a physics based simulation of an auv docking with a dock to investigate the hydrodynamic effect of dock on the auv two docking modes at the final docking were simulated constant rpm revolutions per minute docking and brake docking in the former case the auv is approaching the dock pushed by its constant rotating propeller in the latter case the auv is much like an airplane braking when landing on the runway forces and velocities were recorded for both docking modes numerous flow details were obtained including the velocity pressure contours and velocity vectors two animations of velocity contours for the two docking modes were also provided 2 geometries and the mhdg method the simulated cases of auv underwater docking herein concern the final docking in which the auv s hydrodynamic performance may be affected by the dock the auv started docking at a position about 1 78 times the length of the auv in front of the dock s entrance shown in fig 1 the dock shape is the same as the shape a dock from wu et al 2014 and includes a nozzle and a tube though it is a little longer than the shape a dock due to the longer auv selected the auv is a remus remote environmental monitoring units like auv shown in fig 2 it is developed for underwater docking as in allen et al 2006 which adds an additional inertial navigation system modular front end cap and digital ultra short baseline usbl acoustic homing sensor on the nose the auv is 0 191 m in diameter by 1 74 m long this is an enhanced auv and a little longer compared with the original remus 100 the hull is composed of three parts a nose section bow with a semi elliptical radius a middle section with a constant radius and a tail section with a semi conical radius four identical tail planes are arranged in a symmetrical configuration and a mau 4 40 propeller is attached to the tail section the earth coordinate system is oxyz where ox coincides with the longitudinal axis of the auv hull oy points to the starboard and oz points to the global center its original point is located at the front point of the auv s bow at the initial time when the auv starts docking as the docking proceeds the distance of auv will be shown in the earth coordinate system the thought of improving the mesh quality near the wall leads to the adoption of moving the sub domain instead of moving only the boundary as in the moving mesh method this operates similarly to the dynamic overset mesh method where the sub domain is moving and the background is kept stationary therefore the mhdg meshes and re meshes the flow domain which includes three parts firstly it meshes the domain with multi block topology secondly a moving mesh method is used for both the moving boundary and its dynamic region as adopted in the overset mesh method thirdly a dynamic layer method is used for re meshing to improve the mesh quality and decrease re meshing time the whole fluid domain is divided into six zones numbered ⅰ ⅱ ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ and ⅵ as shown in fig 3 zoneⅰis meshed with structured grids which involves the surface mesh of the auv hull tail planes and prismatic layer mesh filling in the remaining zone zoneⅱinvolves the rotating propeller the unstructured surface mesh of propeller blades and the remaining unstructured volume mesh rotating with the propeller the meshed auv is shown in fig 2 zone ⅲ is meshed with structured grids which surrounds zones ⅱand ⅰ zone ⅳis meshed with structured grids which extends forward from the auv bow to the dock end zone ⅴ is meshed with structured grids which extends backwards from the auv stern to the far domain lastly zone ⅵ is filled with unstructured tetrahedral grids the dock is meshed with unstructured grids to solve the flow near the walls including auv hull tail planes propeller four blades and a hub and dock the standard wall function is used ten layer prism mesh is built the average y of the walls is satisfied with 30 y 300 which could be referred to wu et al 2014 details of the grids of each zone are summarized in table 1 in auv docking simulation zone ⅱis rotating with the propeller zonesⅰand ⅲ are moving straight forward with the auv zone ⅳ and ⅴare moving zones the front wall of zone ⅳis stationary the first layer from this wall is split when the auv is moving the last wall of zone ⅴis stationary too whereas the first layer collapses when the auv moves forward the purpose of setting the collapsed layer and the split layer at a distance from the moving boundary is to reduce the time for re meshing because the further the position the larger the mesh size the outer zone ⅵ is a deformed one this meshing topology can obtain a high accuracy for skin friction force owing to good mesh quality in prismatic layers close to the moving boundary since the moving zones include the disturbed areas around the moving boundary and are not deformed the disturbed areas have a high mesh quality and can retain the accuracy of pressure force the re meshing method is a dynamic layer method which improves the mesh quality and re meshing speed since the mhdg method can improve computation accuracy and speed the inertia of the auv was not reduced to speed up the computation in self propulsion running or self propulsion docking the unsteady acceleration process of auv self propulsion motions could be analyzed and useful 3 user defined functions the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans coupled 6dof six degrees of freedom equations of motion bettle et al 2009 and user defined functions udfs were used to solve the physics based simulation of the final docking process three udfs were compiled to call for urans to compute forces 6dof to solve the motion factors and transfer dynamic factors among different zones the udfs were a propeller udf an auv udf and a fluid udf the flow chart for these udfs is shown in fig 4 in the propeller udf the propeller was rotating at an rpm n and affected by the inflow velocity the thrust t was calculated and saved in file f1 roll motion from the propeller s rotation was excluded the thrust t was transferred to the auv udf where the resistance r was calculated with urans equations the velocity v and the distance s of the auv were obtained by solving the 6dof the data of t r v and s was saved in file f2 the auv velocity v was read from f2 to the moving zones zones ⅰand ⅲ the motions of zones ⅰand ⅲ were transferred to zone ⅳ and ⅴ which were re meshed with the dynamic layer method the motions in interfaces were transferred into zone ⅵ which were deformed subsequently the whole domain was re meshed the propeller udf would read f2 to get the velocity v and distance s which would be used to control the rotating speed n the calculation was repeated until the distance s arrived at the aim distance sa the whole process of auv docking ended all the histories of data t t r v s sa and n were recorded and saved 4 experiment validations the grid convergence research has been done in wu et al 2014 for mesh effect on the auv s hydrodynamic coefficients and for mesh effect on the propeller s hydrodynamics in open water tests then the meshing method was used to simulate the propeller rotating in open water the numerical and experimental results for the thrust torque and efficiency of the propeller working in open water were shown in fig 5 it could be seen from fig 5 that the differences in kt kq and η0 between the simulated and experimental results were very small a series of tests of free running of auv appended with the tail planes and the propeller were carried out at the lab ocean basin in sia shenyang institute of automation chinese academy of science in november of 2013 the tests were performed at constant depth and heading the size of the basin is l 25 m b 15 m d 9 m fig 6 showed the auv on the bank a remus like auv named sarv in the basin and in the sea from left to right to avoid collisions between the auv and the basin wall the revolution of the motor was set at a medium speed occasionally the start point was not acceptable requiring the auv to make a turn to avoid the collision a number of 13 tests of auv free running was conducted the experiments recorded the motor rotation speed the auv velocity auv heading and its position from the analysis of the heading and position data five experiments with less heading change were selected for validation for the simulation of auv free running the auv velocity history in free running recorded in the simulation referred to henceforth as the cfd at the same rotating speed was compared with the five tests named exp1 exp2 exp3 exp4 and exp5 respectively shown in fig 7 each test recorded velocity per 0 5 s while the cfd calculated the velocity per time step time for 1 degree of propeller rotating therefore in order to make a good comparison the negative initial velocity in each test has been deleted and the first positive velocity in tests was kept since the cfd velocity started from 0 then each positive velocity in the tests will be passed through in the cfd owing to the effect of the basin wall the maximum time for free running in the experiment that is whilst avoiding collision is nearly 12 s however the time in simulation could be longer which is shown to be approximately 14 s the velocity before 12 s is compared the velocity in exp1 agreed well with the simulation at lower velocities and is a little higher than the simulation at a medium velocity the velocity of exp2 agreed well with the cfd except for two scatter points which may owe to inaccuracies in the measuring instruments the detailed error of tests compared with the cfd is shown in fig 8 the velocities in experiments agreed well with the cfd results after 5 s where all the errors were less than 10 but in some time parts the error are larger there are a maximum error of 10 at 4 5 s 20 at 1 8 s 30 at 2 s 24 at 1 s 25 at 1 s for exp1 exp2 exp3 exp4 and exp5 respectively the maximum error occurred mostly at the initial time parts which may due to the instrument precision in tests and small velocity value 5 numerical results 5 1 constant rpm docking for the purpose of investigating the effect of the dock on the hydrodynamic performance of the auv a constant rpm docking is first performed in which the auv is propelled to the stationary dock by a constantly rotating propeller the whole length of the docking process is about 2 5 times the auv length which could be longer if not limited by the simulation time the auv has a starting velocity of 0 68 m s the reynolds number was changing as auv s velocity changed the initial reynolds number was 2 149 106 at a constant rpm the auv continued cruising straight along the docking centerline toward the dock the total time for the constant rpm docking was about 6 s the thrust and resistance of the auv vs time are shown in fig 9 and its velocity in fig 10 these two figures demonstrated that the auv had a continuing increase of velocity because the thrust was slightly greater than the resistance before auv entered the entrance of the nozzle the inflow velocity upstream of the propeller was increasing however slightly the thrust was decreasing which agreed with the open water curve in fig 5 the resistance increased smoothly as the velocity increased until the auv arrived at the nozzle s entrance subsequently the resistance increased in oscillation when the auv moved in front of the neck point of b the resistance arrived at its maximum the maximum increment of resistance after the auv entering point a was about 6 7 thereafter there was a slump in resistance when the auv entered the tube part of the dock it meant that the auv had the opposite effect from the dock a pressure force before the neck point b and a suction force after the neck point b which would be depicted more clearly in the flow field later the variation of resistance influenced the velocity which experienced a decrease in acceleration before point b and an increase in acceleration after point b shown in fig 10 since the curvature of the velocity is not obvious the points of a b and c are marked beside the intersection points to indicate the line variation clearly the increment of velocity during the docking time duration of 6 0 s is about 11 5 with an end velocity of 0 76 m s the end velocity should be controlled less than 1 m s which is demanded in engineering to avoid a large collision force suggested in reference robert et al 2008 therefore using this constant rpm docking is accepted to meet the collision demand the flow field between 0 s and 6 s was discussed as follows cross sectional cuts at the plane of y 0 showing the instantaneous axial velocity at six different times t 0 s 1 2 s 2 4 s 3 6 s 4 8 s and 6 0 s during constant rpm docking is shown in fig 11 with the same color map for comparison the far field velocity was v 0 because the auv was cruising in an earth coordinate system the right figures in fig 11 described the entire velocity contour at the cut plane while those on the left showed a zoomed in wake astern the propeller to see the discrepancies more clearly among the six time points in the right figures it is obvious that the wake extends downstream of the propeller the variation of the velocity contour close to the bow is not obvious except after the time when auv entered the dock s entrance t 4 8s and t 6 0s when the auv passed through the nozzle t 4 8s the velocity contours before the auv s bow enlarged and narrowed t 4 8s which meant more water before auv s bow had obtained velocity the velocity contours near the bow was also larger these two differences around auv s bow meant that the auv s resistance was increasing beside there was flow moving out through the holes of the nozzle in the left figures the propeller pushed the water afterwards and the tip vortex pairs generated by the rotating propeller were obvious the strength of propeller wake decreased as the auv velocity was increasing besides a root vortex downstream of the hub was obvious which was chasing the auv and accelerated as auv s velocity accelerated an animation of the auv wake in constant rpm docking is shown in the electronic annex fig 12 showed three dimensional pressure contours in constant rpm docking in which the two low pressure areas were obvious on both the auv s bow and its stern due to the high velocity the high pressure on the blade face and the low pressure on the tail planes were both showed clearly which meant that the propeller acted as a provider of thrust the pressures on the auv and the dock did not change until the auv entered the dock s nozzle a slight increase in t 3 6 s a large increase in t 4 8 s when the auv s bow entered the dock there was an increased pressure distributed around the nozzle the narrower the section the higher the pressure shown in t 4 8 s which meant that the auv passed through the nozzle with difficulty but when auv s bow passed through the nozzle and entered the tube the pressure contours on the nozzle were on the contrary the narrower the section the lower the pressure consequently the nozzle would now push the auv forward since the thrust on the propeller had not changed significantly only one time point t 0s was selected for depicting the pressure contours on the propeller blades as shown in fig 13 5 2 brake docking in auv underwater docking there is a need to slow down the docking velocity to avoid collision as with an airplane braking when landing on the runway a brake process could be used for the final docking the duration of the brake process and how fast the velocity will decrease will be discussed herein the tests of auv braking were conducted at the sia lab basin one of the braking processes was depicted in fig 14 it showed that the braking process took about 40s from the starting velocity of 0 67 m s to the final velocity of 0 06 m s approximately stationary in the first 10 s the velocity decreased rapidly after that the velocity decreased more and more slowly this takes too long to simulate to decrease the simulation time the fast deceleration time in the brake process is selected for simulation in brake docking the propeller stopped rotating at the starting position of the final docking shown in fig 1 the auv had an initial velocity and slowed down with only resistance acting on it the propeller would not produce thrust it produced a resistance r p added to the resistance of the hull r h shown in fig 15 where r t is the sum of r p and r h the two resistances acted on the auv causing its velocity to decrease quickly at the initial time the resistance of the propeller was larger than the hull resistance as velocity decreased the two resistances also decreased though the r p decreased more quickly than r h thereafter r p became smaller than r h r h oscillated a little especially when the auv entered the dock shown in point a b and c there was a slump when the auv entered the neck point b this showed that the nozzle had two opposite effects on the auv when the nozzle was in front of the auv it generated resistance which drew the auv back when the auv passed the nozzle it generated a suction force which could push the auv forward fig 16 showed the velocity histories for brake docking cfd and braking processes in the experiments exp1 exp2 exp3 and exp4 the velocity in the first 6s of brake docking was used for comparison with the tests due to being less affected by the dock before point a the velocity error between cfd and tests in brake process may due to the heading deviation of the tests before each brake process the auv performed a self propulsion motion and cruised for some distance therefore there was a limited range in the sia basin left for the brake process thus the auv had to turn to avoid the collision the larger the heading deviation the larger the velocity decrease the velocity decrease is 38 6 42 1 43 2 and 42 8 related to heading change of 15 19 4 13 3 12 7 shown in fig 17 for exp1 exp2 exp3 and exp4 respectively shown in table 2 why exp1 has less velocity decrease with a larger heading deviation compared to exp3 exp4 because the initial several points in exp1 where the velocity decrease ratio is the largest stayed with the same heading angles which would make velocity decrease less in brake docking the velocity decreased from 0 65 m s to 0 35 m s in nearly 9 s the decrement was about 46 2 the whole distance of the braking process is about 4 3 m nearly 2 5 times the auv s length shown in fig 18 fig 19 showed the velocity contours in brake docking at six time points t 0s 1 4s 3 0s 4 8s 6 8s and 9 1s it was clear to see that the propeller acted as a source of resistance when it stopped rotating there were two velocity areas after the propeller one was close to the propeller with a positive velocity pointing to the direction of the auv docking which acted as a viscous pressure resistance the value was comparatively large and decreasing from the propeller to its downstream the other was farther away from the propeller with a negative velocity which was a vortex flow produced by the rotating propeller at the initial time and left in damping the value is smaller as brake docking continued the velocity of the auv decreased and the positive velocity after the propeller also decreased the velocity close to the auv had three obvious areas the first one before the bow was pointing in the docking direction the second was at the neck area connecting the bow and the middle part pointing to the auv stern the third was the boundary layer flow along the auv surface when the bow entered the dock s nozzle the second area was affected first becoming larger then smaller this showed a variation in the resistance fig 15 fig 20 showed the velocity vectors around the auv stern between constant rpm docking and brake docking at the initial time it could be seen that the rotating propeller appended after the cruising auv would produce two flows one pushing water downstream by the propeller blades the other chasing the auv which is downstream of the hub the main hydrodynamic forces acted by propeller lies on the 0 66r 0 75r area of blades not the tip area but in brake docking the flow after the propeller just chases the cruising auv upstream of the propeller the velocity in constant rpm docking is chasing the auv but its value is less than that in brake docking due to the absorption force produced by the rotating propeller the pressure contours during brake docking were shown in fig 21 since the auv velocity decreased as brake docking continued the auv would not be affected by the dock until it entered the middle of the nozzle shown in t 6 8 s therefore it is safer to dock because the auv could enter the dock in freedom without a large added resistance when it passed through the neck point b a negative pressure acted on the bow thus a suction force acted on the auv which would pull the auv to dock but the magnitude of the suction force was lower than that in constant rpm docking 6 conclusion the physics based simulation of auv underwater docking was investigated in this work by employing the mhdg method combined with urans 6dof and udf using the mhdg method and substituting an ordinary moving mesh method the mesh quality after mesh moving and boundary moving can be retained and re meshing takes less time the physics based simulation was running rapidly which required only 7 14 days on a desktop computer with the following specifications intel r core tm i5 6400 cpu 2 70 ghz 2 70 ghz ram 16 0 gb the numerical results were verified by comparison of open water curves and velocity histories of auv free running between simulations and tests the two docking modes of constant rpm docking and brake docking were simulated and the results were shown as follows in constant rpm docking 1 the effect of the dock on auv hydrodynamic performance was less pronounced except when the auv was passing through the neck point b where there was a contrary effect from the dock the resistance increased and then declined when the auv passed through the neck point this resulted in a decrease in acceleration and an increase in acceleration respectively 2 when the auv bow entered the dock there was an increased pressure distributed around the nozzle the narrower the section the higher the pressure auv passed through the nozzle with difficulty however when the auv bow passed through the nozzle and entered the tube the pressure contours on the nozzle were on the contrary 3 during constant rpm docking the propeller pushed the water afterwards and the tip vortex pairs generated by the rotating propeller were pronounced the strength of the vortex pairs had a damping effect there was a root vortex downstream of hub chasing the auv which increased as the auv velocity was increasing 4 the increment of resistance and velocity during the docking time of 6 0 s was approximately 6 7 and 11 5 respectively in brake docking 1 it showed that the braking process took about 40 s from the starting velocity of 0 67 m s to the final velocity of 0 06 m s in the experiments during the first 10 s the velocity would decrease rapidly 2 the velocity history showed that brake docking would decrease the velocity from 0 65 m s to 0 35 m s in nearly 9 s the decrement was about 46 2 3 the propeller created a force of resistance when it stopped rotating there were two velocity areas after the propeller one was close to the propeller with a positive velocity pointing in the direction of auv docking which acted as a viscous pressure resistance the other was at a distance from the propeller with a negative velocity which was the vortex flow produced by the rotating propeller at the initial time and continuing with a damping effect as the brake docking proceeded the value was smaller 4 the velocity close to the auv resided in three obvious areas the first one was before the bow which was positive pointing in the auv docking direction the second was negative and at the neck area connecting the bow and the middle part pointing to the auv stern the third was the boundary layer flow shown in green along the auv surface 5 the velocity decreased significantly when the auv entered the nozzle therefore the drag and push forces from the nozzle were comparatively less than those in constant rpm docking thus it was safer to dock since the auv could enter the dock in freedom without a large added force it is possible to control the docking velocity effectively at the initial position using the two docking modes discussed above the velocities at the end of point c are acceptable compared with the literature however a more useful and convenient way to control docking velocity which is necessary to avoid collision between the auv and the dock and to have the propeller and tail planes working effectively to overcome unexpected currents is embedding a function of velocity control into udf this will be investigated in the future acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the chinese scholarship council csc the natural

22612,the paper investigates the correlation of capsizing and non capsizing trajectories in an attempt to identify a relevant parameter for capsize probability assessment the probability of capsize of decommissioned french naval ships a frigate and helicopter carrier jeanne d arc have been determined by a monte carlo procedure despite the computation cases are limited to two ships and two sea states data sets generated tend to show in trajectory phase plane a convergence of the envelopes of non capsized trajectories and of capsizing cycles the presumed convergence of the envelopes would indicate a correlation between capsized and non capsized trajectories this suggest a faster and more cost effective probability assessment method is conceivable using a reduced number of computations and set of data compared to monte carlo method statistical analysis of capsizing cycles shows a normal law can approximate properly the roll rates distribution before capsize particularly the roll rate at zero crossing and the roll rate extrema after zero crossing however partial match is obtained between these criteria associated to the probability obtained from monte carlo method and the curve of probability of roll rate exceedance obtained with non capsizing cycles additional computations that widen the scope of ships and sea states are in progress keywords capsize probability monte carlo roll exceedance attraction basin 1 introduction at first order capsize probability gives a precise evaluation of the meteorological risk encompassed by a ship for given loading conditions heading speed and sea state the determination of this probability is of major concern and remains an open problem addressed for a long time in the literature as for example by rainey and thompson 1991 or by falzarano et al 1992 monte carlo method and its derivate give a good evaluation of this probability but the associated computation cost are very large and incompatible with many applications of capsize probability assessment beside probability of roll exceedance can be evaluated rapidly and used to define a global probability of capsize for the all life cycle of the ship unfortunately the correlation between those two approaches is not straightforward as er and iu 1999 or maki 2017 compare capsize probability with a monte carlo method the present paper uses multiple dof numerical simulation of a ship in beam waves instead of analytical results the paper investigates the correlation of capsizing and non capsizing trajectories in the phase plane in an attempt to identify a relevant parameter for capsize probability assessment using statistical methods as those described by leadbetter lindgren and rootzen 2012 2 ship and numerical tools 2 1 the ships the study considers two ships a french frigate designed in the seventies and by now decommissioned and the helicopter carrier jeanne d arc jda that was decommissioned in 2010 data availability and an interest in significantly different stiffness between the ships considered were crucial in the choice of these vessels as study cases the natural roll periods of these ships are 15 8 s and 12 2 s for the frigate and jda respectively 2 2 multi dof computation ship trajectory is simulated with fredyn v14 which is a 6 dof time domain computational code developed by marin in the frame of the crnav the ship evolves in beam sea with frozen yaw and sway spectral sea state is simulated using pierson moskowitz spectrum that combines 80 wave components no wind is taken into account for each simulation the trajectory duration to compute is chosen to be representative of those of a sea state and thus set at 20 000 s numerical time step is set to 0 5 s for all the simulations initial conditions are zero heel and zero roll rate the compliance with these initial conditions while wave excitation starts is achieved using a fredyn feature that steadily increases wave height over a user defined duration set to 20 s in our case the monte carlo procedure described further in this paper requires the generation of distinct wave signals for the same sea state for this purpose each simulation uses the same wave component frequencies with specific distribution of phase shifts randomly generated for each simulation using a seed number that allow the exact replication of each computation beside statistical analysis of roll trajectories requires avoidance of wave train repetition in a given simulation the use of fredyn repetition time feature prevents such repetition within a user defined computed time period which is set to 50000 s in this study the low level of wave signal autocorrelations fig 1 illustrates the absence of obvious correlation within a given sea signal in this study the contradictory needs for capturing large sets of non linear behaviours capsizing behaviour and non capsizing behaviour within the user defined computation time and with a given sea state implied to choose specifically for each ship a strong sea state with a peak period very close to its natural roll period sea states ss1 and ss2 were respectively chosen for the frigate and for jda however both ships are evaluated in both sea states ss1 and ss2 in order to compare ship behaviours and sea state influence see table 1 capsize is arbitrarily defined as the reaching of 90 roll angle and simulation is stopped when it occurs more details on fredyn code can be found in ypma 2012 2 3 1 dof model in still water in the purpose of comparing the phase trajectories obtained from fredyn multi

0 inertia term i x x 0 a 44 linear damping term b 44 1 and quadratic damping term b 44 2 are preliminarily determined by the analysis of a fredyn computation of roll decay in still water righting arm gz is approximated in a polynomial up to order 5 for jda form a 5 φ 5 a 4 φ 3 a 1 φ on the basis of fredyn hydrostatic computations fig 2 3 capsize probability 3 1 capsize probability defined by monte carlo computations capsize probability assessment of a ship in a given sea state by a monte carlo procedure requires a large set of time domain computations therefore in our case for a given sea state with the same initial conditions excepting a variation of the wave generator phase a set of n total 1 000 different simulations is performed for each ship in this study the probability of survival ps t in an observation duration t 20 000 s is given by the ratio of the amount of simulations n t which have not ended in a capsize before the time t 2 p c t 1 p s t 1 n t n t o t a l as shown by belenky and sevastianov 2007 the time evolution of pc follows exponential law which means basically that the longer the ship is exposed the higher the probability of capsize 3 p c 1 e α t the value of α s is determined by a least square method based on the simulation points on fig 3 the probability of capsize has been plotted as a function of time dots represent the values of the probability pc t and the curve is the exponential fit of those points pc the main interest of this formulation is that the probability of capsize is described by only one parameter α s which is also the tangent at t 0 s to the curve similarly it is possible to plot the curve fig 4 versus the number of roll cycles experienced by the ship this representation allows a direct comparison with the roll exceedance probability described hereafter it is to notice that average cycle duration is close to the ship roll period at small angle in calm water 13 75 s for the frigate and 12 2 s for jda as belenky and sevastianov 2007 demonstrates the probability curve as a function of cycle number is more or less a re scaling of the one that is a function of observation duration the scale factor being the mean period hence the tangents of these curves at t 0 s give the probability by cycle or by second with a ratio between α c and α s equal to the mean period with an accuracy better than 2 table 2 lists the results of monte carlo method for the computation cases performed in this study for later development it distinguishes results from the sets of capsizes from up wave side of the ship down wave side and both sides for the frigate the number of capsizes up wave side is too small to consider the case as converged its why the values od αs and αc have not been reported 3 2 probability of roll exceedance for given ship and a sea state the complete set of roll cycles over the 1000 simulations is analysed to determine the probability of exceedance of a roll rate threshold x p ϕ x roll rate extrema of each side are post processed separately and their weight is determined following derbanne et al 2008 fig 5 gives an example of exceedance probability curve for the frigate on sea state 1 this curve gives the probability to exceed a given roll angle during the next wave hence this probability is determined for a duration similar to the next oscillation duration 4 analysis of phase plane trajectories a purpose of this study is to identify on the ship trajectory phase plane a roll or roll rate threshold which exceedance probability accurately approximate exact monte carlo capsize probability keeping in mind that the first probability have a much cheaper computational cost than the second roll cycles are separated in two sets for analysis capsizing cycles and non capsizing cycles this enables characterization of the outer envelope of non capsizing cycles see frigate in ss1 for example in fig 6 and inner envelope of 95 capsizing cycles see frigate in ss2 for example in fig 7 in fig 6 bleus dotes represent the temporal traces off all the non capsizing cycles a part of these traces are simulations that do not capsize the other part is composed of simulations concluded by capsize excluding their last roll cycles on the contrary fig 7 plots the temporal traces of the last roll cycles from the simulations that end in capsize fig 8 and fig 9 compare these envelopes and respective attraction basin for both ships and sea states qualitatively it seems at first sight that there might be a convergence of capsizing and non capsizing envelope to a common zero crossing roll rate ϕ ϕ 0 those lines the two inner and outer envelopes and the attraction basin are separatrix that means boundary that separates initial conditions leading capsizing from initial condition that do not lead to capsizing in absence of external excitation using a separatrix is equivalent to classic definition of stability see chapter 5 1 of belenky and sevastianov 2007 to confirm and support this observation with quantitative matter an analysis of the distribution of ϕ ϕ 0 before capsize sets is conducted and extended to the sets of maximum ϕ observed after the last zero crossing and before capsize table 3 lists the corresponding mean values of ϕ ϕ 0 and ϕ m a x before capsize and fig 10 presents the repartition of roll rate and maximum roll rate prior to capsize the size of capsize set of the frigate on ss2 is not statistically converged as it has only 49 samples however for others it turns out that normal laws determined by least square error minimization method could produce an acceptable approximation of these distributions as illustrated in fig 10 normal law approximate gives a cumulated density associated to the roll rates of interest fig 10 for ϕ ϕ 0 and ϕ m a x it must be underline that the mean value of the distributions seems to be few or not influenced by sea state level due to their different natural roll periods and righting levers different dynamic responses are expected between the frigate and jda the frigate is much less stiff than jda such as 100 of its trajectories end in capsize in ss1 and ss2 contrary to jda that ends up in capsize by 58 7 and 80 2 of the trajectories in ss2 and ss2 respectively for the same reasons the frigate capsizes only on down waves side in ss1 and she experiences only few capsizes on up wave side in ss2 only 5 it comes to the extent that jda gets much energy when rolling down the waves but not enough to capsize consequently as the ship rolls back up the waves this energy converts to high roll rate and produces a large proportion of capsizes on up wave side by 51 2 and 61 3 in ss1 and ss2 respectively as said previously p ϕ x being the probability to exceed x consequently to the next wave computed with non capsizing cycles it is legitimate to attempt locating the ϕ extrema obtained from non capsizing envelope and the mean of maximum roll rates before capsize both associated to monte carlo probability to capsize at the next cycle as shown on fig 11 the location matches in jda case and both ship side in the frigate case the location surprisingly don t match on down wave side that is statistically converged and the good match on up wave side is in all likelihood a coincidence given the poor statistical convergence of this subcase 5 conclusions the probability of capsize of the frigate and jda have been determined by a monte carlo procedure despite the computation cases are limited to two ships and two sea states data sets generated tend to show in trajectory phase plane a convergence of the envelopes of non capsized trajectories and of capsizing cycles the presumed convergence of the envelopes would indicate a correlation between capsized and non capsized computations this suggest a

and non capsizing trajectories envelopes in phase plane to relevant values such as ϕ ϕ 0 and ϕ m a x parameters and to setup a faster and more cost effective probability assessment method compared to monte carlo procedure future work is planned also to improve the methodology by trying to include damping in the attraction basin and to improve the estimation of uncertainty acknowledments the

22613,in order to achieve 5 degrees of freedom dofs movement in an underwater space with only two moving parts a new kind of unmanned underwater vehicle fan wing underwater vehicle fuv is proposed the fuv is driven by two fan wings which are adapted from the fan wings for aircraft the features of the underwater fan wing are analyzed by 2d computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations in order to

the procedure of the fuv design then according to the design procedure a control system and a mechanical structure of the fuv are designed finally a real fuv is manufactured and an underwater test is completed the experiment shows that the real fuv can achieve 5 dofs movement in an underwater space and the results match the design proposes keywords fan wing underwater vehicle fan wing unmanned underwater vehicle underwater thruster 1 introduction unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are useful robots for human to explore the underwater world that is because the uuvs reduce human presence for safety costs or acoustic signature reasons and they increase operational ranges rafael et al 2018 the operability is one of the most important ability for uuvs to move flexibly underwater generally each uuv should have at least 3 moving parts to achieve no less than 5 degrees of freedom dofs movement in a space some kinds of uuvs even have 10 moving parts for unique requirements such as hover capable tanakitkorn et al 2017 the spindle shaped uuvs usually have 6 moving parts including a buoyancy regulation system a forward main thruster and 4 rudders which can achieve only 5 dofs movement in a space even to the underwater gliders which are more efficient they still have 3 irreducible moving parts including a buoyancy regulation system a gravity adjustment system and a rudder to achieve 5 dof movements in a space because some of the moving parts are redundant to achieve a single direction of movement it is difficult to build and solve a precise mathematical dynamic model of the uuvs more importantly some effects of the moving parts have to cancel each other out in order to achieve a specific dof movement which is a waste of energy therefore if a uuv has special moving parts which have less coupling connection between each other or smaller in quantity to achieve similar movement it will be a better choice however it is hard to achieve no less than 5 dofs movement in a space with no more than two moving parts one of the reasons is that the buoyancy regulation system can hardly be replaced by other moving parts apart from buoyancy regulation system few moving parts can achieve vertical movement in entire range of incoming speed the other reason is that rudders can hardly be replaced as well apart from rudders few other moving parts have similar efficiency for uuvs to steer in high forward velocity therefore if a uuv can achieve 5 dofs movement with no more than two moving parts in a space the function of the moving parts must be a combination of buoyancy regulation system rudders and main thruster the fan wing which can generate significant lift and thrust at wide range forward speeds is a good solution to the combination mentioned above the fan wing was firstly used as the main thruster and the lift equipment on the fan wing aircraft and the flying test was completed by british inventor peebles in 1998 as is shown in fig 1 meng et al 2015 the proposed generic fan wing configuration consists of a stationary wing type housing geometry and a rotating cross flow fan the cross flow fan is partly surrounded by the housing and partly opened to the flow the fan wings are simple in structure and easy to control fan wing aircraft have high flight efficiency high load low noise and short take off and landing range meng et al 2015 since 1998 a lot of professors in universities and colleges such as imperial college london kingston university iran university of science and technology nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics and south china university of technology have studied fan wing aircraft meng et al 2015 they used the wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation method to study fan wing aircraft and optimize the shape of fan wing to have a better flying performance seyfang 2012 duddempudi et al 2007 askari and shojaeefard 2009 ahad and grahm 2007 meng and ye 2016 xiangnan 2015 if the fan wing can be adapted for a uuv it is possible that the uuv may achieve 5 dof movements with two moving parts in a space in this paper the way for the adaptation includes the following four steps firstly the sketch of the underwater fan wing is adapted from the fan wing for aircraft and the features of the sketch are analyzed by 2d cfd simulations which are the most common method to analyze fan wing duddempudi et al 2007 askari and shojaeefard 2009 xiangnan 2015 gao and lin 2018 sun et al 2015 yamafuji 1975 ma and lian 2009 the mechanical power and acoustic properties of the underwater fan wing are demonstrated secondly the hydrodynamics mathematical model of the fan wing underwater vehicle fuv is built according to the general 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model for uuvs ma and lian 2009 a 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model for fuv are built and the model is simplified into two unique solutions thirdly the design procedure for fuv is planned according to the simplified solutions and the general design procedure for uuvs rafael et al 2018 ma and lian 2009 a design procedure for the fuv are put forward and 3d cfd simulations are used in the design as well finally a control system and a mechanical structure of the fuv are designed according to the design procedure and experiments for the fuv are carried out underwater really 2 underwater features of fan wings at first the features of underwater fan wings should be studies if fan wings have good features underwater they would have the potential of being installed on underwater vehicles a general sketch of a fan wing is put forward as is shown in fig 2 the size of the fan wing is described in detail it is designed to be much smaller than the fan wings used in the air as the density of water is much higher than the air the cross flow fan is installed under the fixed wing so as to generate downward forces by 2d cfd simulations the features of this fan wing sketch can be estimated the unstructured domains of this sketch are shown in fig 3 the size of the domains is 0 7 m 0 4 m which is more than 10 times the size of the cross flow fan and the grids near the fan wing is refined the cross flow fan is installed exactly in the middle of the box the grids around the cross flow fan are set to be rotational ones some boundary layers are added to the profile of the cross flow fan and the fixed wing grid independency studies are conducted with three successive grids and this mesh meet a good balance of computation speed and precision in the calculations the two equation shear stress transport sst turbulence model is used the pressure velocity coupling is calculated using the simplec algorithm second order upwind discretization is considered for the convection terms the right boundary of the box is set as a uniform velocity inlet and the others three boundaries around the box are set as zero relative static pressure outlets where the temperature is set as 300 k under 1 atm by transient cfd simulations the evolution of the fan wing running underwater can be studies taking a general condition zero velocity inlet and 750 rpm rotating speed of the cross flow fan for example the stream lines and pressure cloud contours results at different time steps are worked out as is shown in fig 4 apart from the eccentric vortex in the cross flow fan three transitional vortexes are generated during this process the vortex ① is generated firstly at about 1 5 s and ruptured at the latest at about 2 3 s as the vortex ① ruptured the field around the fan wing starts to stabilize the vortex ② and ③ are generated almost at the same time at about 1 8 s but the vortex ② is ruptured earlier the generation and rupture of vortex ② and ③ marks the flow direction change of the fixed wing s upper surface at about 3 0 s the stream lines around the fan wing are convergent and the pressure around the fan wing is stable therefore the pressure at this time can be used to measure the force on the fan wing by setting the inlet velocity and the rotating speed of the cross flow fan to different values the forces on the fan wing with different velocity inlet and rotating speed can be worked out as is shown in fig 5 in order to distinguish the force contribution on different parts of the fixed wing the fixed wing is split into four parts named as wall1 wall2 wall3 and wall4 as is shown in fig 2 fig 5 a and b describe the relation of the velocity inlet and the forces on the fan wings in x and z direction when the cross flow fan rotates at a constant velocity of 750 rpm as the velocity inlet increases the net force on the fan wing in x direction decreases the cross flow fan and the wall1 are the main compositions as the velocity inlet increases the net force on the fan wing in z direction increases as well the fan wall1 wall3 and wall4 have positive effect to the z direction force while only wall2 has negative effects fig 5 c and d describe the relation of rotating speed of the cross flow fan and the forces on the fan wing in x and z directions when the velocity inlet is set to a constant value of 0 5 knots as the rotating speed of the cross flow fan increases the forces in both x and z direction tend to increase the net force is mainly related to the force on the cross flow fan while the forces on wall2 and wall3 slightly contribute to net force fig 6 shows the relations of power and velocity inlet and rotating speed of the cross flow fan as the velocity inlet increases the power of the fan wing grows straightly as the rotating speed of the cross flow fan increases the power of the fan wing increases like a quadratic curve apart from the forces on the fan wing the noise feature of the fan wing should also be analyzed fig 7 shows the noise contours of the fan wing with zero velocity inlet and 750 rpm rotating speed of the cross flow fan which is calculated by the broadband noise sources model the maximum noise is 2 36 db which is located at the front end of a blade according to the calculation results of the fan wing discussed above the fan wing have a good features on generating forces in x and z directions with low noise therefore the fan wing thruster has good potential for underwater use 3 mathematical models of fuv differently from the aircraft the uuvs don t have to overcome the gravity because of the existence of significant buoyancy from another perspective in order to achieve vertical movement the uuvs need to balance the gravity and buoyancy rather than just to overcome the gravity if the fan wings are installed on sides of a uuv their lift can be used to regulate the balance between the gravity and buoyancy and their thrust can be used to push the uuv forward if two fan wings are symmetrically installed on two sides of a uuv the difference between the lift and thrust generated from the fan wings can be used to adjust attitudes of the uuv therefore it is probably unnecessary to add rudders propellers or buoyancy regulation system for a uuv which has symmetrically been installed fan wings to achieve multi dofs movement this kind of uuv can be defined as the fan wing underwater vehicle fuv fig 8 illustrates a schematic diagram of a kind of fuv the fuv only includes a main body and two symmetrically installed fan wings in the front of the main body a schematic diagram of the symmetrically installed fan wing is shown in fig 9 it includes a fixed wing and a cross flow fan installed under the fixed wing which has the same cross section sketch to the fan wing analyzed in the previous section 3 1 hydrodynamics mathematical model of the fuv in order to analyze the movement of the fuv a 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model is built the orthogonal inertial coordinate system is shown in the fig 8 the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is fixed to the earth and the moving coordinate system o x y z is fixed to the fuv the u v w are velocity components on x y z axis and the p q r are angular velocity components on x y z axis the z direction is directed toward to the earth s center o c x c y c z c o g x g y g z g and o f x f d b 2 z f are the positions of the center of buoyancy b the center of gravity p and the centers of the equivalent force on the fan wings the d b is the diameter of the main body fig 9 indicates that the forces on the fan wing can be simplified into two distribution forces f x f z on the straight line through the o f and the length of the distribution forces are l f according to the theorem of momentum and the moment of momentum theorem and the general 6 dofs hydrodynamics model of uuvs 6 dofs hydrodynamics equations can be carried out as the equation 1 described 1 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q i j x i j v v i v j i x i i v i d b 2 l f d b 2

the equation 1 can be referred to the appendices the assumptions of equation 1 are that a perturbation of surrounding water to the fuv can be ignored b the fuv is of weak maneuver and the viscosity coefficient and inertia coefficient are independent from the movement of fuv c second order and above derivatives of velocities and angular velocities the coupling terms of velocities and angular velocities and its derivative and the high order terms of the velocities and angular velocities can be ignored d the flow effect of the fan wing to the main body can be ignored in equation 1 it is described that all the 1 a 1 c 1 d 1 e and 1 f have the terms about the f x or f z which means that the fan wings can noticeably affect the movement of fuv in 5 dofs including x direction z direction heading pitch and roll the f x is the term in the equation 1 a 1 e and 1 f which means the change of f x can affect the movement of fuv in x direction heading and roll similarly the change of f z can affect the movement of fuv in z direction roll and pitch both f x and f z are demanded by the rotating speed of the cross flow fan n 1 and n 2 therefore this kind of fuv can achieve 5 dof movements with two moving parts in a space it is obvious that all of the 5 dof movements are coupled although 5 dof movements can be achieved by only two moving parts each dof movement cannot be changed independently exactly since there are only two independent single input actuator the fuv only have 2 dofs and the 2 dofs impact the 5 dof movement in a space the main reason why we cannot easily uncouple the 5 dof movement is the existence of gravity and buoyancy this can lead to great difficulties in design and control of the fuv however if we take two unique moving conditions of the fuv into consideration there will be ways to solve this problem 3 2 ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition in straight line cruise condition if we don t consider the effects of velocities and angular velocities except the u and perturbation of the u it can be an ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition which is equal to the following conditions 2 x 11 v u

order to further simplify the equation 1 without changing the physical meaning the following conditions can be added as well y c y g z f 0 when the pith angle θ is equal to θ 0 and the roll angle φ is equal to φ 0 equation 1 can be simplified into equation 2 in the equation 2 the 2 c and 2 e are related when we solve the 2 b 2 c and 2 e a solution of the x f can be solved out as is described in equation 3 by setting values of the positions of o c and o g and the value of gravity and buoyancy the positions of the fan wings can be solved out 3 x f x g p x c b cos θ 0 cos φ 0 z g p z c b sin θ

and f z are evenly distributed the solutions can be described in equation 4 however in equation 4 there are only 3 independent variables n 1 n 2 and u in 4 equations thus the θ 0 and φ 0 are related in this condition 4 f x n 1 u 1 2 2 n 11 v l f 2 l f d b y 11 v x 11 v l f y 11 v p b cos θ 0 sin φ 0 p b sin θ 0 l f 2 x g p x c b cos θ 0 sin φ 0 l f 2 l f d b f x n 2 u 1 2 2 n 11 v l f 2 l f d b y

b thus by discussing the ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition the position of the fan wings the value of n 1 n 2 and u can be solved out if we know the mathematical model of the fan wings the posture angles of the fuv θ 0 and φ 0 can also be solved if one of them are set when we set θ 0 and φ 0 to zero a simpler solution can be solved out as is described in equation 5 5 x f x

u w z 1 i u z 3 i w 2 l f f z n 1 u w u w p b cos θ u w u w b in this condition the θ 0 is set to zero so the depth of the fuv is fixed therefore the u cru is the only cruise velocity for the fuv to achieve depth keeping and the n cru is the only rotating speed of the cross flow fans in this condition if the fuv needs to change the cruise velocity without changing the depth regulating buoyancy is a good choice but if the cruise velocity doesn t have to be changed the depth keeping can still be achieved 3 3 ideal movement in a vertical plane condition another unique condition is that the fuv moves in a vertical plane if the velocities and accelerations except the u w u w can be ignored the condition can be an ideal movement in a vertical plane condition which is equal to this conditions below u 0 u 0 w 0 w 0 v v p q r p q r φ n 1 n 2 0 similar to the previous conditions the following conditions can be added as well y c y g z f 0 when the values of n 1 x f and initial conditions to the equation 1 are set and the mathematical model of the fan wings is built the u w u w and θ may be solved out the fuv can move in a vertical plane if the x f is set to be the x f cru the hydrodynamics mathematical model can be further simplified the equation 1 can be simplified into equations 7 and 8 since the other conditions are complicate such as moving in a horizontal plane it is unnecessary to simplify equation 1 in those conditions 4 design of the fuv as the analysis in the previous section the fuv can achieve ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity and ideal movement in a vertical plane the fuv is controllable in these conditions however since the fuv only have two moving parts as the actuators the fuv is under actuated which means the fuv can not be controllable in some of the conditions underwater therefore the structure and control system should be designed according to the limited conditions the most common condition of the fuv can be chosen as the design condition and the structure of the fuv can be designed apart from the design conditions the solutions of mathematical models of the fuv and its fan wings are necessary as well but the exact model of the fan wing is difficult to build since the flow around the cross flow fan is too complicated for example in equation 5 the f x and f z can hardly be solved since the exact mathematical model of the cross flow fan cannot be built with the existing theories meng et al 2015 however for a given fan wing its performance can be analyzed by experiments or cfd simulations which is similar to the detailed analysis in section 2 the cfd simulations are much more convenient than the experiments so the cfd simulations can be used to solve out the numerical solutions of the fuv 4 1 the procedure of the fuv design the condition of ideal straight line depth keeping cruise with constant velocity can be the design condition the procedure of the fuv design can be referred to the fig 10 by inputting the expected loads m load of the fuv the minimum diameter d min and length l min of main body and the minimum expected cruise velocity u min the design results including u cru n cru x f cru d b l f and l b can be output after the value of x f cru is calculated some other conditions such as an ideal movement in a vertical plane condition can also be analyzed by 3d cfd simulations and by solving the hydrodynamics mathematical model according to the procedure the mechanical structure can be designed however the control system is the main and determined part of the expected loads for the mechanical structure design as a start the control system should be designed and then the design of mechanical structure can be carried out by the procedure 4 2 the control system design of the fuv in the fuv only two moving parts should be driven by motors so the control system only have two output signals to control the motors since the fuv is firstly designed for the feasibility demonstration the fuv only need to be remotely controlled therefore a simple control system of the fuv is designed as is shown in the control system flow chart fig 11 by this control system the manipulator can operate the 2 4g remote controller to manipulate the fuv the operating instructions can be wirelessly sent from the 2 4g remote controller to the 2 4g remote receiver and then the microprogrammed control unit mcu can resolve the signals transformed from the 2 4g remote receiver and control the motor drivers by some embedded control algorithms finally the fan wings can be driven and the entire fuv can be controlled apart from the direct control process a feedback closed loop is added the 3d accelerometer and 3d gyroscope are used to measure the posture of the entire fuv and generate feedback signals those signals are sent to the mcu and can be used to adjust the signals from the 2 4g remote receiver the signals from the 2 4g remote receiver contain a heading and a pitch control signal the heading control signal is used to adjust the rotating speed difference between two motors and the pitch control signal is used to adjust the rotating speed magnitude of two motor by proportion integration differentiation pid method the pitch control signal can be combined with the posture feedback data to make sure that the fuv can move forward without the change of heading angle because the change of heading angle affects the flags of the pid direction control a switch is added in the algorithm between the heading control signal and the pitch control signal the procedure of embedded control algorithms can be described in fig 12 by using this control system the fuv can move underwater with basic function including change of heading pitch and roll angles and x direction and z direction movement the 5 dof movements underwater can be achieved by this system therefore for the fuv design the remote receiver the printed circuit board pcb board of the mcu and 3d accelerometer and 3d gyroscope two motor drivers two motors and a 12 v power should be considered as the main parts of the expected loads and the entire expected loads can be estimated by the equation 9 9 m η m remote receiver m pcb 2 m motor driver 2 m motor m power where the η is the additional load coefficient which is to estimate all the loads of the entire fuv besides the control system can also affect the diameter and the shortest length of the main body the installation of the control system can affect the load distribution of the fuv 4 3 the mechanical structure design of the fuv the mass of the parts of control system the diameter of the main body and the minimum expected cruise velocity can be set as is listed in table 1 considering the strength and feasibility of the structure and the optimization procedure described in section 4 1 the mechanical structure design results can be work out which are listed in table 2 the values of u cru n cru and f z are selected based on 3d cfd simulations results which are illustrated as a curve in fig 13 where the temperature is 300 k under 1 atm in this work about 1 5 10 7 unstructured volume grids are used in 3d cfd simulations grid independency studies are passed by comparing three different densities of grids a two equation shear stress transport sst turbulence model is used for all calculations the pressure velocity coupling is calculated using the simplec algorithm second order upwind discretization is considered for the convection terms a uniform velocity boundary condition is used for simulating the cruise velocity u cru and a frame motion around the cross flow fans is used for simulating the rotation speed n cru the u cru n cru and f z cru are used to solve out the b and x f cru according to the equations 5 and 6 the results in figs 13 and 5 have many differences in value that is because the fig 5 describes the 2d cfd simulation results only for the fan wing which can indicate more flow field details while the effects of flow in the y direction are ignored the fig 13 describes the 3d cfd simulation results for the entire fuv which can indicate the 3 directions flow while some of the flow field details are ignored because of the limitation of grid quantity for analyzing the features of the fan wing the flow details are more important so the 2d cfd simulations are used in section 2 for analyzing the features of the entire fuv all of the 3 directions flows are indispensable so the 3d cfd are used for the fuv design after that the mechanical structure can be obtained as is shown in fig 14 the velocity flows around this structure of the cruise condition are shown in fig 15 according to the cfd simulations fig 15 a illustrates a velocity flow distribution around a cross section of the fan wing and fig 15 b c and d illustrate velocity flow distributions around cross sections of the fuv in three different directions it is shown that the fan wings can indeed accelerate the flow under the fuv and pump the flow backward with only a little flow dispersed to the side the main body affect the flow out of the fan wing but the effect is only limited to the flow around the body therefore the assumptions of equation 1 are justifiable and the analyses in the section 2 are meaningful 5 experiment according to the design results a real fuv can be manufactured as is shown in fig 16 in order to avoid underwater attenuation of electromagnetic signals the 2 4g remote receiver is encased in a box which can float on the surface of the water the float box is connected with the main body by wires and the wires can go through the tail hole to connect with the control system in the sealing tank since the actual mass of the real fuv is 1 45 kg with 13 1 error which is higher than the m in design some buoyancy materials are bunched under the main body to balance the gravity the fuv is tested in a 0 8 m depth artificial fresh water pool where the temperature is 300 k under 1 atm as is shown in figs 17 20 floating on the surface fig 17 moving straightly in x direction fig 18 heading and roll change fig 19 and z direction movements with pitch change fig 20 are achieved underwater therefore the fuv can achieve 5 dof movements in an underwater space what s more the performance parameters of the fuv working underwater are also measured the u cru is about 1 15 knots in this condition which is close to the u cru in design with 13 error and the minimum turning radius is about 0 45 m which is only 86 of l b with a 2200 mah 12 v power supply the fuv can work for more than 1 5 h continuously 6 conclusion in this paper a new kind of underwater vehicle fan wing underwater vehicle is designed and tested underwater the fuv can achieve 5 dofs movement in an underwater space which matches the physical meaning of 6 dofs hydrodynamics mathematical model described in equation 1 the value of estimate load mass and cruise velocity is close to the actual test value with an error of about 13 so the procedure of the fuv design is feasible and the mathematical model using in the design procedure is effective on the other hand this fuv is only designed to prove the possibility of fan wings using underwater the equipment of the experiment is too simple to measure the fuv in detail and the mathematical model is too general to indicate all the factors thus there will be much more works to be done in order to build a better mathematical model and improve and apply this new kind of underwater vehicle in the future funding chinese academy of sciences country china grant id gqrc 19 16

22613,in order to achieve 5 degrees of freedom dofs movement in an underwater space with only two moving parts a new kind of unmanned underwater vehicle fan wing underwater vehicle fuv is proposed the fuv is driven by two fan wings which are adapted from the fan wings for aircraft the features of the underwater fan wing are analyzed by 2d computational fluid dynamic cfd simulations in order to analyze the movement of the fuv a 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model is built the model is simplified for analyzing two kinds of common conditions movements according to the simplified model of the ideal straight line depth keeping cruise with constant velocity condition a general procedure to design the fuv is put forward some 3d cfd simulations are added to solve the mathematical model in the procedure of the fuv design then according to the design procedure a control system and a mechanical structure of the fuv are designed finally a real fuv is manufactured and an underwater test is completed the experiment shows that the real fuv can achieve 5 dofs movement in an underwater space and the results match the design proposes keywords fan wing underwater vehicle fan wing unmanned underwater vehicle underwater thruster 1 introduction unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are useful robots for human to explore the underwater world that is because the uuvs reduce human presence for safety costs or acoustic signature reasons and they increase operational ranges rafael et al 2018 the operability is one of the most important ability for uuvs to move flexibly underwater generally each uuv should have at least 3 moving parts to achieve no less than 5 degrees of freedom dofs movement in a space some kinds of uuvs even have 10 moving parts for unique requirements such as hover capable tanakitkorn et al 2017 the spindle shaped uuvs usually have 6 moving parts including a buoyancy regulation system a forward main thruster and 4 rudders which can achieve only 5 dofs movement in a space even to the underwater gliders which are more efficient they still have 3 irreducible moving parts including a buoyancy regulation system a gravity adjustment system and a rudder to achieve 5 dof movements in a space because some of the moving parts are redundant to achieve a single direction of movement it is difficult to build and solve a precise mathematical dynamic model of the uuvs more importantly some effects of the moving parts have to cancel each other out in order to achieve a specific dof movement which is a waste of energy therefore if a uuv has special moving parts which have less coupling connection between each other or smaller in quantity to achieve similar movement it will be a better choice however it is hard to achieve no less than 5 dofs movement in a space with no more than two moving parts one of the reasons is that the buoyancy regulation system can hardly be replaced by other moving parts apart from buoyancy regulation system few moving parts can achieve vertical movement in entire range of incoming speed the other reason is that rudders can hardly be replaced as well apart from rudders few other moving parts have similar efficiency for uuvs to steer in high forward velocity therefore if a uuv can achieve 5 dofs movement with no more than two moving parts in a space the function of the moving parts must be a combination of buoyancy regulation system rudders and main thruster the fan wing which can generate significant lift and thrust at wide range forward speeds is a good solution to the combination mentioned above the fan wing was firstly used as the main thruster and the lift equipment on the fan wing aircraft and the flying test was completed by british inventor peebles in 1998 as is shown in fig 1 meng et al 2015 the proposed generic fan wing configuration consists of a stationary wing type housing geometry and a rotating cross flow fan the cross flow fan is partly surrounded by the housing and partly opened to the flow the fan wings are simple in structure and easy to control fan wing aircraft have high flight efficiency high load low noise and short take off and landing range meng et al 2015 since 1998 a lot of professors in universities and colleges such as imperial college london kingston university iran university of science and technology nanjing university of aeronautics and astronautics and south china university of technology have studied fan wing aircraft meng et al 2015 they used the wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation method to study fan wing aircraft and optimize the shape of fan wing to have a better flying performance seyfang 2012 duddempudi et al 2007 askari and shojaeefard 2009 ahad and grahm 2007 meng and ye 2016 xiangnan 2015 if the fan wing can be adapted for a uuv it is possible that the uuv may achieve 5 dof movements with two moving parts in a space in this paper the way for the adaptation includes the following four steps firstly the sketch of the underwater fan wing is adapted from the fan wing for aircraft and the features of the sketch are analyzed by 2d cfd simulations which are the most common method to analyze fan wing duddempudi et al 2007 askari and shojaeefard 2009 xiangnan 2015 gao and lin 2018 sun et al 2015 yamafuji 1975 ma and lian 2009 the mechanical power and acoustic properties of the underwater fan wing are demonstrated secondly the hydrodynamics mathematical model of the fan wing underwater vehicle fuv is built according to the general 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model for uuvs ma and lian 2009 a 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model for fuv are built and the model is simplified into two unique solutions thirdly the design procedure for fuv is planned according to the simplified solutions and the general design procedure for uuvs rafael et al 2018 ma and lian 2009 a design procedure for the fuv are put forward and 3d cfd simulations are used in the design as well finally a control system and a mechanical structure of the fuv are designed according to the design procedure and experiments for the fuv are carried out underwater really 2 underwater features of fan wings at first the features of underwater fan wings should be studies if fan wings have good features underwater they would have the potential of being installed on underwater vehicles a general sketch of a fan wing is put forward as is shown in fig 2 the size of the fan wing is described in detail it is designed to be much smaller than the fan wings used in the air as the density of water is much higher than the air the cross flow fan is installed under the fixed wing so as to generate downward forces by 2d cfd simulations the features of this fan wing sketch can be estimated the unstructured domains of this sketch are shown in fig 3 the size of the domains is 0 7 m 0 4 m which is more than 10 times the size of the cross flow fan and the grids near the fan wing is refined the cross flow fan is installed exactly in the middle of the box the grids around the cross flow fan are set to be rotational ones some boundary layers are added to the profile of the cross flow fan and the fixed wing grid independency studies are conducted with three successive grids and this mesh meet a good balance of computation speed and precision in the calculations the two equation shear stress transport sst turbulence model is used the pressure velocity coupling is calculated using the simplec algorithm second order upwind discretization is considered for the convection terms the right boundary of the box is set as a uniform velocity inlet and the others three boundaries around the box are set as zero relative static pressure outlets where the temperature is set as 300 k under 1 atm by transient cfd simulations the evolution of the fan wing running underwater can be studies taking a general condition zero velocity inlet and 750 rpm rotating speed of the cross flow fan for example the stream lines and pressure cloud contours results at different time steps are worked out as is shown in fig 4 apart from the eccentric vortex in the cross flow fan three transitional vortexes are generated during this process the vortex ① is generated firstly at about 1 5 s and ruptured at the latest at about 2 3 s as the vortex ① ruptured the field around the fan wing starts to stabilize the vortex ② and ③ are generated almost at the same time at about 1 8 s but the vortex ② is ruptured earlier the generation and rupture of vortex ② and ③ marks the flow direction change of the fixed wing s upper surface at about 3 0 s the stream lines around the fan wing are convergent and the pressure around the fan wing is stable therefore the pressure at this time can be used to measure the force on the fan wing by setting the inlet velocity and the rotating speed of the cross flow fan to different values the forces on the fan wing with different velocity inlet and rotating speed can be worked out as is shown in fig 5 in order to distinguish the force contribution on different parts of the fixed wing the fixed wing is split into four parts named as wall1 wall2 wall3 and wall4 as is shown in fig 2 fig 5 a and b describe the relation of the velocity inlet and the forces on the fan wings in x and z direction when the cross flow fan rotates at a constant velocity of 750 rpm as the velocity inlet increases the net force on the fan wing in x direction decreases the cross flow fan and the wall1 are the main compositions as the velocity inlet increases the net force on the fan wing in z direction increases as well the fan wall1 wall3 and wall4 have positive effect to the z direction force while only wall2 has negative effects fig 5 c and d describe the relation of rotating speed of the cross flow fan and the forces on the fan wing in x and z directions when the velocity inlet is set to a constant value of 0 5 knots as the rotating speed of the cross flow fan increases the forces in both x and z direction tend to increase the net force is mainly related to the force on the cross flow fan while the forces on wall2 and wall3 slightly contribute to net force fig 6 shows the relations of power and velocity inlet and rotating speed of the cross flow fan as the velocity inlet increases the power of the fan wing grows straightly as the rotating speed of the cross flow fan increases the power of the fan wing increases like a quadratic curve apart from the forces on the fan wing the noise feature of the fan wing should also be analyzed fig 7 shows the noise contours of the fan wing with zero velocity inlet and 750 rpm rotating speed of the cross flow fan which is calculated by the broadband noise sources model the maximum noise is 2 36 db which is located at the front end of a blade according to the calculation results of the fan wing discussed above the fan wing have a good features on generating forces in x and z directions with low noise therefore the fan wing thruster has good potential for underwater use 3 mathematical models of fuv differently from the aircraft the uuvs don t have to overcome the gravity because of the existence of significant buoyancy from another perspective in order to achieve vertical movement the uuvs need to balance the gravity and buoyancy rather than just to overcome the gravity if the fan wings are installed on sides of a uuv their lift can be used to regulate the balance between the gravity and buoyancy and their thrust can be used to push the uuv forward if two fan wings are symmetrically installed on two sides of a uuv the difference between the lift and thrust generated from the fan wings can be used to adjust attitudes of the uuv therefore it is probably unnecessary to add rudders propellers or buoyancy regulation system for a uuv which has symmetrically been installed fan wings to achieve multi dofs movement this kind of uuv can be defined as the fan wing underwater vehicle fuv fig 8 illustrates a schematic diagram of a kind of fuv the fuv only includes a main body and two symmetrically installed fan wings in the front of the main body a schematic diagram of the symmetrically installed fan wing is shown in fig 9 it includes a fixed wing and a cross flow fan installed under the fixed wing which has the same cross section sketch to the fan wing analyzed in the previous section 3 1 hydrodynamics mathematical model of the fuv in order to analyze the movement of the fuv a 6 dof hydrodynamics mathematical model is built the orthogonal inertial coordinate system is shown in the fig 8 the fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 is fixed to the earth and the moving coordinate system o x y z is fixed to the fuv the u v w are velocity components on x y z axis and the p q r are angular velocity components on x y z axis the z direction is directed toward to the earth s center o c x c y c z c o g x g y g z g and o f x f d b 2 z f are the positions of the center of buoyancy b the center of gravity p and the centers of the equivalent force on the fan wings the d b is the diameter of the main body fig 9 indicates that the forces on the fan wing can be simplified into two distribution forces f x f z on the straight line through the o f and the length of the distribution forces are l f according to the theorem of momentum and the moment of momentum theorem and the general 6 dofs hydrodynamics model of uuvs 6 dofs hydrodynamics equations can be carried out as the equation 1 described 1 m u v r w q x g q 2 r 2 y g p q r z g p r q i j x i j v v i v j i x i i v i d b 2 l f d b 2

the equation 1 can be referred to the appendices the assumptions of equation 1 are that a perturbation of surrounding water to the fuv can be ignored b the fuv is of weak maneuver and the viscosity coefficient and inertia coefficient are independent from the movement of fuv c second order and above derivatives of velocities and angular velocities the coupling terms of velocities and angular velocities and its derivative and the high order terms of the velocities and angular velocities can be ignored d the flow effect of the fan wing to the main body can be ignored in equation 1 it is described that all the 1 a 1 c 1 d 1 e and 1 f have the terms about the f x or f z which means that the fan wings can noticeably affect the movement of fuv in 5 dofs including x direction z direction heading pitch and roll the f x is the term in the equation 1 a 1 e and 1 f which means the change of f x can affect the movement of fuv in x direction heading and roll similarly the change of f z can affect the movement of fuv in z direction roll and pitch both f x and f z are demanded by the rotating speed of the cross flow fan n 1 and n 2 therefore this kind of fuv can achieve 5 dof movements with two moving parts in a space it is obvious that all of the 5 dof movements are coupled although 5 dof movements can be achieved by only two moving parts each dof movement cannot be changed independently exactly since there are only two independent single input actuator the fuv only have 2 dofs and the 2 dofs impact the 5 dof movement in a space the main reason why we cannot easily uncouple the 5 dof movement is the existence of gravity and buoyancy this can lead to great difficulties in design and control of the fuv however if we take two unique moving conditions of the fuv into consideration there will be ways to solve this problem 3 2 ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition in straight line cruise condition if we don t consider the effects of velocities and angular velocities except the u and perturbation of the u it can be an ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition which is equal to the following conditions 2 x 11 v u

order to further simplify the equation 1 without changing the physical meaning the following conditions can be added as well y c y g z f 0 when the pith angle θ is equal to θ 0 and the roll angle φ is equal to φ 0 equation 1 can be simplified into equation 2 in the equation 2 the 2 c and 2 e are related when we solve the 2 b 2 c and 2 e a solution of the x f can be solved out as is described in equation 3 by setting values of the positions of o c and o g and the value of gravity and buoyancy the positions of the fan wings can be solved out 3 x f x g p x c b cos θ 0 cos φ 0 z g p z c b sin θ

and f z are evenly distributed the solutions can be described in equation 4 however in equation 4 there are only 3 independent variables n 1 n 2 and u in 4 equations thus the θ 0 and φ 0 are related in this condition 4 f x n 1 u 1 2 2 n 11 v l f 2 l f d b y 11 v x 11 v l f y 11 v p b cos θ 0 sin φ 0 p b sin θ 0 l f 2 x g p x c b cos θ 0 sin φ 0 l f 2 l f d b f x n 2 u 1 2 2 n 11 v l f 2 l f d b y

b thus by discussing the ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity condition the position of the fan wings the value of n 1 n 2 and u can be solved out if we know the mathematical model of the fan wings the posture angles of the fuv θ 0 and φ 0 can also be solved if one of them are set when we set θ 0 and φ 0 to zero a simpler solution can be solved out as is described in equation 5 5 x f x

u w z 1 i u z 3 i w 2 l f f z n 1 u w u w p b cos θ u w u w b in this condition the θ 0 is set to zero so the depth of the fuv is fixed therefore the u cru is the only cruise velocity for the fuv to achieve depth keeping and the n cru is the only rotating speed of the cross flow fans in this condition if the fuv needs to change the cruise velocity without changing the depth regulating buoyancy is a good choice but if the cruise velocity doesn t have to be changed the depth keeping can still be achieved 3 3 ideal movement in a vertical plane condition another unique condition is that the fuv moves in a vertical plane if the velocities and accelerations except the u w u w can be ignored the condition can be an ideal movement in a vertical plane condition which is equal to this conditions below u 0 u 0 w 0 w 0 v v p q r p q r φ n 1 n 2 0 similar to the previous conditions the following conditions can be added as well y c y g z f 0 when the values of n 1 x f and initial conditions to the equation 1 are set and the mathematical model of the fan wings is built the u w u w and θ may be solved out the fuv can move in a vertical plane if the x f is set to be the x f cru the hydrodynamics mathematical model can be further simplified the equation 1 can be simplified into equations 7 and 8 since the other conditions are complicate such as moving in a horizontal plane it is unnecessary to simplify equation 1 in those conditions 4 design of the fuv as the analysis in the previous section the fuv can achieve ideal straight line cruise with constant velocity and ideal movement in a vertical plane the fuv is controllable in these conditions however since the fuv only have two moving parts as the actuators the fuv is under actuated which means the fuv can not be controllable in some of the conditions underwater therefore the structure and control system should be designed according to the limited conditions the most common condition of the fuv can be chosen as the design condition and the structure of the fuv can be designed apart from the design conditions the solutions of mathematical models of the fuv and its fan wings are necessary as well but the exact model of the fan wing is difficult to build since the flow around the cross flow fan is too complicated for example in equation 5 the f x and f z can hardly be solved since the exact mathematical model of the cross flow fan cannot be built with the existing theories meng et al 2015 however for a given fan wing its performance can be analyzed by experiments or cfd simulations which is similar to the detailed analysis in section 2 the cfd simulations are much more convenient than the experiments so the cfd simulations can be used to solve out the numerical solutions of the fuv 4 1 the procedure of the fuv design the condition of ideal straight line depth keeping cruise with constant velocity can be the design condition the procedure of the fuv design can be referred to the fig 10 by inputting the expected loads m load of the fuv the minimum diameter d min and length l min of main body and the minimum expected cruise velocity u min the design results including u cru n cru x f cru d b l f and l b can be output after the value of x f cru is calculated some other conditions such as an ideal movement in a vertical plane condition can also be analyzed by 3d cfd simulations and by solving the hydrodynamics mathematical model according to the procedure the mechanical structure can be designed however the control system is the main and determined part of the expected loads for the mechanical structure design as a start the control system should be designed and then the design of mechanical structure can be carried out by the procedure 4 2 the control system design of the fuv in the fuv only two moving parts should be driven by motors so the control system only have two output signals to control the motors since the fuv is firstly designed for the feasibility demonstration the fuv only need to be remotely controlled therefore a simple control system of the fuv is designed as is shown in the control system flow chart fig 11 by this control system the manipulator can operate the 2 4g remote controller to manipulate the fuv the operating instructions can be wirelessly sent from the 2 4g remote controller to the 2 4g remote receiver and then the microprogrammed control unit mcu can resolve the signals transformed from the 2 4g remote receiver and control the motor drivers by some embedded control algorithms finally the fan wings can be driven and the entire fuv can be controlled apart from the direct control process a feedback closed loop is added the 3d accelerometer and 3d gyroscope are used to measure the posture of the entire fuv and generate feedback signals those signals are sent to the mcu and can be used to adjust the signals from the 2 4g remote receiver the signals from the 2 4g remote receiver contain a heading and a pitch control signal the heading control signal is used to adjust the rotating speed difference between two motors and the pitch control signal is used to adjust the rotating speed magnitude of two motor by proportion integration differentiation pid method the pitch control signal can be combined with the posture feedback data to make sure that the fuv can move forward without the change of heading angle because the change of heading angle affects the flags of the pid direction control a switch is added in the algorithm between the heading control signal and the pitch control signal the procedure of embedded control algorithms can be described in fig 12 by using this control system the fuv can move underwater with basic function including change of heading pitch and roll angles and x direction and z direction movement the 5 dof movements underwater can be achieved by this system therefore for the fuv design the remote receiver the printed circuit board pcb board of the mcu and 3d accelerometer and 3d gyroscope two motor drivers two motors and a 12 v power should be considered as the main parts of the expected loads and the entire expected loads can be estimated by the equation 9 9 m η m remote receiver m pcb 2 m motor driver 2 m motor m power where the η is the additional load coefficient which is to estimate all the loads of the entire fuv besides the control system can also affect the diameter and the shortest length of the main body the installation of the control system can affect the load distribution of the fuv 4 3 the mechanical structure design of the fuv the mass of the parts of control system the diameter of the main body and the minimum expected cruise velocity can be set as is listed in table 1 considering the strength and feasibility of the structure and the optimization procedure described in section 4 1 the mechanical structure design results can be work out which are listed in table 2 the values of u cru n cru and f z are selected based on 3d cfd simulations results which are illustrated as a curve in fig 13 where the temperature is 300 k under 1 atm in this work about 1 5 10 7 unstructured volume grids are used in 3d cfd simulations grid independency studies are passed by comparing three different densities of grids a two equation shear stress transport sst turbulence model is used for all calculations the pressure velocity coupling is calculated using the simplec algorithm second order upwind discretization is considered for the convection terms a uniform velocity boundary condition is used for simulating the cruise velocity u cru and a frame motion around the cross flow fans is used for simulating the rotation speed n cru the u cru n cru and f z cru are used to solve out the b and x f cru according to the equations 5 and 6 the results in figs 13 and 5 have many differences in value that is because the fig 5 describes the 2d cfd simulation results only for the fan wing which can indicate more flow field details while the effects of flow in the y direction are ignored the fig 13 describes the 3d cfd simulation results for the entire fuv which can indicate the 3 directions flow while some of the flow field details are ignored because of the limitation of grid quantity for analyzing the features of the fan wing the flow details are more important so the 2d cfd simulations are used in section 2 for analyzing the features of the entire fuv all of the 3 directions flows are indispensable so the 3d cfd are used for the fuv design after that the mechanical structure can be obtained as is shown in fig 14 the velocity flows around this structure of the cruise condition are shown in fig 15 according to the cfd simulations fig 15 a illustrates a velocity flow distribution around a cross section of the fan wing and fig 15 b c and d illustrate velocity flow distributions around cross sections of the fuv in three different directions it is shown that the fan wings can indeed accelerate the flow under the fuv and pump the flow backward with only a little flow dispersed to the side the main body affect the flow out of the fan wing but the effect is only limited to the flow around the body therefore the assumptions of equation 1 are justifiable and the analyses in the section 2 are meaningful 5 experiment according to the design results a real fuv can be manufactured as is shown in fig 16 in order to avoid underwater attenuation of electromagnetic signals the 2 4g remote receiver is encased in a box which can float on the surface of the water the float box is connected with the main body by wires and the wires can go through the tail hole to connect with the control system in the sealing tank since the actual mass of the real fuv is 1 45 kg with 13 1 error which is higher than the m in design some buoyancy materials are bunched under the main body to balance the gravity the fuv is tested in a 0 8 m depth artificial fresh water pool where the temperature is 300 k under 1 atm as is shown in figs 17 20 floating on the surface fig 17 moving straightly in x direction fig 18 heading and roll change fig 19 and z direction movements with pitch change fig 20 are achieved underwater therefore the fuv can achieve 5 dof movements in an underwater space what s more the performance parameters of the fuv working underwater are also measured the u cru is about 1 15 knots in this condition which is close to the u cru in design with 13 error and the minimum turning radius is about 0 45 m which is only 86 of l b with a 2200 mah 12 v power supply the fuv can work for more than 1 5 h continuously 6 conclusion in this paper a new kind of underwater vehicle fan wing underwater vehicle is designed and tested underwater the fuv can achieve 5 dofs movement in an underwater space which matches the physical meaning of 6 dofs hydrodynamics mathematical model described in equation 1 the value of estimate load mass and cruise velocity is close to the actual test value with an error of about 13 so the procedure of the fuv design is feasible and the mathematical model using in the design procedure is effective on the other hand this fuv is only designed to prove the possibility of fan wings using underwater the equipment of the experiment is too simple to measure the fuv in detail and the mathematical model is too general to indicate all the factors thus there will be much more works to be done in order to build a better mathematical model and improve and apply this new kind of underwater vehicle in the future funding chinese academy of sciences country china grant id gqrc 19 16

22614,in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a novel oscillating water column owc breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate is numerically and experimentally investigated a viscous fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt solved by the open source package openfoam is established under laminar flow conditions after comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones the well validated numerical model is further employed to investigate the effects of the length of horizontal bottom plate d the immersion depth of back plate d 2 the water depth h and the wave height h on the reflection c r and transmission c t coefficients dissipation coefficient c d and column confined energy coefficient c e of the breakwater the results show that lengthening the bottom plate can effectively increase the energy dissipation and then lead to lower reflection and transmission coefficients and a smaller draught of the back plate can also increase energy dissipation the water depth has insignificant influence on the hydrodynamic coefficient of long waves but influences the breakwater performance in short waves the variation of wave height mainly contributes to the change of reflection coefficient keywords oscillating water column breakwater transmission coefficient dissipation coefficient column confined energy coefficient experimental and numerical study 1 introduction conventional bottom mounted breakwaters such as rubble mound breakwaters concrete caisson breakwaters are extensively used for coastal protection and shelter of marine structures and facilities against strong wave actions in rough seas however these breakwaters are potentially associated with environmental problems since they may strongly block water exchange and sediment transport within the protected area moreover these breakwaters generally become expensive for deeper waters in order to reduce the construction cost and diminish the impact on the eco environmental system pile supported breakwaters could be an attractive alternative dai et al 2018 this type of breakwater is able to effectively destroy or reflect the wave energy concentrating near the water surface and conveniently assemble wave energy converters wecs for multipurpose applications falcão and henriques 2016 various new types of pile supported breakwaters with distinct shapes and wave attenuation mechanisms have been proposed in the past two decades including box type breakwaters koutandos et al 2005 diamantoulaki et al 2008 vertical plate type barriers isaacson et al 1999 neelamani and vedagiri 2002 suh et al 2006 horizontal plate type breakwaters dong et al 2008 liu et al 2009 koley and sahoo 2017 wave energy converter type breakwaters hong et al 2006 he and huang 2014 etc among these breakwaters vertical plate type barriers have received considerable attention these breakwaters are either made up by a single vertical plate or two vertical plates the hydrodynamic performance of these breakwaters was extensively studied by a number of researchers ursell 1947 and wiegel 1960 analytically studied the hydrodynamic performance of partially immersed single vertical barriers in deep waters based on linear wave diffraction theory it was found that this kind of breakwater is quite effective for short period incoming waves and the relative draught is crucial to the transmission performance later losada et al 1992 investigated the oblique wave diffraction around a rigid vertical thin plate using the matched eigenfunction expansion method in their study not only the progressive waves but also the evanescent waves were accounted for in order to satisfy the overall conservation of energy to further improve the hydrodynamic performance of vertical plate barriers two surface piercing vertical plates barriers were also suggested according to neelamani and gayathri 2006 the hydrodynamic performance of the two plates breakwater is better than the single plate breakwater in terms of the wave damping ability unlike the single vertical plate there exist resonant conditions where the overall transmission and reflection coefficients show extremal values at particular wavelengths for the two vertical plates system the hydrodynamic characteristics of two vertical surface piercing plates has been studied by a number of researchers using analytical numerical or experimental methods approximate solutions based on wide spacing approximation were given by srokosz and evans 1979 and the overall transmission and reflection behaviors matched well with those of experiments by stiassni et al 1986 except at resonant frequencies mciver 1985 and das et al 1997 analytically studied the wave diffraction around twin vertical plates the former adopted the matched eigenfunction expansion method while the latter used the galerkin method recently the same problem was investigated by dong and cho 2016 using both theoretical and experimental methods different from previous studies their attention was paid on the local wave motion between the two plates since this system could also be seen as owc type wave energy converter besides two identical plates system two unequal plates have also been studied by morris 1975 mciver 1985 evans and porter 1997 roy et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for example morris 1975 and evans and porter 1997 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a pair of unequal fixed thin vertical barriers one of which is on the water free surface while the other is completely submerged mciver 1985 examined the wave scattering of normally incident waves by two unequal surface piercing plates in water of finite depth it was found that the zero reflection no longer exists due to the inequality this has also been confirmed by roy et al 2016 who used a one term galerkin approximation method neelamani and vedagiri 2002 and neelamani and gayathri 2006 experimentally examined the wave interaction with twin partially immersed vertical barrier of different draughts the hydrodynamic performance including the wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation coefficients were measured for different structure configurations in both regular and random wave fields recently wang et al 2018 reconsidered this problem for an obliquely incident wave in water of stepped bottom topography using the matched eigenfunction method and a least square method permeable vertical thin plates in the two vertical plates system were also considered such as isaacson et al 1999 and liu and li 2011 the use of slotted vertical barriers can significantly reduce the maximum horizontal force on the barrier in the weather side compared with those for a single barrier although there were many studies on the predictions of the hydrodynamic performance of two surface piercing plates most of them are based on linear water waves theory the nonlinear wave scattering by such a system is relatively rare for general simulations of wave structure interaction problems either viscous numerical wave tanks nwt based on navier stokes ns equations or idealized nwts liu et al 2009 wang et al 2015 based on potential theory can be applied for example liu et al 2009 studied the nonlinear wave scattering by a submerged horizontal plate by establishing an idealized nwt based on boundary integral equations which were solved using boundary element methods the non breaking free surface flow was tracked by using a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach proposed by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 idealized nwts can provide solutions within a relatively short time in a personal computer since it does not require large computation resources however neither viscous effects nor flow separation can be accounted for an idealized nwt these phenomena may be critical for breakwaters modelling since some of the wave energy was dissipated through the mechanism of vortex shedding turbulence generation or wave breaking isaacson et al 1999 neelamani and vedagiri 2002 he and huang 2014 in this regard viscous nwts solved by using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools are preferred in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the present two vertical plates breakwater with the fast development of high performance computing technology in this study openfoam an open source c code is chosen as the tool to simulate the wave structure interaction problems recently a number of researchers have applied openfoam for common problems in coastal and offshore engineering such as morgan et al 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2012 developed a freely available wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam this toolbox is capable of modelling long term wave propagation and wave breaking later chen et al 2014 extended openfoam with new wave generation and absorption modules to deal with wave generation and absorption in order to simulate nonlinear wave interactions with a vertical surface piercing cylinder the numerical results for three regular waves and four focused wave groups were found in good agreement with the experimental data which indicated that openfoam is very capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures though there were many studies on the hydrodynamic performance of the isolated pile supported surface piercing or horizontal plate barriers the research on integrating them together as a new breakwater system is relatively scarce in this study a novel type of breakwater consisting of two surface piercing vertical plates with a horizontal bottom plate shown by fig 1 is proposed which can also be considered as a basic structural form representing an oscillating water column owc device deployed over a submerged horizontal plate the objective of this research is to investigate the hydrodynamic performance including reflection and transmission coefficients of this owc type breakwater via both physical tests and numerical simulations in addition to evaluate the trapped wave energy and energy loss mainly due to vortex shedding of this proposed system the column confined energy and energy dissipation coefficients are analyzed with respect to different structure configurations and wave climates which might provide a useful guidance when the power takeoff pto system is installed at the top of these two surface piercing plates a fully nonlinear viscous nwt based on ns equations with a simple laminar flow model is applied to model the nonlinear wave interactions with the breakwater system the agreement between the numerical and experimental results effectively validates the present numerical model by utilizing the verified numerical model the effects of the length of horizontal bottom plate the draught of back plate the water depth and the wave height on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater system are detailedly explored 2 experiments 2 1 the physical model as shown in fig 1 a the owc type breakwater investigated in the present study consists of two vertical parallel surface piercing plates of different draughts and a dismountable horizontal bottom plate the top of the owc chamber was fully open the breakwater model was made of transparent perspex sheets of 10 mm in thickness the geometrical sketch of the breakwater model is shown in fig 1 b where b denotes the breadth of the owc chamber d 1 the draught of the front plate d 2 the draught of the back plate and d the length of the horizontal bottom plate in this study the draught of the back plate d 2 was set larger than that of the front plate d 1 in order to reduce the wave loads acting on the front plate in the experiments the geometric parameters of the model except d were fixed at b 0 18 m d 1 0 1 m and d 2 0 2 m respectively five lengths of the bottom plate were tested i e d 0 0 09 0 18 0 27 and 0 36 m in which the maximum one d 0 36 m was taken as two times of the breadth of the owc chamber b 0 18 m and the shortest length d 0 m corresponding to the non bottom plate case 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in the two dimensional wave flume located in the ocean experiment hall of zijingang campus at zhejiang university china the dimensions of the wave flume were 35 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 8 m in height as illustrated in fig 2 a 1 5 m long piston type wave maker was installed at the left end of the flume to generate two dimensional regular plane waves at the right end of the wave flume a 3 m long sloping wave absorbing beach was located to diminish the reflection of right going transmitted waves reflection coefficients of this beach were less than 5 for all wave conditions examined in this study the breakwater model was rigidly installed in the middle section of the flume by several holders attached to the flume the upstream front plate of the breakwater model was located at 15 9 m away from the wave maker as shown in fig 2 seven capacitance type wave gauges labeled as g j j 1 7 with a resolution of 0 1 mm each were used to measure the instantaneous surface elevations the locations of the seven wave gauges are given in the above figure the wave gauge g 1 was used to measure the wave height of the incident wave by using the unaffected time series of surface elevation before the reflected waves coming based on the wave records of the three wave gauges g 2 g 4 placed in front of the model the reflected waves can be separated from the incident waves by the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 the two wave gauges g 5 and g 6 were used to measure the surface elevation inside the owc chamber the wave gauge g 7 located in the leeside of the model was used to record the time series of the transmitted waves in all the experiments the data was collected by dj800 data acquisition instrument of tianjin institute of hydro technical and the data sampling rate for the wave gauges was 100 hz the duration of data acquisition was 40 s the experiment was repeated at least three times for each wave condition tested and the average value of the collected data was used for analysis 2 3 test wave conditions the tested wave conditions as well as the geometric parameters of the breakwater model are summarized in table 1 considering the prototype model of this breakwater defined for the field conditions of water depth 10 m and the incident wave period varying from 5 to 13 s the length scale of 1 25 was chosen therefore according to froude similarity the still water depth was fixed at h 0 4 m and the incident wave period t ranged from 1 0 to 2 6 s in the experiments the corresponding wavelength l varied from 1 46 to 4 94 m the wave heights of the incident wave were h i 0 04 and 0 06 m thus the relative water depth defined by h l was in the range of 0 08 0 27 and the wave steepness h i l was in the range of 0 008 0 027 h i 0 04 m or 0 012 0 041 h i 0 06 m 2 4 data analysis on the seaward side of breakwater the surface elevations measured by the three wave gauges g 2 g 4 are a superposition of the right going incident waves and the left going reflected waves using the two point method of goda and suzuki 1976 the reflected waves can be separated from the incident waves after performing the wave separation analysis the reflection coefficient c r can be computed by 1 c r h r h i where h r and h i are the wave heights of the reflected waves and the incident waves respectively after the free surface water waves pass over the breakwater model the surface elevation measured by the wave gauge g 7 is purely the right going transmitted waves similar to the reflection coefficient c r the transmission coefficient c t is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave height h t to the incident one h i as 2 c t h t h i apart from c r and c t an energy dissipation coefficient c d is introduced and calculated by 3 c d 1 c r 2 c t 2 where c d quantifies the proportion of energy loss caused by vortex shedding it can be obtained straightforwardly according to the conservation of wave energy flux for a control volume defined by the two side walls note that the slight effect of the wave reflection from the wave absorbing beach was neglected in the wave energy balance in order to quantify the wave energy confined by the owc chamber an energy coefficient c e is defined as 4 c e h a v e h i where h a v e is the average wave height of waves measured by the two wave gauges g 5 and g 6 3 numerical methods 3 1 governing equations in this study the multiphase interfoam solver of openfoam has been utilized for the present two dimensional two phase air and water flow problem additionally the air water interface i e the free surface is tracked by using the vof volume of fluid technique hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equations of this solver are the reynold averaged ns equations for conservation of mass and momentum of an incompressible fluid which are given respectively by 5 u 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u μ e f f u p g x ρ u μ e f f σ κ α together with the following scalar advection equation of the water volume fraction α in each cell 7 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where x z the two dimensional gradient operator u u x u z the velocity vector in cartesian coordinates x x z the position vector in cartesian coordinates ρ the local density t the time instant p the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure g the gravitational acceleration μ e f f μ ρ ν t u r b the efficient dynamic viscosity μ the local molecular viscosity ν t u r b the local turbulent viscosity σ the surface tension coefficient κ the curvature of the interface u r the relative compression velocity in eq 6 the last term on the right hand side accounts for the surface tension in eq 7 compared with the classical vof method an artificial compression term i e the last term on the left hand side is added in order to restrain the numerical diffusion and maintain the sharpness of free surface weller et al 1998 this term is only active in the vicinity of the interface between the air and water phases rusche 2002 additionally an especially designed scheme named mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution is used so that the solution of α by eq 7 is always bounded between zero and one the local density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ in eq 6 are given as a function of α respectively by 8 ρ α ρ water 1 α ρ air 9 μ α μ water 1 α μ air where ρ water and ρ air denote the density of water and air respectively μ water and μ air are the molecular viscosity of water and air respectively both the water volume fraction α and the air volume fraction 1 α range between zero and one when the cell is empty of water but full of air α is zero when the cell is full of water but empty of air α is one on the interface which is a mixture of the air phase and the water phase α takes intermediate values between zero and one 3 2 boundary conditions to numerically solve the governing equations given by eqs 5 7 proper boundary conditions shall be specified for all boundaries in the computation domain as shown in fig 3 the present nwt is enclosed with the following boundary the inlet wave making boundary outlet structure seabed and atmosphere on the fixed solid boundaries of the structure surface and the seabed the no slip wall condition was used on the atmosphere boundary the pressure outlet boundary condition was applied and the total pressure was set zero these classic boundary conditions were all supplied with openfoam by default however both wave generation and absorption conditions are crucial for the modelling of wave structure interaction in a shorter computation domain thus the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 was used to generate and absorb free surface water waves in the present nwt in this study the first order stokes wave theory was applied on the inlet boundary for the regular wave generation the following free surface elevation η and the associated velocity components u x and u z were prescribed along the inlet boundary as 10 η x t h i 2 cos k x ω t 11 u x x z t g k h i 2 ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω t u z x z t g k h i 2 ω sinh k z h cosh k h cos k x ω t where ω denotes the angular frequency of the incident wave k the wave number and h the still water depth to more realistically model the open sea condition a wave absorption scheme was employed by setting two relaxation zones one in back of the inlet boundary and the other in front of the outlet jacobsen et al 2012 the former relaxation zone was used to prevent the re reflection from the inlet boundary such that the reflected waves from the structure were damped out and only the incident waves were preserved on the other hand the reflection of waves from the outlet boundary were diminished by the relaxation zone located in front of this boundary a more detailed description of the relaxation zones can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 3 3 numerical implementation as mentioned in section 3 1 the interfoam solver supplied with openfoam was employed to simulate the two phase free surface flow to solve the pressure velocity coupling in the unsteady incompressible ns equations the pimple solver algorithm was used in interfoam this algorithm was merged by piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator algorithm and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equation algorithm by using the simple algorithm the pressure on a mesh can be computed from the velocity field by coupling the ns equations with an iterative procedure the piso were applied in the pimple algorithm to rectify the pressure velocity correction a detailed explanation of piso and simple algorithms in applications with vof can be found in jasak 1996 in this study the finite volume method was adopted to conduct numerical discretization in the process of solving the governing equations eqs 5 7 the collocated mesh method developed by rhie and chow 1983 was used to disperse the computed domain into a series of small units so as to store all flow field information in the center of each cell openfoam provides a variety of options for the discretization schemes and interpolation methods for different terms in the governing equations in the present simulations the transient term is interpolated in an implicit euler format the convection term employs gauss limitedlinearv 1 0 schemes the viscous diffusion term uses a linear corrected scheme in addition all remaining terms are using linear interpolation 4 results and discussions 4 1 convergence test as the first step of numerical studies convergence tests are carried out to determine the appropriate mesh for both satisfactory accuracy and low computation cost the wave propagation of regular wave trains in the viscous nwt without bodies is simulated the wave height and wave period of the incident wave are h i 0 06 m and t 1 6 s respectively the total length of the used nwt is 31 m about 11 times the wavelength and the water depth is h 0 45 m with the simulations of the cases with without k ω sst model it was found that the discrepancy between the numerical results using k ω sst model or laminar flow is negligible through comparing the surface elevations in between and outside the column similar findings can be found in penalba et al 2018 the reason behind this is that the portion of the incoming wave energy converted into heat due to turbulence is small which is not visibly reflected in terms of free water surface thus the laminar flow model is adopted in all the following simulations for the concern of computational costs the sensitivities of the numerical model with respect to both the cell number per wavelength in the horizontal direction c p l and the cell number per wave height in the vertical direction c p h are assessed from figs 4 and 5 convergent results of time series of the free surface elevations at four selected horizontal locations i e x 4 12 16 and 20 m are observed when c p l and c p h are 100 and 10 respectively therefore these two values for grid size are fixed in the ensuing simulations in addition to the above verification to the nwt without breakwater the grid sensitiveness around the breakwater is necessary to be checked as well three sets of grids around the breakwater termed as coarse medium and fine are introduced with corresponding minimum aspect ratios of 5 4 and 3 25 near the solid boundary respectively under the excitation of regular waves with period t 1 s and height h 0 04 m in a constant water depth h 0 4 m three numerical wave gauges separately deployed in front of the breakwater in between the column and in back of the breakwater were used to monitor the time series of surface elevations as shown in fig 6 it is found that a good agreement among these three sets of grids is achieved it is noteworthy that a workstation of cpu xeon e5 2680 was employed to run each case with four cores for the coarse mesh it takes 2 h for implementation whereas four and 6 h are required for the medium and fine meshes respectively therefore considering the computation efficiency the medium grid is adopted for the following simulations 4 2 comparison between experimental and numerical results after the convergence tests the present nwt is then extended to simulate the wave interaction with the proposed owc type breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate the sketch of the used nwt is illustrated in fig 3 the nwt setup is the same as the experimental one which is summarized in table 1 both of the front and back plates are 0 01 m in thickness both the lengths of relaxation zones i and ii are 2 times of the wavelength of incident wave the experimental and numerical results of the time series of free surface elevations are plotted in fig 7 at two selected locations i e g 5 in between the column and g 3 in front of the column in these simulations the bottom plate length is fixed at d 0 36 m and the wave height of the incident wave is h 0 04 m two wave periods i e t 1 0 and 2 6 s are considered it can be seen that the numerical results match well with the experimental ones the slight difference may be due to the different wave generation techniques in the nwt the regular wave is generated by specifying the horizontal and vertical velocities on the fixed wave inlet boundary this is different from the wave generation by a piston type wave maker in experiments apart from the free surface elevations the hydrodynamic coefficients including the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d and column confined energy coefficient c e are also compared between simulations and experiments the results for the wave heights of 0 04 and 0 06 m are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively the fitting lines of the obtained scattered numerical results are also presented in these figures five different lengths of the horizontal bottom plate are considered i e d 0 b d 0 5 b d b d 1 5 b and d 2 b good agreement between the numerical and experimental results of the four hydrodynamic coefficients can be found from these two figures the slight discrepancy between the predicted and measured values may be due to the wave making difference between the numerical simulation and the measurement errors moreover the breakwater model in numerical simulations is rigidly fixed however in the experiments the model is held by a carriage which indicates that it is probably not constrained ideally the dynamic response of the model may show its impact on the wave motions thus affecting its hydrodynamic performance overall the numerical model based on the viscous fully nonlinear nwt is able to well predict the hydrodynamic performance of the present breakwater the curves of transmission coefficient c t for all different bottom plate lengths reduce with the increase of wave frequency which indicates that the owc type breakwater is quite effective to block short waves which is well known for vertical plate breakwaters neelamani and vedagiri 2002 dong and cho 2016 by increasing the length of the horizontal bottom plate the transmission coefficient substantially lowers down for longer waves for example for the longest waves corresponding to h l 0 08 c t shows 28 decrease for h i 0 04 m and 25 for h i 0 06 m as d changes from d 0 to d 2 b besides for both the wave heights the breakwater with the bottom plate of d 2 b can provide the widest wave frequency range of h l 0 1 for the transmission coefficient of c r 0 5 this has shown the advantage of introducing the submerged horizontal plate into the two vertical plate breakwater system as mentioned by liu et al 2009 the wave attenuating mechanism of a submerged thin plate is controlling the wave breaking and phase change of the scattered waves over the plate moreover the vortices generated at the edges of the plate may cause some energy dissipation similar to c r and c t the dissipation coefficient c d is also much influenced by the length of the horizontal plate when d changes from d 0 to d b the wave energy dissipation is enhanced while it becomes complicated when d further increases to d 2 b therefore in order to dissipate more wave energy by using the present breakwater the appropriate length of the horizontal bottom plate should be carefully chosen according to the wave climate similar to the reflection coefficient curves there also appears a peak on the curves of the column confined energy coefficient c e by increasing the length of the bottom plate the corresponding peak frequency reduces the peak value of c e shows a 17 increase with d varying from d 0 to d 2 b 4 3 parametric studies having confirmed the capability of predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the present breakwater model in regular waves in the last section the established nwt will be further used to investigate the effects of both the breakwater configuration parameters and the wave climate including the length of the horizontal bottom plate d the draught of the back plate d 2 the water depth h and the wave height of the incident wave h i in the following numerical simulations the breadth of the two vertical plate and the draught of the front plate are fixed at b 0 18 m and d 1 0 1 m respectively other parameters unless otherwise specified are the same as in the nwt used in the last section 4 3 1 effect of the length of the horizontal bottom plate in this subsection the effect of the bottom plate length is investigated the draught of the back plate the water depth and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d 2 d 1 2 h d 1 4 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively nine different bottom plate lengths ranging from d b 0 to 4 are examined in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients c r c t c d and c e fig 10 a shows the reflection coefficients c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency h l for different bottom plate lengths it can be seen that c r firstly increases and then decreases as h l increases in the considered range in other words there exists a peak of the reflection coefficient for each length of the bottom plate d b for the non bottom plate case d b 0 the peak frequency is around h l 0 24 this result of c r is quite different from the analytical results by wang et al 2018 based on the linear water wave theory which gives that c r monotonically increases with h l the difference between them may be attributed to that the energy loss with the vortex shedding in the vicinity of the lower tip of front plate is simply neglected in the analytical study as indicated by fig 10 c the dissipation of wave energy for the non bottom plate case becomes stronger when the wavelength of the incident waves is shorter this reveals the importance of using viscous nwts to model the process of vortex shedding generated near the floating structures this is difficult to simulate using either analytical or potential theory based nwts moreover as lengthening the horizontal bottom plate to d b 4 the reflection coefficient increases with the wave frequency h l to a peak value and then drops to a small value close to zero the appearance of the peak frequency of c r may be due to the resonance phenomenon after placing the horizontal bottom plate corresponding to the well known quarter wavelength resonance in a half open organ pipe rezanejad et al 2013 this present variation trend of c r is similar to the results of patarapanich 1984 in which waves past a solely submerged plate was studied moreover it can be observed that with lengthening the horizontal bottom plate from d b 0 to 4 the peak frequency of c r shows an obvious shift towards the low frequency region with the integration of the horizontal bottom plate into the owc type breakwater the shallow water effect due to this submerged plate tends to affect the reflected waves thus altering the corresponding peak frequency according to patarapanich 1984 the peak frequency is determined by the ratio between the length of the bottom plate and the wavelength therefore the corresponding h l shall drop with the increase of d with other parameters fixed in the present scenario on the other hand further increase of the length of the bottom plate from d b 2 to 4 leads to a significant enhancement of the reflection coefficient again this is associated with the dissipation of wave energy depicted by fig 10 c it is seen that when d b increases to about 2 the wave energy dissipation will no longer be enhanced further lengthening the bottom plate will reduce the wave dissipation but increase the reflected wave energy especially in the long wave regime therefore the appropriate length of the bottom plate should be carefully chosen according to the local wave climate fig 10 b shows the transmission coefficients c t versus h l for different lengths of the horizontal bottom plate d b it reveals that the length of the horizontal bottom plate shows a significant influence on the transmission coefficient when d b is smaller than 2 c t decreases gradually with the increase of h l further increase of d b will lead to fluctuations of c t in short waves when the length of the bottom plate is as long as d b 4 there even appears a peak at h l 0 14 moreover the present breakwater is found very effective for both short and long waves for short waves such as h l 0 27 c t of the present breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate d 0 varies in the range of 0 07 0 16 while c t takes as much as 0 37 of the non bottom plate breakwater this demonstrates the great advantage of the present breakwater over the two vertical plates barriers in short waves for long waves such as h l 0 08 c t monotonically decreases with the increase of d b from 0 to 4 except at d b 0 5 specifically c t decreases from 0 85 to 0 17 when d b increases from 0 to 4 again this shows the significance of the horizontal bottom plate in the present breakwater in long waves in addition the length of the plate has a great impact on the transmission coefficient for long waves but its influence becomes much smaller for the short waves the reduction of transmission coefficient is inseparable from the increase of energy dissipation which is also shown in fig 10 c nonlinear interactions including the near resonant interaction as well as the self and mutual interactions among the waves affected by the submerged plate were found by kojima et al 1991 to induce the generation of higher harmonic components which propagate independently in the lee side and to result in appreciable disintegration of wave form this wave decomposition may produce considerable modification of the spectrum of a transmitted wave train through the nonlinear transfer of energy from primary wave components to higher frequency components and consequently reduce its significant wave period therefore the transmission coefficient of the structure can be reduced by setting a horizontal bottom plate as seen from fig 10 c the dissipation coefficient c d first increases and then decreases as the length of the horizontal bottom plate increases among these lengths of the horizontal plate the maximum value of c d is reached with d b 1 5 or 2 this breakwater configuration works well for both short and long waves when h l is larger than 0 175 c d is above 80 while c d is above 30 when h l is less than 0 175 the high dissipation effect in short waves may be due to the depth condition of the short wave high speed flow and vortex shedding at the end of the vertical plate increases the energy dissipation when the wave interacts with the structure more vortices will be generated around the front plate and horizontal bottom plate resulting in more energy dissipation at the same time water column can be formed inside the structure during wave propagation which can also cause certain wave energy dissipation and this phenomenon may generate wave resonance when the plate length is appropriate for short waves the energy dissipation increases substantially with the installation of the horizontal bottom plate but the length of the plate d seems not affect the energy dissipation too much within the range between d b 0 5 and 4 from fig 10 d only when the length of the horizontal bottom plate is in the range between d b 0 and 3 that its influence on the column confined energy becomes obvious for short waves c e decreases with the increase of d while the variation becomes converse for long waves a further increase of the length of the horizontal bottom plate beyond d b 3 c e does not change significantly which means that the impact of the length of the horizontal plate on the column confined energy is relatively small to reveal the mechanism of wave energy dissipation due to vortex shedding the snapshots of the vorticity distribution pattern for h 0 06 m t 1 1 s and d b 2 is shown in fig 11 for every 1 8 of the wave period as can be seen in this figure there are two regions that high flow vorticities occur the area adjacent to the tip of the bottom plate and the proximity area of the tip of the front lip the formation and shedding of this vorticities might be one of the predominant reasons of energy dissipation in the process of harnessing energy from ocean waves rezanejad et al 2019 therefore tuning the geometrical configuration of the structure for small energy dissipation is crucial to improve the performance of a multipurpose owc device summing up the above findings it is evident that when the dimensionless length of the bottom plate is within the range of 2 d b 2 5 it is profitable to achieve a relatively small reflection coefficient e g c r 0 5 and meanwhile possess violent interior water surface fluctuation for further energy conversion 4 3 2 effect of the draught of the back plate in this subsection we investigate the effect of the draught of back plate on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the breakwater model the length of the horizontal bottom plate the water depth and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d b 2 h d 1 4 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively four different draughts of the back plate i e d 2 d 1 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 are considered fig 12 a shows the reflection coefficients c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency h l for different draughts of the back plate it can be clearly seen that c r increases with the increase of d 2 within the considered range of h l this is simply because the back plate of larger immersion can block more wave energy concentrating near the free surface for short waves the increase of d 2 has a slight effect on the reflection coefficient for instance when the draught of the back plate increases from d 2 d 1 2 5 to 3 5 c r only shows an 8 increase at h l 0 27 in contrast the effect of d 2 on c r in the long wave regimes is more significant as the draught of back plate changes from d 2 d 1 2 to 3 5 the corresponding reflection coefficient increases from 0 42 to 0 94 at h l 0 08 the variation of transmission coefficient c t against h l for different draughts of the back plate is plotted in fig 12 b as expected c t decreases gradually with the increase of d 2 for instance as d 2 d 1 increases from 2 to 3 5 at h l 0 08 long waves c t shows a substantial decrease from 0 625 to 0 25 with the draught of the back plate d 2 d 1 3 the transmission coefficient is less than 0 5 over the whole range of wave frequencies this demonstrates that the present breakwater could work effectively to diminish long waves the dissipation coefficient c d versus h l for different draughts of the back plate is shown in fig 12 c obviously c d decreases with the increase of d 2 with a given h l therefore the energy dissipation of the system is maximum with d 2 d 1 2 among the four draughts of the back plate this is due to that reducing the opening ratio between the front vertical plate and the bottom plate could promote the shedding of vortices in the vicinities of the horizontal plates in fig 12 d the column confined energy coefficient c e versus h l for different draughts of the back plate is presented as for short waves more wave energy is captured within the column with the increase of d 2 d 1 except for d 2 d 1 3 5 there exists a peak in the curves of c e for the other three draughts obviously the draught of the back plate affects the opening ratio of the two vertical plates in the vertical direction which changes the energy collection capability of the plates 4 3 3 effect of the water depth apart from the structure configuration parameters of the breakwater the effect of the water depth h on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater model is also studied the variation of the static water depth refers to the fluctuation of the water level due to sea tides the length of the horizontal bottom plate the draught of the back plate and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d b 2 d 2 d 1 2 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively in this section four values of the relative water depth i e h d 1 4 4 2 4 4 and 4 6 are investigated against the hydrodynamic coefficients fig 13 a shows the reflection coefficient c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency b l for the four different water depths it can be seen that the water depth shows a significant impact on c r this is likely due to the variation of orbital velocities of the water wave particle with different water depths as for long waves the increase of the relative water depth h d 1 leads to slight increase of c r while for short waves the variations of c r are complicated as for the three relative water depths i e h d 1 4 2 4 4 and 4 6 there appears a trough in the curves of c r it is noted that this trough frequency shows a shift towards high frequency region the variation of c r with different relative water depths is mainly affected by the wave energy dissipation associated with vortex shedding this can be clearly seen from fig 13 c variations of the transmission coefficient c t for different relative water depths h d 1 are plotted in fig 13 b different from the reflection coefficient c r the water depth only slightly affects the transmission coefficient for long waves for instance c t for the long wave of b l 0 036 only fluctuates between 0 62 and 0 65 for the four relative water depths this means that the present breakwater can work effectively to damp waves during tides however the water depth shows a substantial impact for short waves when the relative water depth increases from h d 1 4 to 4 6 the corresponding c t decreases from 0 12 to 0 06 at b l 0 122 fig 13 d shows the column confined energy coefficient c e versus b l for the three different water depths it reveals that the wave energy confined in the column is also significantly affected by the relative water depth for wave frequencies except the high frequency region beyond b l 0 11 increasing the relative water depth will lead to the increase of the wave energy confined by the two vertical plates for the shortest waves of b l 0 122 the coefficient c e for h d 1 4 is about 1 2 times of that for h d 1 4 6 4 3 4 effect of the wave height in this subsection the effect of the wave height of the incoming regular wave on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater is investigated with the present fully nonlinear viscous nwt the length of the horizontal bottom plate the draught of the back plate and the water depth are fixed at d b 2 d 2 d 1 2 and h d 1 4 respectively three wave heights i e h i d 1 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are examined in terms of the reflection transmission dissipation and column confined energy coefficients as shown in fig 14 overall the variation trends of these hydrodynamic coefficients for different wave heights are similar to each other except that there appears two extremals in the curve of c e with h i d 1 0 4 as shown in fig 14 d this has also been confirmed by the experimental results shown in fig 8 d moreover it can be seen from fig 14 b that c t remains almost unchanged with the three different wave heights ranging from h i d 1 0 4 to 0 8 the maximum difference of c t between them is within 18 this indicates that the effect of nonlinearity of the incident waves seems insignificant on the transmitted waves which is quite different from the case of non bottom plate where c t reduces significantly with the wave height neelamani and vedagiri 2002 due to the presence of the horizontal bottom plate the present breakwater could work beneficially to block high waves unlike c t the effect of the wave height becomes obvious on the other three hydrodynamic coefficients i e c r c d and c e as shown in fig 14 a c r decreases moderately with the increase of h i d 1 again this is unlike with the case of non bottom plate in which the wave steepness shows insignificant influence on c r neelamani and vedagiri 2002 this indicates that the present breakwater is less prone to reflect high waves however similar to the case of non bottom plate this breakwater is more effective to dissipate energy of high waves as shown by fig 14 c this probably leads to the lower reflection of high waves as indicated by fig 14 a fig 14 d reveals that c e decreases with the increase of the wave height therefore the column of the breakwater is able to contain more wave energy with smaller wave heights overall fig 14 has demonstrated the significance of higher order harmonic waves generated in the present wave structure interaction problem 5 conclusions employing the open source package openfoam and the toolbox waves2foam the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating water column breakwater with horizontal bottom plate was numerically investigated by comparing with the corresponding experimental results the current numerical model was validated in addition the influences of the length of horizontal bottom plate d draught of the back plate d 2 water depth h and wave height h on the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t energy dissipation c d and relative energy between the two vertical plates c e are also discussed numerically therefore the following conclusions are drawn 1 it is feasible to carry out numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic performance of a novel owc breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate through openfoam 2 to some extent an appropriate length of the horizontal bottom plate can effectively improve the efficiency of the wave resistance enhance the energy dissipation and meanwhile possess a strong oscillation between the plates the optimal length found by the present numerical tests is within the range of 2 d b 2 5 3 the draught of back plate also has a great influence on the hydraulic characteristics the energy dissipation is higher at a lower draught by promoting the generation and shedding of eddy current so that both the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient can be kept in a relatively low state 4 the water depth has no great influence on the transmission coefficient of the structure while the reflection coefficient changes substantially with the water depth for short waves 5 both the reflection coefficient and the column confined energy coefficient moderately drop with the increase of wave height in addition the change of wave height has little effect on the transmission coefficient the proposed owc type breakwater in principle can be considered as not only a pile supported breakwater but more importantly a multipurpose marine structure through adding a power takeoff system at the top of two surface piercing plates to form an owc device then the oscillatory air pressure inside the quasi closed chamber will radiate wave energy and further interferes with the incident waves as a result the reflection coefficient and trapped energy might be different from the present breakwater system without pto this study can be a helpful guidance on improving the hydrodynamic performance when an owc device is fitted in the future acknowledgement this

22614,in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics of a novel oscillating water column owc breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate is numerically and experimentally investigated a viscous fully nonlinear numerical wave tank nwt solved by the open source package openfoam is established under laminar flow conditions after comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones the well validated numerical model is further employed to investigate the effects of the length of horizontal bottom plate d the immersion depth of back plate d 2 the water depth h and the wave height h on the reflection c r and transmission c t coefficients dissipation coefficient c d and column confined energy coefficient c e of the breakwater the results show that lengthening the bottom plate can effectively increase the energy dissipation and then lead to lower reflection and transmission coefficients and a smaller draught of the back plate can also increase energy dissipation the water depth has insignificant influence on the hydrodynamic coefficient of long waves but influences the breakwater performance in short waves the variation of wave height mainly contributes to the change of reflection coefficient keywords oscillating water column breakwater transmission coefficient dissipation coefficient column confined energy coefficient experimental and numerical study 1 introduction conventional bottom mounted breakwaters such as rubble mound breakwaters concrete caisson breakwaters are extensively used for coastal protection and shelter of marine structures and facilities against strong wave actions in rough seas however these breakwaters are potentially associated with environmental problems since they may strongly block water exchange and sediment transport within the protected area moreover these breakwaters generally become expensive for deeper waters in order to reduce the construction cost and diminish the impact on the eco environmental system pile supported breakwaters could be an attractive alternative dai et al 2018 this type of breakwater is able to effectively destroy or reflect the wave energy concentrating near the water surface and conveniently assemble wave energy converters wecs for multipurpose applications falcão and henriques 2016 various new types of pile supported breakwaters with distinct shapes and wave attenuation mechanisms have been proposed in the past two decades including box type breakwaters koutandos et al 2005 diamantoulaki et al 2008 vertical plate type barriers isaacson et al 1999 neelamani and vedagiri 2002 suh et al 2006 horizontal plate type breakwaters dong et al 2008 liu et al 2009 koley and sahoo 2017 wave energy converter type breakwaters hong et al 2006 he and huang 2014 etc among these breakwaters vertical plate type barriers have received considerable attention these breakwaters are either made up by a single vertical plate or two vertical plates the hydrodynamic performance of these breakwaters was extensively studied by a number of researchers ursell 1947 and wiegel 1960 analytically studied the hydrodynamic performance of partially immersed single vertical barriers in deep waters based on linear wave diffraction theory it was found that this kind of breakwater is quite effective for short period incoming waves and the relative draught is crucial to the transmission performance later losada et al 1992 investigated the oblique wave diffraction around a rigid vertical thin plate using the matched eigenfunction expansion method in their study not only the progressive waves but also the evanescent waves were accounted for in order to satisfy the overall conservation of energy to further improve the hydrodynamic performance of vertical plate barriers two surface piercing vertical plates barriers were also suggested according to neelamani and gayathri 2006 the hydrodynamic performance of the two plates breakwater is better than the single plate breakwater in terms of the wave damping ability unlike the single vertical plate there exist resonant conditions where the overall transmission and reflection coefficients show extremal values at particular wavelengths for the two vertical plates system the hydrodynamic characteristics of two vertical surface piercing plates has been studied by a number of researchers using analytical numerical or experimental methods approximate solutions based on wide spacing approximation were given by srokosz and evans 1979 and the overall transmission and reflection behaviors matched well with those of experiments by stiassni et al 1986 except at resonant frequencies mciver 1985 and das et al 1997 analytically studied the wave diffraction around twin vertical plates the former adopted the matched eigenfunction expansion method while the latter used the galerkin method recently the same problem was investigated by dong and cho 2016 using both theoretical and experimental methods different from previous studies their attention was paid on the local wave motion between the two plates since this system could also be seen as owc type wave energy converter besides two identical plates system two unequal plates have also been studied by morris 1975 mciver 1985 evans and porter 1997 roy et al 2016 wang et al 2018 for example morris 1975 and evans and porter 1997 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a pair of unequal fixed thin vertical barriers one of which is on the water free surface while the other is completely submerged mciver 1985 examined the wave scattering of normally incident waves by two unequal surface piercing plates in water of finite depth it was found that the zero reflection no longer exists due to the inequality this has also been confirmed by roy et al 2016 who used a one term galerkin approximation method neelamani and vedagiri 2002 and neelamani and gayathri 2006 experimentally examined the wave interaction with twin partially immersed vertical barrier of different draughts the hydrodynamic performance including the wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation coefficients were measured for different structure configurations in both regular and random wave fields recently wang et al 2018 reconsidered this problem for an obliquely incident wave in water of stepped bottom topography using the matched eigenfunction method and a least square method permeable vertical thin plates in the two vertical plates system were also considered such as isaacson et al 1999 and liu and li 2011 the use of slotted vertical barriers can significantly reduce the maximum horizontal force on the barrier in the weather side compared with those for a single barrier although there were many studies on the predictions of the hydrodynamic performance of two surface piercing plates most of them are based on linear water waves theory the nonlinear wave scattering by such a system is relatively rare for general simulations of wave structure interaction problems either viscous numerical wave tanks nwt based on navier stokes ns equations or idealized nwts liu et al 2009 wang et al 2015 based on potential theory can be applied for example liu et al 2009 studied the nonlinear wave scattering by a submerged horizontal plate by establishing an idealized nwt based on boundary integral equations which were solved using boundary element methods the non breaking free surface flow was tracked by using a mixed eulerian lagrangian approach proposed by longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 idealized nwts can provide solutions within a relatively short time in a personal computer since it does not require large computation resources however neither viscous effects nor flow separation can be accounted for an idealized nwt these phenomena may be critical for breakwaters modelling since some of the wave energy was dissipated through the mechanism of vortex shedding turbulence generation or wave breaking isaacson et al 1999 neelamani and vedagiri 2002 he and huang 2014 in this regard viscous nwts solved by using computational fluid dynamics cfd tools are preferred in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the present two vertical plates breakwater with the fast development of high performance computing technology in this study openfoam an open source c code is chosen as the tool to simulate the wave structure interaction problems recently a number of researchers have applied openfoam for common problems in coastal and offshore engineering such as morgan et al 2010 jacobsen et al 2012 chen et al 2014 hu et al 2016 jacobsen et al 2012 developed a freely available wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam this toolbox is capable of modelling long term wave propagation and wave breaking later chen et al 2014 extended openfoam with new wave generation and absorption modules to deal with wave generation and absorption in order to simulate nonlinear wave interactions with a vertical surface piercing cylinder the numerical results for three regular waves and four focused wave groups were found in good agreement with the experimental data which indicated that openfoam is very capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures though there were many studies on the hydrodynamic performance of the isolated pile supported surface piercing or horizontal plate barriers the research on integrating them together as a new breakwater system is relatively scarce in this study a novel type of breakwater consisting of two surface piercing vertical plates with a horizontal bottom plate shown by fig 1 is proposed which can also be considered as a basic structural form representing an oscillating water column owc device deployed over a submerged horizontal plate the objective of this research is to investigate the hydrodynamic performance including reflection and transmission coefficients of this owc type breakwater via both physical tests and numerical simulations in addition to evaluate the trapped wave energy and energy loss mainly due to vortex shedding of this proposed system the column confined energy and energy dissipation coefficients are analyzed with respect to different structure configurations and wave climates which might provide a useful guidance when the power takeoff pto system is installed at the top of these two surface piercing plates a fully nonlinear viscous nwt based on ns equations with a simple laminar flow model is applied to model the nonlinear wave interactions with the breakwater system the agreement between the numerical and experimental results effectively validates the present numerical model by utilizing the verified numerical model the effects of the length of horizontal bottom plate the draught of back plate the water depth and the wave height on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater system are detailedly explored 2 experiments 2 1 the physical model as shown in fig 1 a the owc type breakwater investigated in the present study consists of two vertical parallel surface piercing plates of different draughts and a dismountable horizontal bottom plate the top of the owc chamber was fully open the breakwater model was made of transparent perspex sheets of 10 mm in thickness the geometrical sketch of the breakwater model is shown in fig 1 b where b denotes the breadth of the owc chamber d 1 the draught of the front plate d 2 the draught of the back plate and d the length of the horizontal bottom plate in this study the draught of the back plate d 2 was set larger than that of the front plate d 1 in order to reduce the wave loads acting on the front plate in the experiments the geometric parameters of the model except d were fixed at b 0 18 m d 1 0 1 m and d 2 0 2 m respectively five lengths of the bottom plate were tested i e d 0 0 09 0 18 0 27 and 0 36 m in which the maximum one d 0 36 m was taken as two times of the breadth of the owc chamber b 0 18 m and the shortest length d 0 m corresponding to the non bottom plate case 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in the two dimensional wave flume located in the ocean experiment hall of zijingang campus at zhejiang university china the dimensions of the wave flume were 35 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 8 m in height as illustrated in fig 2 a 1 5 m long piston type wave maker was installed at the left end of the flume to generate two dimensional regular plane waves at the right end of the wave flume a 3 m long sloping wave absorbing beach was located to diminish the reflection of right going transmitted waves reflection coefficients of this beach were less than 5 for all wave conditions examined in this study the breakwater model was rigidly installed in the middle section of the flume by several holders attached to the flume the upstream front plate of the breakwater model was located at 15 9 m away from the wave maker as shown in fig 2 seven capacitance type wave gauges labeled as g j j 1 7 with a resolution of 0 1 mm each were used to measure the instantaneous surface elevations the locations of the seven wave gauges are given in the above figure the wave gauge g 1 was used to measure the wave height of the incident wave by using the unaffected time series of surface elevation before the reflected waves coming based on the wave records of the three wave gauges g 2 g 4 placed in front of the model the reflected waves can be separated from the incident waves by the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 the two wave gauges g 5 and g 6 were used to measure the surface elevation inside the owc chamber the wave gauge g 7 located in the leeside of the model was used to record the time series of the transmitted waves in all the experiments the data was collected by dj800 data acquisition instrument of tianjin institute of hydro technical and the data sampling rate for the wave gauges was 100 hz the duration of data acquisition was 40 s the experiment was repeated at least three times for each wave condition tested and the average value of the collected data was used for analysis 2 3 test wave conditions the tested wave conditions as well as the geometric parameters of the breakwater model are summarized in table 1 considering the prototype model of this breakwater defined for the field conditions of water depth 10 m and the incident wave period varying from 5 to 13 s the length scale of 1 25 was chosen therefore according to froude similarity the still water depth was fixed at h 0 4 m and the incident wave period t ranged from 1 0 to 2 6 s in the experiments the corresponding wavelength l varied from 1 46 to 4 94 m the wave heights of the incident wave were h i 0 04 and 0 06 m thus the relative water depth defined by h l was in the range of 0 08 0 27 and the wave steepness h i l was in the range of 0 008 0 027 h i 0 04 m or 0 012 0 041 h i 0 06 m 2 4 data analysis on the seaward side of breakwater the surface elevations measured by the three wave gauges g 2 g 4 are a superposition of the right going incident waves and the left going reflected waves using the two point method of goda and suzuki 1976 the reflected waves can be separated from the incident waves after performing the wave separation analysis the reflection coefficient c r can be computed by 1 c r h r h i where h r and h i are the wave heights of the reflected waves and the incident waves respectively after the free surface water waves pass over the breakwater model the surface elevation measured by the wave gauge g 7 is purely the right going transmitted waves similar to the reflection coefficient c r the transmission coefficient c t is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave height h t to the incident one h i as 2 c t h t h i apart from c r and c t an energy dissipation coefficient c d is introduced and calculated by 3 c d 1 c r 2 c t 2 where c d quantifies the proportion of energy loss caused by vortex shedding it can be obtained straightforwardly according to the conservation of wave energy flux for a control volume defined by the two side walls note that the slight effect of the wave reflection from the wave absorbing beach was neglected in the wave energy balance in order to quantify the wave energy confined by the owc chamber an energy coefficient c e is defined as 4 c e h a v e h i where h a v e is the average wave height of waves measured by the two wave gauges g 5 and g 6 3 numerical methods 3 1 governing equations in this study the multiphase interfoam solver of openfoam has been utilized for the present two dimensional two phase air and water flow problem additionally the air water interface i e the free surface is tracked by using the vof volume of fluid technique hirt and nichols 1981 the governing equations of this solver are the reynold averaged ns equations for conservation of mass and momentum of an incompressible fluid which are given respectively by 5 u 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u μ e f f u p g x ρ u μ e f f σ κ α together with the following scalar advection equation of the water volume fraction α in each cell 7 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where x z the two dimensional gradient operator u u x u z the velocity vector in cartesian coordinates x x z the position vector in cartesian coordinates ρ the local density t the time instant p the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure g the gravitational acceleration μ e f f μ ρ ν t u r b the efficient dynamic viscosity μ the local molecular viscosity ν t u r b the local turbulent viscosity σ the surface tension coefficient κ the curvature of the interface u r the relative compression velocity in eq 6 the last term on the right hand side accounts for the surface tension in eq 7 compared with the classical vof method an artificial compression term i e the last term on the left hand side is added in order to restrain the numerical diffusion and maintain the sharpness of free surface weller et al 1998 this term is only active in the vicinity of the interface between the air and water phases rusche 2002 additionally an especially designed scheme named mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution is used so that the solution of α by eq 7 is always bounded between zero and one the local density ρ and dynamic viscosity μ in eq 6 are given as a function of α respectively by 8 ρ α ρ water 1 α ρ air 9 μ α μ water 1 α μ air where ρ water and ρ air denote the density of water and air respectively μ water and μ air are the molecular viscosity of water and air respectively both the water volume fraction α and the air volume fraction 1 α range between zero and one when the cell is empty of water but full of air α is zero when the cell is full of water but empty of air α is one on the interface which is a mixture of the air phase and the water phase α takes intermediate values between zero and one 3 2 boundary conditions to numerically solve the governing equations given by eqs 5 7 proper boundary conditions shall be specified for all boundaries in the computation domain as shown in fig 3 the present nwt is enclosed with the following boundary the inlet wave making boundary outlet structure seabed and atmosphere on the fixed solid boundaries of the structure surface and the seabed the no slip wall condition was used on the atmosphere boundary the pressure outlet boundary condition was applied and the total pressure was set zero these classic boundary conditions were all supplied with openfoam by default however both wave generation and absorption conditions are crucial for the modelling of wave structure interaction in a shorter computation domain thus the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 was used to generate and absorb free surface water waves in the present nwt in this study the first order stokes wave theory was applied on the inlet boundary for the regular wave generation the following free surface elevation η and the associated velocity components u x and u z were prescribed along the inlet boundary as 10 η x t h i 2 cos k x ω t 11 u x x z t g k h i 2 ω cosh k z h cosh k h sin k x ω t u z x z t g k h i 2 ω sinh k z h cosh k h cos k x ω t where ω denotes the angular frequency of the incident wave k the wave number and h the still water depth to more realistically model the open sea condition a wave absorption scheme was employed by setting two relaxation zones one in back of the inlet boundary and the other in front of the outlet jacobsen et al 2012 the former relaxation zone was used to prevent the re reflection from the inlet boundary such that the reflected waves from the structure were damped out and only the incident waves were preserved on the other hand the reflection of waves from the outlet boundary were diminished by the relaxation zone located in front of this boundary a more detailed description of the relaxation zones can be found in jacobsen et al 2012 3 3 numerical implementation as mentioned in section 3 1 the interfoam solver supplied with openfoam was employed to simulate the two phase free surface flow to solve the pressure velocity coupling in the unsteady incompressible ns equations the pimple solver algorithm was used in interfoam this algorithm was merged by piso pressure implicit with splitting of operator algorithm and simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equation algorithm by using the simple algorithm the pressure on a mesh can be computed from the velocity field by coupling the ns equations with an iterative procedure the piso were applied in the pimple algorithm to rectify the pressure velocity correction a detailed explanation of piso and simple algorithms in applications with vof can be found in jasak 1996 in this study the finite volume method was adopted to conduct numerical discretization in the process of solving the governing equations eqs 5 7 the collocated mesh method developed by rhie and chow 1983 was used to disperse the computed domain into a series of small units so as to store all flow field information in the center of each cell openfoam provides a variety of options for the discretization schemes and interpolation methods for different terms in the governing equations in the present simulations the transient term is interpolated in an implicit euler format the convection term employs gauss limitedlinearv 1 0 schemes the viscous diffusion term uses a linear corrected scheme in addition all remaining terms are using linear interpolation 4 results and discussions 4 1 convergence test as the first step of numerical studies convergence tests are carried out to determine the appropriate mesh for both satisfactory accuracy and low computation cost the wave propagation of regular wave trains in the viscous nwt without bodies is simulated the wave height and wave period of the incident wave are h i 0 06 m and t 1 6 s respectively the total length of the used nwt is 31 m about 11 times the wavelength and the water depth is h 0 45 m with the simulations of the cases with without k ω sst model it was found that the discrepancy between the numerical results using k ω sst model or laminar flow is negligible through comparing the surface elevations in between and outside the column similar findings can be found in penalba et al 2018 the reason behind this is that the portion of the incoming wave energy converted into heat due to turbulence is small which is not visibly reflected in terms of free water surface thus the laminar flow model is adopted in all the following simulations for the concern of computational costs the sensitivities of the numerical model with respect to both the cell number per wavelength in the horizontal direction c p l and the cell number per wave height in the vertical direction c p h are assessed from figs 4 and 5 convergent results of time series of the free surface elevations at four selected horizontal locations i e x 4 12 16 and 20 m are observed when c p l and c p h are 100 and 10 respectively therefore these two values for grid size are fixed in the ensuing simulations in addition to the above verification to the nwt without breakwater the grid sensitiveness around the breakwater is necessary to be checked as well three sets of grids around the breakwater termed as coarse medium and fine are introduced with corresponding minimum aspect ratios of 5 4 and 3 25 near the solid boundary respectively under the excitation of regular waves with period t 1 s and height h 0 04 m in a constant water depth h 0 4 m three numerical wave gauges separately deployed in front of the breakwater in between the column and in back of the breakwater were used to monitor the time series of surface elevations as shown in fig 6 it is found that a good agreement among these three sets of grids is achieved it is noteworthy that a workstation of cpu xeon e5 2680 was employed to run each case with four cores for the coarse mesh it takes 2 h for implementation whereas four and 6 h are required for the medium and fine meshes respectively therefore considering the computation efficiency the medium grid is adopted for the following simulations 4 2 comparison between experimental and numerical results after the convergence tests the present nwt is then extended to simulate the wave interaction with the proposed owc type breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate the sketch of the used nwt is illustrated in fig 3 the nwt setup is the same as the experimental one which is summarized in table 1 both of the front and back plates are 0 01 m in thickness both the lengths of relaxation zones i and ii are 2 times of the wavelength of incident wave the experimental and numerical results of the time series of free surface elevations are plotted in fig 7 at two selected locations i e g 5 in between the column and g 3 in front of the column in these simulations the bottom plate length is fixed at d 0 36 m and the wave height of the incident wave is h 0 04 m two wave periods i e t 1 0 and 2 6 s are considered it can be seen that the numerical results match well with the experimental ones the slight difference may be due to the different wave generation techniques in the nwt the regular wave is generated by specifying the horizontal and vertical velocities on the fixed wave inlet boundary this is different from the wave generation by a piston type wave maker in experiments apart from the free surface elevations the hydrodynamic coefficients including the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d and column confined energy coefficient c e are also compared between simulations and experiments the results for the wave heights of 0 04 and 0 06 m are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively the fitting lines of the obtained scattered numerical results are also presented in these figures five different lengths of the horizontal bottom plate are considered i e d 0 b d 0 5 b d b d 1 5 b and d 2 b good agreement between the numerical and experimental results of the four hydrodynamic coefficients can be found from these two figures the slight discrepancy between the predicted and measured values may be due to the wave making difference between the numerical simulation and the measurement errors moreover the breakwater model in numerical simulations is rigidly fixed however in the experiments the model is held by a carriage which indicates that it is probably not constrained ideally the dynamic response of the model may show its impact on the wave motions thus affecting its hydrodynamic performance overall the numerical model based on the viscous fully nonlinear nwt is able to well predict the hydrodynamic performance of the present breakwater the curves of transmission coefficient c t for all different bottom plate lengths reduce with the increase of wave frequency which indicates that the owc type breakwater is quite effective to block short waves which is well known for vertical plate breakwaters neelamani and vedagiri 2002 dong and cho 2016 by increasing the length of the horizontal bottom plate the transmission coefficient substantially lowers down for longer waves for example for the longest waves corresponding to h l 0 08 c t shows 28 decrease for h i 0 04 m and 25 for h i 0 06 m as d changes from d 0 to d 2 b besides for both the wave heights the breakwater with the bottom plate of d 2 b can provide the widest wave frequency range of h l 0 1 for the transmission coefficient of c r 0 5 this has shown the advantage of introducing the submerged horizontal plate into the two vertical plate breakwater system as mentioned by liu et al 2009 the wave attenuating mechanism of a submerged thin plate is controlling the wave breaking and phase change of the scattered waves over the plate moreover the vortices generated at the edges of the plate may cause some energy dissipation similar to c r and c t the dissipation coefficient c d is also much influenced by the length of the horizontal plate when d changes from d 0 to d b the wave energy dissipation is enhanced while it becomes complicated when d further increases to d 2 b therefore in order to dissipate more wave energy by using the present breakwater the appropriate length of the horizontal bottom plate should be carefully chosen according to the wave climate similar to the reflection coefficient curves there also appears a peak on the curves of the column confined energy coefficient c e by increasing the length of the bottom plate the corresponding peak frequency reduces the peak value of c e shows a 17 increase with d varying from d 0 to d 2 b 4 3 parametric studies having confirmed the capability of predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the present breakwater model in regular waves in the last section the established nwt will be further used to investigate the effects of both the breakwater configuration parameters and the wave climate including the length of the horizontal bottom plate d the draught of the back plate d 2 the water depth h and the wave height of the incident wave h i in the following numerical simulations the breadth of the two vertical plate and the draught of the front plate are fixed at b 0 18 m and d 1 0 1 m respectively other parameters unless otherwise specified are the same as in the nwt used in the last section 4 3 1 effect of the length of the horizontal bottom plate in this subsection the effect of the bottom plate length is investigated the draught of the back plate the water depth and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d 2 d 1 2 h d 1 4 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively nine different bottom plate lengths ranging from d b 0 to 4 are examined in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients c r c t c d and c e fig 10 a shows the reflection coefficients c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency h l for different bottom plate lengths it can be seen that c r firstly increases and then decreases as h l increases in the considered range in other words there exists a peak of the reflection coefficient for each length of the bottom plate d b for the non bottom plate case d b 0 the peak frequency is around h l 0 24 this result of c r is quite different from the analytical results by wang et al 2018 based on the linear water wave theory which gives that c r monotonically increases with h l the difference between them may be attributed to that the energy loss with the vortex shedding in the vicinity of the lower tip of front plate is simply neglected in the analytical study as indicated by fig 10 c the dissipation of wave energy for the non bottom plate case becomes stronger when the wavelength of the incident waves is shorter this reveals the importance of using viscous nwts to model the process of vortex shedding generated near the floating structures this is difficult to simulate using either analytical or potential theory based nwts moreover as lengthening the horizontal bottom plate to d b 4 the reflection coefficient increases with the wave frequency h l to a peak value and then drops to a small value close to zero the appearance of the peak frequency of c r may be due to the resonance phenomenon after placing the horizontal bottom plate corresponding to the well known quarter wavelength resonance in a half open organ pipe rezanejad et al 2013 this present variation trend of c r is similar to the results of patarapanich 1984 in which waves past a solely submerged plate was studied moreover it can be observed that with lengthening the horizontal bottom plate from d b 0 to 4 the peak frequency of c r shows an obvious shift towards the low frequency region with the integration of the horizontal bottom plate into the owc type breakwater the shallow water effect due to this submerged plate tends to affect the reflected waves thus altering the corresponding peak frequency according to patarapanich 1984 the peak frequency is determined by the ratio between the length of the bottom plate and the wavelength therefore the corresponding h l shall drop with the increase of d with other parameters fixed in the present scenario on the other hand further increase of the length of the bottom plate from d b 2 to 4 leads to a significant enhancement of the reflection coefficient again this is associated with the dissipation of wave energy depicted by fig 10 c it is seen that when d b increases to about 2 the wave energy dissipation will no longer be enhanced further lengthening the bottom plate will reduce the wave dissipation but increase the reflected wave energy especially in the long wave regime therefore the appropriate length of the bottom plate should be carefully chosen according to the local wave climate fig 10 b shows the transmission coefficients c t versus h l for different lengths of the horizontal bottom plate d b it reveals that the length of the horizontal bottom plate shows a significant influence on the transmission coefficient when d b is smaller than 2 c t decreases gradually with the increase of h l further increase of d b will lead to fluctuations of c t in short waves when the length of the bottom plate is as long as d b 4 there even appears a peak at h l 0 14 moreover the present breakwater is found very effective for both short and long waves for short waves such as h l 0 27 c t of the present breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate d 0 varies in the range of 0 07 0 16 while c t takes as much as 0 37 of the non bottom plate breakwater this demonstrates the great advantage of the present breakwater over the two vertical plates barriers in short waves for long waves such as h l 0 08 c t monotonically decreases with the increase of d b from 0 to 4 except at d b 0 5 specifically c t decreases from 0 85 to 0 17 when d b increases from 0 to 4 again this shows the significance of the horizontal bottom plate in the present breakwater in long waves in addition the length of the plate has a great impact on the transmission coefficient for long waves but its influence becomes much smaller for the short waves the reduction of transmission coefficient is inseparable from the increase of energy dissipation which is also shown in fig 10 c nonlinear interactions including the near resonant interaction as well as the self and mutual interactions among the waves affected by the submerged plate were found by kojima et al 1991 to induce the generation of higher harmonic components which propagate independently in the lee side and to result in appreciable disintegration of wave form this wave decomposition may produce considerable modification of the spectrum of a transmitted wave train through the nonlinear transfer of energy from primary wave components to higher frequency components and consequently reduce its significant wave period therefore the transmission coefficient of the structure can be reduced by setting a horizontal bottom plate as seen from fig 10 c the dissipation coefficient c d first increases and then decreases as the length of the horizontal bottom plate increases among these lengths of the horizontal plate the maximum value of c d is reached with d b 1 5 or 2 this breakwater configuration works well for both short and long waves when h l is larger than 0 175 c d is above 80 while c d is above 30 when h l is less than 0 175 the high dissipation effect in short waves may be due to the depth condition of the short wave high speed flow and vortex shedding at the end of the vertical plate increases the energy dissipation when the wave interacts with the structure more vortices will be generated around the front plate and horizontal bottom plate resulting in more energy dissipation at the same time water column can be formed inside the structure during wave propagation which can also cause certain wave energy dissipation and this phenomenon may generate wave resonance when the plate length is appropriate for short waves the energy dissipation increases substantially with the installation of the horizontal bottom plate but the length of the plate d seems not affect the energy dissipation too much within the range between d b 0 5 and 4 from fig 10 d only when the length of the horizontal bottom plate is in the range between d b 0 and 3 that its influence on the column confined energy becomes obvious for short waves c e decreases with the increase of d while the variation becomes converse for long waves a further increase of the length of the horizontal bottom plate beyond d b 3 c e does not change significantly which means that the impact of the length of the horizontal plate on the column confined energy is relatively small to reveal the mechanism of wave energy dissipation due to vortex shedding the snapshots of the vorticity distribution pattern for h 0 06 m t 1 1 s and d b 2 is shown in fig 11 for every 1 8 of the wave period as can be seen in this figure there are two regions that high flow vorticities occur the area adjacent to the tip of the bottom plate and the proximity area of the tip of the front lip the formation and shedding of this vorticities might be one of the predominant reasons of energy dissipation in the process of harnessing energy from ocean waves rezanejad et al 2019 therefore tuning the geometrical configuration of the structure for small energy dissipation is crucial to improve the performance of a multipurpose owc device summing up the above findings it is evident that when the dimensionless length of the bottom plate is within the range of 2 d b 2 5 it is profitable to achieve a relatively small reflection coefficient e g c r 0 5 and meanwhile possess violent interior water surface fluctuation for further energy conversion 4 3 2 effect of the draught of the back plate in this subsection we investigate the effect of the draught of back plate on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the breakwater model the length of the horizontal bottom plate the water depth and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d b 2 h d 1 4 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively four different draughts of the back plate i e d 2 d 1 2 2 5 3 and 3 5 are considered fig 12 a shows the reflection coefficients c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency h l for different draughts of the back plate it can be clearly seen that c r increases with the increase of d 2 within the considered range of h l this is simply because the back plate of larger immersion can block more wave energy concentrating near the free surface for short waves the increase of d 2 has a slight effect on the reflection coefficient for instance when the draught of the back plate increases from d 2 d 1 2 5 to 3 5 c r only shows an 8 increase at h l 0 27 in contrast the effect of d 2 on c r in the long wave regimes is more significant as the draught of back plate changes from d 2 d 1 2 to 3 5 the corresponding reflection coefficient increases from 0 42 to 0 94 at h l 0 08 the variation of transmission coefficient c t against h l for different draughts of the back plate is plotted in fig 12 b as expected c t decreases gradually with the increase of d 2 for instance as d 2 d 1 increases from 2 to 3 5 at h l 0 08 long waves c t shows a substantial decrease from 0 625 to 0 25 with the draught of the back plate d 2 d 1 3 the transmission coefficient is less than 0 5 over the whole range of wave frequencies this demonstrates that the present breakwater could work effectively to diminish long waves the dissipation coefficient c d versus h l for different draughts of the back plate is shown in fig 12 c obviously c d decreases with the increase of d 2 with a given h l therefore the energy dissipation of the system is maximum with d 2 d 1 2 among the four draughts of the back plate this is due to that reducing the opening ratio between the front vertical plate and the bottom plate could promote the shedding of vortices in the vicinities of the horizontal plates in fig 12 d the column confined energy coefficient c e versus h l for different draughts of the back plate is presented as for short waves more wave energy is captured within the column with the increase of d 2 d 1 except for d 2 d 1 3 5 there exists a peak in the curves of c e for the other three draughts obviously the draught of the back plate affects the opening ratio of the two vertical plates in the vertical direction which changes the energy collection capability of the plates 4 3 3 effect of the water depth apart from the structure configuration parameters of the breakwater the effect of the water depth h on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater model is also studied the variation of the static water depth refers to the fluctuation of the water level due to sea tides the length of the horizontal bottom plate the draught of the back plate and the wave height of the incident wave are fixed at d b 2 d 2 d 1 2 and h i d 1 0 4 respectively in this section four values of the relative water depth i e h d 1 4 4 2 4 4 and 4 6 are investigated against the hydrodynamic coefficients fig 13 a shows the reflection coefficient c r versus the dimensionless wave frequency b l for the four different water depths it can be seen that the water depth shows a significant impact on c r this is likely due to the variation of orbital velocities of the water wave particle with different water depths as for long waves the increase of the relative water depth h d 1 leads to slight increase of c r while for short waves the variations of c r are complicated as for the three relative water depths i e h d 1 4 2 4 4 and 4 6 there appears a trough in the curves of c r it is noted that this trough frequency shows a shift towards high frequency region the variation of c r with different relative water depths is mainly affected by the wave energy dissipation associated with vortex shedding this can be clearly seen from fig 13 c variations of the transmission coefficient c t for different relative water depths h d 1 are plotted in fig 13 b different from the reflection coefficient c r the water depth only slightly affects the transmission coefficient for long waves for instance c t for the long wave of b l 0 036 only fluctuates between 0 62 and 0 65 for the four relative water depths this means that the present breakwater can work effectively to damp waves during tides however the water depth shows a substantial impact for short waves when the relative water depth increases from h d 1 4 to 4 6 the corresponding c t decreases from 0 12 to 0 06 at b l 0 122 fig 13 d shows the column confined energy coefficient c e versus b l for the three different water depths it reveals that the wave energy confined in the column is also significantly affected by the relative water depth for wave frequencies except the high frequency region beyond b l 0 11 increasing the relative water depth will lead to the increase of the wave energy confined by the two vertical plates for the shortest waves of b l 0 122 the coefficient c e for h d 1 4 is about 1 2 times of that for h d 1 4 6 4 3 4 effect of the wave height in this subsection the effect of the wave height of the incoming regular wave on the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater is investigated with the present fully nonlinear viscous nwt the length of the horizontal bottom plate the draught of the back plate and the water depth are fixed at d b 2 d 2 d 1 2 and h d 1 4 respectively three wave heights i e h i d 1 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are examined in terms of the reflection transmission dissipation and column confined energy coefficients as shown in fig 14 overall the variation trends of these hydrodynamic coefficients for different wave heights are similar to each other except that there appears two extremals in the curve of c e with h i d 1 0 4 as shown in fig 14 d this has also been confirmed by the experimental results shown in fig 8 d moreover it can be seen from fig 14 b that c t remains almost unchanged with the three different wave heights ranging from h i d 1 0 4 to 0 8 the maximum difference of c t between them is within 18 this indicates that the effect of nonlinearity of the incident waves seems insignificant on the transmitted waves which is quite different from the case of non bottom plate where c t reduces significantly with the wave height neelamani and vedagiri 2002 due to the presence of the horizontal bottom plate the present breakwater could work beneficially to block high waves unlike c t the effect of the wave height becomes obvious on the other three hydrodynamic coefficients i e c r c d and c e as shown in fig 14 a c r decreases moderately with the increase of h i d 1 again this is unlike with the case of non bottom plate in which the wave steepness shows insignificant influence on c r neelamani and vedagiri 2002 this indicates that the present breakwater is less prone to reflect high waves however similar to the case of non bottom plate this breakwater is more effective to dissipate energy of high waves as shown by fig 14 c this probably leads to the lower reflection of high waves as indicated by fig 14 a fig 14 d reveals that c e decreases with the increase of the wave height therefore the column of the breakwater is able to contain more wave energy with smaller wave heights overall fig 14 has demonstrated the significance of higher order harmonic waves generated in the present wave structure interaction problem 5 conclusions employing the open source package openfoam and the toolbox waves2foam the hydrodynamic performance of an oscillating water column breakwater with horizontal bottom plate was numerically investigated by comparing with the corresponding experimental results the current numerical model was validated in addition the influences of the length of horizontal bottom plate d draught of the back plate d 2 water depth h and wave height h on the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t energy dissipation c d and relative energy between the two vertical plates c e are also discussed numerically therefore the following conclusions are drawn 1 it is feasible to carry out numerical simulation of the hydrodynamic performance of a novel owc breakwater with a horizontal bottom plate through openfoam 2 to some extent an appropriate length of the horizontal bottom plate can effectively improve the efficiency of the wave resistance enhance the energy dissipation and meanwhile possess a strong oscillation between the plates the optimal length found by the present numerical tests is within the range of 2 d b 2 5 3 the draught of back plate also has a great influence on the hydraulic characteristics the energy dissipation is higher at a lower draught by promoting the generation and shedding of eddy current so that both the reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient can be kept in a relatively low state 4 the water depth has no great influence on the transmission coefficient of the structure while the reflection coefficient changes substantially with the water depth for short waves 5 both the reflection coefficient and the column confined energy coefficient moderately drop with the increase of wave height in addition the change of wave height has little effect on the transmission coefficient the proposed owc type breakwater in principle can be considered as not only a pile supported breakwater but more importantly a multipurpose marine structure through adding a power takeoff system at the top of two surface piercing plates to form an owc device then the oscillatory air pressure inside the quasi closed chamber will radiate wave energy and further interferes with the incident waves as a result the reflection coefficient and trapped energy might be different from the present breakwater system without pto this study can be a helpful guidance on improving the hydrodynamic performance when an owc device is fitted in the future acknowledgement this
