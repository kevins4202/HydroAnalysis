14535,the foreseeable increase of bioethanol production by distilleries will inevitably lead to an important increase in production of the associated effluent namely vinasse due to its high pollution load characterized by high chemical oxygen demand high salt content and heavy dark color the depollution of this effluent is mandatory before release into nature in this work we reviewed the literature on the main physicochemical and biological treatments of sugarcane vinasse and emphasised on the technological valuation of vinasse that allows to shift the status of the effluent from waste to valuable resource the membrane systems seem to offer the best depollution option but they are subjected to strong technical limitations several alternative processes have been proposed but they generally fail to treat the entire organic load of waste when used in stand alone technology while generating higher investment costs in the treatment process the biological processes turn out to be particularly promising as they are able to produce interesting metabolites from living cells among them production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is by far the most developed and economically viable process for treatment of vinasse however a few works also using vinasse as a growth medium have been published on development of innovative technics to produce single cell products such as lipids proteins organic acids alcohols or enzymes in the medium term technologies to produce third generation biodiesel are developing to complement and compete with fuels derived from petroleum finally the development of hydrogen production processes from vinasse is emerging thus preparing us for a long term decarbonised economy keywords distillery effluent waste management pollution biotechnological treatments agricultural amendment microbiological processes bioenergy 1 introduction the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with biofuels is generating growing interest in a transition to a more friendly economy bioethanol offers numerous advantages for this use the fuel can be produced worldwide using a large variety of feedstock including sugar beets sugarcane molasses corn rice dairy product or cellulosic material 1 it is also considered renewable thanks to its biological origin finally its environmental impact is lower than fossil gasoline 2 as such bioethanol production is expected to keep growing for the next decade to reach 134 billion liters in 2024 3 with biggest producers expected to be united states brazil european union and china fig 1 vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw distillery stillage or distillery slop is an aqueous waste generated by the distillation of alcoholic must during the ethanol production process fig 2 4 6 the sugarcane ethanol industry generally releases on average 156 l of stillage and 250 kg of bagasse per ton of sugarcane and produced 12 l of alcohol and 94 kg of sugar 7 thus representing 13 l of stillage per liter of alcohol produced the production of this effluent is expected to rise with the production of ethanol and a perspective of 1742 billion liters produced in 2024 is expected based on this ratio vinasse is an acidic stream ph 3 5 5 high in organic load as represented by high chemical oxygen demand cod up to 140 g l with a dark brown color because of the presence of melanoidins 8 and an unpleasant odour it contains nutrients such as nitrogen up to 4 2 g l phosphorus up to 3 0 g l or potassium up to 17 5 g l as shown in table 1 the characteristics of the vinasse depends on the raw material used the first management system for this effluent was the discharge in water bodies the impact of this practice was assessed by histopathology of liver in tilapia 9 fishes were exposed to different dilutions of stillage from 1 to 10 in laboratory bioassays the vinasse treated fishes exhibited severe tissue disorganization depending on the concentration applied leading to the conclusion that vinasse has a dose dependent toxic and cytotoxic potential in water bodies when it is spread into the nature the effluent can cause proliferation of microorganisms and consumption of the dissolved oxygen in water leading to death of aquatic animals and plants and contaminating sources of potable water 10 12 these environmental problems lead several countries to adopt regulations about effluent discharge aiming at reducing the environmental impact and minimizing the direct contact of raw vinasse with water bodies the main use of vinasse is as a fertilizer through irrigation of fields 7 13 the risks of fertilization are principally associated with the build up of nutrients in the soil including soil salinization and over fertilization leading to salt leaching to groundwater increasing soil instability or eutrophication of water bodies other impacts on the ground include contamination with toxic metals such as zinc copper or barium amongst other metals quantified in table 2 permanent soil and water resources acidification interference in the process of photosynthesis due to the high color and turbidity of stillage or clogging of soil pores by organic overload thus decreasing oxygen transfert and microbial activity as well as stimulating the generation of unpleasant odors due to the anaerobic degradation of organic loads 14 the application of vinasse in the field also has negative effect on invertebrate present in the soil avoidance behavior was observed on earthworms eisenia andrei and collembolans folsomia candida and lower reproduction of these two species along with enchytraeids enchytraeus crypticus and mites hypoaspis aculeifer was highlighted which was attributed to the high salt content and especially the high potassium concentrations 15 ethanol is regarded as an alternative to fossil fuels thanks to its lower greenhouse gas emission compared to gasoline 2 effluents count for a part of the emissions of the ethanol sector the vinasse management system impact the overall greenhouse gases emissions at the field application level 16 17 and during its storage and transportation before application to the field 13 18 transportation of vinasse in open channel and disposal in the field as a fertilizer is the main method used in brazil for discharge of the spent wash ch4 and n2o emissions all along the disposal system were followed because of their potential as greenhouse gases and it was found that ch4 count for 98 of the total emissions during transport but was consumed once applied to the soil however the n2o emissions occurred mainly after irrigation of the field vinasse because of its high organic salt and heavy metal contents and its large production volume represents a great challenge to natural environment from water bodies to atmospheric greenhouse gases through soil contamination consequently depolluting processes should be applied before discharge in the environment the scope of this work was to assess the advances on the knowledge on treatment and usage of vinasse reported in the literature in the last 20 years in a first part treatments and outcomes applied to vinasse were reviewed encompassing physicochemical and biological treatments then the question of the status of vinasse as a waste or a resource is addressed through examples of its usage as agricultural amendment substrate for biomass and valuable molecule production and as raw material for energetic purposes 2 physicochemical and biological treatments of vinasse given that many issues have been raised by the use of vinasse in direct application on the ground several works were published with the goal to reduce both the quantity and the polluting load of the liquid effluent physicochemical or biological management process can be used for this purpose physicochemical process for the treatment of vinasse are based on separation of the organic charge from the water or on the use of strong oxidizing agent for degradation of the chemical pollutants thus reducing the volume of stillage to treat or the amount of pollutant in the effluent whereas biological methods are used in milder conditions of temperature and pressure with no addition of chemicals 2 1 volume reduction the first challenge associated with vinasse management is its production volume the corn ethanol industry has already managed this problem by concentrating the organic charge through drying processes leading to the valorization of the dried residue for animal feeding purpose 4 however energy requirement associated with evaporation of the water content is energetically high and economically disadvantageous 2 2 recirculation as a waste from distilleries vinasse could be advantageously recycled directly into the ethanol production process as a tap water replacement 19 22 recycling of the whole stillage into fermentation medium leads to a higher concentration of dry matter after 14 cycles from 9 6 to 24 this process enabled a 66 decrease in nutrients addition 46 2 in fresh water and 50 in sulfuric acid requirement 19 further stillage volume reduction is possible by replacing tap water with recirculating stillage after distillation and solid separation 20 or using post methanated effluents 21 without influence on the ethanol yield and fermentation time the resulting concentrated effluent reduced energy requirement for vinasse drying but did not eliminate the evaporation step and liquids emissions into the environment further physical chemical or biological post treatments are then required to reduce the polluting characteristics of the ultimate effluent after recycling of the vinasse 2 3 membrane system filtration systems in wastewater treatment use membranes to concentrate the suspended solids from a slurry in a concentrate stream and to release the depolluted water in the permeate stream several technologies including microfiltration nanofiltration or reverse osmosis offer different cut off limits depending on the molecular weight of the particles to strip out from the water it can be considered as an intermediate operation to separate solutes or as a final depolluting step before discharging of the water as a final step this operation is envisaged in replacement of the evaporation step mainly because it reduces significantly the energy requirements down to 7 9 kj per kg of water removed as compared to evaporation that requires about 1300 kj per kg of water removed 23 each existing methods was essayed on vinasse with various success see table 3 microfiltration systems are able to work directly with thin stillage for total solid concentration between 7 and 35 using a 5 stages membrane system 23 or can be used as a tertiary treatment for aerobically treated distillery effluents in combination with nanofiltration resulting in high chemical oxygen demand removal a reduction of total dissolved solids and color removal in the ranges of 96 99 5 85 95 and 98 99 5 respectively 24 for lower molecular weight particle separation from wastewater reverse osmosis can be applied this method is a membrane process used for separation or concentration of soluble from aqueous solutions briefly it consists in circulating a pressurized solution tangentially to a high rejection membrane meanwhile low pressure is applied to the other side the resultant pressure has to exceed the osmotic pressure to produce a flux of purified water through the membrane and a stock of concentrated solution 25 however reverse osmosis can be used only with water wastes with acidic or neutral ph 26 alcohol distilleries use large volumes of water which in some process is recovered as condensates during stillage concentration however the inhibitory molecules contained in these condensates prevent their discharge without further treatment attempts for reducing water consumption of distilleries have led to the idea of recycling water from condensates after elimination of the inhibitory solutes reverse osmosis have been applied for the purpose in order to reduce the small organic solutes of the vinasse 26 permeates were checked for inhibitory effects on saccharomyces cerevisae and the treatment proved suitable for subsequent recycling in an alcohol production step except at ph 6 where 10 inhibition was still present the authors also envisaged a double reverse osmosis or coupling with another process to eliminate all traces of inhibitors when applied directly to distillery effluent permeate fluxes obtained ranged from 35 to 120 l m2 h depending on the membrane used 27 target solute rejections were comprised between 82 2 and 99 2 and the permeate inhibitory effect on microbial growth was between 0 and 5 2 in order to improve efficiency of the process combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis at a pilot plant scale was tested 28 in this improved process nanofiltration was found to be particularly efficient for color removal while reverse osmosis resulted in a reduction of 99 8 of total dissolved solids 99 9 of cod and 99 9 of potassium contained in the permeate however filtration systems suffer from filter clogging that limit the concentration of the feed and reduce the permeate flux other complementary technics were developed to improve the efficiency of the process that were implemented for vinasse for example it is possible to work on the effluent before filtration by centrifugation and precipitation this resulted in a separation efficiency that was increased from 46 to 75 and a permeate flux also improved from 45 to 50 to 79 l m2 h 29 it was also possible to work on the membranes directly by incorporating some adjuvants such as graphene in the membrane which resulted in an increase of the flux trough the membrane from 7 to 17 l m2 h 30 the most reported method for vinasse filtration improvement is the coagulation flocculation method flocculation is the agglomeration of solid particles from slurry caused by addition of a chemical or biological additive resulting in flocs formation and their separation from the solution 31 flocculation of vinasse has been studied using commercial polyelectrolytes resulting in a total suspended solid concentrated from 0 15 w w to 40 w w and a filtration flux increased by six fold as compared to a process based on centrifugation 31 the use of non metallic polyaspartic acid resulted in a reduced inhibition of the recycled wastewater in the ethanol process contrasting with polyaluminium chloride polyacrylamide flocculant or no flocculant 32 using polyglutamic acid with sodium hypochlorite resulted in 70 decrease of the turbidity and reduced chemical oxygen demand by 79 5 33 the use of plant seed have also been reported for the coagulation of vinasse with respect to color removal kernel aqueous extract of moringa oleifera seeds displayed a maximum of 53 and 64 color removal using sodium chloride and potassium chloride salts respectively 34 2 4 adsorption processes adsorption of organic pollutants into porous material is the simplest method of purification of water traditionally activated carbon is used for this purpose principally to removed color from effluents others adsorption techniques can be used to separate specific species from a wastewater for example potassium ions have been purified from distillery wastewater using cation exchange resin 2 4 1 activated carbon activated carbon is a high adsorption capacity material widely employed for removal of color and specific organic pollutants thanks to a large surface area and microporous structure color removal capacity of 19 activated carbon from bagasse bagasse fly ash sawdust wood ash and rice husk ash was examinated on biomethanated distillery effluent 35 they obtained a maximum color removal of 50 with phosphoric acid carbonized bagasse however none of the samples produced give better performance than commercial activated carbons with over 80 color removal additionally chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon phenol and total kjeldahl nitrogen were reduced by 23 6 16 6 32 8 and 24 8 respectively with phosphoric acid activated bagasse the synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and granular activated carbons on vinasse treatment was investigated 36 they found that the combined process affected negatively the removal efficiency by limiting the cod removal and color the negative effect decreased by increasing ph value of the influent authors proposed that the negative effect could be due to lower adsorption of degradation products from oxidation process onto granular activated carbon than primary organic molecules in vinasse 2 4 2 cation exchange resin vinasse presents a high concentration of potassium up to 17 g l 37 this high concentration limits its usage in one of the possible use of this effluent animal feed because of toxic effect 38 potassium ions extraction from vinasses using a strong acid cation exchange resin was studied 39 a maximum extraction capacity of 56 79 mg k per ml of resin and a 99 6 elution of the concentrated k from the resin was attained concluding that the methodology was a potential means for industrial production of potassium salt altogether with the production of a vinasse which might be used as animal feed 2 5 physical treatments 2 5 1 cavitation cavitation meaning formation growth and collapse of microbubbles in milliseconds time intervals and releasing large amount of energy can be used to destroy contaminants in water 40 this phenomenon can be performed by sonochemical cavitation using ultrasound or by hydrodynamic cavitation involving velocity variation which results in pressure variation in a liquid circulating through a specific geometry such as a venturi system 41 ultrasound irradiated wastewater was proved to be less recalcitrant to biological degradation than non treated stillage and can reach up to 44 cod degradation with us treatment as compared to a 25 in non treated stillage 42 the technique has been combined with other processes such as ozonation 43 or enzymatic treatment 44 while us did not interact synergistically with ozone when used sequentially with cellulase containing endoglucanase cellobiohydrolase and β glucosidase the combined treatment yielded higher cod removal than for each treatment applied separately in this case a 4 fold increase in the initial oxidation rate was observed as compared to untreated batches hydrodynamic cavitation has also been reported for the degradation of synthetic wastewater containing specific pollutants such as textile dyes and pesticides 45 46 as a pretreatment for bio methanated distillery wastewater hydrocavitation resulted in cod and toc reduction by 32 2 and 31 4 respectively along with a color reduction of 48 47 2 5 2 catalytic thermolysis catalytic thermolysis is the thermal degradation of organic and inorganic substances in an aqueous solution or suspension by means of elevated temperatures and pressures using cuo catalyst in anoxic conditions at 140 c this technique showed a maximal 60 cod removal in the wastewater along with the production of a solid residue usable as a fuel in combustion furnaces with a heating value of 21 7 mj kg 1 48 the process can be improved by addition of oxygen or air and is called wet oxidation this process convert insoluble organic matter into simpler soluble compounds which are in turns oxidized and eventually converted to carbon dioxide and water without emissions of no x so2 hcl dioxins furans or fly ash 49 the process can be applied with or without catalyst without catalyst the process used as a pretreatment can enhance the biodegradability of the effluent for aerobic digestion with cod reduction up to 67 7 whereas the untreated effluent reached cod reduction by only 22 5 50 this treatment also degraded melanoidins up to 97 8 and reduced the toxicity of the effluent as illustrated by positive germination test up to no dilution condition 51 the use of catalysts may be very advantageous because it can lower operating temperature and pressure thus lower energy consumption compared to non catalytic wet oxidation different catalysts can be used such as pt al2o3 mn ce oxides or cu ii exchanged nay zeolite at a concentration of 1 among them the highest toc removal from vinasse was observed with mn ce oxides the catalysts were found to be very effective for short contact times of 10 min but cu ii nay catalyst loose catalyst activity over time due to coke laydown 52 2 6 oxidative process oxidation can be envisaged to lower the organic matter contained in vinasse the oxidants are chemical agents used through catalytic wet oxidation see section 2 5 photocatalysis or ozone addition a synthesis of these techniques applied to vinasse from various origins is summarized in table 4 2 6 1 photocatalysis photocatalysis is the catalysis of a photochemical reaction at a solid surface energy from a light source excites electrons of the catalyst creating electron hole pairs the holes can react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals or directly with organic compounds by electron transfer the electrons can react with oxygen contributing to oxidation reactions 53 the process has been tested with distillery effluents using visible and uv light or sunlight catalysis with aluminium based nanocatalyst under two 24 w fluorescent lamps produced visible light during 3 h and resulted in 80 vinasse decolorization at 475 nm 54 the uv light achieved color removal of only 54 for the distillery wastewater with tio2 zeolite catalyst 55 photocatalysis of distillery vinasses with solar radiations during 5 consecutive days with nb2o5 tio2 as catalyst reduced total organic compounds in vinasse by 55 as compared to a 4 decrease without catalyst 56 the efficiency of the photocatalytic treatment depended mostly on the quantity of catalyst added and was best at low ph and room temperature whereas agitation has very little effect 54 a decrease in vinasse toxicity can be obtained with photocatalysis with nb2o5 tio2 as showed using bioassays with artemia saline 56 although it has little effect on cod removal 55 the use of photocatalysis in combination with anaerobic digestion can improve the quality of the treated wastewater by reducing the color 55 2 6 2 ozone ozone is an unstable gas which can be produced at the point of use acting as a strong oxidizing agent its effectiveness in converting recalcitrant compounds into less toxic and more biodegradable ones is based on the direct effects produced by the oxidative activity of molecular ozone and on the indirect effect of products of the reaction such as oh radicals 43 the gas has been used for pretreatment of aerobic digestion of distiller effluents and enhanced by 25 times the subsequent aerobic oxidation rate at a maximum of 45 6 cod reduction as compared to 1 8 cod reduction for the control 43 the gas can also be used prior to anaerobic digestion of vinasse resulting in a 50 reduction of phenols without effect on the total organic carbon content but leading to enhanced methane yield coefficients and methane production rates by 13 6 and 41 16 respectively 57 ozone could also be used in combination with other techniques such as electrocoagulation 58 2 7 electro chemical treatment 2 7 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation generates through the electrochemical dissolution of a sacrificial metal anode in situ colloids destabilizing metallic coagulant cations and simultaneous formation of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas from water at the cathode similarly as for flocculation cationic species favor floc formation which traps the contaminants while the hydrogen gas acts as a float for these particles 59 fenton reactions involve addition of hydrogen peroxide to ferrous ions in acidic medium to form ferric ions and free hydroxyl radicals ferric ions further react with hydrogen peroxide to enhance the oxidative power electro fenton is a combination of coagulation and fenton reaction that generates the hydrogen peroxide in situ using a carbonaceous cathode 60 the combination of electro fenton hydrogen peroxide generated electrochemically and electro coagulation ferrous ions generated electrochemically is called peroxi coagulation iron anode for ferrous ions formation and carbonaceous cathode for hydrogen peroxide production 61 laboratory scale experiments were performed to decolorize vinasse using electrocoagulation and electro fenton process 59 the results obtained for electrocoagulation showed 79 color removal using iron electrodes arranged with 0 5 cm of inter electrode space and at ph 7 5 a current intensity 300 rpm agitation speed during 2 h of electrolysis time in electro fenton 44 vinasse color removal was observed using carbon electrodes with 0 5 cm inter electrode distance ph 3 4 a current intensity 20 mg l feso4 and agitation speed of 400 rpm during 3 h of electrolysis time another hybrid technique of electrocoagulation combined with ozone was investigated by 58 for the removal of color and cod in distillery effluent the coupling with ozone is interesting as it involves direct attack of fe2 with o3 to generate the intermediate feo 2 the intermediate species produce oh radicals which accelerate cod and color removal 58 a combined technique associating electrocoagulation and ozonation was even more effective than each alone the maximum removal of cod efficiency was found to be 83 at current density of 3 a m 2 initial cod concentration 2500 ppm initial ph 6 and ozone gas mixture flow rate 15 l min 1 requiring an energy consumption of 5 1 kwh m 3 the complete color removal was observed within 2 h of process time 2 7 2 electrodialysis most publications on vinasse treatment focus on reducing main parameters as chemical and biological oxygen demand total organic carbon or color electrodialysis is the extraction of electrolytes from salty water through an ionic exchange membrane under an electric field 62 an electrodialysis method was proposed for treatment of potassium in beet vinasse 13 a decrease in conductivity was reported along with the process that was associated to the cation concentration evolution potassium concentration fall from 10 to 0 5 g l while the decreasing of calcium and sodium ion levels was very small from 0 3 to 0 25 g l and 2 1 5 g l respectively resulting in a selectivity of the process for specific ions 2 8 microbiological treatment the anaerobic microbiological process is one of the most used treatments of vinasse applied to vinasse in thermophilic or mesophilic digestion it leads to a decrease in the overall content of pollutants but to an increase in color of the spent wash thus requiring additional treatments many physicochemical treatments described earlier have been applied in combination with anaerobic digestion because they are already well integrated in current ethanol production plants this treatment produces biogas while reducing the organic load of the effluent and as such it can contribute to the production of energy other biological treatments exist aimed at reducing the pollution load of the vinasse and at focussing on discoloration and elimination of heavy metals 2 8 1 decolorization several microbiological treatments have been reported for color removal in the literature 63 67 the persistent brown color of the vinasse cannot be degraded by conventional anaerobic treatments and can even be increased due to repolymerization of complex compounds however there are a number of microbial strains or consortium capable of significantly increasing the decolorization of vinasse bulk microorganisms from the soil were found to be able to decolorize molasses spent wash by 81 after 18 days of incubation when 10 w v of soil and 12 5 v v of vinasse have been used 63 additionally bacteria isolated from soil contaminated with distillery effluent showed a maximum decolorization of 72 6 along with a toxicity removal on germination and growth of vigna radiata mung beans 64 similarly the filamentous fungi flavodon flavus immobilized on polyurethane foam displayed up to 73 decolorization of 10 diluted vinasse concomitantly with a 68 decrease of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 65 the decolorized vinasse was found to be less toxic as shown by tests on oreochromis mossambicus that revealed no damage of the liver in contrast to untreated effluents 65 it would also be interesting to test the reduction of toxicity of decolorized vinasse on other organisms such as zebrafish see also ref 9 or trout cell lines combination of chemical and biological treatments by polyaluminium chloride and aspergillus niger of non diluted anaerobically digested spentwash reached up to 86 8 decolorization 66 basidiomycetes are also proving to be good candidates for vinasse decolorization pleurotus sajor caju showed color and turbidity reduction of vinasse by 99 2 and 99 7 respectively and a specific reduction of phenols and total suspended solids by 98 2 and 97 6 respectively 68 the color of the vinasse arises from the phenolic compounds resulting from the degradation of the fibrous feedstocks the melanoidins generated by the maillard reactions during the heating of the effluent the caramels from overheated sugars and the furfurals resulting from the acid hydrolysis 69 the phenolic compounds present in the vinasse could be degraded up to 74 after a 3 days aerobic treatment of vinasse with the fungus penicillium decumbens 70 the microorganism can be acclimatized to phenol by progressive contact treatment acclimated activated sludge showed increased cod removal efficiency from 19 to 31 for non acclimated sludge which could be further improved to 82 and 87 with 10 fold and 50 fold dilution of wastewater respectively 71 the question of color removal can also be treated through bacterial consortia bharagava et al 67 tested axenic or consortium bacteria for the natural and synthetic elimination of melanoidin and demonstrated improved efficiency of mixed bacteria on axenic cultures 2 8 2 heavy metals removal the removal of heavy metals is generally achieved by physicochemical and biological methods surprisingly in our survey we only found biological methods but no physicochemical treatment to treat the sugarcane vinasse the use of the actinobacterium streptomyces sp mc1 has been reported for the removal of heavy metals from vinasse 72 potentially toxic metals such as mn fe zn as and pb have been effectively removed during bacterial growth mn and fe were removed at 95 and 62 respectively after 4 days of aerobic microbial treatment zn as and pb were completely eliminated at the end of the culture period the possibility of cultivating an indeterminate consortium of sulphate reducing bacteria on vinasse as substrate has been studied for the removal of heavy metals present in mining wastewater 73 anaerobic sludge has been enriched by feeding of vinasse lactate and sulphate the elimination of cadmium and zinc in the form of metal sulfide was evaluated using this procedure the authors obtained reduction percentages greater than 99 for both metals 2 9 enzymatic process the vinasse may contain organic compounds which are difficult to degrade such as residues of fibers of the plant feedstock or the yeast cells generated during the alcohol production process these compounds represent a possible complementary source of nutrients but most of them can hardly be metabolized by biological processes as previously discussed commercial cellulase enzymes containing endoglucanase ec 3 2 1 4 cellobiohydrolase ec 3 2 1 91 and β glucosidase ec 3 2 1 21 were used as pre treatment techniques to degrade fibrous materials in the vinasse 44 the effectiveness of the technique was tested by subjecting the effluent to subsequent aerobic biological oxidation at the optimum ph value of 4 8 with 50 units of the enzyme cocktail and after 24 h of incubation enzymatic pre treatment resulted in a 7 increase in cod removal when aerobic oxidation was subsequently applied to the must yeast cells contain nutrients that can be valued but are generally not accessible to the biological process such as anaerobic degradation due to yeast cell wall thickness the enzymatic digestion of yeast cells using lyticase α amylase cellulase β glucosidase β glucanase lipase protease enzyme complex and papain was evaluated for their effect on the anaerobic digestion of whisky spent wash and pot ale 74 protease associated beta glucanase showed synergistic activity reaching more than 90 yeast cell digestion at 37 c whereas papain reached 95 degradation in spent wash at 50 c anaerobic digestion of the enzymatically treated pot ale has shown cod reductions of 87 compared with only 13 without enzymes 2 10 phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technology that uses plants to reduce and degrade polluting organic compounds such as those found in vinasse artificial wetlands are one of the technologies used for this purpose the main optimization parameters of the technics are the flow of passage or recycling of the effluent as well as the plant species used the technology was proved to be applicable for exemple on acid effluent such as acid mine drainage 75 the performance of a subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with pontederia sagittata was evaluated for the treatment of diluted stillage subjected to ph adjustment at 6 76 surface cod loading rates up to 94 8 g cod m2 d were fed the system was able to remove up to 80 6 87 3 76 0 58 7 and 69 4 for cod bod5 total nitrogen nitrates and sulfates respectively depending on the hydraulic retention time hrt no phosphate and potassium removals were observed the use of living organisms requires working at low temperature and atmospheric pressure but avoids the need to add harmful chemicals limits energy intake and causes decolorization and cod reduction similar to oxidative processes however the treatment time is usually longer than the physicochemical process and for some microbial species it may be necessary to make special nutritional adjustments to the waste nevertheless as depollution and growth occur biological organisms produce potentially valuable metabolites that can further reduce the cost of the process compared to physicochemical processes typically the main treatment system used to reduce the polluant effect of vinasse is anaerobic digestion due to the concomitant production of valuable biogas while reducing the polluting characteristics of the stillage thus most biological treatments of vinasse are considered a production step rather than a final depollution treatment and are discussed in section 3 as potential upgrading of wastewater from distillery instead of a simple bioremediation process 3 distillery vinasses waste or resource vinasse is considered as a toxic waste and adequate treatment must be considered before being discharged into the environment it can also be considered as a valuable by product for several applications such as agricultural fertilizer soil conditioner pest control additive and cultural medium for microbial biomass production this latter application has generated growing interest among researchers for the last few years for molecules or energy production several studies have envisaged vinasse as a resource material rather than a waste 3 1 agricultural value so far the main use of vinasse with or without treatment was its application as fertilizer for agricultural fields its composition brings to the soil fertilizing elements for plants and organic matter that affect the microbial community and indirectly the physical properties of the soil it is also a potential composting material for the production of soil amendment 3 1 1 growth promoter vinasse has demonstrated interesting possibilities in agricultural field as growth promoter field experiments in maize cultivation revealed that the application of distillery effluents resulted in increased leaf area in higher chlorophyll content nitrate reductase activity total dry weight and grain yields biomethanated spent wash showed better grain yield around 36 9 q ha 1 than raw vinasse with 32 2 q ha 1 77 same authors have also studied the effect of stillage on groundnut in field with the same parameters 78 or on seed germination in tomato chilli bottle gourd cucumber and onion 79 same effect of vinasse was observed in maize and in groundnut cultivation including increased total chlorophyll content crop growth rate total dry matter nutrient uptake and seed yield compared to controls but in the case of groundnut inhibition of nodulation and decreased nitrogen fixation was observed concerning vegetables the distillery effluent showed no inhibitory effect on seed germination at low concentration except for tomatoes for onion the germination was 84 at 10 concentration as compared to 63 for untreated cultures when applied at 75 or 100 vinasse completely stopped germination of seeds 79 mung bean and green gram have also been tested with distillery effluents with or without anaerobic pre treatment 80 81 these plants were negatively impacted by addition of raw vinasse concentration as low as 5 anaerobic pretreatment was able to reduce the toxicity of the stillage which can be used up to 10 concentration for irrigation and showed higher growth in root length shoot length number of leaves biomass photosynthetic pigment protein and starch other plants such as indian mustard were able to sustain higher concentration of post methanated waste up to 50 without inhibition effects 82 special care should be taken when applying vinasse to the crops depending on the species it could be considered as a good amendment reducing the need for commercial fertilizer however its application should be limited due to imbalanced nutrient content and high salinity leading to the necessity of fertilizer complementation thus liquid fertilizer formula for hydroponic cultures has been produced using vinasse 83 the formula containing 10 vinasse complemented with other nutrients was tested with lettuce watercress and rocket similar results were obtained with the formula containing vinasse and a commercial fertilizer 3 1 2 soil erosion control vinasse applications on field revealed several physico and bio chemical impacts at the physical level its application also leads to modifications in the behavior of soil when liquid effluent was applied to the ground its hydrological behavior was modified and when simulated rain was applied earlier runoff was observed for soils treated with vinasse 84 however a high dose of vinasse protected soils from erosion due to rainfall and decreased soil loss and sediment concentration this result could be explained by the organic content of the soil incorporated after vinasse application 85 when vinasse was applied to the soil larger aggregates and higher carbon content were found moreover aggregates stability was higher with non treated vinasse than with post methanated effluents probably due to its higher organic carbon content higher carbon content may stimulate microbial activity and secretion of polysaccharides causing stabilization of soil aggregates reduction of runoff issue with liquid vinasse has been attempted using biochar from liquid vinasses 86 the time before runoff when biochar was applied 24 h and 48 h before simulated rain was increased by 55 1 and 71 7 respectively as compared to control moreover the runoff volume decreased by 98 46 and 46 39 with biochar application for 24 and 48 h time delay between application and rain simulation respectively finally least soil loss of 1 12 g and sediment concentration of 1 44 g l 1 occurred with the 48 h time delay treatment 3 1 3 composting composting is an aerobic process that biodegrades heterogeneous organic substrates and stabilises organic matter for use in soil conditioning providing additional nutrients as well as stabilizing soils this process was tested on vinasse mixed with various other wastes mixture with grape marc were incubated in a laboratory scale reactor at 55 c for 43 days 87 the addition of vinasse affected the composting process both positively and negatively the nutrients provided by the vinasse promoted microbial growth however an increase in salinity and a decrease in ph were also observed when vinasse additions were increased leading to limited microbial activity the authors then concluded that 10 20 addition of vinasse would result in the best compromise mixture with fly ash was used in a vermicomposting process with two epigeic earthworms eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae 88 effect of waste mixture was assessed with cellulolytic fungal population and cellulase activity during vermicomposting for mixtures including from 25 to 50 vinasse the cellulolytic fungi biomass increased and a higher cellulase activity was observed no differences were observed between the two worm species investigated conversely use of vinasse in vermicomposting with rabbit manure showed a negative impact on eisenia fetida 89 when vinasse was integrated at 10 in the mixture weight and number of worm were 25 and 28 lower respectively by comparison with rabbit manure alone when 50 vinasse was mixed with rabbit manure these parameters were 54 and 50 lower than rabbit manure alone respectively the high amount of soluble salts and phosphate are thought to be responsible for these effects 3 2 biomass production the high organic loads of vinasse is seen as a potential advantage as growth medium for microbial production microalgae and fungal biomass have been identified as potential source of food or feed because of their content in desirable molecules such as single cell protein antioxidant or lipids production of microalgae on vinasses has been investigated 90 91 although it has a dark brown color autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth can be obtained on stillage if adequately diluted vinasse concentration up to 5 g l was studied in dark fermentations and in photobioreactors 90 in dark fermentation 5 g l beet vinasse was used to produce up to 4 8 g l of spirulina maxima biomass with a specific growth rate near 0 1 d 1 in addition continuous cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor yielded biomass at 8 g l using 2 g l of vinasse supplemented medium the same microalgae was studied by 91 under autotrophic without vinasse dark heterotrophic with 0 1 v v or 1 0 v v sugarcane vinasse and mixotrophic conditions maximum biomass production occurred after 25 days in the mixotrophic cultivation and produced up to 0 716 g l when medium was supplemented with vinasse at 1 0 v v whereas autotrophic cultures produced 20 lower biomass autotrophic conditions gave a specific growth rate of 0 97 d 1 heterotrophic conditions with 0 1 v v vinasse gave a specific growth rate of 0 54 d 1 but increasing the vinasse concentration at 1 0 v v gave a higher specific growth rate of 1 02 d 1 on the contrary in mixotrophic cultures increasing vinasse concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 v v led to a decrease of the specific growth rate from 0 28 d 1 to 0 14 d 1 respectively based on these results authors used a vinasse concentration of 3 v v in a cyclic light autotrophic dark heterotrophic microalgae culture and obtained a concentration of 0 609 g l 1 at the 7th day with protein content up to 77 3 w w production of fungal biomass on vinasse is also considered as an attractive source of proteins 92 the production of the edible fungus rhizopus oligosporus was studied in an airlift bioreactor filled with 75 v v sugarcane vinasse and supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus the highest fungal biomass concentration obtained was 3 79 g l after 3 days cultivation protein content of the dry biomass was 50 and lipids reached 3 44 composition of the biomass in essential amino acids was comparable to that of commercial protein sources for aquatic feeds except for methionine and phenylalanine despite the possibility to develop processes using vinasse as a medium for single cell biomass production an even more attractive way of using this effluent is to produce value added molecules 3 3 production of value added molecules many organic molecules have already been produced using vinasse based medium including alcohols organic acids polymers proteins and others underlying the ability to valorize this nutrient containing liquid 3 3 1 alcohol production vinasse have been used to produced ethanol 93 butanol 94 or xylitol 95 ethanol could be produced at 5 g l using the edible ascomycete fungus neurospora intermedia in continuous culture without nutrient addition also butanol and xylitol could be produced respectively using clostridium pasteurianum on a glycerol supplemented vinasse medium or using debaryomyces hanseniion wine vinasses upon xylose addition metals present in the stillage particularly zn showed a negative effect on maximal xylitol yield decreasing from 0 62 to 0 28 g g when zn content increased from 1 3 to 3 5 mg kg respectively 3 3 2 organic acids organic acids could also be produced on vinasse lactic acid is the most studied organic acid because it is a versatile chemical bulk integrated in many industrial processes as acidifying and flavouring agent as softener for leather as antimicrobial and preserver substance or as chemical a remarkable use is also found as a precursor for poly lactic acid polymers in the pharmaceutical and plastic industry thanks to many favorable characteristics like biodegradability biocompatibility and elasticity lactic acid fermentation of the stillage can be performed with lactobacillus rhamnosus without mineral or nitrogen supplementation 96 this microorganism yielded lactic acid up to 0 90 g g with a productivity of 1 48 g l h improvement of the process by immobilization of the biomass on zeolite was also assessed 97 it proved to facilitate separation of biomass and its reuse in repeated batch cycles with a yield of 0 96 g g and a productivity of 1 69 g l h further optimizations of the immobilization have been worked out with mg modified zeolite 98 however despite higher cell immobilization higher lactic acid concentration of 47 6 g l and an equivalent yield of 0 96 g g than simple zeolite immobilization productivity was only 1 41 g l h with mg modified zeolite improvement of lactic acid production have also been studied through pretreatment of concentrated sorghum vinasse with microwave and naoh before simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process 99 microwave and naoh at 0 06 g per gram of dry weight vinasse were used to degrade hemicellulose and lignin the two treatments had a synergistic effects on lactic acid yield in these conditions lactic acid yielded 86 0 mg per gram of dried vinasse production of other organic acid compounds including butyric acid acetic acid or long chain fatty acids were also investigated 100 101 butyric isobutyric acid and acetic acid were produced up to 10 1 g l and 3 6 g l respectively using kissiris immobilized mixed bacterial cultures in continuous anaerobic acidogenesis of non sterile ph 8 adjusted vinasses 100 eicosapentaenoic acid c20 5 n 3 can also be produced during growth of the fungus pythium irregulare using vinasse based medium the yield and productivity were 243 mg l and 27 mg l day respectively in an optimized temperature shift culture process 101 3 3 3 polymers numerous polymers are produced using microorganisms as exemplified by synthesis of polysaccharides from ganoderma lucidum up to 7 50 g l 102 polyhydroxyalkanoates from bacillus tequilensis accumulated at 40 dry cell weight 103 or cellulose from gluconacetobacter xylinus with a yield of 57 sugar converted into cellulose 104 all these strains have been grown on vinasse either as the main source of nutrients either as a medium additive the use of vinasse in the medium globally led to improvement of the production and a decrease of the cost associated to the medium 3 3 4 enzymes vinasse are mainly produced from plants which contained lignocellulosic materials at the end of the ethanol process lignocellulose often remains in the stillage or can be added to activate the lignocellulosic catabolic pathways of microorganisms sets of enzymes from wild strains have been produced using this effluent as carbon source for growth anaerobically treated vinasse was used for the production of cellulases from aspergillus ellipticus under solid state fermentation using wheat straw as substrate 105 β glucosidase and endo β 1 4 glucanase activities were detected at a level of 26 7 and 130 9 units per g of substrate respectively the same medium could also serve for xylanase production up to 5600 u g by a strain of burkholderia sp 106 or up to 6 6 u ml by aspergillus heteromorphus in the presence of lignocellulose 107 3 3 5 others molecules aliphatic ketones β carotene or emulsifier production have been reported from microbial strains grown on vinasse fermentation of the filamentous fungus phycomyces nitens produced β carotene at 4 1 4 2 mg l in vinasse with light stimulation 108 aliphatic ketones were produced by a two step process consisting of a first hydrothermal treatment producing a mixture of cyclic compounds aromatics ketones ethers esters carboxylic acids and aldehydes residues and followed by a second catalytic reaction over a zro2 feox catalyst to produce aliphatic ketones from esters and carboxylic acids 109 finally emulsifier production by yeast 110 or actinobacterium 72 can be obtained when grown on vinasse the yeast emulsifier consisted of 1 4 α and 1 3 β d glucans protein bound of 1 93 105 da containing 96 of carbohydrates mainly as glucose with minor amount of mannose and 4 of protein built from 17 amino acids with a major content of serine and alanine 3 4 energetic value since distilleries use steam to separate ethanol from water it uses relatively high amount of energy this energy need can be satisfied with methane produced by anaerobic fermentation of the stillage other valuable energetic products have to be produced to meet the growing energy demand of future societies based on non fossil energy sources hydrogen is envisaged as a platform molecule for future energy systems a future source of hydrogen is thought to be through electrolysis of water with renewable electricity from photovoltaic or wind farms fermentation of vinasse is another possibility currently under investigation for hydrogen production gases are easily transportable through pipe systems whereas they do not suit easily in mobility system such as car as compared to liquid fuels the two main fuels for transportation are gasoline and diesel these two petroleum derived fuels have potential renewable homologs namely ethanol and biodiesel biodiesel is the product obtained from methanolysis of vegetable animal or microbial oils the microbial oil production have been investigated on distillery vinasse and proved to be qualitatively adapted for biodiesel production 3 4 1 biogas anaerobic digestion is considered an attractive biotechnological method degrading a variety of organic wastes such as poultry litters dead animals or cellulosic materials 1 111 114 the process requires the widely intricate activity of a microbial community involving sequential catabolic steps firstly organic compounds are hydrolyzed into short chain fatty acids as lactate propionate and butyrate these fatty acids are further degraded to acetate and h2 co2 during the second step of acidogenesis and finally methanogenesis occurs with acetate and h2 co2 conversion into methane 115 the entire process has been studied during annual variation 116 as a way to improve the ethanol industry from economic environmental and energetic perspectives 6 by producing electricity 117 118 and reducing water consumption 119 it is estimated to reduce gas consumption of ethanol plant between 43 and 59 with the methane produced from vinasse while saving an estimated 10 million for a facility producing 360 million l ethanol year 120 moreover ch4 is being commonly used as compressed natural gas which has been regarded as a cleaner energy carrier in comparison to gasoline or diesel 121 attempts to improve efficiency of the methanation process as summarized in table 5 have been carried out such as pretreatment of the vinasses with combination of ozone uv and tio2 122 biological pretreatment with filamentous fungi 123 co feeding 112 114 or immobilization of the methanogens bacteria 124 modifications of the vinasse composition are suspected to be responsible for the improvements observed in the case of ozone uv and tio2 treatment 122 among the possible modifications reducing phenolic content of the waste is probably a key objective because it was proposed as the explicative parameter for fungal treatment efficiency 123 improvement in anaerobic conditions can also lead to a better yield as demonstrated by the 22 improvement when immobilized biomass was used five types of bioreactors are usually used to produce biogas from vinasse these are summarized in table 6 in anaerobic digestion growth of the biomass is slow resulting in low sludge production but limiting the flux of influent to treat to overcome this limitation reactors which separate the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solid retention time srt have been implemented table 6 the continuously stirred tank reactor is the simplest reactor design used in the anaerobic digestion of vinasse this kind of reactor can reach up to 0 7 l methane g organic matter removed from vinasse but within high hrt of 20 days 120 thus high rate reactors have been studied to improve the performances of anaerobic digestion column reactors with sludge blanket have been associated with a filter to retain the biomass and to reach high rate of effluent consumption this type of reactor significantly reduce to 5 days the hrt without instabilities of the process producing up to 6 l methane l effluent days 125 anaerobic bed reactors are column reactors filled with lining in which the biomass can be fixed and let the effluent to treat circulates fixed bed and the fluidized bed reactors are the two types of bed reactor they have been studied to treat vinasse the fluidized bed reactors turned out to be better with lower hrt of 3 days than the 8 days of fixed film bed reactors and 5 times higher methane production potentially better results can be obtained from thermophilic processes as compared with mesophilic biochemical methane potential bmp assays produced 49 l ch4 and 65 l ch4 per l stillage from mesophilic and thermophilic digesters respectively however in continuous flow studies with a semi continuous digester at organic loadings rate olr of 4 25 cod l days unstable performance was observed for the thermophilic digester at 60 hrt 126 whereas using a completely stirred tank reactors steady state was achieved at 30 20 and 15 days hrt digester failure was only observed at a 12 day hrt 120 the inherently sensitiveness of methanogenic bacteria to environmental parameters can destabilize the process in case of abrupt changes to prevent instabilities in the process due to sensitiveness of methanogenic bacteria a biphasic reactor was implemented to treat distillery wastewater 127 129 the acidogenic step was carried out in a first reactor and the methanogenic one in the following the bacteria in the acidogenic reactor are less sensitive to environmental changes and constitute a buffer for methanogenic bacteria the design allowed methanogenic reactor to resist to significant changes in the ph but organic loading rate higher than 11 33 kg cod m3 d and hydraulic retention time below 10 days were harmful for cod removal and biogas production 127 other authors compared the two stage process to the single stage process 129 a maximum methane yield of 0 33 l ch4 g codadded was achieved in the two stage process while a single stage process achieved a maximum yield of only 0 26 l ch4 g codadded leading to energy outcome increase by 18 5 in the total energy yield using two stage anaerobic digestion as compared to single stage process the two stage continuous anaerobic reactor has been tested in combination with filtration at methanogenic effluent exit for the treatment of sugar cane vinasses overall improvement in cod removal efficiencies reached 96 9 although membrane fouling issue was observed 128 despite the advantages of methane its potential is limited by its narrow flammability slow burning speed and high ignition temperature 121 leading to poor combustion efficiency and an intensive energy requirement when used to power vehicles hydrogen is a possible additive for methane characteristics improvement hydrogen and methane production from vinasse in one reactor was demonstrated leading to production of 4 7 l h mixed gases with proportion of hydrogen varying from 60 to 23 121 3 4 2 biohydrogen biohydrogen is hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources some microorganisms are known to produce hydrogen either by photocatalytic or dark fermentative process microbiologically produced hydrogen was a clean efficient and environment friendly fuel since it has high energy content 122 kj g and produced only water after combustion 130 anaerobic dark fermentations presented a number of advantages such as higher hydrogen production rate and day and night production over phototrophic process indeed this process has been widely used with vinasse table 7 resumes some performance of dark fermentative biohydrogen production from vinasse theoretical maximum yield of hydrogen production is 12 mol h2 mol glucose two phenomenons limit the real yield of hydrogen production in fermentation process the first is the incomplete degradation of organic compounds by the fermentative pathway leading to formation of small molecules as lactic acid butyric acid and propionic acid which are not convertible by the fermentative route but can be used in photocatalytic process 131 133 using vinasse as cultural medium makes the photocatalytic process unusable due to the dark brown color of the waste as such dark fermentation was the only reported way to produce hydrogen from it at the exception of one attempt with sequential fermentative and phototrophic process using diluted effluent in the latter phototrophic step 131 the fermentative process yielded hydrogen production at a rate of 340 mmol h2 g cod where the establishment of lactobacillus related microorganisms prevailed improvement of 5 5 mmol h2 g cod was obtained using rhodopseudomonas related microorganisms in the subsequent phototrophic process with diluted effluent at 10 v v the second factor limiting hydrogen production is the risk of further hydrogen consumption when dissolved in the medium for example in a homoacetogenesis h2 co2 conversion to acetate step due to possible microbial methanogens contamination in the medium to overcome this limitation thermophilic process are used to reduce the solubility of h2 in the medium and to limit the formation of acetic acid via the homoacetogenic pathway 134 modifications of the process were implemented to increase the yield of h2 production pretreatment of the seeds for selection of particular characteristics can be performed 135 using acid ph 3 for 24 h or heat 80 c for 15 min pretreatment had some effects on microbial community in the reactor and was reflected by different lactic acid profiles during hydrogen production lactic acid is a metabolite normally associated with decreased h2 production clostridium was predominant in the heat pretreated inoculum and conducted to an increase in lactic acid whereas thermoanaerobacterium was predominant in the acid treated inoculum leading to a diminution of lactic acid concentration packing material in anaerobic packed bed reactor can also modify the performances of hydrogen production 136 maximum hydrogen production of 509 404 81 and 10 ml l d and maximum yields of 3 2 2 6 0 4 and 0 05 mol molcarbohydrates were observed with reactors filled with low density polyethylene expanded clay charcoal and porous ceramic respectively underlying the importance of the packing material the effluent from biohydrogen production process is still containing large amount of small organic acids and volatile fatty acids which turned out to be impossible to convert into hydrogen by the microorganisms electro fermentation can be used to overcome this limit and to improve the hydrogen yield demonstrating a 68 volatile fatty acid utilization simultaneously with a 0 057 mmol h hydrogen production when 0 6 v was applied 132 improvement in the economics of the process have been studied by integrating h2 production with a subsequent poly hydroxy alcanoate accumulation by bacillus tequilensis 103 maximum poly hydroxy alcanoate accumulation of 40 dry cell weight could be achieved concomitantly with 38 decrease in acidification resulting in volatile fatty acid consumption 3 4 3 biodiesel biodiesel is principally produced through transesterification of neutral lipids traditional feedstocks are vegetal oils but new microbial resources are in development principally as microalgae yeasts or filamentous fungi oleaginous microorganisms are able to accumulate over 20 dry weight of their biomass as lipids storage under high c n ratio with higher productivities than plant resources addition of glycerol or molasses as supplementary carbon sources to vinasse were used to promote lipids accumulation in the yeasts yarrowia lipolytica rhodotorula mucilaginosa rhodotorula glutinis and candida vini 137 high lipid content of 20 and 19 dry weight were obtained from r glutinis on slops glycerol media and from c vini in molasses slops media respectively the growth of y lipolytica on slops glycerol mixtures yielded a fatty acid profile very similar to those expected for american society for testings and materials astm standards biodiesel 138 used glycerol and thin stillage from sake distillery and reported 36 5 lipid content dry weight with rhodotorula glutinis filamentous fungi are also able to produce oil from vinasses 139 mucor circinelloides was cultivated on thin stillage for 2 days in a 6 l airlift bioreactor dry fungal biomass up to 20 g l could be produced with a lipid content of 46 dry weight filamentous fungi are known to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids the unsaturated fatty acids from m circinelloides accounted for 52 of total lipids supplying crude glycerol during the stationary phase further improved cellular oil content from 46 to 61 dry weight microalgae and yeast can also be used in combination 140 mixed culture of rhodosporidium toruloides and chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied using 1 1 mixed distillery wastewater and municipal wastewater under 12 12 light dark cycle under such experimental set up the lipid content and lipid yield were respectively 63 45 and 4 60 g l 4 conclusions vinasse is produced worldwide in very large volumes using a variety of feed stocks mainly corn and sugarcane it is intensively studied due to environmental concern caused by its discharge in the environment to date anaerobic microbiological digestion and direct spreading are the main industrial management systems for this issue however numerous treatment processes have been recently proposed at laboratory scale to reduce the polluting charge including membrane systems adsorption process catalytic and oxidative treatments enzymatic transformation and phytoremediation among the many treatment options proposed physicochemical treatments proved to be most effective in color and organic removal but suffered from a number of technical issues and are limited by the production of secondary wastes to overcome these limitations combination of different treatment methods are expected to improve the reduction of the pollution load but this will automatically generate additional costs of the waste management numerous authors studied novel routes for valorization to improve the versatility of this effluent and turn it into a resource instead of a waste leading to include it into a carbon cycle based economy currently vinasse treatment at industrial scale are mainly based on industrial processes using anaerobic digestion for production of biogas laboratory investigations were also conducted to use vinasse as a fertilizer and erosion control agent as a cultural medium for production of biomass industrial enzymes organic acids and replacement of petroleum derived molecules and as hydrogen or single cell oil production medium the review also pointed out some gaps in the research which require further investigations the question of the gaseous and aerosol portion of the vinasse also needs to be further evaluated to understand the overall impact of the effluent on ecosystems in addition when applied to water bodies the pollution of the liquid part is well characterized but the distribution of pollutants between water and sediments is poorly described and the effect of contaminated sediments on ecosystems is not well characterized finally we noticed that meanwhile physico chemical methods are well suited for heavy metal removal none has been reported on their removal from vinasse in the literature reviewed although this is a major issue with strict regulation in many countries bridging these gaps could allow the use of vinasse in technically feasible processes but that can not be implemented industrially in the current state acknowledgements the financial support of conseil régional de la réunion and the european social fund convention dired 20140704 divinas project is warmly acknowledged 
14535,the foreseeable increase of bioethanol production by distilleries will inevitably lead to an important increase in production of the associated effluent namely vinasse due to its high pollution load characterized by high chemical oxygen demand high salt content and heavy dark color the depollution of this effluent is mandatory before release into nature in this work we reviewed the literature on the main physicochemical and biological treatments of sugarcane vinasse and emphasised on the technological valuation of vinasse that allows to shift the status of the effluent from waste to valuable resource the membrane systems seem to offer the best depollution option but they are subjected to strong technical limitations several alternative processes have been proposed but they generally fail to treat the entire organic load of waste when used in stand alone technology while generating higher investment costs in the treatment process the biological processes turn out to be particularly promising as they are able to produce interesting metabolites from living cells among them production of biogas through anaerobic digestion is by far the most developed and economically viable process for treatment of vinasse however a few works also using vinasse as a growth medium have been published on development of innovative technics to produce single cell products such as lipids proteins organic acids alcohols or enzymes in the medium term technologies to produce third generation biodiesel are developing to complement and compete with fuels derived from petroleum finally the development of hydrogen production processes from vinasse is emerging thus preparing us for a long term decarbonised economy keywords distillery effluent waste management pollution biotechnological treatments agricultural amendment microbiological processes bioenergy 1 introduction the gradual replacement of fossil fuels with biofuels is generating growing interest in a transition to a more friendly economy bioethanol offers numerous advantages for this use the fuel can be produced worldwide using a large variety of feedstock including sugar beets sugarcane molasses corn rice dairy product or cellulosic material 1 it is also considered renewable thanks to its biological origin finally its environmental impact is lower than fossil gasoline 2 as such bioethanol production is expected to keep growing for the next decade to reach 134 billion liters in 2024 3 with biggest producers expected to be united states brazil european union and china fig 1 vinasse also known as distillery spent wash dsw distillery stillage or distillery slop is an aqueous waste generated by the distillation of alcoholic must during the ethanol production process fig 2 4 6 the sugarcane ethanol industry generally releases on average 156 l of stillage and 250 kg of bagasse per ton of sugarcane and produced 12 l of alcohol and 94 kg of sugar 7 thus representing 13 l of stillage per liter of alcohol produced the production of this effluent is expected to rise with the production of ethanol and a perspective of 1742 billion liters produced in 2024 is expected based on this ratio vinasse is an acidic stream ph 3 5 5 high in organic load as represented by high chemical oxygen demand cod up to 140 g l with a dark brown color because of the presence of melanoidins 8 and an unpleasant odour it contains nutrients such as nitrogen up to 4 2 g l phosphorus up to 3 0 g l or potassium up to 17 5 g l as shown in table 1 the characteristics of the vinasse depends on the raw material used the first management system for this effluent was the discharge in water bodies the impact of this practice was assessed by histopathology of liver in tilapia 9 fishes were exposed to different dilutions of stillage from 1 to 10 in laboratory bioassays the vinasse treated fishes exhibited severe tissue disorganization depending on the concentration applied leading to the conclusion that vinasse has a dose dependent toxic and cytotoxic potential in water bodies when it is spread into the nature the effluent can cause proliferation of microorganisms and consumption of the dissolved oxygen in water leading to death of aquatic animals and plants and contaminating sources of potable water 10 12 these environmental problems lead several countries to adopt regulations about effluent discharge aiming at reducing the environmental impact and minimizing the direct contact of raw vinasse with water bodies the main use of vinasse is as a fertilizer through irrigation of fields 7 13 the risks of fertilization are principally associated with the build up of nutrients in the soil including soil salinization and over fertilization leading to salt leaching to groundwater increasing soil instability or eutrophication of water bodies other impacts on the ground include contamination with toxic metals such as zinc copper or barium amongst other metals quantified in table 2 permanent soil and water resources acidification interference in the process of photosynthesis due to the high color and turbidity of stillage or clogging of soil pores by organic overload thus decreasing oxygen transfert and microbial activity as well as stimulating the generation of unpleasant odors due to the anaerobic degradation of organic loads 14 the application of vinasse in the field also has negative effect on invertebrate present in the soil avoidance behavior was observed on earthworms eisenia andrei and collembolans folsomia candida and lower reproduction of these two species along with enchytraeids enchytraeus crypticus and mites hypoaspis aculeifer was highlighted which was attributed to the high salt content and especially the high potassium concentrations 15 ethanol is regarded as an alternative to fossil fuels thanks to its lower greenhouse gas emission compared to gasoline 2 effluents count for a part of the emissions of the ethanol sector the vinasse management system impact the overall greenhouse gases emissions at the field application level 16 17 and during its storage and transportation before application to the field 13 18 transportation of vinasse in open channel and disposal in the field as a fertilizer is the main method used in brazil for discharge of the spent wash ch4 and n2o emissions all along the disposal system were followed because of their potential as greenhouse gases and it was found that ch4 count for 98 of the total emissions during transport but was consumed once applied to the soil however the n2o emissions occurred mainly after irrigation of the field vinasse because of its high organic salt and heavy metal contents and its large production volume represents a great challenge to natural environment from water bodies to atmospheric greenhouse gases through soil contamination consequently depolluting processes should be applied before discharge in the environment the scope of this work was to assess the advances on the knowledge on treatment and usage of vinasse reported in the literature in the last 20 years in a first part treatments and outcomes applied to vinasse were reviewed encompassing physicochemical and biological treatments then the question of the status of vinasse as a waste or a resource is addressed through examples of its usage as agricultural amendment substrate for biomass and valuable molecule production and as raw material for energetic purposes 2 physicochemical and biological treatments of vinasse given that many issues have been raised by the use of vinasse in direct application on the ground several works were published with the goal to reduce both the quantity and the polluting load of the liquid effluent physicochemical or biological management process can be used for this purpose physicochemical process for the treatment of vinasse are based on separation of the organic charge from the water or on the use of strong oxidizing agent for degradation of the chemical pollutants thus reducing the volume of stillage to treat or the amount of pollutant in the effluent whereas biological methods are used in milder conditions of temperature and pressure with no addition of chemicals 2 1 volume reduction the first challenge associated with vinasse management is its production volume the corn ethanol industry has already managed this problem by concentrating the organic charge through drying processes leading to the valorization of the dried residue for animal feeding purpose 4 however energy requirement associated with evaporation of the water content is energetically high and economically disadvantageous 2 2 recirculation as a waste from distilleries vinasse could be advantageously recycled directly into the ethanol production process as a tap water replacement 19 22 recycling of the whole stillage into fermentation medium leads to a higher concentration of dry matter after 14 cycles from 9 6 to 24 this process enabled a 66 decrease in nutrients addition 46 2 in fresh water and 50 in sulfuric acid requirement 19 further stillage volume reduction is possible by replacing tap water with recirculating stillage after distillation and solid separation 20 or using post methanated effluents 21 without influence on the ethanol yield and fermentation time the resulting concentrated effluent reduced energy requirement for vinasse drying but did not eliminate the evaporation step and liquids emissions into the environment further physical chemical or biological post treatments are then required to reduce the polluting characteristics of the ultimate effluent after recycling of the vinasse 2 3 membrane system filtration systems in wastewater treatment use membranes to concentrate the suspended solids from a slurry in a concentrate stream and to release the depolluted water in the permeate stream several technologies including microfiltration nanofiltration or reverse osmosis offer different cut off limits depending on the molecular weight of the particles to strip out from the water it can be considered as an intermediate operation to separate solutes or as a final depolluting step before discharging of the water as a final step this operation is envisaged in replacement of the evaporation step mainly because it reduces significantly the energy requirements down to 7 9 kj per kg of water removed as compared to evaporation that requires about 1300 kj per kg of water removed 23 each existing methods was essayed on vinasse with various success see table 3 microfiltration systems are able to work directly with thin stillage for total solid concentration between 7 and 35 using a 5 stages membrane system 23 or can be used as a tertiary treatment for aerobically treated distillery effluents in combination with nanofiltration resulting in high chemical oxygen demand removal a reduction of total dissolved solids and color removal in the ranges of 96 99 5 85 95 and 98 99 5 respectively 24 for lower molecular weight particle separation from wastewater reverse osmosis can be applied this method is a membrane process used for separation or concentration of soluble from aqueous solutions briefly it consists in circulating a pressurized solution tangentially to a high rejection membrane meanwhile low pressure is applied to the other side the resultant pressure has to exceed the osmotic pressure to produce a flux of purified water through the membrane and a stock of concentrated solution 25 however reverse osmosis can be used only with water wastes with acidic or neutral ph 26 alcohol distilleries use large volumes of water which in some process is recovered as condensates during stillage concentration however the inhibitory molecules contained in these condensates prevent their discharge without further treatment attempts for reducing water consumption of distilleries have led to the idea of recycling water from condensates after elimination of the inhibitory solutes reverse osmosis have been applied for the purpose in order to reduce the small organic solutes of the vinasse 26 permeates were checked for inhibitory effects on saccharomyces cerevisae and the treatment proved suitable for subsequent recycling in an alcohol production step except at ph 6 where 10 inhibition was still present the authors also envisaged a double reverse osmosis or coupling with another process to eliminate all traces of inhibitors when applied directly to distillery effluent permeate fluxes obtained ranged from 35 to 120 l m2 h depending on the membrane used 27 target solute rejections were comprised between 82 2 and 99 2 and the permeate inhibitory effect on microbial growth was between 0 and 5 2 in order to improve efficiency of the process combination of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis at a pilot plant scale was tested 28 in this improved process nanofiltration was found to be particularly efficient for color removal while reverse osmosis resulted in a reduction of 99 8 of total dissolved solids 99 9 of cod and 99 9 of potassium contained in the permeate however filtration systems suffer from filter clogging that limit the concentration of the feed and reduce the permeate flux other complementary technics were developed to improve the efficiency of the process that were implemented for vinasse for example it is possible to work on the effluent before filtration by centrifugation and precipitation this resulted in a separation efficiency that was increased from 46 to 75 and a permeate flux also improved from 45 to 50 to 79 l m2 h 29 it was also possible to work on the membranes directly by incorporating some adjuvants such as graphene in the membrane which resulted in an increase of the flux trough the membrane from 7 to 17 l m2 h 30 the most reported method for vinasse filtration improvement is the coagulation flocculation method flocculation is the agglomeration of solid particles from slurry caused by addition of a chemical or biological additive resulting in flocs formation and their separation from the solution 31 flocculation of vinasse has been studied using commercial polyelectrolytes resulting in a total suspended solid concentrated from 0 15 w w to 40 w w and a filtration flux increased by six fold as compared to a process based on centrifugation 31 the use of non metallic polyaspartic acid resulted in a reduced inhibition of the recycled wastewater in the ethanol process contrasting with polyaluminium chloride polyacrylamide flocculant or no flocculant 32 using polyglutamic acid with sodium hypochlorite resulted in 70 decrease of the turbidity and reduced chemical oxygen demand by 79 5 33 the use of plant seed have also been reported for the coagulation of vinasse with respect to color removal kernel aqueous extract of moringa oleifera seeds displayed a maximum of 53 and 64 color removal using sodium chloride and potassium chloride salts respectively 34 2 4 adsorption processes adsorption of organic pollutants into porous material is the simplest method of purification of water traditionally activated carbon is used for this purpose principally to removed color from effluents others adsorption techniques can be used to separate specific species from a wastewater for example potassium ions have been purified from distillery wastewater using cation exchange resin 2 4 1 activated carbon activated carbon is a high adsorption capacity material widely employed for removal of color and specific organic pollutants thanks to a large surface area and microporous structure color removal capacity of 19 activated carbon from bagasse bagasse fly ash sawdust wood ash and rice husk ash was examinated on biomethanated distillery effluent 35 they obtained a maximum color removal of 50 with phosphoric acid carbonized bagasse however none of the samples produced give better performance than commercial activated carbons with over 80 color removal additionally chemical oxygen demand total organic carbon phenol and total kjeldahl nitrogen were reduced by 23 6 16 6 32 8 and 24 8 respectively with phosphoric acid activated bagasse the synergistic effect of ozone oxidation and granular activated carbons on vinasse treatment was investigated 36 they found that the combined process affected negatively the removal efficiency by limiting the cod removal and color the negative effect decreased by increasing ph value of the influent authors proposed that the negative effect could be due to lower adsorption of degradation products from oxidation process onto granular activated carbon than primary organic molecules in vinasse 2 4 2 cation exchange resin vinasse presents a high concentration of potassium up to 17 g l 37 this high concentration limits its usage in one of the possible use of this effluent animal feed because of toxic effect 38 potassium ions extraction from vinasses using a strong acid cation exchange resin was studied 39 a maximum extraction capacity of 56 79 mg k per ml of resin and a 99 6 elution of the concentrated k from the resin was attained concluding that the methodology was a potential means for industrial production of potassium salt altogether with the production of a vinasse which might be used as animal feed 2 5 physical treatments 2 5 1 cavitation cavitation meaning formation growth and collapse of microbubbles in milliseconds time intervals and releasing large amount of energy can be used to destroy contaminants in water 40 this phenomenon can be performed by sonochemical cavitation using ultrasound or by hydrodynamic cavitation involving velocity variation which results in pressure variation in a liquid circulating through a specific geometry such as a venturi system 41 ultrasound irradiated wastewater was proved to be less recalcitrant to biological degradation than non treated stillage and can reach up to 44 cod degradation with us treatment as compared to a 25 in non treated stillage 42 the technique has been combined with other processes such as ozonation 43 or enzymatic treatment 44 while us did not interact synergistically with ozone when used sequentially with cellulase containing endoglucanase cellobiohydrolase and β glucosidase the combined treatment yielded higher cod removal than for each treatment applied separately in this case a 4 fold increase in the initial oxidation rate was observed as compared to untreated batches hydrodynamic cavitation has also been reported for the degradation of synthetic wastewater containing specific pollutants such as textile dyes and pesticides 45 46 as a pretreatment for bio methanated distillery wastewater hydrocavitation resulted in cod and toc reduction by 32 2 and 31 4 respectively along with a color reduction of 48 47 2 5 2 catalytic thermolysis catalytic thermolysis is the thermal degradation of organic and inorganic substances in an aqueous solution or suspension by means of elevated temperatures and pressures using cuo catalyst in anoxic conditions at 140 c this technique showed a maximal 60 cod removal in the wastewater along with the production of a solid residue usable as a fuel in combustion furnaces with a heating value of 21 7 mj kg 1 48 the process can be improved by addition of oxygen or air and is called wet oxidation this process convert insoluble organic matter into simpler soluble compounds which are in turns oxidized and eventually converted to carbon dioxide and water without emissions of no x so2 hcl dioxins furans or fly ash 49 the process can be applied with or without catalyst without catalyst the process used as a pretreatment can enhance the biodegradability of the effluent for aerobic digestion with cod reduction up to 67 7 whereas the untreated effluent reached cod reduction by only 22 5 50 this treatment also degraded melanoidins up to 97 8 and reduced the toxicity of the effluent as illustrated by positive germination test up to no dilution condition 51 the use of catalysts may be very advantageous because it can lower operating temperature and pressure thus lower energy consumption compared to non catalytic wet oxidation different catalysts can be used such as pt al2o3 mn ce oxides or cu ii exchanged nay zeolite at a concentration of 1 among them the highest toc removal from vinasse was observed with mn ce oxides the catalysts were found to be very effective for short contact times of 10 min but cu ii nay catalyst loose catalyst activity over time due to coke laydown 52 2 6 oxidative process oxidation can be envisaged to lower the organic matter contained in vinasse the oxidants are chemical agents used through catalytic wet oxidation see section 2 5 photocatalysis or ozone addition a synthesis of these techniques applied to vinasse from various origins is summarized in table 4 2 6 1 photocatalysis photocatalysis is the catalysis of a photochemical reaction at a solid surface energy from a light source excites electrons of the catalyst creating electron hole pairs the holes can react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals or directly with organic compounds by electron transfer the electrons can react with oxygen contributing to oxidation reactions 53 the process has been tested with distillery effluents using visible and uv light or sunlight catalysis with aluminium based nanocatalyst under two 24 w fluorescent lamps produced visible light during 3 h and resulted in 80 vinasse decolorization at 475 nm 54 the uv light achieved color removal of only 54 for the distillery wastewater with tio2 zeolite catalyst 55 photocatalysis of distillery vinasses with solar radiations during 5 consecutive days with nb2o5 tio2 as catalyst reduced total organic compounds in vinasse by 55 as compared to a 4 decrease without catalyst 56 the efficiency of the photocatalytic treatment depended mostly on the quantity of catalyst added and was best at low ph and room temperature whereas agitation has very little effect 54 a decrease in vinasse toxicity can be obtained with photocatalysis with nb2o5 tio2 as showed using bioassays with artemia saline 56 although it has little effect on cod removal 55 the use of photocatalysis in combination with anaerobic digestion can improve the quality of the treated wastewater by reducing the color 55 2 6 2 ozone ozone is an unstable gas which can be produced at the point of use acting as a strong oxidizing agent its effectiveness in converting recalcitrant compounds into less toxic and more biodegradable ones is based on the direct effects produced by the oxidative activity of molecular ozone and on the indirect effect of products of the reaction such as oh radicals 43 the gas has been used for pretreatment of aerobic digestion of distiller effluents and enhanced by 25 times the subsequent aerobic oxidation rate at a maximum of 45 6 cod reduction as compared to 1 8 cod reduction for the control 43 the gas can also be used prior to anaerobic digestion of vinasse resulting in a 50 reduction of phenols without effect on the total organic carbon content but leading to enhanced methane yield coefficients and methane production rates by 13 6 and 41 16 respectively 57 ozone could also be used in combination with other techniques such as electrocoagulation 58 2 7 electro chemical treatment 2 7 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation generates through the electrochemical dissolution of a sacrificial metal anode in situ colloids destabilizing metallic coagulant cations and simultaneous formation of hydroxyl ions and hydrogen gas from water at the cathode similarly as for flocculation cationic species favor floc formation which traps the contaminants while the hydrogen gas acts as a float for these particles 59 fenton reactions involve addition of hydrogen peroxide to ferrous ions in acidic medium to form ferric ions and free hydroxyl radicals ferric ions further react with hydrogen peroxide to enhance the oxidative power electro fenton is a combination of coagulation and fenton reaction that generates the hydrogen peroxide in situ using a carbonaceous cathode 60 the combination of electro fenton hydrogen peroxide generated electrochemically and electro coagulation ferrous ions generated electrochemically is called peroxi coagulation iron anode for ferrous ions formation and carbonaceous cathode for hydrogen peroxide production 61 laboratory scale experiments were performed to decolorize vinasse using electrocoagulation and electro fenton process 59 the results obtained for electrocoagulation showed 79 color removal using iron electrodes arranged with 0 5 cm of inter electrode space and at ph 7 5 a current intensity 300 rpm agitation speed during 2 h of electrolysis time in electro fenton 44 vinasse color removal was observed using carbon electrodes with 0 5 cm inter electrode distance ph 3 4 a current intensity 20 mg l feso4 and agitation speed of 400 rpm during 3 h of electrolysis time another hybrid technique of electrocoagulation combined with ozone was investigated by 58 for the removal of color and cod in distillery effluent the coupling with ozone is interesting as it involves direct attack of fe2 with o3 to generate the intermediate feo 2 the intermediate species produce oh radicals which accelerate cod and color removal 58 a combined technique associating electrocoagulation and ozonation was even more effective than each alone the maximum removal of cod efficiency was found to be 83 at current density of 3 a m 2 initial cod concentration 2500 ppm initial ph 6 and ozone gas mixture flow rate 15 l min 1 requiring an energy consumption of 5 1 kwh m 3 the complete color removal was observed within 2 h of process time 2 7 2 electrodialysis most publications on vinasse treatment focus on reducing main parameters as chemical and biological oxygen demand total organic carbon or color electrodialysis is the extraction of electrolytes from salty water through an ionic exchange membrane under an electric field 62 an electrodialysis method was proposed for treatment of potassium in beet vinasse 13 a decrease in conductivity was reported along with the process that was associated to the cation concentration evolution potassium concentration fall from 10 to 0 5 g l while the decreasing of calcium and sodium ion levels was very small from 0 3 to 0 25 g l and 2 1 5 g l respectively resulting in a selectivity of the process for specific ions 2 8 microbiological treatment the anaerobic microbiological process is one of the most used treatments of vinasse applied to vinasse in thermophilic or mesophilic digestion it leads to a decrease in the overall content of pollutants but to an increase in color of the spent wash thus requiring additional treatments many physicochemical treatments described earlier have been applied in combination with anaerobic digestion because they are already well integrated in current ethanol production plants this treatment produces biogas while reducing the organic load of the effluent and as such it can contribute to the production of energy other biological treatments exist aimed at reducing the pollution load of the vinasse and at focussing on discoloration and elimination of heavy metals 2 8 1 decolorization several microbiological treatments have been reported for color removal in the literature 63 67 the persistent brown color of the vinasse cannot be degraded by conventional anaerobic treatments and can even be increased due to repolymerization of complex compounds however there are a number of microbial strains or consortium capable of significantly increasing the decolorization of vinasse bulk microorganisms from the soil were found to be able to decolorize molasses spent wash by 81 after 18 days of incubation when 10 w v of soil and 12 5 v v of vinasse have been used 63 additionally bacteria isolated from soil contaminated with distillery effluent showed a maximum decolorization of 72 6 along with a toxicity removal on germination and growth of vigna radiata mung beans 64 similarly the filamentous fungi flavodon flavus immobilized on polyurethane foam displayed up to 73 decolorization of 10 diluted vinasse concomitantly with a 68 decrease of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 65 the decolorized vinasse was found to be less toxic as shown by tests on oreochromis mossambicus that revealed no damage of the liver in contrast to untreated effluents 65 it would also be interesting to test the reduction of toxicity of decolorized vinasse on other organisms such as zebrafish see also ref 9 or trout cell lines combination of chemical and biological treatments by polyaluminium chloride and aspergillus niger of non diluted anaerobically digested spentwash reached up to 86 8 decolorization 66 basidiomycetes are also proving to be good candidates for vinasse decolorization pleurotus sajor caju showed color and turbidity reduction of vinasse by 99 2 and 99 7 respectively and a specific reduction of phenols and total suspended solids by 98 2 and 97 6 respectively 68 the color of the vinasse arises from the phenolic compounds resulting from the degradation of the fibrous feedstocks the melanoidins generated by the maillard reactions during the heating of the effluent the caramels from overheated sugars and the furfurals resulting from the acid hydrolysis 69 the phenolic compounds present in the vinasse could be degraded up to 74 after a 3 days aerobic treatment of vinasse with the fungus penicillium decumbens 70 the microorganism can be acclimatized to phenol by progressive contact treatment acclimated activated sludge showed increased cod removal efficiency from 19 to 31 for non acclimated sludge which could be further improved to 82 and 87 with 10 fold and 50 fold dilution of wastewater respectively 71 the question of color removal can also be treated through bacterial consortia bharagava et al 67 tested axenic or consortium bacteria for the natural and synthetic elimination of melanoidin and demonstrated improved efficiency of mixed bacteria on axenic cultures 2 8 2 heavy metals removal the removal of heavy metals is generally achieved by physicochemical and biological methods surprisingly in our survey we only found biological methods but no physicochemical treatment to treat the sugarcane vinasse the use of the actinobacterium streptomyces sp mc1 has been reported for the removal of heavy metals from vinasse 72 potentially toxic metals such as mn fe zn as and pb have been effectively removed during bacterial growth mn and fe were removed at 95 and 62 respectively after 4 days of aerobic microbial treatment zn as and pb were completely eliminated at the end of the culture period the possibility of cultivating an indeterminate consortium of sulphate reducing bacteria on vinasse as substrate has been studied for the removal of heavy metals present in mining wastewater 73 anaerobic sludge has been enriched by feeding of vinasse lactate and sulphate the elimination of cadmium and zinc in the form of metal sulfide was evaluated using this procedure the authors obtained reduction percentages greater than 99 for both metals 2 9 enzymatic process the vinasse may contain organic compounds which are difficult to degrade such as residues of fibers of the plant feedstock or the yeast cells generated during the alcohol production process these compounds represent a possible complementary source of nutrients but most of them can hardly be metabolized by biological processes as previously discussed commercial cellulase enzymes containing endoglucanase ec 3 2 1 4 cellobiohydrolase ec 3 2 1 91 and β glucosidase ec 3 2 1 21 were used as pre treatment techniques to degrade fibrous materials in the vinasse 44 the effectiveness of the technique was tested by subjecting the effluent to subsequent aerobic biological oxidation at the optimum ph value of 4 8 with 50 units of the enzyme cocktail and after 24 h of incubation enzymatic pre treatment resulted in a 7 increase in cod removal when aerobic oxidation was subsequently applied to the must yeast cells contain nutrients that can be valued but are generally not accessible to the biological process such as anaerobic degradation due to yeast cell wall thickness the enzymatic digestion of yeast cells using lyticase α amylase cellulase β glucosidase β glucanase lipase protease enzyme complex and papain was evaluated for their effect on the anaerobic digestion of whisky spent wash and pot ale 74 protease associated beta glucanase showed synergistic activity reaching more than 90 yeast cell digestion at 37 c whereas papain reached 95 degradation in spent wash at 50 c anaerobic digestion of the enzymatically treated pot ale has shown cod reductions of 87 compared with only 13 without enzymes 2 10 phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technology that uses plants to reduce and degrade polluting organic compounds such as those found in vinasse artificial wetlands are one of the technologies used for this purpose the main optimization parameters of the technics are the flow of passage or recycling of the effluent as well as the plant species used the technology was proved to be applicable for exemple on acid effluent such as acid mine drainage 75 the performance of a subsurface flow constructed wetlands planted with pontederia sagittata was evaluated for the treatment of diluted stillage subjected to ph adjustment at 6 76 surface cod loading rates up to 94 8 g cod m2 d were fed the system was able to remove up to 80 6 87 3 76 0 58 7 and 69 4 for cod bod5 total nitrogen nitrates and sulfates respectively depending on the hydraulic retention time hrt no phosphate and potassium removals were observed the use of living organisms requires working at low temperature and atmospheric pressure but avoids the need to add harmful chemicals limits energy intake and causes decolorization and cod reduction similar to oxidative processes however the treatment time is usually longer than the physicochemical process and for some microbial species it may be necessary to make special nutritional adjustments to the waste nevertheless as depollution and growth occur biological organisms produce potentially valuable metabolites that can further reduce the cost of the process compared to physicochemical processes typically the main treatment system used to reduce the polluant effect of vinasse is anaerobic digestion due to the concomitant production of valuable biogas while reducing the polluting characteristics of the stillage thus most biological treatments of vinasse are considered a production step rather than a final depollution treatment and are discussed in section 3 as potential upgrading of wastewater from distillery instead of a simple bioremediation process 3 distillery vinasses waste or resource vinasse is considered as a toxic waste and adequate treatment must be considered before being discharged into the environment it can also be considered as a valuable by product for several applications such as agricultural fertilizer soil conditioner pest control additive and cultural medium for microbial biomass production this latter application has generated growing interest among researchers for the last few years for molecules or energy production several studies have envisaged vinasse as a resource material rather than a waste 3 1 agricultural value so far the main use of vinasse with or without treatment was its application as fertilizer for agricultural fields its composition brings to the soil fertilizing elements for plants and organic matter that affect the microbial community and indirectly the physical properties of the soil it is also a potential composting material for the production of soil amendment 3 1 1 growth promoter vinasse has demonstrated interesting possibilities in agricultural field as growth promoter field experiments in maize cultivation revealed that the application of distillery effluents resulted in increased leaf area in higher chlorophyll content nitrate reductase activity total dry weight and grain yields biomethanated spent wash showed better grain yield around 36 9 q ha 1 than raw vinasse with 32 2 q ha 1 77 same authors have also studied the effect of stillage on groundnut in field with the same parameters 78 or on seed germination in tomato chilli bottle gourd cucumber and onion 79 same effect of vinasse was observed in maize and in groundnut cultivation including increased total chlorophyll content crop growth rate total dry matter nutrient uptake and seed yield compared to controls but in the case of groundnut inhibition of nodulation and decreased nitrogen fixation was observed concerning vegetables the distillery effluent showed no inhibitory effect on seed germination at low concentration except for tomatoes for onion the germination was 84 at 10 concentration as compared to 63 for untreated cultures when applied at 75 or 100 vinasse completely stopped germination of seeds 79 mung bean and green gram have also been tested with distillery effluents with or without anaerobic pre treatment 80 81 these plants were negatively impacted by addition of raw vinasse concentration as low as 5 anaerobic pretreatment was able to reduce the toxicity of the stillage which can be used up to 10 concentration for irrigation and showed higher growth in root length shoot length number of leaves biomass photosynthetic pigment protein and starch other plants such as indian mustard were able to sustain higher concentration of post methanated waste up to 50 without inhibition effects 82 special care should be taken when applying vinasse to the crops depending on the species it could be considered as a good amendment reducing the need for commercial fertilizer however its application should be limited due to imbalanced nutrient content and high salinity leading to the necessity of fertilizer complementation thus liquid fertilizer formula for hydroponic cultures has been produced using vinasse 83 the formula containing 10 vinasse complemented with other nutrients was tested with lettuce watercress and rocket similar results were obtained with the formula containing vinasse and a commercial fertilizer 3 1 2 soil erosion control vinasse applications on field revealed several physico and bio chemical impacts at the physical level its application also leads to modifications in the behavior of soil when liquid effluent was applied to the ground its hydrological behavior was modified and when simulated rain was applied earlier runoff was observed for soils treated with vinasse 84 however a high dose of vinasse protected soils from erosion due to rainfall and decreased soil loss and sediment concentration this result could be explained by the organic content of the soil incorporated after vinasse application 85 when vinasse was applied to the soil larger aggregates and higher carbon content were found moreover aggregates stability was higher with non treated vinasse than with post methanated effluents probably due to its higher organic carbon content higher carbon content may stimulate microbial activity and secretion of polysaccharides causing stabilization of soil aggregates reduction of runoff issue with liquid vinasse has been attempted using biochar from liquid vinasses 86 the time before runoff when biochar was applied 24 h and 48 h before simulated rain was increased by 55 1 and 71 7 respectively as compared to control moreover the runoff volume decreased by 98 46 and 46 39 with biochar application for 24 and 48 h time delay between application and rain simulation respectively finally least soil loss of 1 12 g and sediment concentration of 1 44 g l 1 occurred with the 48 h time delay treatment 3 1 3 composting composting is an aerobic process that biodegrades heterogeneous organic substrates and stabilises organic matter for use in soil conditioning providing additional nutrients as well as stabilizing soils this process was tested on vinasse mixed with various other wastes mixture with grape marc were incubated in a laboratory scale reactor at 55 c for 43 days 87 the addition of vinasse affected the composting process both positively and negatively the nutrients provided by the vinasse promoted microbial growth however an increase in salinity and a decrease in ph were also observed when vinasse additions were increased leading to limited microbial activity the authors then concluded that 10 20 addition of vinasse would result in the best compromise mixture with fly ash was used in a vermicomposting process with two epigeic earthworms eisenia fetida and eudrilus eugeniae 88 effect of waste mixture was assessed with cellulolytic fungal population and cellulase activity during vermicomposting for mixtures including from 25 to 50 vinasse the cellulolytic fungi biomass increased and a higher cellulase activity was observed no differences were observed between the two worm species investigated conversely use of vinasse in vermicomposting with rabbit manure showed a negative impact on eisenia fetida 89 when vinasse was integrated at 10 in the mixture weight and number of worm were 25 and 28 lower respectively by comparison with rabbit manure alone when 50 vinasse was mixed with rabbit manure these parameters were 54 and 50 lower than rabbit manure alone respectively the high amount of soluble salts and phosphate are thought to be responsible for these effects 3 2 biomass production the high organic loads of vinasse is seen as a potential advantage as growth medium for microbial production microalgae and fungal biomass have been identified as potential source of food or feed because of their content in desirable molecules such as single cell protein antioxidant or lipids production of microalgae on vinasses has been investigated 90 91 although it has a dark brown color autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic growth can be obtained on stillage if adequately diluted vinasse concentration up to 5 g l was studied in dark fermentations and in photobioreactors 90 in dark fermentation 5 g l beet vinasse was used to produce up to 4 8 g l of spirulina maxima biomass with a specific growth rate near 0 1 d 1 in addition continuous cultivation in a tubular photobioreactor yielded biomass at 8 g l using 2 g l of vinasse supplemented medium the same microalgae was studied by 91 under autotrophic without vinasse dark heterotrophic with 0 1 v v or 1 0 v v sugarcane vinasse and mixotrophic conditions maximum biomass production occurred after 25 days in the mixotrophic cultivation and produced up to 0 716 g l when medium was supplemented with vinasse at 1 0 v v whereas autotrophic cultures produced 20 lower biomass autotrophic conditions gave a specific growth rate of 0 97 d 1 heterotrophic conditions with 0 1 v v vinasse gave a specific growth rate of 0 54 d 1 but increasing the vinasse concentration at 1 0 v v gave a higher specific growth rate of 1 02 d 1 on the contrary in mixotrophic cultures increasing vinasse concentration from 0 1 to 1 0 v v led to a decrease of the specific growth rate from 0 28 d 1 to 0 14 d 1 respectively based on these results authors used a vinasse concentration of 3 v v in a cyclic light autotrophic dark heterotrophic microalgae culture and obtained a concentration of 0 609 g l 1 at the 7th day with protein content up to 77 3 w w production of fungal biomass on vinasse is also considered as an attractive source of proteins 92 the production of the edible fungus rhizopus oligosporus was studied in an airlift bioreactor filled with 75 v v sugarcane vinasse and supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus the highest fungal biomass concentration obtained was 3 79 g l after 3 days cultivation protein content of the dry biomass was 50 and lipids reached 3 44 composition of the biomass in essential amino acids was comparable to that of commercial protein sources for aquatic feeds except for methionine and phenylalanine despite the possibility to develop processes using vinasse as a medium for single cell biomass production an even more attractive way of using this effluent is to produce value added molecules 3 3 production of value added molecules many organic molecules have already been produced using vinasse based medium including alcohols organic acids polymers proteins and others underlying the ability to valorize this nutrient containing liquid 3 3 1 alcohol production vinasse have been used to produced ethanol 93 butanol 94 or xylitol 95 ethanol could be produced at 5 g l using the edible ascomycete fungus neurospora intermedia in continuous culture without nutrient addition also butanol and xylitol could be produced respectively using clostridium pasteurianum on a glycerol supplemented vinasse medium or using debaryomyces hanseniion wine vinasses upon xylose addition metals present in the stillage particularly zn showed a negative effect on maximal xylitol yield decreasing from 0 62 to 0 28 g g when zn content increased from 1 3 to 3 5 mg kg respectively 3 3 2 organic acids organic acids could also be produced on vinasse lactic acid is the most studied organic acid because it is a versatile chemical bulk integrated in many industrial processes as acidifying and flavouring agent as softener for leather as antimicrobial and preserver substance or as chemical a remarkable use is also found as a precursor for poly lactic acid polymers in the pharmaceutical and plastic industry thanks to many favorable characteristics like biodegradability biocompatibility and elasticity lactic acid fermentation of the stillage can be performed with lactobacillus rhamnosus without mineral or nitrogen supplementation 96 this microorganism yielded lactic acid up to 0 90 g g with a productivity of 1 48 g l h improvement of the process by immobilization of the biomass on zeolite was also assessed 97 it proved to facilitate separation of biomass and its reuse in repeated batch cycles with a yield of 0 96 g g and a productivity of 1 69 g l h further optimizations of the immobilization have been worked out with mg modified zeolite 98 however despite higher cell immobilization higher lactic acid concentration of 47 6 g l and an equivalent yield of 0 96 g g than simple zeolite immobilization productivity was only 1 41 g l h with mg modified zeolite improvement of lactic acid production have also been studied through pretreatment of concentrated sorghum vinasse with microwave and naoh before simultaneous saccharification and fermentation process 99 microwave and naoh at 0 06 g per gram of dry weight vinasse were used to degrade hemicellulose and lignin the two treatments had a synergistic effects on lactic acid yield in these conditions lactic acid yielded 86 0 mg per gram of dried vinasse production of other organic acid compounds including butyric acid acetic acid or long chain fatty acids were also investigated 100 101 butyric isobutyric acid and acetic acid were produced up to 10 1 g l and 3 6 g l respectively using kissiris immobilized mixed bacterial cultures in continuous anaerobic acidogenesis of non sterile ph 8 adjusted vinasses 100 eicosapentaenoic acid c20 5 n 3 can also be produced during growth of the fungus pythium irregulare using vinasse based medium the yield and productivity were 243 mg l and 27 mg l day respectively in an optimized temperature shift culture process 101 3 3 3 polymers numerous polymers are produced using microorganisms as exemplified by synthesis of polysaccharides from ganoderma lucidum up to 7 50 g l 102 polyhydroxyalkanoates from bacillus tequilensis accumulated at 40 dry cell weight 103 or cellulose from gluconacetobacter xylinus with a yield of 57 sugar converted into cellulose 104 all these strains have been grown on vinasse either as the main source of nutrients either as a medium additive the use of vinasse in the medium globally led to improvement of the production and a decrease of the cost associated to the medium 3 3 4 enzymes vinasse are mainly produced from plants which contained lignocellulosic materials at the end of the ethanol process lignocellulose often remains in the stillage or can be added to activate the lignocellulosic catabolic pathways of microorganisms sets of enzymes from wild strains have been produced using this effluent as carbon source for growth anaerobically treated vinasse was used for the production of cellulases from aspergillus ellipticus under solid state fermentation using wheat straw as substrate 105 β glucosidase and endo β 1 4 glucanase activities were detected at a level of 26 7 and 130 9 units per g of substrate respectively the same medium could also serve for xylanase production up to 5600 u g by a strain of burkholderia sp 106 or up to 6 6 u ml by aspergillus heteromorphus in the presence of lignocellulose 107 3 3 5 others molecules aliphatic ketones β carotene or emulsifier production have been reported from microbial strains grown on vinasse fermentation of the filamentous fungus phycomyces nitens produced β carotene at 4 1 4 2 mg l in vinasse with light stimulation 108 aliphatic ketones were produced by a two step process consisting of a first hydrothermal treatment producing a mixture of cyclic compounds aromatics ketones ethers esters carboxylic acids and aldehydes residues and followed by a second catalytic reaction over a zro2 feox catalyst to produce aliphatic ketones from esters and carboxylic acids 109 finally emulsifier production by yeast 110 or actinobacterium 72 can be obtained when grown on vinasse the yeast emulsifier consisted of 1 4 α and 1 3 β d glucans protein bound of 1 93 105 da containing 96 of carbohydrates mainly as glucose with minor amount of mannose and 4 of protein built from 17 amino acids with a major content of serine and alanine 3 4 energetic value since distilleries use steam to separate ethanol from water it uses relatively high amount of energy this energy need can be satisfied with methane produced by anaerobic fermentation of the stillage other valuable energetic products have to be produced to meet the growing energy demand of future societies based on non fossil energy sources hydrogen is envisaged as a platform molecule for future energy systems a future source of hydrogen is thought to be through electrolysis of water with renewable electricity from photovoltaic or wind farms fermentation of vinasse is another possibility currently under investigation for hydrogen production gases are easily transportable through pipe systems whereas they do not suit easily in mobility system such as car as compared to liquid fuels the two main fuels for transportation are gasoline and diesel these two petroleum derived fuels have potential renewable homologs namely ethanol and biodiesel biodiesel is the product obtained from methanolysis of vegetable animal or microbial oils the microbial oil production have been investigated on distillery vinasse and proved to be qualitatively adapted for biodiesel production 3 4 1 biogas anaerobic digestion is considered an attractive biotechnological method degrading a variety of organic wastes such as poultry litters dead animals or cellulosic materials 1 111 114 the process requires the widely intricate activity of a microbial community involving sequential catabolic steps firstly organic compounds are hydrolyzed into short chain fatty acids as lactate propionate and butyrate these fatty acids are further degraded to acetate and h2 co2 during the second step of acidogenesis and finally methanogenesis occurs with acetate and h2 co2 conversion into methane 115 the entire process has been studied during annual variation 116 as a way to improve the ethanol industry from economic environmental and energetic perspectives 6 by producing electricity 117 118 and reducing water consumption 119 it is estimated to reduce gas consumption of ethanol plant between 43 and 59 with the methane produced from vinasse while saving an estimated 10 million for a facility producing 360 million l ethanol year 120 moreover ch4 is being commonly used as compressed natural gas which has been regarded as a cleaner energy carrier in comparison to gasoline or diesel 121 attempts to improve efficiency of the methanation process as summarized in table 5 have been carried out such as pretreatment of the vinasses with combination of ozone uv and tio2 122 biological pretreatment with filamentous fungi 123 co feeding 112 114 or immobilization of the methanogens bacteria 124 modifications of the vinasse composition are suspected to be responsible for the improvements observed in the case of ozone uv and tio2 treatment 122 among the possible modifications reducing phenolic content of the waste is probably a key objective because it was proposed as the explicative parameter for fungal treatment efficiency 123 improvement in anaerobic conditions can also lead to a better yield as demonstrated by the 22 improvement when immobilized biomass was used five types of bioreactors are usually used to produce biogas from vinasse these are summarized in table 6 in anaerobic digestion growth of the biomass is slow resulting in low sludge production but limiting the flux of influent to treat to overcome this limitation reactors which separate the hydraulic retention time hrt from the solid retention time srt have been implemented table 6 the continuously stirred tank reactor is the simplest reactor design used in the anaerobic digestion of vinasse this kind of reactor can reach up to 0 7 l methane g organic matter removed from vinasse but within high hrt of 20 days 120 thus high rate reactors have been studied to improve the performances of anaerobic digestion column reactors with sludge blanket have been associated with a filter to retain the biomass and to reach high rate of effluent consumption this type of reactor significantly reduce to 5 days the hrt without instabilities of the process producing up to 6 l methane l effluent days 125 anaerobic bed reactors are column reactors filled with lining in which the biomass can be fixed and let the effluent to treat circulates fixed bed and the fluidized bed reactors are the two types of bed reactor they have been studied to treat vinasse the fluidized bed reactors turned out to be better with lower hrt of 3 days than the 8 days of fixed film bed reactors and 5 times higher methane production potentially better results can be obtained from thermophilic processes as compared with mesophilic biochemical methane potential bmp assays produced 49 l ch4 and 65 l ch4 per l stillage from mesophilic and thermophilic digesters respectively however in continuous flow studies with a semi continuous digester at organic loadings rate olr of 4 25 cod l days unstable performance was observed for the thermophilic digester at 60 hrt 126 whereas using a completely stirred tank reactors steady state was achieved at 30 20 and 15 days hrt digester failure was only observed at a 12 day hrt 120 the inherently sensitiveness of methanogenic bacteria to environmental parameters can destabilize the process in case of abrupt changes to prevent instabilities in the process due to sensitiveness of methanogenic bacteria a biphasic reactor was implemented to treat distillery wastewater 127 129 the acidogenic step was carried out in a first reactor and the methanogenic one in the following the bacteria in the acidogenic reactor are less sensitive to environmental changes and constitute a buffer for methanogenic bacteria the design allowed methanogenic reactor to resist to significant changes in the ph but organic loading rate higher than 11 33 kg cod m3 d and hydraulic retention time below 10 days were harmful for cod removal and biogas production 127 other authors compared the two stage process to the single stage process 129 a maximum methane yield of 0 33 l ch4 g codadded was achieved in the two stage process while a single stage process achieved a maximum yield of only 0 26 l ch4 g codadded leading to energy outcome increase by 18 5 in the total energy yield using two stage anaerobic digestion as compared to single stage process the two stage continuous anaerobic reactor has been tested in combination with filtration at methanogenic effluent exit for the treatment of sugar cane vinasses overall improvement in cod removal efficiencies reached 96 9 although membrane fouling issue was observed 128 despite the advantages of methane its potential is limited by its narrow flammability slow burning speed and high ignition temperature 121 leading to poor combustion efficiency and an intensive energy requirement when used to power vehicles hydrogen is a possible additive for methane characteristics improvement hydrogen and methane production from vinasse in one reactor was demonstrated leading to production of 4 7 l h mixed gases with proportion of hydrogen varying from 60 to 23 121 3 4 2 biohydrogen biohydrogen is hydrogen derived from renewable energy sources some microorganisms are known to produce hydrogen either by photocatalytic or dark fermentative process microbiologically produced hydrogen was a clean efficient and environment friendly fuel since it has high energy content 122 kj g and produced only water after combustion 130 anaerobic dark fermentations presented a number of advantages such as higher hydrogen production rate and day and night production over phototrophic process indeed this process has been widely used with vinasse table 7 resumes some performance of dark fermentative biohydrogen production from vinasse theoretical maximum yield of hydrogen production is 12 mol h2 mol glucose two phenomenons limit the real yield of hydrogen production in fermentation process the first is the incomplete degradation of organic compounds by the fermentative pathway leading to formation of small molecules as lactic acid butyric acid and propionic acid which are not convertible by the fermentative route but can be used in photocatalytic process 131 133 using vinasse as cultural medium makes the photocatalytic process unusable due to the dark brown color of the waste as such dark fermentation was the only reported way to produce hydrogen from it at the exception of one attempt with sequential fermentative and phototrophic process using diluted effluent in the latter phototrophic step 131 the fermentative process yielded hydrogen production at a rate of 340 mmol h2 g cod where the establishment of lactobacillus related microorganisms prevailed improvement of 5 5 mmol h2 g cod was obtained using rhodopseudomonas related microorganisms in the subsequent phototrophic process with diluted effluent at 10 v v the second factor limiting hydrogen production is the risk of further hydrogen consumption when dissolved in the medium for example in a homoacetogenesis h2 co2 conversion to acetate step due to possible microbial methanogens contamination in the medium to overcome this limitation thermophilic process are used to reduce the solubility of h2 in the medium and to limit the formation of acetic acid via the homoacetogenic pathway 134 modifications of the process were implemented to increase the yield of h2 production pretreatment of the seeds for selection of particular characteristics can be performed 135 using acid ph 3 for 24 h or heat 80 c for 15 min pretreatment had some effects on microbial community in the reactor and was reflected by different lactic acid profiles during hydrogen production lactic acid is a metabolite normally associated with decreased h2 production clostridium was predominant in the heat pretreated inoculum and conducted to an increase in lactic acid whereas thermoanaerobacterium was predominant in the acid treated inoculum leading to a diminution of lactic acid concentration packing material in anaerobic packed bed reactor can also modify the performances of hydrogen production 136 maximum hydrogen production of 509 404 81 and 10 ml l d and maximum yields of 3 2 2 6 0 4 and 0 05 mol molcarbohydrates were observed with reactors filled with low density polyethylene expanded clay charcoal and porous ceramic respectively underlying the importance of the packing material the effluent from biohydrogen production process is still containing large amount of small organic acids and volatile fatty acids which turned out to be impossible to convert into hydrogen by the microorganisms electro fermentation can be used to overcome this limit and to improve the hydrogen yield demonstrating a 68 volatile fatty acid utilization simultaneously with a 0 057 mmol h hydrogen production when 0 6 v was applied 132 improvement in the economics of the process have been studied by integrating h2 production with a subsequent poly hydroxy alcanoate accumulation by bacillus tequilensis 103 maximum poly hydroxy alcanoate accumulation of 40 dry cell weight could be achieved concomitantly with 38 decrease in acidification resulting in volatile fatty acid consumption 3 4 3 biodiesel biodiesel is principally produced through transesterification of neutral lipids traditional feedstocks are vegetal oils but new microbial resources are in development principally as microalgae yeasts or filamentous fungi oleaginous microorganisms are able to accumulate over 20 dry weight of their biomass as lipids storage under high c n ratio with higher productivities than plant resources addition of glycerol or molasses as supplementary carbon sources to vinasse were used to promote lipids accumulation in the yeasts yarrowia lipolytica rhodotorula mucilaginosa rhodotorula glutinis and candida vini 137 high lipid content of 20 and 19 dry weight were obtained from r glutinis on slops glycerol media and from c vini in molasses slops media respectively the growth of y lipolytica on slops glycerol mixtures yielded a fatty acid profile very similar to those expected for american society for testings and materials astm standards biodiesel 138 used glycerol and thin stillage from sake distillery and reported 36 5 lipid content dry weight with rhodotorula glutinis filamentous fungi are also able to produce oil from vinasses 139 mucor circinelloides was cultivated on thin stillage for 2 days in a 6 l airlift bioreactor dry fungal biomass up to 20 g l could be produced with a lipid content of 46 dry weight filamentous fungi are known to produce polyunsaturated fatty acids the unsaturated fatty acids from m circinelloides accounted for 52 of total lipids supplying crude glycerol during the stationary phase further improved cellular oil content from 46 to 61 dry weight microalgae and yeast can also be used in combination 140 mixed culture of rhodosporidium toruloides and chlorella pyrenoidosa was studied using 1 1 mixed distillery wastewater and municipal wastewater under 12 12 light dark cycle under such experimental set up the lipid content and lipid yield were respectively 63 45 and 4 60 g l 4 conclusions vinasse is produced worldwide in very large volumes using a variety of feed stocks mainly corn and sugarcane it is intensively studied due to environmental concern caused by its discharge in the environment to date anaerobic microbiological digestion and direct spreading are the main industrial management systems for this issue however numerous treatment processes have been recently proposed at laboratory scale to reduce the polluting charge including membrane systems adsorption process catalytic and oxidative treatments enzymatic transformation and phytoremediation among the many treatment options proposed physicochemical treatments proved to be most effective in color and organic removal but suffered from a number of technical issues and are limited by the production of secondary wastes to overcome these limitations combination of different treatment methods are expected to improve the reduction of the pollution load but this will automatically generate additional costs of the waste management numerous authors studied novel routes for valorization to improve the versatility of this effluent and turn it into a resource instead of a waste leading to include it into a carbon cycle based economy currently vinasse treatment at industrial scale are mainly based on industrial processes using anaerobic digestion for production of biogas laboratory investigations were also conducted to use vinasse as a fertilizer and erosion control agent as a cultural medium for production of biomass industrial enzymes organic acids and replacement of petroleum derived molecules and as hydrogen or single cell oil production medium the review also pointed out some gaps in the research which require further investigations the question of the gaseous and aerosol portion of the vinasse also needs to be further evaluated to understand the overall impact of the effluent on ecosystems in addition when applied to water bodies the pollution of the liquid part is well characterized but the distribution of pollutants between water and sediments is poorly described and the effect of contaminated sediments on ecosystems is not well characterized finally we noticed that meanwhile physico chemical methods are well suited for heavy metal removal none has been reported on their removal from vinasse in the literature reviewed although this is a major issue with strict regulation in many countries bridging these gaps could allow the use of vinasse in technically feasible processes but that can not be implemented industrially in the current state acknowledgements the financial support of conseil régional de la réunion and the european social fund convention dired 20140704 divinas project is warmly

14536,this study reports mechanistic investigations in sonochemical degradation of four trihalomethanes thms viz chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chbr3 in presence of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres degradation reactions of thms were carried out under identical conditions with addition of silica nanospheres concurrently simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics were carried out mesoporous silica nanospheres with the largest surface area and the highest mean pore diameter yielded the highest enhancement in degradation of the thms these results were also corroborated by h2o2 dosimetry the concentration profiles of the thms were fitted to pseudo 1st order kinetic model although mean pore sizes of mesoporous silica nanospheres were smaller than minimum threshold radius for transient cavitation these nanospheres provided surface induced and pore induced nucleation to augment cavitation bubble population in medium the highest nanosphere induced enhancement in degradation was obtained for chbr3 while the highest total degradation was obtained for chcl3 with concurrent analysis of experimental and simulations results an attempt is made to deduce the predominant physical mechanism of degradation of the thms keywords advanced oxidation process trihalomethane sonolysis cavitation bubble dynamics 1 introduction trihalomethanes thms are generated during chlorine disinfection process in water treatment plant these are essentially formed out of reaction of chlorine and bromine with the organic matter present in the water thms are environmental pollutants and some of them are carcinogenic the conventional methods of removal of thms include air stripping adsorption on granular activated carbon filtration and ozonation 1 2 advanced oxidation processes are essentially based on production of hydroxyl radicals using techniques such photocatalysis or persulfate 3 however sonolysis or ultrasound treatment has emerged as a potential advanced oxidation process in recent years for oxidative degradation of numerous recalcitrant organic pollutants in sonolysis the oxidizing radicals are generated through transient collapse of cavitation bubbles 4 5 literature on sonochemical degradation of thm is very limited shemer and narkis have reported that the principal mechanism of degradation of thms during sonolysis is pyrolysis either in the core or in the interfacial region of cavitation bubble 6 7 thus the rate of thm degradation and the net degradation achieved is a function of population of cavitation bubbles in the medium an obvious solution to enhancing the rate of thm degradation during sonolysis is to increase the population of cavitation nuclei in the reaction system an effective means of providing nuclei in the reaction system is addition of solid particles the gas pockets trapped in the crevices and on rough surface of these particles can provide sufficiently small nuclei for cavitation events which can grow into cavitation bubbles that undergo transient collapse in case of particle induced cavitation the surface characteristics of the particles play crucial role belova et al 8 10 have demonstrated that higher contact angle between liquid and solid surface results in lower surface energy barrier for cavitation nucleation and thus cavitation dominates at hydrophobic surfaces page and sear 11 have reported heterogeneous nucleation in and out of pores for a porous solid material the nucleation rate was orders of magnitude higher at the pores than on the flat surface existence of pores in solid material drastically reduced the free energy barrier for nucleation although studies of belova et al 8 10 and page and sear 11 have demonstrated the fundamental influence of the characteristics of solid materials on nucleation these studies have been done on solid materials of very small or microscopic scale under highly controlled conditions for a macroscopic system such as sonochemical reaction employing solid particles the results could be different than those predicted by the fundamental studies it is therefore essential to examine the quantitative relationship between morphological properties of the solid particles added to the reaction system and the enhancement in kinetics and yield of the sonochemical reaction induced by such addition the solid particles may also act as adsorbent for the pollutant that creates enhanced local concentrations of pollutant in a dilute solution 12 16 the present study has addressed the issue of deducing physical mechanism of sonochemical degradation of the thms in presence of solid particles the solid particles employed in present study are non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres these nanospheres have high specific surface area the mesopores in these nanospheres have diameters in the range of 2 50 nm the gas pockets trapped in these mesopores can provide nuclei for transient cavitation events these silica nanospheres have been synthesized using modified stӧber process and the biphasic stratification approach we have essentially studied the kinetics of the thm degradation in presence of these nanospheres the experimental results have been correlated to simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics using a mathematical model that takes into account heat and vapor transport across bubble during radial motion and also to the physical properties of the thms the concurrent analysis of experimental and simulations result has unraveled some interesting mechanistic features of nanosphere induced enhancement of sonochemical degradation of the thms as explained in the subsequent sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals four thms viz chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane bromoform 99 purity were procured from sigma aldrich tetraethyl orthosilicate teos cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac solution 25 wt in h2o triethanolamine tea ammonium hydroxide solution ammonium nitrate cyclohexane and ethanol were also procured from sigma aldrich and used as received other chemicals used in the experiments and their make are as follows sodium hydroxide samchun potassium iodide sigma aldrich ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate junsei and potassium hydrogen phthalate junsei 2 2 synthesis of non porous silica nanospheres as noted earlier synthesis of non porous silica nanospheres was carried out using modified stӧber process this method has been described in detail by sato berrú s et al 17 essentially 45 ml of ethanol 5 ml of distilled water 3 ml of ammonium hydroxide solution and 1 5 ml of teos were mixed and stirred for 1 h at room temperature white powder of silica nanospheres was obtained after washing the precipitate with ethanol 2 3 synthesis of mesoporous silica nanospheres mesoporous silica nanospheres were synthesized using the methodology described by shen et al 18 which employs heterogeneous oil water biphasic stratification reaction system that allows self assembly of reactants in the oil water interface for one pot continuous interfacial growth ctac and teos were used as template and silica source respectively and tea and cyclohexane were applied as catalyst and emulsion agent typically 24 ml of ctac and 0 18 g of tea were dissolved to 36 ml of distilled water for 1 h at 60 c 20 ml of 20 10 and 5 v v teos in cyclohexane was carefully added to the water ctac tea solution and kept at 60 c in a water bath with mild magnetic stirring the teos cyclohexane solution formed the upper phase of reaction mixture without mixing with water phase the synthesis reaction occurred at the interfacial region between water and cyclohexane solution the reaction time was 24 h at constant temperature the resulting milky solution under organic solvent was removed using syringe the products were centrifuged and washed several times by ethanol to remove unreacted reactants the product was then mixed with 0 6 ammonia nitrate ethanol solution for 6 h at 60 c twice to extract the ctac template the extracted products were washed again and dried at room temperature finally the mesoporous nanospheres in the form of white fine powder were obtained the mesoporous nanospheres synthesized using 5 10 and 20 v v teos solution have been named as msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 respectively 2 4 characterization of synthesized materials nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of the silica nanospheres were measured at 77 31 k with a surface area porosity analyzer asap2020 micromeritics usa prior to measurements the catalyst samples were degassed in vacuum at 180 c for 9 h the specific surface area of the catalyst samples was determined from adsorption data using brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distribution of the silica nanospheres was determined from adsorption isotherms using the barrett joyner halenda bjh model while the total volume of the pores was estimated from the amount of gas adsorbed the structural morphology of the silica nanospheres was determined using transmission electron microscope tecnai 20 microscope fei usa images at operating voltage of 200 kv the samples of catalysts for tem analysis were immobilized on a holey carbon film coated copper grid after suspending in ethanol under sonication 20 khz for 30 min the x ray diffractograms of the silica nanospheres were recorded using an x ray powder diffractometer x pert apd phillips netherlands employing cu anode operating parameters for recording of x ray diffractograms were voltage 40 mv current 30 ma scan rate 5 80 dwelling time 3 s 2 5 thm degradation experiments experiments for sonochemical degradation of thms were carried out using cup horn type sonoreactor diameter 10 cm frequency 450 khz equipped with water cooling system a borosilicate glass cylinder height 20 cm volume 500 ml was mounted on the cup horn the reaction mixture was placed in this cylinder in a glass bottle volume 200 ml the total volume of reaction mixture prepared using millipore water as the liquid medium in all experiments was 100 ml with initial concentration of thm as 10 mg l and solid nanospheres concentration of 1 g l the initial ph of the reaction mixture was neutral ph 7 the cup horn ultrasound system used for the experiments was characterized using calorimetric techniques the rated theoretical power rating of the ultrasound transducer in cup horn was 80 w however the actual power delivered to the reaction system was determined calorimetrically as 52 22 w on the basis of actual power consumption by cup horn during sonication and the area of the transducer the acoustic pressure amplitude generated in the medium was estimated as 5 bar the temperature of the reaction medium was maintained at 298 k during sonication the total time of sonication of the thm solution was 1 h aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at intervals of 10 20 40 and 60 min for determination of the progress of reaction the residual concentration of thm in the aliquots withdrawn from reaction mixture was determined with gas chromatograph agilent 6890n equipped with flame ionization detector fid 2 5 1 kinetic analysis of thms degradation the time profiles of residual thm concentration in the reaction mixture were fitted to pseudo 1st order kinetic expression d c a d t k c a and the kinetic rate constants for different silica nanospheres were obtained 2 5 2 h2o2 dosimetry prior to the main experiments on thm degradation the intensity of the transient cavitation generated in pure liquid medium i e water without addition of thm in presence of different silica nanospheres was assessed using h2o2 dosimetry hydrogen peroxide concentration was detected by the iodometric method i e weissler reaction of ki oxidation to liberate i2 using uv vis spectrophotometer analytik jena specord 40 germany 1 ml of aliquot of water subjected to sonication for different periods was mixed with 1 ml of solution a 0 4 m potassium iodide 0 1 m sodium hydroxide 0 2 mm ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 1 ml of solution b 0 1 m potassium hydrogen phthalate the absorbance of the resultant reaction mixture at 352 nm was recorded for estimation of the iodine concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mesoporous silica nanospheres transmission electron microscope tem micrographs of mesoporous silica nanospheres msns 5 are shown in fig 1 a1 a3 with different magnifications micrographs in fig 1a clearly reveal highly uniform mesoporous structural morphology of the silica nanospheres the mean diameter of these nanospheres is 150 nm the spherical nanomaterials show distinct radial mesoporous channels with high mono dispersity according to iupac definition of physical sorption n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the mesoporous silica nanospheres msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 shown in fig 1b1 resemble type iv isotherms these isotherms feature a multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation which is a process accompanied with sharp increase in adsorption volume capillary condensation and hysteresis loop were observed at relative pressure of 0 2 p p 0 0 9 in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm steep curves in the capillary condensation regime indicate narrow pore size distributions a bet surface area and pore volume for the nanospheres synthesized with 5 teos cyclohexane solution or msns 5 nanosphere was the highest viz 502 04 m2 g and 1 25 cm3 g respectively the bet surface area for msns 20 nanospheres synthesized with 20 teos cyclohexane was the lowest viz 445 41 m2 g these results essentially indicate that more silica source and lesser hydrophobic solution induce smaller pore size and larger pore wall thickness in the resultant catalyst 18 the pore size distribution in the mesoporous nanospheres was also dependent on the volume ratio of silica source in cyclohexane solvent as evident from results shown in fig 1b2 the mean pore sizes of the mesoporous silica nanospheres synthesized using 5 10 and 20 of teos cyclohexane solution i e msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 were 11 66 9 66 and 6 48 nm respectively large amount of organic solvent in synthesis mixture induced large average pore size because cyclohexane acted as a swelling agent a mean pore size of 6 5 nm was achieved using a 20 v v teos cyclohexane solution while 5 v v solution resulted in mesoporous assembly with larger mean pore size 11 7 nm this result points out that the ratio of organic solvent in upper phase and silica source in the heterogeneous oil water biphasic stratification reaction system is key factor governing mean pore sizes in the resultant mesoporous nanospheres xrd patterns of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres are shown in fig 2 a single peak centered at 2θ angle of 22 and absence of any additional peak in fig 2 confirms the presence and nature of silica as reported by previous authors 19 20 the summary of the morphological characterization of the mesoporous silica nanospheres is given in table 1 3 2 assessment of cavitation intensity in presence of mesoporous silica nanospheres using h2o2 dosimetry h2o2 formation during sonication is attributed to recombination of the oh radicals generated during transient collapse of cavitation bubbles oh radicals have high oxidation potential 2 3 ev and also cause degradation of pollutants through hydroxylation concentration profiles of hydrogen peroxide generated in the liquid medium pure millipore water during 1 h sonication in presence of different nanospheres concentration 1 g l are shown in fig 3 the h2o2 generation rates observed under different experimental conditions were as follows 1 no additives 0 18 μm min 2 nonporous silica nanospheres 0 29 μm min 3 msns 20 nanospheres 0 53 μm min 4 msns 10 nanospheres 0 54 μm min and 5 msns 5 nanospheres 0 68 μm min these values clearly indicate enhancement effect in h2o2 generation induced by addition of nanospheres the enhancement is 1 56 for non porous catalyst and 3 71 for the msns 5 catalyst the enhancement in h2o2 generation is obviously attributed to generation of greater number of cavitation nuclei in the medium due to addition of nanospheres as noted in section 1 nanospheres can contribute cavitation nuclei through both surface induced nucleation and pore induced nucleation thus enhancement in cavitation intensity through additional contribution of cavitation nuclei by different silica nanospheres used in this study is function of surface area mean pore diameter and the total pore volume a comparison of the h2o2 generation rates in presence of non porous and mesoporous nanospheres reveal far higher nucleation in presence of msns nanospheres as the h2o2 formation rate is 1 84 2 38 times faster than that in presence of nonporous silica nanospheres existence of mesopores in the nanospheres reduced the threshold energy for nucleation as the air pockets entrapped in mesopores can act as potential cavitation nuclei 11 21 therefore mesoporous msns nanospheres with the highest bet surface area and largest pore volume is expected to provide maximum nucleation this conjecture is corroborated by the results of h2o2 dosimetry in that msns 5 nanospheres which has the highest bet surface area the largest mean pore size and the highest total pore volume showed maximum h2o2 generation rate of 0 68 μm min however it is not possible to distinguish between the individual contributions of surface induced and pore induced cavitation nucleation in presence of nanospheres from the h2o2 dosimetry data an indirect guesstimate of the individual contributions of surface and pore induced cavitation due to nanospheres towards cavitation intensity in the medium can be made as follows h2o2 generation rate for the msns 10 and msns 20 nanospheres is practically same the morphological characteristics of msns 10 and msns 20 nanospheres listed in table 1 different mean pore size and total pore volume yet same specific surface area if pore induced nucleation was to dominate the cavitation intensity in the medium one would expect to see higher h2o2 generation rate in presence of msns 10 nanospheres these results essentially point towards greater contribution of surface induced nucleation towards cavitation intensity in the medium in the present context there are two possible mechanisms of degradation of thms viz thermal pyrolysis inside cavitation bubble and hydroxylation in the bulk liquid medium or more exactly the bubble bulk interfacial region both of these mechanisms have direct relation to the cavitation bubble population in the medium thus h2o2 dosimetry can help in discerning the mechanism of silica nanospheres induced enhancement of thm degradation 3 3 sonocatalytic degradation of thms the time profiles of degradation of all thms in pure water and in presence of non porous and mesoporous nanospheres are shown in fig 4 and the pseudo 1st order kinetic model fits to the degradation profiles are shown in fig 5 the final results on degradation of all thms have been summarized in table 2 a it could be inferred from table 2a that addition of silica nanospheres in the thm solution enhances degradation of all thms the enhancement in degradation with mesoporous nanospheres is more marked than non porous nanospheres for all thms comparing between the three mesoporous nanospheres the highest degradation for all thms is obtained for the msns 5 nanospheres which has the highest surface area for example chbrcl2 and chbr2cl showed rise of 2 08 and 2 5 in degradation for msns 5 nanospheres respectively while a relatively smaller increment of 1 82 and 2 1 in degradation was seen for msns 20 this result is attributed to maximum cavitation nucleation provided by msns 5 nanospheres through surface induced mechanism however comparing the catalyst induced enhancement in the degradation of four thms an interesting observation could be made is that maximum enhancement is observed for chbr3 and the least enhancement is obtained for chcl3 for example as compared to degradation without nanospheres the degradation of chcl3 in presence of msns 5 increased by about 50 from 61 57 to 91 15 while the degradation of chbr3 showed 3 fold rise from 21 45 to 66 88 for the other two thms viz chbrcl2 and chbr2cl the rise in degradation was 2 fold from 41 8 to 86 9 and 2 5 fold from 31 5 to 78 9 respectively secondly for all nanospheres the degradation of chcl3 was the highest among all thms these trends are essentially attributed to the predominant mechanism of degradation of the thms as discussed in greater detail in next section 3 3 1 kinetic analysis of thm degradation the results of the kinetic analysis are given in table 2b certain trends in pseudo 1st order kinetic constants of degradation of all thms in presence of silica nanospheres are as follows 1 for all thms the kinetics constant shows marked rise with addition of silica nanospheres however the extent of enhancement in kinetic constants of different thms for any type of nanospheres varied significantly for example for msns 5 nanospheres the kinetic constant of chbr3 showed the highest increase of 5 24 while kinetic constant of chcl3 showed least rise of 2 65 the rise of kinetic constants of chbrcl2 and chclbr2 were 4 21 and 4 62 respectively 2 the kinetic constant for mesoporous nanospheres is much higher than non porous nanospheres among the three mesoporous nanospheres the highest kinetic constant for all thms is seen for msns 5 nanospheres for example for non porous nanospheres the kinetic constants of chcl3 chbrcl2 chclbr2 and chbr3 showed rise of 1 48 2 33 2 49 and 2 78 respectively while for msns 5 nanospheres the rises in kinetic constants of these thms in same order were 2 65 4 21 4 62 and 5 24 respectively 3 among the four thms the least kinetic constant for all nanospheres is obtained for chbr3 indicating the slowest degradation while the highest kinetic constant is obtained for chcl3 indicating the fastest degradation these trends in kinetic constants are also related to predominant physical mechanism of degradation as discussed in subsequent section 3 4 physical explanation to trends in thms degradation in this section we have attempted to provide a physical explanation to the experimental results on thms degradation the analysis presented in this section is based on simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics and its concurrent analysis vis à vis experimental results on degradation of the thms such an approach has been adopted by previous authors for example hamdaoui and coworkers 22 28 merouani et al 23 have used simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics for assessing effect of frequency and saturation gases on radical production and also for prediction of number of active cavitation bubbles in sonochemical reactor merouani et al 24 ferkous et al 25 have investigated effect of frequency and acoustic intensity on degradation of naphthol blue black using simulations of bubble dynamics while merouani et al 26 have reported effect of liquid temperature on sonolytic degradation of organic dyes the approach adopted by hamdaoui and coworkers is to estimate the peak temperature at transient bubble collapse using mathematical model followed by solving a system of simultaneous reversible chemical reactions to predict time profiles of concentrations of various species although the approach of hamdaoui and coworkers gives physical insight into chemical kinetics of cavitation bubble the physical model used by them has two shortcomings viz 1 it does not account for mass transport of vapor during bubble dynamics and 2 the radial motion of the bubble and chemical kinetics are decoupled in other words the enthalpy changes of chemical reactions are not accounted for in bubble dynamics formulation in fact many of the dissociation reactions are endothermic and contribute to lowering of peak temperature attained during collapse as noted earlier the cup horn sonication system used in the present study had frequency of 450 khz and estimated acoustic pressure amplitude of 5 bar the experiments have been conducted at bulk liquid temperature of 298 k for the simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics we have used the modified bubble dynamic equation that takes into account the liquid compressibility 29 1 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 1 ρ l p r t p o p t r ρ l c d d t p r t p t 4 μ ρ l r d r d t 2 σ ρ l r the simulations have been performed using approach of prasad naidu et al 30 based on flynn s hypothesis the air water vapor mixture inside the bubble is assumed to obey ideal gas law and the final temperature and pressure peak reached in the bubble can be calculated using polytropic law as t max t 0 r 2 r min 3 γ 1 and p max t o r 2 r min 3 γ where r min is the minimum radius produced by the bubble during transient collapse and r2 is the radius at which the partial pressure at the gas in the bubble equals the vapor pressure of the liquid in the collapse phase of bubble motion at which the bubble becomes closed system as noted earlier γ is the polytropic constant of bubble contents value taken as 1 33 and t o is the initial temperature of the reaction mixture 298 k an important parameter in simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics is the initial or equilibrium radius of the cavitation bubble to determine this parameter we first calculate the lower threshold for bubble growth as per blake s analysis 31 2 p b p o 8 σ 9 3 σ 2 r b 3 p o 2 σ r b p b is the minimum acoustic pressure at which a gas bubble of radius r b will grow under quasi steady state or mechanical equilibrium conditions provided r b r r where r r is the resonant bubble radius corresponding to frequency of ultrasound f r r is given as 3 p 0 ρ l 2 π f 2 31 where po is the static pressure in the liquid medium for f 450 khz the resonant bubble radius at ambient pressure p o 101 3 kpa is 6 17 μm we determine the blake threshold radius by substituting p b p o p a max 4 105 pa and σ 0 072 n m with these substitutions in eq 2 rb is calculated as 0 107 μm on the basis of calculated values of r b and r r we have chosen representative value for initial bubble radius r o as 1 μm as noted earlier the initial ph of the reaction mixture was 7 which is significantly lower than pka values of the thms for example chloroform has pka 15 7 while bromoform has pka 13 7 thus the thm molecules in the reaction mixture predominantly exist in molecular or undissociated form the vapor pressures of thm solutions at the bubble interface p v have been determined using raoult s law due to very low concentrations of solute essentially leading to activity coefficients 1 as 3 p v x t h m p v t h m x h 2 o p v h 2 o where x thm and x h 2 o are mole fractions of trihalomethanes and water respectively in the liquid at the bubble interface all thms used in present study have hydrophobic nature due to which they tend to preferentially partition at the bubble interface thus the concentration of the solute at bubble interface is much larger than bulk concentration lipnick 32 has noted that partition coefficient of chloroform between olive oil and water is 30 33 for dilute solutions unfortunately the partition coefficient data for other thms is not available in the literature in view of this difficulty we assume same partition coefficient of 30 for all thms used in this study this approximation is sufficient as for the objectives of the present study are concerned although we note that partition coefficient for bromoform is expected to be significantly higher than chloroform due to its higher hydrophobicity as indicated by water solubility of 310 mg 100 ml for bromoform as against 1 06 g 100 ml for chloroform okitsu et al 33 34 and chiha et al 22 have proposed alternate approach to account for elevated concentration of organic pollutants at bubble interface these authors have proposed a heterogeneous kinetics model based on hypothesis that rate of adsorption of pollutant molecules from bulk solution to bubble interface varies proportionately with bulk concentration of pollutant and the population of vacant adsorption sites at bubble interface the rate of pollutant degradation is then expressed in terms of adsorbed concentration of pollutant at bubble interface which is significantly higher than bulk concentration we have considered an air bubble for simulations the air inside the bubble is assumed to be saturated with liquid vapor i e water and the thm the bubble dynamics equation has been solved using runge kutta adaptive step size method 35 to get time profiles of bubble radius and temperature and pressure inside the bubble the summary of the simulation results is provided in table 3 due to very low partial pressure of thms at the bubble interface the evaporation in the bubble is dominated by water vapor as seen from table 3 the mole fractions of all thms in the bubble at the moment of transient collapse are 10 6 as a result the characteristics of the transient cavitation i e peak temperature and pressures attained at transient collapse and the equilibrium mole fractions of the chemical species in the bubble are same in solutions of all four thms the thermal dissociation reactions occurring inside the bubble are extremely fast and thus the bubble contents remains essentially at equilibrium conditions throughout the radial motion brenner et al 36 in view of this we have determined the composition of the bubble contents at the peak temperature attained during transient collapse using assumption of chemical equilibrium table 3 also lists the equilibrium mole fractions of various species resulting from thermal dissociation of water vapor and oxygen molecules in the bubble while determining the equilibrium composition of bubble contents at the transient collapse using gibbs energy minimization 37 we have not considered the nitrogen molecules in air as the nitrogen species occur in very small equilibrium fractions and these species are unlikely to contribute to degradation of the thms the chemical species produced in the bubble may diffuse out of the bubble at the point of minimum radius or maximum compensation during radial motion or these species may directly get released into the bulk liquid if the bubble undergoes fragmentation at the point of maximum compression as noted from table 3 the chemical species produced in the bubble include radical oxidant species like oh o and ho2 small amount of h2o2 is also produced in the bubble the radical oxidant species generated during transient bubble collapse are intercepted by the thm molecules present at the bubble interface which essentially results in degradation of thms comparison of the mean size of the silica nanospheres pores with the blake threshold radius clearly indicates that the minimum threshold bubble radius required for transient cavitation is much larger than the largest pore size in msns 5 nanospheres therefore as noted in section 2 3 surface induced nucleation is likely to contribute to augmentation in cavitation intensity in the medium table 2a presents the summary of the degradation of thms in homogeneous solutions and in presence of non porous and msns particles addition of both nonporous and porous nanospheres to the reaction solution enhances the thm degradation greater enhancement in the thm degradation is seen for porous msns particles than non porous particles among all msns particles the highest enhancement in degradation is obtained for msns 5 nanospheres this result is attributed to the largest surface area of these nanospheres due to which they induce maximum cavitation nucleation comparing percentage degradation of different thms given in table 2a for any particular nanospheres we see the least particle induced enhancement of degradation for chcl3 followed by chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 this trend can be explained on the basis of the vapor pressure of the thms at conditions of experiments chcl3 has the highest vapor pressure of 27 1 kpa at 298 k bulk temperature of reaction mixture during sonication followed by chclbr2 10 14 kpa chbrcl2 7 kpa and chbr3 0 7 kpa the higher the vapor pressure of the thms the higher its evaporation into the bubble as indicated by the mole fraction of the thm vapor inside the bubble listed in table 3 these vapor molecules are subjected to the extreme conditions generated at the transient bubble collapse and undergo thermal dissociation as noted earlier by virtue of its higher hydrophobicity chbr3 is likely to partition to greater extent at the bubble interface than other thms this would generate relatively higher local concentration of chbr3 at bubble interface resulting in higher interception of oh o and ho2 oxidizing radicals diffused released from the bubble with addition of nanospheres in the medium the cavitation bubble population in the medium not only increases but also remains relatively constant due to continuous supply of external nuclei by nanospheres through surface induced nucleation this results in rise in cavitation intensity in the medium i e rate of radical generation through transient bubble collapse which is manifested in terms of several fold increase in the degradation of chbr3 through possible mechanism of hydroxylation kotronarou et al 38 and yasui 39 have hypothesized that the interfacial region of cavitation bubble or the thin liquid layer surrounding the bubble also gets heated to moderate temperatures 600 k during transient bubble collapse chbr3 molecules present in the interfacial region can undergo thermal dissociation at these conditions identification of the degradation intermediates of chbr3 is necessary to distinguish between these two possible chemical mechanisms of degradation by virtue of its high vapor pressure the extent of evaporation of chcl3 in the cavitation bubble is relatively much larger than other thms as indicated by its equilibrium mole fraction in the bubble at transient collapse in table 3 thus the rate of degradation of chcl3 through thermal dissociation in the bubble is intrinsically quite fast even in absence of any particle or relatively lower cavitation bubble population in the medium therefore addition of silica nanospheres does not result in marked enhancement of degradation of chcl3 the other two thms viz chclbr2 and chclbr2 are also expected to degrade predominantly through thermal decomposition inside cavitation bubble due to moderate vapor pressures of 10 14 and 7 kpa respectively again identification of the degradation intermediates is necessary to confirm the chemical mechanism of degradation a general conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that influence of silica nanospheres addition on enhancement of both extent and rate or kinetics of thm degradation was inversely proportional to the volatility of thm 4 conclusion this paper has presented mechanistic investigations in sonochemical degradation of trihalomethanes in presence of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres the mesoporous nanospheres could supply additional nuclei for transient cavitation which enhanced cavitation intensity in the medium the highest enhancement in thm degradation was obtained for msns 5 nanospheres with largest pore size and surface area mean pore size of all mesoporous nanospheres was smaller than minimum threshold bubble radius for transient cavitation thus the silica nanospheres augmented cavitation intensity in the medium through surface induced nucleation for all four silica nanospheres trends in total percentage degradation were chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 chbr3 the highest nanosphere induced enhancement in degradation was obtained for chbr3 as the total degradation increased nearly 3 fold the pseudo 1st order kinetic constant of chbr3 degradation also increased 4 fold with addition of msns 5 nanospheres simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics revealed evaporation of the thms into the cavitation bubble which was proportional to its vapor pressure moreover thermal dissociation of water vapor in the transient cavitation bubble resulted in formation of oxidizing radicals the predominant mechanism of degradation of the thm depended on its vapor pressure highly volatile chcl3 was expected to degrade through thermal pyrolysis inside cavitation bubble while least volatile chbr3 was expected to degrade either through hydroxylation induced by oxidizing radicals generated from cavitation bubble or through thermal decomposition in the interfacial region of the bubble further research in this area is required with

14536,this study reports mechanistic investigations in sonochemical degradation of four trihalomethanes thms viz chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 and chbr3 in presence of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres degradation reactions of thms were carried out under identical conditions with addition of silica nanospheres concurrently simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics were carried out mesoporous silica nanospheres with the largest surface area and the highest mean pore diameter yielded the highest enhancement in degradation of the thms these results were also corroborated by h2o2 dosimetry the concentration profiles of the thms were fitted to pseudo 1st order kinetic model although mean pore sizes of mesoporous silica nanospheres were smaller than minimum threshold radius for transient cavitation these nanospheres provided surface induced and pore induced nucleation to augment cavitation bubble population in medium the highest nanosphere induced enhancement in degradation was obtained for chbr3 while the highest total degradation was obtained for chcl3 with concurrent analysis of experimental and simulations results an attempt is made to deduce the predominant physical mechanism of degradation of the thms keywords advanced oxidation process trihalomethane sonolysis cavitation bubble dynamics 1 introduction trihalomethanes thms are generated during chlorine disinfection process in water treatment plant these are essentially formed out of reaction of chlorine and bromine with the organic matter present in the water thms are environmental pollutants and some of them are carcinogenic the conventional methods of removal of thms include air stripping adsorption on granular activated carbon filtration and ozonation 1 2 advanced oxidation processes are essentially based on production of hydroxyl radicals using techniques such photocatalysis or persulfate 3 however sonolysis or ultrasound treatment has emerged as a potential advanced oxidation process in recent years for oxidative degradation of numerous recalcitrant organic pollutants in sonolysis the oxidizing radicals are generated through transient collapse of cavitation bubbles 4 5 literature on sonochemical degradation of thm is very limited shemer and narkis have reported that the principal mechanism of degradation of thms during sonolysis is pyrolysis either in the core or in the interfacial region of cavitation bubble 6 7 thus the rate of thm degradation and the net degradation achieved is a function of population of cavitation bubbles in the medium an obvious solution to enhancing the rate of thm degradation during sonolysis is to increase the population of cavitation nuclei in the reaction system an effective means of providing nuclei in the reaction system is addition of solid particles the gas pockets trapped in the crevices and on rough surface of these particles can provide sufficiently small nuclei for cavitation events which can grow into cavitation bubbles that undergo transient collapse in case of particle induced cavitation the surface characteristics of the particles play crucial role belova et al 8 10 have demonstrated that higher contact angle between liquid and solid surface results in lower surface energy barrier for cavitation nucleation and thus cavitation dominates at hydrophobic surfaces page and sear 11 have reported heterogeneous nucleation in and out of pores for a porous solid material the nucleation rate was orders of magnitude higher at the pores than on the flat surface existence of pores in solid material drastically reduced the free energy barrier for nucleation although studies of belova et al 8 10 and page and sear 11 have demonstrated the fundamental influence of the characteristics of solid materials on nucleation these studies have been done on solid materials of very small or microscopic scale under highly controlled conditions for a macroscopic system such as sonochemical reaction employing solid particles the results could be different than those predicted by the fundamental studies it is therefore essential to examine the quantitative relationship between morphological properties of the solid particles added to the reaction system and the enhancement in kinetics and yield of the sonochemical reaction induced by such addition the solid particles may also act as adsorbent for the pollutant that creates enhanced local concentrations of pollutant in a dilute solution 12 16 the present study has addressed the issue of deducing physical mechanism of sonochemical degradation of the thms in presence of solid particles the solid particles employed in present study are non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres these nanospheres have high specific surface area the mesopores in these nanospheres have diameters in the range of 2 50 nm the gas pockets trapped in these mesopores can provide nuclei for transient cavitation events these silica nanospheres have been synthesized using modified stӧber process and the biphasic stratification approach we have essentially studied the kinetics of the thm degradation in presence of these nanospheres the experimental results have been correlated to simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics using a mathematical model that takes into account heat and vapor transport across bubble during radial motion and also to the physical properties of the thms the concurrent analysis of experimental and simulations result has unraveled some interesting mechanistic features of nanosphere induced enhancement of sonochemical degradation of the thms as explained in the subsequent sections 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals four thms viz chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane bromoform 99

1 5 ml of teos were mixed and stirred for 1 h at room temperature white powder of silica nanospheres was obtained after washing the precipitate with ethanol 2 3 synthesis of mesoporous silica nanospheres mesoporous silica nanospheres were synthesized using the methodology described by shen et al 18 which employs heterogeneous oil water biphasic stratification reaction system that allows self assembly of reactants in the oil water interface for one pot continuous interfacial growth ctac and teos were used as template and silica source respectively and tea and cyclohexane were applied as catalyst and emulsion agent typically 24 ml of ctac and 0 18 g of tea were dissolved to 36 ml of distilled water for 1 h at 60 c 20 ml of 20 10 and 5 v v teos in cyclohexane was carefully added to the water ctac tea solution and kept at 60 c in a water bath with mild magnetic stirring the teos cyclohexane solution formed the upper phase of reaction mixture without mixing with water phase the synthesis reaction occurred at the interfacial region between water and cyclohexane solution the reaction time was 24 h at constant temperature the resulting milky solution under organic solvent was removed using syringe the products were centrifuged and washed several times by ethanol to remove unreacted reactants the product was then mixed with 0 6 ammonia nitrate ethanol solution for 6 h at 60 c twice to extract the ctac template the extracted products were washed again and dried at room temperature finally the mesoporous nanospheres in the form of white fine powder were obtained the mesoporous nanospheres synthesized using 5 10 and 20 v v teos solution have been named as msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 respectively 2 4 characterization of synthesized materials nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of the silica nanospheres were measured at 77 31 k with a surface area porosity analyzer asap2020 micromeritics usa prior to measurements the catalyst samples were degassed in vacuum at 180 c for 9 h the specific surface area of the catalyst samples was determined from adsorption data using brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distribution of the silica

s 2 5 thm degradation experiments experiments for sonochemical degradation of thms were carried out using cup horn type sonoreactor diameter 10 cm frequency 450 khz equipped with water cooling system a borosilicate glass cylinder height 20 cm volume 500 ml was mounted on the cup horn the reaction mixture was placed in this cylinder in a glass bottle volume 200 ml the total volume of reaction mixture prepared using millipore water as the liquid medium in all experiments was 100 ml with initial concentration of thm as 10 mg l and solid nanospheres concentration of 1 g l the initial ph of the reaction mixture was neutral ph 7 the cup horn ultrasound system used for the experiments was characterized using calorimetric techniques the rated theoretical power rating of the ultrasound transducer in cup horn was 80 w however the actual power delivered to the reaction system was determined calorimetrically as 52 22 w on the basis of actual power consumption by cup horn during sonication and the area of the transducer the acoustic pressure amplitude generated in the medium was estimated as 5 bar the temperature of the reaction medium was maintained at 298 k during sonication the total time of sonication of the thm solution was 1 h aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at intervals of 10 20 40 and 60 min for determination of the progress of reaction the residual concentration of thm in the aliquots withdrawn from reaction mixture was determined with gas chromatograph agilent 6890n equipped with flame ionization detector fid 2 5 1 kinetic analysis of thms degradation the time profiles of residual thm concentration in the reaction mixture were fitted to pseudo 1st order kinetic expression d c a d t k c a and the kinetic rate constants for different silica nanospheres were obtained 2 5 2 h2o2 dosimetry prior to the main experiments on thm degradation the intensity of the transient cavitation generated in pure liquid medium i e water without

oxidation to liberate i2 using uv vis spectrophotometer analytik jena specord 40 germany 1 ml of aliquot of water subjected to sonication for different periods was mixed with 1 ml of solution a 0 4 m potassium iodide 0 1 m sodium hydroxide 0 2 mm ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and 1 ml of solution b 0 1 m potassium hydrogen phthalate the absorbance of the resultant reaction mixture at 352 nm was recorded for estimation of the iodine concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mesoporous silica nanospheres transmission electron microscope tem micrographs of mesoporous silica nanospheres msns 5 are shown in fig 1 a1 a3 with different magnifications micrographs in fig 1a clearly reveal highly uniform mesoporous structural morphology of the silica nanospheres the mean diameter of these nanospheres is 150 nm the spherical nanomaterials show distinct radial mesoporous channels with high mono dispersity according to iupac definition of physical sorption n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the mesoporous silica nanospheres msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 shown in fig 1b1 resemble type iv isotherms these isotherms feature a multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation which is a process accompanied with sharp increase in adsorption volume capillary condensation and hysteresis loop were observed at relative pressure of 0 2 p p 0 0 9 in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm steep curves in the capillary condensation regime indicate narrow pore size distributions a bet surface area and pore volume for the nanospheres synthesized with 5 teos cyclohexane solution or msns 5 nanosphere was the highest viz 502 04 m2 g and 1 25 cm3 g respectively the bet surface area for msns 20 nanospheres synthesized with 20 teos cyclohexane was the lowest viz 445 41 m2 g these results essentially indicate that more silica source and lesser hydrophobic solution induce smaller pore size and larger pore wall thickness in the resultant catalyst 18 the pore size distribution in the mesoporous nanospheres was also dependent on the volume ratio of silica source in cyclohexane solvent as evident from results shown in fig 1b2 the mean pore sizes of the mesoporous silica nanospheres synthesized using 5 10 and 20 of teos cyclohexane solution i e msns 5 msns 10 and msns 20 were 11 66 9 66 and 6 48 nm respectively large amount of organic solvent in synthesis mixture induced large average pore size because cyclohexane acted as a swelling agent a mean pore size of 6 5 nm was achieved using a 20 v v teos cyclohexane solution while 5 v v solution resulted in mesoporous assembly with larger mean pore size 11 7 nm this result points out that the ratio of organic solvent in upper phase and silica source in the heterogeneous oil water biphasic stratification reaction system is key factor governing mean pore sizes in the resultant mesoporous nanospheres xrd patterns of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres are shown in fig 2 a single peak centered at 2θ angle of 22 and absence of any additional peak in fig 2 confirms the presence and nature of silica as reported by previous authors 19 20 the summary of the morphological characterization of the mesoporous silica nanospheres is given in table 1 3 2 assessment of cavitation intensity in presence of mesoporous silica nanospheres using h2o2 dosimetry h2o2 formation during sonication is attributed to recombination of the oh radicals generated during transient collapse of cavitation bubbles oh radicals have high oxidation potential 2 3 ev and also cause degradation of pollutants through hydroxylation concentration profiles of hydrogen peroxide generated in the liquid medium pure millipore water during 1 h sonication in presence of different nanospheres concentration 1 g l are shown in fig 3 the h2o2 generation rates observed under different experimental conditions were as follows 1 no additives 0 18 μm min 2 nonporous silica nanospheres 0 29 μm min 3 msns 20 nanospheres 0 53 μm min 4 msns 10 nanospheres 0 54 μm min and 5 msns 5 nanospheres 0 68 μm min these values clearly indicate enhancement effect in h2o2 generation induced by addition of nanospheres the enhancement is 1 56 for non porous catalyst and 3 71 for the msns 5 catalyst the enhancement in h2o2 generation is obviously attributed to generation of greater number of cavitation nuclei in the medium due to addition of nanospheres as noted in section 1 nanospheres can contribute cavitation nuclei through both surface induced nucleation and pore induced nucleation thus enhancement in cavitation intensity through additional contribution of cavitation nuclei by different silica nanospheres used in this study is function of surface area mean pore diameter and the total pore volume a comparison of the h2o2 generation rates in presence of non porous and mesoporous nanospheres reveal far higher nucleation in presence of msns nanospheres as the h2o2 formation rate is 1 84 2 38 times faster than that in presence of nonporous silica nanospheres existence of mesopores in the nanospheres reduced the threshold energy for nucleation as the air pockets entrapped in mesopores can act as potential cavitation nuclei 11 21 therefore mesoporous msns nanospheres with the highest bet surface area and largest pore volume is expected to provide maximum nucleation this conjecture is corroborated by the results of h2o2 dosimetry in that msns 5 nanospheres which has the highest bet surface area the largest mean pore size and the highest total pore volume showed maximum h2o2 generation rate of 0 68 μm min however it is not possible to distinguish between the individual contributions of surface induced and pore induced cavitation nucleation in presence of nanospheres from the h2o2 dosimetry data an indirect guesstimate of the individual contributions of surface and pore induced cavitation due to nanospheres towards cavitation intensity in the medium can be made as follows h2o2 generation rate for the msns 10 and msns 20 nanospheres is practically same the morphological characteristics of msns 10 and msns 20 nanospheres listed in table 1 different mean pore size and total pore volume yet same specific surface area if pore induced nucleation was to dominate the cavitation intensity in the medium one would expect to see higher h2o2 generation rate in presence of msns 10 nanospheres these results essentially point towards greater contribution of surface induced nucleation towards cavitation intensity in the medium in the present context there are two possible mechanisms of degradation of thms viz thermal pyrolysis inside cavitation bubble and hydroxylation in the bulk liquid medium or more exactly the bubble bulk interfacial region both of these mechanisms have direct relation to the cavitation bubble population in the medium thus h2o2 dosimetry can help in discerning the mechanism of silica nanospheres induced enhancement of thm degradation 3 3 sonocatalytic degradation of thms the time profiles of degradation of all thms in pure water and in presence of non porous and mesoporous nanospheres are shown in fig 4 and the pseudo 1st order kinetic model fits to the degradation profiles are shown in fig 5 the final results on degradation of all thms have been summarized in table 2 a it could be inferred from table 2a that addition of silica nanospheres in the thm solution enhances degradation of all thms the enhancement in degradation with mesoporous nanospheres is more marked than non porous nanospheres for all thms comparing between the three mesoporous nanospheres the highest degradation for all thms is obtained for the msns 5 nanospheres which has the highest surface area for example chbrcl2 and chbr2cl showed rise of 2 08 and 2 5 in degradation for msns 5 nanospheres respectively while a relatively smaller increment of 1 82 and 2 1 in degradation was seen for msns 20 this result is attributed to maximum cavitation nucleation provided by msns 5 nanospheres through surface induced mechanism however comparing the catalyst induced enhancement in the degradation of four thms an interesting observation could be made is that maximum enhancement is observed for chbr3 and the least enhancement is obtained for chcl3 for example as compared to degradation without nanospheres the degradation of chcl3 in presence of msns 5 increased by about 50 from 61 57 to 91 15 while the degradation of chbr3 showed 3 fold rise from 21 45 to 66 88 for the other two thms viz chbrcl2 and chbr2cl the rise in degradation was 2 fold from 41 8 to 86 9 and 2 5 fold from 31 5 to 78 9 respectively secondly for all nanospheres the degradation of chcl3 was the highest among all thms these trends are essentially attributed to the predominant mechanism of degradation of the thms as discussed in greater detail in next section 3 3 1 kinetic analysis of thm degradation the results of the kinetic analysis are given in table 2b certain trends in pseudo 1st order kinetic constants of degradation of all thms in presence of silica nanospheres are as follows 1 for all thms the kinetics constant shows marked rise with addition of silica nanospheres however the extent of enhancement in kinetic constants of different thms for any type of nanospheres varied significantly for example for msns 5 nanospheres the kinetic constant of chbr3 showed the highest increase of 5 24 while kinetic constant of chcl3 showed least rise of 2 65 the rise of kinetic constants of chbrcl2 and chclbr2 were 4 21 and 4 62 respectively 2 the kinetic constant for mesoporous nanospheres is much higher than non porous nanospheres among the three mesoporous nanospheres the highest kinetic constant for all thms is seen for msns 5 nanospheres for example for non porous nanospheres the kinetic constants of chcl3 chbrcl2 chclbr2 and chbr3 showed rise of 1 48 2 33 2 49 and 2 78 respectively while for msns 5 nanospheres the rises in kinetic constants of these thms in same order were 2 65 4 21 4 62 and 5 24 respectively 3 among the four thms the least kinetic constant for all nanospheres is obtained for chbr3 indicating the slowest degradation while the highest kinetic constant is obtained for chcl3 indicating the fastest degradation these trends in kinetic constants are also related to predominant physical mechanism of degradation as discussed in subsequent section 3 4 physical explanation to trends in thms degradation in this section we have attempted to provide a physical explanation to the experimental results on thms degradation the analysis presented in this section is based on simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics and its concurrent analysis vis à vis experimental results on degradation of the thms such an approach has been adopted by previous authors for example hamdaoui and coworkers 22 28 merouani et al 23 have used simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics for assessing effect of frequency and saturation gases on radical production and also for prediction of number of active cavitation bubbles in sonochemical reactor merouani et al 24 ferkous et al 25 have investigated effect of frequency and acoustic intensity on degradation of naphthol blue black using simulations of bubble dynamics while merouani et al 26 have reported effect of liquid temperature on sonolytic degradation of organic dyes the approach adopted by hamdaoui and coworkers is to estimate the peak temperature at transient bubble collapse using mathematical model followed by solving a system of simultaneous reversible chemical reactions to predict time profiles of concentrations of various species although the approach of hamdaoui and coworkers gives physical insight into chemical kinetics of cavitation bubble the physical model used by them has two shortcomings viz 1 it does not account for mass transport of vapor during bubble dynamics and 2 the radial motion of the bubble and chemical kinetics are decoupled in other words the enthalpy changes of chemical reactions are not accounted for in bubble dynamics formulation in fact many of the dissociation reactions are endothermic and contribute to lowering of peak temperature attained during collapse as noted earlier the cup horn sonication system used in the present study had frequency of 450 khz and estimated acoustic pressure amplitude of 5 bar the experiments have been conducted at bulk liquid temperature of 298 k for the simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics we have used the modified bubble dynamic equation that takes into account the liquid compressibility 29 1 r d 2 r d t 2 3 2 d r d t 2 1 ρ l p r t p o p t r ρ l c d d t p r t p t 4 μ ρ l r d r d t 2 σ ρ l r the simulations have been performed using approach of prasad naidu et al 30 based on flynn s hypothesis the air water vapor mixture inside the bubble is assumed to obey ideal gas law and the final temperature and pressure peak reached in the bubble can be calculated using polytropic law as t max t 0 r 2 r min 3 γ 1 and p max t o r 2 r min 3 γ where r min is the minimum radius produced by the bubble during transient collapse and r2 is the radius at which the partial pressure at the gas in the bubble equals the vapor pressure of the liquid in the collapse phase of bubble motion at which the bubble becomes closed system as noted earlier γ is the polytropic constant of bubble contents value taken as 1 33 and t o is the initial temperature of the reaction mixture 298 k an important parameter in simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics is the initial or equilibrium radius of the cavitation bubble to determine this parameter we first calculate the lower threshold for bubble growth as per blake s analysis 31 2 p b p o 8 σ 9 3 σ 2 r b 3 p o 2 σ r b p b is the minimum acoustic pressure at which a gas bubble of radius r b will grow under quasi steady state or mechanical equilibrium conditions provided r b r r where r r is the resonant bubble radius corresponding to frequency of ultrasound f r r is given as 3 p 0 ρ l 2 π f 2 31 where po is the static pressure in the liquid medium for f 450 khz the resonant bubble radius at ambient pressure p o 101 3 kpa is 6 17 μm we determine the blake threshold radius by substituting p b p o p a max 4 105 pa and σ 0 072 n m with these substitutions in eq 2 rb is calculated as 0 107 μm on the basis of calculated values of r b and r r we have chosen representative value for initial bubble radius r o as 1 μm as noted earlier the initial ph of the reaction mixture was 7 which is significantly lower than pka values of the thms for example chloroform has pka 15 7 while bromoform has pka 13 7 thus the thm molecules in the reaction mixture predominantly exist in molecular or undissociated form the vapor pressures of thm solutions at the bubble interface p v have been determined using raoult s law due to very low concentrations of solute essentially leading to activity coefficients 1 as 3 p v x t h m p v t h m x h 2 o p v h 2 o where x thm and x h 2 o are mole fractions of trihalomethanes and water respectively in the liquid at the bubble interface all thms used in present study have hydrophobic nature due to which they tend to preferentially partition at the bubble interface thus the concentration of the solute at bubble interface is much larger than bulk concentration lipnick 32 has noted that partition coefficient of chloroform between olive oil and water is 30 33 for dilute solutions unfortunately the partition coefficient data for other thms is not available in the literature in view of this difficulty we assume same partition coefficient of 30 for all thms used in this study this approximation is sufficient as for the objectives of the present study are concerned although we note that partition coefficient for bromoform is expected to be significantly higher than chloroform due to its higher hydrophobicity as indicated by water solubility of 310 mg 100 ml for bromoform as against 1 06 g 100 ml for chloroform okitsu et al 33 34 and chiha et al 22 have proposed alternate approach to account for elevated concentration of organic pollutants at bubble interface these authors have proposed a heterogeneous kinetics model based on hypothesis that rate of adsorption of pollutant molecules from bulk solution to bubble interface varies proportionately with bulk concentration of pollutant and the population of vacant adsorption sites at bubble interface the rate of pollutant degradation is then expressed in terms of adsorbed concentration of pollutant at bubble interface which is significantly higher than bulk concentration we have considered an air bubble for simulations the air inside the bubble is assumed to be saturated with liquid vapor i e water and the thm the bubble dynamics equation has been solved using runge kutta adaptive step size method 35 to get time profiles of bubble radius and temperature and pressure inside the bubble the summary of the simulation results is provided in table 3 due to very low partial pressure of thms at the bubble interface the evaporation in the bubble is dominated by water vapor as seen from table 3 the mole fractions of all thms in the bubble at the moment of transient collapse are 10 6 as a result the characteristics of the transient cavitation i e peak temperature and pressures attained at transient collapse and the equilibrium mole fractions of the chemical species in the bubble are same in solutions of all four thms the thermal dissociation reactions occurring inside the bubble are extremely fast and thus the bubble contents remains essentially at equilibrium conditions throughout the radial motion brenner et al 36 in view of this we have determined the composition of the bubble contents at the peak temperature attained during transient collapse using assumption of chemical equilibrium table 3 also lists the equilibrium mole fractions of various species resulting from thermal dissociation of water vapor and oxygen molecules in the bubble while determining the equilibrium composition of bubble contents at the transient collapse using gibbs energy minimization 37 we have not considered the nitrogen molecules in air as the nitrogen species occur in very small equilibrium fractions and these species are unlikely to contribute to degradation of the thms the chemical species produced in the bubble may diffuse out of the bubble at the point of minimum radius or maximum compensation during radial motion or these species may directly get released into the bulk liquid if the bubble undergoes fragmentation at the point of maximum compression as noted from table 3 the chemical species produced in the bubble include radical oxidant species like oh o and ho2 small amount of h2o2 is also produced in the bubble the radical oxidant species generated during transient bubble collapse are intercepted by the thm molecules present at the bubble interface which essentially results in degradation of thms comparison of the mean size of the silica nanospheres pores with the blake threshold radius clearly indicates that the minimum threshold bubble radius required for transient cavitation is much larger than the largest pore size in msns 5 nanospheres therefore as noted in section 2 3 surface induced nucleation is likely to contribute to augmentation in cavitation intensity in the medium table 2a presents the summary of the degradation of thms in homogeneous solutions and in presence of non porous and msns particles addition of both nonporous and porous nanospheres to the reaction solution enhances the thm degradation greater enhancement in the thm degradation is seen for porous msns particles than non porous particles among all msns particles the highest enhancement in degradation is obtained for msns 5 nanospheres this result is attributed to the largest surface area of these nanospheres due to which they induce maximum cavitation nucleation comparing percentage degradation of different thms given in table 2a for any particular nanospheres we see the least particle induced enhancement of degradation for chcl3 followed by chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 this trend can be explained on the basis of the vapor pressure of the thms at conditions of experiments chcl3 has the highest vapor pressure of 27 1 kpa at 298 k bulk temperature of reaction mixture during sonication followed by chclbr2 10 14 kpa chbrcl2 7 kpa and chbr3 0 7 kpa the higher the vapor pressure of the thms the higher its evaporation into the bubble as indicated by the mole fraction of the thm vapor inside the bubble listed in table 3 these vapor molecules are subjected to the extreme conditions generated at the transient bubble collapse and undergo thermal dissociation as noted earlier by virtue of its higher hydrophobicity chbr3 is likely to partition to greater extent at the bubble interface than other thms this would generate relatively higher local concentration of chbr3 at bubble interface resulting in higher interception of oh o and ho2 oxidizing radicals diffused released from the bubble with addition of nanospheres in the medium the cavitation bubble population in the medium not only increases but also remains relatively constant due to continuous supply of external nuclei by nanospheres through surface induced nucleation this results in rise in cavitation intensity in the medium i e rate of radical generation through transient bubble collapse which is manifested in terms of several fold increase in the degradation of chbr3 through possible mechanism of hydroxylation kotronarou et al 38 and yasui 39 have hypothesized that the interfacial region of cavitation bubble or the thin liquid layer surrounding the bubble also gets heated to moderate temperatures 600 k during transient bubble collapse chbr3 molecules present in the interfacial region can undergo thermal dissociation at these conditions identification of the degradation intermediates of chbr3 is necessary to distinguish between these two possible chemical mechanisms of degradation by virtue of its high vapor pressure the extent of evaporation of chcl3 in the cavitation bubble is relatively much larger than other thms as indicated by its equilibrium mole fraction in the bubble at transient collapse in table 3 thus the rate of degradation of chcl3 through thermal dissociation in the bubble is intrinsically quite fast even in absence of any particle or relatively lower cavitation bubble population in the medium therefore addition of silica nanospheres does not result in marked enhancement of degradation of chcl3 the other two thms viz chclbr2 and chclbr2 are also expected to degrade predominantly through thermal decomposition inside cavitation bubble due to moderate vapor pressures of 10 14 and 7 kpa respectively again identification of the degradation intermediates is necessary to confirm the chemical mechanism of degradation a general conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that influence of silica nanospheres addition on enhancement of both extent and rate or kinetics of thm degradation was inversely proportional to the volatility of thm 4 conclusion this paper has presented mechanistic investigations in sonochemical degradation of trihalomethanes in presence of non porous and mesoporous silica nanospheres the mesoporous nanospheres could supply additional nuclei for transient cavitation which enhanced cavitation intensity in the medium the highest enhancement in thm degradation was obtained for msns 5 nanospheres with largest pore size and surface area mean pore size of all mesoporous nanospheres was smaller than minimum threshold bubble radius for transient cavitation thus the silica nanospheres augmented cavitation intensity in the medium through surface induced nucleation for all four silica nanospheres trends in total percentage degradation were chcl3 chcl2br chclbr2 chbr3 the highest nanosphere induced enhancement in degradation was obtained for chbr3 as the total degradation increased nearly 3 fold the pseudo 1st order kinetic constant of chbr3 degradation also increased 4 fold with addition of msns 5 nanospheres simulations of cavitation bubble dynamics revealed evaporation of the thms into the cavitation bubble which was proportional to its vapor pressure moreover thermal dissociation of water vapor in the transient cavitation bubble resulted in formation of oxidizing radicals the predominant mechanism of degradation of the thm depended on its vapor pressure highly volatile chcl3 was expected to degrade through thermal pyrolysis inside cavitation bubble while least volatile chbr3 was expected to degrade either through hydroxylation induced by oxidizing radicals generated from cavitation bubble or through thermal decomposition in the interfacial region of the bubble further research in this area is required with determination of degradation intermediates to confirm the chemical mechanism of degradation acknowledgements this study was supported by a korea university grant and the korean ministry of the

14537,the objectives of this pilot scale study were to evaluate biological acclimation of virgin granular activated carbon gac quantify the impact of nutrient phosphorus and nitrogen enhancement and to compare the performance of parallel biologically active carbon bac filters operated continuously or cyclically 12 h day with respect to removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursors virgin gac media outperformed biologically active carbon for an initial 4 month period in terms of doc reduction 30 as expected based on the superior performance associated with adsorption compared to biodegradation once the adsorptive capacity was exhausted and the media was biologically acclimated the performance of the new gac was statistically similar in terms of organic carbon and disinfection by product precursor removal to a filter containing media harvested from a filter operating biologically for 12 years phosphorus addition to the filter influent 0 3 mg po4 p l

but significant improvement in doc removal 3 2 when compared to continuously operated pilot filters genotyping of both cyclically and continuously operated biofilters with varying gac ages showed similar community composition however differences in the phylogenetic diversity of the samples were evident keywords biofiltration nutrient enhancement cyclical biofilter operation metagenomics microbial community analysis 1 introduction granular activated carbon gac is commonly used as a filter adsorber in drinking water systems gac filters have been shown to effectively remove natural organic matter nom 1 disinfection by product dbp precursors 2 and micropollutants including pharmaceuticals 3 as well as taste and odour compounds 4 over time general trends show that gac loses adsorptive capacity while at the same time biofilm development occurs to promote removal of various substances through biodegradation previous studies have reported the time required for biological acclimation to occur 90 days 5 however limited information is available for biofilters which receive water that been pre treated with ultrafiltration which remove particulates it has been hypothesized that carbon metabolism by biofilters may be limited by the amount of bioavailable phosphorous or nitrogen an optimal molar uptake ratio of 100 10 1 for carbon nitrogen phosphorous has previously been proposed based on the metabolic cycles of aerobic organisms 6 phosphorus has been identified as a limiting nutrient in many drinking water sources 7 and correspondingly in drinking water biofilters 8 shifting from a phosphorous or nitrogen limitation to a carbon limiting environment has been hypothesized to stimulate carbon utilization by the attached microbiome for cell synthesis and energy production thereby increasing nom biodegradation 9 mixed consensus exists in the literature regarding the efficacy of nutrient addition on biofilter performance lauderdale et al 6 reported that phosphorus addition 0 02 mg po4 p l to pre ozonated biofilter influent increased doc removal by 75 0 7 mg l compared to a passively operated biofilter 0 4 mg l with an ebct of 6 7 min in contrast mckie et al 10 and azzeh et al azzeh et al 2014 observed no impact of phosphorus or nitrogen enhancement to the filter influent 0 5 mg l c n p 10 1 1 on doc removal by biologically active anthracite or gac filters ebct 10 min receiving waters with or without pre ozonation although many water treatment facilities operate continuously some may only be operated to meet demand or to utilize available storage capacity as a result treatment systems may be operated cyclically as water is required niquette et al 11 examined the shutdown of biofilters and reported doc removal to increase once filters were re started however reasons for this improvement were not provided it is hypothesized that cyclical biofilter operation may preferentially promote the growth of nom degrading bacteria providing improved water quality such a feast and fasting phenomenon is routinely practiced in wastewater treatment where cyclic aerobic and anaerobic conditions are employed to preferentially select for healthy microorganisms and increase the biodegradation rate of organic matter 12 in this study the acclimation period of virgin gac media was monitored to better understand biofilter start up as well as the time required to achieve biological versus adsorptive removal performance was characterized by ph temperature turbidity dissolved oxygen doc and thm and haa formation potential fp to compare both continuous and cyclically operated biofilters as well as the impact of nutrient enhancement finally the biological community composition was examined to identify differences in the microbiome

the continuously operated pilot filters biological acclimation of the virgin gac was observed over a period of seven months the filter was deemed to be biologically active when doc removal plateaued and was approximately that observed at full scale all trials evaluating the impact of nutrient enhancement were conducted when the water temperature was consistently above 10 c 11 17 c as lower water temperatures 10 c have been shown to negatively impact biofiltration performance 13 filters were provided with increasing concentrations of additional nutrients n and p over a period of six weeks until maximum uptake was observed nutrient concentrations were measured twice per week and concentrations were increased each week until breakthrough was observed filters were then dosed n 0 8 mg l as nh4 n and p 0 3 mg l as po4 p to satisfy maximum uptake samples were collected over a six week period and analyzed weekly for ph temperature dissolved oxygen do organic carbon doc uv254 absorbance and dbp formation potential fp nutrient concentrations in biofilter influent and effluent were measured twice a week to assess uptake and ensure consistent dosing media samples were collected from a sampling port located 5 cm from the top of the filters and analyzed monthly for atp concentration on the media during acclimation atp was also monitored before and after nutrient enhancement finally media samples were collected from 5 cm and 45 cm depths to evaluate bacterial community composition and quantify changes in biomass density as measured by atp 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic

pyrosequencing bacterial dna was extracted from the filter media the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using a universal forward sequencing primer and a universally barcoded reverse sequencing primer to allow for multiplexing as previously described by 15 each media sample was prepared and analyzed in triplicate dna sequences were quality filtered assembled and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 minimum identity using the uparse pipeline provided within usearch 16 taxonomy was assigned with an 80 confidence by the utax algorithm as determined by a single species control pao1 a total of 4280 otus were identified 1467 remained after removing low abundance otus 0 005 relative abundance a rarefaction depth of 8500 sequences per sample was selected as this represented the minimum number of sequences present in an individual sample replicate 2 4 statistical analyses paired student t tests were conducted at a 95 significance level and evaluated the impact of nutrient addition phosphorus or nitrogen on biofiltration performance in terms of doc removal a one tailed t test was selected to compare nutrient enhanced filters to the control biofilter this test was utilized as it would determine whether the enhanced filters provided a statistically significant performance improvement finally an unpaired two tailed test was used to compare continuous bacctrl and cyclical operation bacfs 17 a two tailed test was implemented for this comparison to evaluate whether there was a difference between the two operating methods without considering which treatment provided superior performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 continuous biofiltration operation and performance the bacctrl operated continuously without nutrient addition consistently reduced doc by 5 8 1 9 0 3 0 1 mg l from the influent previous studies have shown biofiltration alone to remove 6 11 of doc although higher doc reductions 20 25 have been reported when ozonation is applied 18 19 the control filter effectively reduced thm fp by 14 28 23 8 8 7 μg l and haa fp by 11 26 5 7 2 7 μg l these reductions were approximately 3 4 times greater than doc removal 6 8 suggesting that the filters preferentially degraded dbp precursor material this is supported by the literature where hydrophobic fractions of doc in particular the small sized constituents molecular weight 1 kda served as dbp precursors and were more amenable to biodegradation 20 n 2 for atp analysis n 6 for all other parameters 3 2 media acclimation following one month of operation atp on the virgin gac media was 75 100 ng g increasing within 4 months to 334 407 ng g and similar p 0 05 to the bacctrl 350 780 ng g fig 2 these values were greater than the benchmark used to define a biologically active filter of 100 ng cm3 as suggested by pharand et al 21 initial doc removal across the virgin gac was consistently high 1 2 mg l 30 similar doc removal 0 3 mg l 8 p 0 05 to the bac control was observed following 4 months of operation 13 000 bed volumes suggesting that the adsorptive capacity for doc was exhausted and that the gac was biologically acclimated a comparable acclimation period 70 days was reported by kim et al 22 where a virgin gac filter calgon f 400 consistently achieved higher doc removal 1 3 mg l 56 compared to a bac filter operated at the same ebct 10 min for the first 70 days after which removal efficiencies were similar 0 9 mg l 39 3 3 nutrient uptake it was anticipated that the pilot filters were operating under nutrient limiting conditions since concentrations of p and n in the raw water were less than their detection limits of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively assuming that all of the doc was available for biodegradation 4 mg l addition of 0 48 mg n l and 0 1 mg p l respectively would satisfy nutrient requirements based on the 100 10 1c n p molar ratio described by lauderdale et al 6 this nutrient ratio has been shown to be important to for microbial development throughout environmental systems to ensure carbon limiting conditions n and p were supplemented at 0 8 mg l as nh4 n and 0 3 mg l as po4 p phosphorus uptake across bacp was approximately 13 0 04 mg l similar to previous studies and consistent with the predicted theoretical uptake 23 ammonia nitrogen conversion across the enhanced biofilter was consistently high 0 78 0 15 mg l with 0 01 mg l observed in the effluent yu et al 24 reported up to 80 removal of nitrogen as nh4 n across full scale bac sand filters ebct 6 7 min treating surface water contaminated with ammonia average nh4 n0 3 67 mg l the ammonia was likely removed though nitrification by the biofilm this pathway specifically targets ammonia nitrogen without impacting organic carbon degradation 24 3 4 impact of nutrient enhancement both bacp and bacn had similar p 0 05 atp concentrations 355 551 ng g when compared to bacctrl 373 485 ng g indicating that nutrient addition did not impact the concentration of the active biomass over the two month enhancement period table 2 bacp removed slightly more doc 0 4 mg l when compared to bacctrl 0 3 mg l in agreement with lauderdale et al 6 and sang et al 25 where phosphorus enhancement 0 02 mg l as po4 p improved doc removal mckie et al 10 and melin et al 26 reported no effect on doc removal upon phosphorus addition of 0 5 mg l and 0 02 mg l as po4 p respectively as such it can be inferred that the impact of nutrient addition is site specific and potentially influenced by source water nom composition or the indigenous microbial community phosphorus addition had a small but significant p 0 05 impact on the reduction of thm fp 6 8 μg l while no effect was observed on haa fp table 2 gallard and von gunten 27 reported a reduction in ph 8 7 to be associated with reduced thm formation 66 16 μg l upon chlorination cl2 dose 5 7 mg l due to slower reaction kinetics 0 03 m 1s 1 to 0 01 m 1s 1 although the addition of phosphoric acid may have impacted thm fp reduction by reducing ph it is more likely that the increased reduction of doc was responsible for the observed thm fp reductions although phosphorus was supplemented as phosphoric acid in this study the ph of the enhanced filter effluent 7 2 8 0 was consistent p 0 05 with the control 7 2 8 1 therefore any reduction in thm fp can be attributed to biodegradation independent of ph related dbp reaction kinetics based on observations for this source water phosphorus addition could offer some benefit in reducing thm formation following subsequent chlorination phosphorus breakthrough 0 24 0 26 mg l however is a potential drawback as low phosphorus concentrations in drinking water 0 01 0 05 mg l have been associated with microbial growth in distribution systems 28 potentially outweighing improvements in dbp precursor removal further studies may be warranted to examine the effect of lower p dosages 0 1 mg l on biofilter performance while minimizing phosphorus breakthrough nitrogen enhancement did not improve filter performance as there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the reduction of doc thm or haa fps when compared to bacctrl despite an uptake of 0 75 mg l table 2 there was a correspondingly high do uptake across the bacn 1 7 mg l when compared to the bacctrl 0 48 mg l as discussed earlier nitrogen consumption could be an inherent characteristic of biofilters that does not contribute to overall organic carbon removal performance 24 oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in the presence of nitrifying bacteria could help explain the oxygen consumption phylum level bacterial community structure fig 3 indicated the presence of nitrospira a genus of bacteria commonly associated with the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate on both bacctrtl and bacfs filter media dna analysis was not performed on the nitrogen enhanced filter the occurrence of nitrates in the biofilter effluents was not monitored and as such a specific degradation mechanism cannot be proposed however based on the conversion of ammonia and presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria it is assumed that nitrification may occur within the filter 3 5 impact of filter operation full scale biofilters were operated for 8 12 h per day based on system demand pilot scale filters were operated continuously of interest bacfs achieved significantly p 0 05 higher doc removal 0 4 0 1 mg l when compared to the bacctrl 0 3 0 1 mg l table 2 although the difference is relatively small removals were consistent throughout the duration of the study headloss in both the bacfs and bacctrl was similar 0 01 m d and hydraulics were not expected to impact organics reduction dissolved oxygen measured in the top 5 cm of a full scale filter ranged from 7 0 8 0 mg l decreasing to 1 0 mg l during periods of shutdown do in the bacctrl was measured at the same depth and ranged between 7 0 8 0 mg l while wastewater treatment purposefully induces anoxic conditions on aerobic organisms to preferentially select for healthy microorganisms and increase the biodegradation rate of organic matter 12 it is unclear what role this operating procedure may play in drinking water systems metagenomic analyses were conducted to provide a better understanding of potential reasons for differences between the biofilters 3 6 metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities analyses were conducted using 16s rrna sequencing to provide phylum level bacterial community structure analyses were conducted on media collected from bacctrl bacvirg and bac fs to evaluate the impact of cyclical operation bacctrl vs bacfs filter shutdown bacfs on and off and media age bacctrl vs bacvir on the biofilm community fig 3 there is an absence of published literature regarding differences in biofilm community resulting from the cyclical operation of biofilters and limited information is available on the impact of media age in all samples proteobacteria green was the most abundant phylum identified 35 48 in particular α proteobacteria a class of proteobacteria have been reported to contribute to doc removal 29 30 proteobacteria were statistically more abundant p 026 in samples obtained from a filter depth of 45 cm 43 5 when compared to those collected at 5 cm 37 3 a potential explanation may be that α proteobacteria prefer low nutrient environments as would exist at greater filter depths 31 when examining the differences between filters operated continuously and cyclically two orders burkholderiales and caldilineales and the family rhodobacteraceae were identified as being statistically more abundant in bacfs cyclical compared to the bacctrl continuous these three genera are all from proteobacteria family which may explain the improved performance associated with bacfs in terms of distribution through the filter depth burkholderiale were relatively more abundant at a depth of 45 cm rhodobacteraceae were more abundant at 5 cm than 45 cm and caldilineales were equally abundant at 5 and 45 cm no significant differences with respect to the species present were observed as a result of filter flow status on or off or media age in addition to examining the phylum present in the filters a weighted unifrac diagram was generated from principal coordinate analysis such that the phylogentic diversity of biofilm samples could be examined with respect to depth media age and operation strategy fig 4 the data presented in fig 4 had been weighted to incorporate the relative abundance of each otu as opposed to presence alone 32 differences in biofilm community diversity as a result of operating conditions bacctrl vs bacfs filter shutdown bacfs on and off media age bacctrl vs bacvir and sample depth 5 cm vs 45 cm were observed principle component 1 pc1 identifies divergence in community diversity in the cyclically operated filter as all of the full scale media samples distinctly group in an area of higher variation this is likely indicative of species tolerant of anaerobic conditions however further studies are required to fully elucidate the driving mechanisms for this diversity pc2 captures variation as a function of filter depth and filter age in continuously operated filters increasing filter depth results in lower nutrient concentrations and as such the biofilm will be dominated by bacteria that are suited to these environmental conditions when comparing samples collected at 5 and 45 cm depth in the bacctrl phosphorus decreased by 0 1 mg l ammonia decreased by 0 05 mg l and carbon decreased by 0 5 mg l differences in nutrient concentrations could result in the phylogenetic diversity represented by pc2 fig 4 biofilter shutdown periods has been shown by niquette et al 11 to increase nutrient concentrations throughout the bed depth due to biomass sloughing and decay for the current study it is hypothesized that the lower variation in the biofilm community as represented by pc2 between samples collected at 45 cm depth and 5 cm depth in bacfs compared to bacctrl was due to filter shutdown the increase in nutrients within the filter during shutdown may be sufficient to overcome the nutrient gradient that exists during operation of the bacfs bacvirg also differs from the bacctrl in terms of operational age bacvirg 1 year of operation bacctrl media 12 years this impact is shown by the vertical clustering in pc2 whereby bacctrl 5 and 45 cm samples is distinctly different from bacvirg this implies that greater biological diversity is established as the filter operates for a longer periods of time but did not result in a measurable improvement to water quality 4 conclusions as expected virgin gac filter media was superior 30 to biologically active carbon bac 8 with respect to doc removal however adsorptive capacity of the media was deemed to be exhausted after approximately 13 000 bed volumes 4 months of operation following exhaustion of adsorptive sites biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism whereby doc removals achieved by bacvirg were equal to bacctrl it is unclear at this time whether substrate carbon is directly consumed by the bacteria or if it is first adsorbed by gac and then consumed regardless of the removal mechanism the net result is biological degradation nutrient enhancement of the biologically active filters at this location was found to be unnecessary due to the limited performance improvements phosphorus enhancement increased doc and thm precursor removal however these were small improvements that would not warrant full scale implementation due to potential phosphorus breakthrough and microbial regrowth in distribution systems nitrogen enhancement did not have an impact on carbon removal as measured by doc despite almost all of the supplemented nitrogen 1 mg l being consumed across the biofilter although these results indicate that performance was not improved with nutrient enhancement it also demonstrates the robust nature of biofiltration and its ability to effectively treat varying nutrient concentrations most significantly this study demonstrated that biofilter operation can impact the biofilm community on gac media cyclically operated filters bacfs consistently removed more doc 0 1 mg l than the continuously operated filters bacctrl no significant improvement associated with cyclical operation was observed with respect to dbp precursor removal indicating that the bacteria responsible for degradation of precursors may be present regardless of operation strategy the importance of pilot studies and depth profiling were evident as they highlighted the lack of benefit associated with nutrient enhancement and changes at full scale may have been made without knowing the full effect on treated water quality furthermore without evaluating both continuously and cyclically operated biofilters the benefits of cyclical operation with respect to water quality and biological community diversity would not have been identified acknowledgements this work was funded by the national sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc chair in

14537,the objectives of this pilot scale study were to evaluate biological acclimation of virgin granular activated carbon gac quantify the impact of nutrient phosphorus and nitrogen enhancement and to compare the performance of parallel biologically active carbon bac filters operated continuously or cyclically 12 h day with respect to removal of dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursors virgin gac media outperformed biologically active carbon for an initial 4 month period in terms of doc reduction 30 as expected based on the superior performance associated with adsorption compared to biodegradation once the adsorptive capacity was exhausted and the media was biologically acclimated the performance of the new gac was statistically similar in terms of organic

microbial community analysis 1 introduction granular activated carbon gac is commonly used as a filter adsorber in drinking water systems gac filters have been shown to effectively remove natural organic matter nom 1 disinfection by product dbp precursors 2 and micropollutants including pharmaceuticals 3 as well as taste and odour compounds 4 over time general trends show that gac loses adsorptive capacity while at the same time biofilm development occurs to promote removal of various substances through biodegradation previous studies have reported the time required for biological acclimation to occur 90 days 5 however limited information is available for biofilters which receive water that been pre treated with ultrafiltration which remove particulates it has been hypothesized that carbon metabolism by biofilters may be limited by the amount of bioavailable phosphorous or nitrogen an optimal molar uptake ratio of 100 10 1 for carbon nitrogen phosphorous has previously been proposed based on the metabolic cycles of aerobic organisms 6 phosphorus has been identified as a limiting nutrient in many drinking water sources 7 and correspondingly in drinking water biofilters 8 shifting from a phosphorous or nitrogen limitation to a carbon limiting environment has been hypothesized to stimulate carbon utilization by the attached microbiome for cell synthesis and energy production thereby increasing nom biodegradation 9 mixed consensus exists in the literature regarding the efficacy of nutrient addition on biofilter performance lauderdale et al 6 reported that phosphorus addition 0 02 mg po4 p l to pre ozonated biofilter influent increased doc removal by 75 0 7 mg l compared to a passively operated biofilter 0 4 mg l with an ebct of 6 7 min in contrast mckie et al 10 and azzeh et al azzeh et al 2014 observed no impact of phosphorus or nitrogen enhancement to the filter influent 0 5 mg l c n p 10 1 1 on doc removal by biologically active anthracite or gac filters ebct 10 min receiving waters with or without pre ozonation although many water treatment facilities operate continuously some may only be operated to meet demand or to utilize available storage capacity as a result treatment systems may be operated cyclically as water is required niquette et al 11 examined the shutdown of biofilters and reported doc removal to increase once filters were re started however reasons for this improvement were not provided it is hypothesized that cyclical biofilter operation may preferentially promote the growth of nom degrading bacteria providing improved water quality such a feast and fasting phenomenon is routinely practiced in wastewater treatment where cyclic aerobic and anaerobic conditions are employed to preferentially select for healthy microorganisms and increase the biodegradation rate of organic matter 12 in this study the acclimation period of virgin gac media was monitored to better understand biofilter start up as well as the time required to achieve biological versus adsorptive removal performance was characterized by ph temperature turbidity dissolved oxygen doc and thm and haa formation potential fp to compare both continuous and cyclically operated biofilters as well as the impact of nutrient enhancement finally the biological community composition was examined to identify differences in the microbiome

carbon filtrasorb 300 calgon carbon pittsburgh pa was originally installed to provide taste and odour control the media has not been regenerated and all adsorptive capacity was assumed to be exhausted when this study was conducted 12 years following initial installation full scale biologically active carbon bac filters are operated for approximately 8 12 h per day loss of head is minimal due to the low turbidity in the post uf influent table 1 as such the filters are typically backwashed every 6 months 2 2 pilot configuration and experimental design the biofiltration pilot treatment train used

weeks until maximum uptake was observed the fourth pilot filter bacvir contained virgin gac filtrasorb 300 fig 1 finally the cyclically operated full scale filter bacfs was monitored in parallel to the continuously operated pilot filters biological acclimation of the virgin gac was observed over a period of seven months the filter was deemed to be biologically active when doc removal plateaued and was approximately that observed at full scale all trials evaluating the impact of nutrient enhancement were conducted when the water temperature was consistently above 10 c 11 17 c as lower water temperatures 10 c have been shown to negatively impact biofiltration performance 13 filters were provided with increasing concentrations of additional nutrients n and p over a period of six weeks until maximum uptake was observed nutrient concentrations were measured twice per week and concentrations were increased each week until breakthrough was observed filters were then dosed n 0 8 mg l as nh4 n and p 0 3 mg l as po4 p to satisfy maximum uptake samples were collected over a six week period and analyzed weekly for ph temperature dissolved oxygen do organic carbon doc uv254 absorbance and dbp formation potential fp nutrient concentrations in biofilter influent and effluent were measured twice a week to assess uptake and ensure consistent dosing media samples were collected from a sampling port located 5 cm from the top of the filters and analyzed monthly for atp concentration on the media during acclimation atp was also monitored before and after nutrient enhancement finally media samples were collected from 5 cm and 45 cm depths to evaluate bacterial community composition and quantify changes in biomass density as measured by atp 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic

pyrosequencing bacterial dna was extracted from the filter media the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using a universal forward sequencing primer and a universally barcoded reverse sequencing primer to allow for multiplexing as previously described by 15 each media sample was prepared and analyzed in triplicate dna sequences were quality filtered assembled and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 minimum identity using the uparse pipeline provided within usearch 16 taxonomy was assigned with an 80 confidence by the utax algorithm as determined by a single species control pao1 a total of 4280 otus were identified 1467 remained after removing low abundance otus 0 005 relative abundance a rarefaction depth of 8500 sequences per sample was selected as this represented the minimum number of sequences present in an individual sample replicate 2 4 statistical analyses paired student t tests were conducted at a 95 significance level and evaluated the impact of nutrient addition phosphorus or nitrogen on biofiltration performance in terms of doc removal a one tailed t test was selected to compare nutrient enhanced filters to the control biofilter this test was utilized as it would determine whether the enhanced filters provided a statistically significant performance improvement finally an unpaired two tailed test was used to compare continuous bacctrl and cyclical operation bacfs 17 a two tailed test was implemented for this comparison to evaluate whether there was a difference between the two operating methods without considering which treatment provided superior performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 continuous biofiltration operation and performance the bacctrl operated continuously without nutrient addition consistently reduced doc by 5 8 1 9 0 3 0 1 mg l from the influent previous studies have shown biofiltration alone to remove 6 11 of doc although higher doc reductions 20 25 have been reported when ozonation is applied 18 19 the control filter effectively reduced thm fp by 14 28 23 8 8 7 μg l and haa fp by 11 26 5 7 2 7 μg l these reductions were approximately 3 4 times greater than doc removal 6 8 suggesting that the filters preferentially degraded dbp precursor material this is supported by the literature where hydrophobic fractions of doc in particular the small sized constituents molecular weight 1 kda served as dbp precursors and were more amenable to biodegradation 20 n 2 for atp analysis n 6 for all other parameters 3 2 media acclimation following one month of operation atp on the virgin gac media was 75 100 ng g increasing within 4 months to 334 407 ng g and similar p 0 05 to the bacctrl 350 780 ng g fig 2 these values were greater than the benchmark used to define a biologically active filter of 100 ng cm3 as suggested by pharand et al 21 initial doc removal across the virgin gac was consistently high 1 2 mg l 30 similar doc removal 0 3 mg l 8 p 0 05 to the bac control was observed following 4 months of operation 13 000 bed volumes suggesting that the adsorptive capacity for doc was exhausted and that the gac was biologically acclimated a comparable acclimation period 70 days was reported by kim et al 22 where a virgin gac filter calgon f 400 consistently achieved higher doc removal 1 3 mg l 56 compared to a bac filter operated at the same ebct 10 min for the first 70 days after which removal efficiencies were similar 0 9 mg l 39 3 3 nutrient uptake it was anticipated that the pilot filters were operating under nutrient limiting conditions since concentrations of p and n in the raw water were less than their detection limits of 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively assuming that all of the doc was available for biodegradation 4 mg l addition of 0 48 mg n l and 0 1 mg p l respectively would satisfy nutrient requirements based on the 100 10 1c n p molar ratio described by lauderdale et al 6 this nutrient ratio has been shown to be important to for microbial development throughout environmental systems to ensure carbon limiting conditions n and p were supplemented at 0 8 mg l as nh4 n and 0 3 mg l as po4 p phosphorus uptake across bacp was approximately 13 0 04 mg l similar to previous studies and consistent with the predicted theoretical uptake 23 ammonia nitrogen conversion across the enhanced biofilter was consistently high 0 78 0 15 mg l with 0 01 mg l observed in the effluent yu et al 24 reported up to 80 removal of nitrogen as nh4 n across full scale bac sand filters ebct 6 7 min treating surface water contaminated with ammonia average nh4 n0 3 67 mg l the ammonia was likely removed though nitrification by the biofilm this pathway specifically targets ammonia nitrogen without impacting organic carbon degradation 24 3 4 impact of nutrient enhancement both bacp and bacn had similar p 0 05 atp concentrations 355 551 ng g when compared to bacctrl 373 485 ng g indicating that nutrient addition did not impact the concentration of the active biomass over the two month enhancement period table 2 bacp removed slightly more doc 0 4 mg l when compared to bacctrl 0 3 mg l in agreement with lauderdale et al 6 and sang et al 25 where phosphorus enhancement 0 02 mg l as po4 p improved doc removal mckie et al 10 and melin et al 26 reported no effect on doc removal upon phosphorus addition of 0 5 mg l and 0 02 mg l as po4 p respectively as such it can be inferred that the impact of nutrient addition is site specific and potentially influenced by source water nom composition or the indigenous microbial community phosphorus addition had a small but significant p 0 05 impact on the reduction of thm fp 6 8 μg l while no effect was observed on haa fp table 2 gallard and von gunten 27 reported a reduction in ph 8 7 to be associated with reduced thm formation 66 16 μg l upon chlorination cl2 dose 5 7 mg l due to slower reaction kinetics 0 03 m 1s 1 to 0 01 m 1s 1 although the addition of phosphoric acid may have impacted thm fp reduction by reducing ph it is more likely that the increased reduction of doc was responsible for the observed thm fp reductions although phosphorus was supplemented as phosphoric acid in this study the ph of the enhanced filter effluent 7 2 8 0 was consistent p 0 05 with the control 7 2 8 1 therefore any reduction in thm fp can be attributed to biodegradation independent of ph related dbp reaction kinetics based on observations for this source water phosphorus addition could offer some benefit in reducing thm formation following subsequent chlorination phosphorus breakthrough 0 24 0 26 mg l however is a potential drawback as low phosphorus concentrations in drinking water 0 01 0 05 mg l have been associated with microbial growth in distribution systems 28 potentially outweighing improvements in dbp precursor removal further studies may be warranted to examine the effect of lower p dosages 0 1 mg l on biofilter performance while minimizing phosphorus breakthrough nitrogen enhancement did not improve filter performance as there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the reduction of doc thm or haa fps when compared to bacctrl despite an uptake of 0 75 mg l table 2 there was a correspondingly high do uptake across the bacn 1 7 mg l when compared to the bacctrl 0 48 mg l as discussed earlier nitrogen consumption could be an inherent characteristic of biofilters that does not contribute to overall organic carbon removal performance 24 oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in the presence of nitrifying bacteria could help explain the oxygen consumption phylum level bacterial community structure fig 3 indicated the presence of nitrospira a genus of bacteria commonly associated with the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate on both bacctrtl and bacfs filter media dna analysis was not performed on the nitrogen enhanced filter the occurrence of nitrates in the biofilter effluents was not monitored and as such a specific degradation mechanism cannot be proposed however based on the conversion of ammonia and presence of nitrite oxidizing bacteria it is assumed that nitrification may occur within the filter 3 5 impact of filter operation full scale biofilters were operated for 8 12 h per day based on system demand pilot scale filters were operated continuously of interest bacfs achieved significantly p 0 05 higher doc removal 0 4 0 1 mg l when compared to the bacctrl 0 3 0 1 mg l table 2 although the difference is relatively small removals were consistent throughout the duration of the study headloss in both the bacfs and bacctrl was similar 0 01 m d and hydraulics were not expected to impact organics reduction dissolved oxygen measured in the top 5 cm of a full scale filter ranged from 7 0 8 0 mg l decreasing to 1 0 mg l during periods of shutdown do in the bacctrl was measured at the same depth and ranged between 7 0 8 0 mg l while wastewater treatment purposefully induces anoxic conditions on aerobic organisms to preferentially select for healthy microorganisms and increase the biodegradation rate of organic matter 12 it is unclear what role this operating procedure may play in drinking water systems metagenomic analyses were conducted to provide a better understanding of potential reasons for differences between the biofilters 3 6 metagenomic analysis of bacterial communities analyses were conducted using 16s rrna sequencing to provide phylum level bacterial community structure analyses were conducted on media collected from bacctrl bacvirg and bac fs to evaluate the impact of cyclical operation bacctrl vs bacfs filter shutdown bacfs on and off and media age bacctrl vs bacvir on the biofilm community fig 3 there is an absence of published literature regarding differences in biofilm community resulting from the cyclical operation of biofilters and limited information is available on the impact of media age in all samples proteobacteria green was the most abundant phylum identified 35 48 in particular α proteobacteria a class of proteobacteria have been reported to contribute to doc removal 29 30 proteobacteria were statistically more abundant p 026 in samples obtained from a filter depth of 45 cm 43 5 when compared to those collected at 5 cm 37 3 a potential explanation may be that α proteobacteria prefer low nutrient environments as would exist at greater filter depths 31 when examining the differences between filters operated continuously and cyclically two orders burkholderiales and caldilineales and the family rhodobacteraceae were identified as being statistically more abundant in bacfs cyclical compared to the bacctrl continuous these three genera are all from proteobacteria family which may explain the improved performance associated with bacfs in terms of distribution through the filter depth burkholderiale were relatively more abundant at a depth of 45 cm rhodobacteraceae were more abundant at 5 cm than 45 cm and caldilineales were equally abundant at 5 and 45 cm no significant differences with respect to the species present were observed as a result of filter flow status on or off or media age in addition to examining the phylum present in the filters a weighted unifrac diagram was generated from principal coordinate analysis such that the phylogentic diversity of biofilm samples could be examined with respect to depth media age and operation strategy fig 4 the data presented in fig 4 had been weighted to incorporate the relative abundance of each otu as opposed to presence alone 32 differences in biofilm community diversity as a result of operating conditions bacctrl vs bacfs filter shutdown bacfs on and off media age bacctrl vs bacvir and sample depth 5 cm vs 45 cm were observed principle component 1 pc1 identifies divergence in community diversity in the cyclically operated filter as all of the full scale media samples distinctly group in an area of higher variation this is likely indicative of species tolerant of anaerobic conditions however further studies are required to fully elucidate the driving mechanisms for this diversity pc2 captures variation as a function of filter depth and filter age in continuously operated filters increasing filter depth results in lower nutrient concentrations and as such the biofilm will be dominated by bacteria that are suited to these environmental conditions when comparing samples collected at 5 and 45 cm depth in the bacctrl phosphorus decreased by 0 1 mg l ammonia decreased by 0 05 mg l and carbon decreased by 0 5 mg l differences in nutrient concentrations could result in the phylogenetic diversity represented by pc2 fig 4 biofilter shutdown periods has been shown by niquette et al 11 to increase nutrient concentrations throughout the bed depth due to biomass sloughing and decay for the current study it is hypothesized that the lower variation in the biofilm community as represented by pc2 between samples collected at 45 cm depth and 5 cm depth in bacfs compared to bacctrl was due to filter shutdown the increase in nutrients within the filter during shutdown may be sufficient to overcome the nutrient gradient that exists during operation of the bacfs bacvirg also differs from the bacctrl in terms of operational age bacvirg 1 year of operation bacctrl media 12 years this impact is shown by the vertical clustering in pc2 whereby bacctrl 5 and 45 cm samples is distinctly different from bacvirg this implies that greater biological diversity is established as the filter operates for a longer periods of time but did not result in a measurable improvement to water quality 4 conclusions as expected virgin gac filter media was superior 30 to biologically active carbon bac 8 with respect to doc removal however adsorptive capacity of the media was deemed to be exhausted after approximately 13 000 bed volumes 4 months of operation following exhaustion of adsorptive sites biodegradation was the dominant removal mechanism whereby doc removals achieved by bacvirg were equal to bacctrl it is unclear at this time whether substrate carbon is directly consumed by the bacteria or if it is first adsorbed by gac and then consumed regardless of the removal mechanism the net result is biological degradation nutrient enhancement of the biologically active filters at this location was found to be unnecessary due to the limited performance improvements phosphorus enhancement increased doc and thm precursor removal however these were small improvements that would not warrant full scale implementation due to potential phosphorus breakthrough and microbial regrowth in distribution systems nitrogen enhancement did not have an impact on carbon removal as measured by doc despite almost all of the supplemented nitrogen 1 mg l being consumed across the biofilter although these results indicate that performance was not improved with nutrient enhancement it also demonstrates the robust nature of biofiltration and its ability to effectively treat varying nutrient concentrations most significantly this study demonstrated that biofilter operation can impact the biofilm community on gac media cyclically operated filters bacfs consistently removed more doc 0 1 mg l than the continuously operated filters bacctrl no significant improvement associated with cyclical operation was observed with respect to dbp precursor removal indicating that the bacteria responsible for degradation of precursors may be present regardless of operation strategy the importance of pilot studies and depth profiling were evident as they highlighted the lack of benefit associated with nutrient enhancement and changes at full scale may have been made without knowing the full effect on treated water quality furthermore without evaluating both continuously and cyclically operated biofilters the benefits of cyclical operation with respect to water quality and biological community diversity would not have been identified acknowledgements this work was funded by the national sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc chair in

14538,in this study we functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube with polar groups including cooh and oh groups f mwcnt and synthesized composite polymer hydrogel via dispersion in monomer solution and by using a simple poly acrylic acid co maleic anhydride paa co pma crosslinking reaction incorporation of the f mwcnt phase into the paa co pma hydrogel network was verified using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the physico chemical properties of the composite polymer hydrogels were investigated and compered to pure hydrogel in addition the effect of f mwcnt incorporation on polymer hydrogels performance as forward osmosis draw agent was studied the results indicated that the addition of f mwcnt 1 2 wt within the polymer hydrogel enhanced the water adsorbing capacity of the composite hydrogel as expected furthermore the composite hydrogel 1 2 wt of incorporated f mwcnt displayed a much higher water flux compared with the pure paa co pma polymer hydrogel during the fo test the facile and efficient preparation of the f mwcnt incorporated paa co pma composite hydrogel means it will have potential applications as a novel draw agent keywords draw agent forward osmosis multiwall carbon nanotube polymer hydrogel 1 introduction in recent years fresh water scarcity has become one of the major global issues due to the growing population 1 2 which has in part been addressed by the seawater desalination as well as recycling wastewater to date various technologies have been developed for sea and saline water desalination in which membrane based reverse osmosis ro and thermal based multistage flash msf evaporation processes are mostly dominated 3 but this current technology is energy intensive processes due to the high solute concentration of seawater and limited energy efficiency of conventional thermal separation 4 5 thus developing environmentally low cost and high efficiency technologies or methods for water purification and seawater desalination are of strategic importance for meeting the all current and foreseeable demands of clean water 6 forward osmosis fo as a novel membrane based water treatment process has attracted much attention in recent years owing to its lower energy consumption easy operation higher rejection of contaminants and much lower fouling tendency compared to reverse osmosis desalination 3 7 8 in fo process the natural osmotic pressure gradient between two solutions with different solute concentration act as driving force spontaneously water molecules of the feed solution with lower osmotic pressure can be moved to the draw solution with higher osmotic pressure 9 11 one of the obstacles to the development of fo desalination is the limited choice of draw agent of which type and concentration influence the efficiency of the fo process 12 thus the selection of a suitable draw agent is highly important for a high performance fo system 13 in general an ideal draw or osmotic agent should generate high enough osmotic pressure relative to the feed solution and should be easily and efficiently regenerated and recovered from diluted feed solution with minimized energy consumption in addition other criteria like low reverse solute flux non toxicity and capability for large scale production should also be taken into consideration 14 hydrogels as three dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks when brought into contact with water are capable of swelling and retaining significant amounts of water within its structure 15 16 of various hydrogels chemically cross linked polymer hydrogels are the most widely used in applications in particular presence of large amount of ionic functional groups in polymer backbone of hydrogels cause to an osmotic pressure difference between the interior of the hydrogel and the surrounding solution thus water molecules can be drawn into the polymer chains of hydrogel network 17 18 in synthesis of polymer hydrogels polymer with ionic functional groups also hydrophilic and flexible characteristic is required but this polymer generally lacks sufficient rigidity strength and mechanical properties whereas carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube cnt and graphene oxide go because of their exceptional electrical conductivity are stiffer and stronger so by incorporation such nanomaterials within the polymer hydrogels nanocomposite hydrogels with improved characteristic were obtained carbon nanotubes cnts as graphene sheets rolled into tubes based on the number of concentric walls are classified into two different categories single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts which usually don t have polar functional groups in their pristine form non functionalized or unmodified cnts need to be functionalized with polar functional groups i e carboxyl cooh or hydroxyl oh groups via different methods to make high stable dispersed solution or make them soluble in aqueous medium 19 cnt based nanocomposite polymer hydrogels have applications in a wide variety of fields including high performance composites drug delivery sensors actuators and water treatment 20 in this study composite poly acrylic acid co maleic anhydride paa co pmamw hydrogels were developed by incorporation cooh functionalized mwcnt as the reinforcing phase within the paa co pma polymer hydrogels the concentration of f mwcnt within the paa co pma polymer hydrogel matrix was varied to investigate the effects on resultant mechanical and other physicochemical properties results will help establish composite paa co pmamw polymer hydrogels as a new draw agent for forward osmosis process to our knowledge this is the first time functionalized mwcnt based paa co pma polymer hydrogels have been fabricated and tested for fo draw agent 2 experimental section 2 1 materials mwcnts were provided by tsinghua maine nano powder commercialization engineering centre mwcnt the average diameters is about 10 20 nm and the average length is about 30 μm and functionalized by hno3 acrylic acid aa merck and maleic anhydride ma merck as a monomer methylene bisacrylamide mba merck as a crosslinker and ammonium persulphate aps sigma aldrich as initiator was used for the synthesis of polymer hydrogel 2 2 functionalization of mwcnts in a typical procedure 0 3 g of the pristine mwcnts were add to a 25 ml of the nitric acid 65 wt in a 100 ml round bottom flask and dispersed for 30 min at room temperature the obtained mixture is warmed to refluxing temperature and then refluxed under magnetic stirring for 48 h after which the reaction mixture diluted with water and then by using a vacuum filtration was filtered the precipitated sample was washed with di water until ph is neutralized and then dried in vacuum oven at 40 c for 24 h this sample is named as oxidative functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes and designated with f mwcnts 2 3 synthesis of pure and composite polymer hydrogels to synthesize the pure polymer hydrogel 1 ml of acrylic acid aa and 0 5 g of maleic anhydride ma as monomers and 0 08 g of mba as cross linker were dissolved in 30 ml of di water in a tree neck round bottom flask the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at 4 c and for residual oxygen removal nitrogen gas was bubbled in the solution for 30 min once the solution had cooled to 4 c a solution of aps as initiator 8 mg was dissolve in di water 5 ml and added to the reaction mixture which was then stirred at 70 c for 1 h after completion of polymerization reaction to remove any unreacted starting material including monomers cross linker or initiator the resultant hydrogels were cut into small pieces and immersed into ultra pure water at r t after 3 days the polymer hydrogel collected and dried at 80 c in a convection oven composite polymer hydrogels were prepared similar to the described procedure except that prior to the free radical polymerization process functionalized mwcnt with different concentration was dispersed in the monomer solution the synthesized composite polymer hydrogels were denoted by paa co pmamw1 paa co pmamw2 and paa co pmamw3 corresponding to the f mwcnt loading of 0 4 wt 0 8 wt and 1 2 wt in monomer solution respectively the procedure used for the synthesis of pure and composite polymer hydrogels was schematically illustrated in scheme 1 2 4 characterization and measurements the hydrogel surface morphology was determined by scanning electronic microscopy sem zeiss dsm 960 a germany attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir bruker equinox 55 spectroscopy was used to study the chemical compositions of the polymeric hydrogel samples over the wave number range of 600 3900 cm 1 to investigate the effect of mwcnt incorporation on mechanical strength of the prepared composite hydrogels hydrogel samples with rectangular stripes were formed in the glass tube with a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 40 mm and stretched by a tensile machine ct3 texture analyzer tensile testing equipment brookfield engineering and for decrease error each experiment conducted 4 times 2 5 swelling ratio of polymer hydrogels the swelling ratios srs of both pure and composite polymer hydrogels were gravimetrically measured as follows 0 1 g of dried samples were immersed into 250 ml ultra pure water and the mass weighed at different times from 0 to 24 h the sr was calculated by eq 1 21 1 s r w s w d w d where ws and wd are the weight of the swollen hydrogel after a certain time of test and the initial weight of the dry hydrogel powder before swelling test respectively the srs of the polymer hydrogels in 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution was measured in the same way all experiments were operated in r t and three times 2 6 water flux evaluation the performance of the obtained polymer hydrogels as draw agent was evaluated in a lab scale fo set up schematically illustrated in fig 1 first of all a semipermeable membrane placed in the set up between the feed solution and draw agent and two parts of set up clamped 0 2 g of the grounded hydrogel powders as draw agent were put onto fo membrane with selective layer facing the hydrogel active layer facing draw solution al ds fo mode the fo process was conducted at room temperature as it is shown in fig 1 saline water as feed solution passes the fo membrane to the hydrogel as draw agent the water permeation flux jv lmh was determined by the feed volume decrement as the following equation 22 f 2 j v δ v a a t where δva is the volume change l of the feed solution over a specific period of time t h a m2 is the effective area of the fo membrane 4 9 cm2 2 7 hydrogel recycling evaluation the investigation of polymer hydrogel reusability was evaluated in a manner similar to that previously described in refs 11 22 the polymer hydrogels were removed from the fo set up and dried in oven at 50 c for 24 h to a constant weight after grounding the dried polymer hydrogel samples into fine powders for the second cycle fo performance of hydrogel as draw agent was measured similar to described manner where the volume changes of the feed solution upon trial time were recorded to calculate water flux the same approach was repeated for the subsequent cycles 3 result and discussions 3 1 characterization of the f mwcnt hydrophilicity is an important prerequisite for water absorption thus cnt composites involved in fo process have to present this requirement the dispersion of unmodified cnts in the aqueous media is one of the key hampers in their development as practical draw agent owing to the rather hydrophobic character of the concentric carbon walls in order to disperse carbon nanotubes successfully it is required to functionalize mwcnts with polar functional groups such as oh and cooh to amplify hydrophilicity and compatibility of mwcnts with the hydrophilic polymer matrix is necessary ftir spectroscopy is used for the identification of the surface functional groups formed through oxidation of mwcnt by hno3 treatment fig 2 a for unmodified mwcnt the absorption peak at 1590 cm 1 is attributed to the conjugated cc stretching related to mwcnt another peaks at 2850 cm 1 and 2920 cm 1 are assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of aliphatic methylene groups respectively 23 furthermore these characteristic peaks additional band in the ftir spectrum of f mwcnt is appeared the peaks at 3415 and 1690 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of oh and co of carboxyl groups respectively 24 in addition the peak at 1080 cm 1 is assigned to the co stretching vibration 25 presence of these peaks suggests that functionalization of the mwcnts have introduced cooh and oh as polar functional groups on the surface of mwcnts xrd studies carried out in order to expound whether there is a change in the crystal structure of mwcnt after functionalization fig 2b shows that xrd patterns of mwcnts before and after oxidation reaction and shows that the f mwcnt and pristine mwcnt have similar crystalline structure which indicates the oxidative functionalization process does not change the crystalline structure of the mwcnts 3 2 preparation and characterization of pure and composite polymer hydrogels pure polymer hydrogel was prepared by in situ free radical polymerization of maleic anhydride in acrylic acid solution at 70 c using mba as crosslinker and aps as a redox initiator then the maleic anhydride in polymer hydrogel paa co pma backbone was hydrolyzed by using alkaline solution to convert them to the polar dicarboxylic acid groups composite polymer hydrogels were synthesized by the same method except that before the polymerization reaction the f mwcnt was dispersed in the acrylic acid monomer solution uniform polymer hydrogels were obtained and the color of the composite hydrogels with increasing the f mwcnt loadings within the polymer hydrogels turned darker fig 3 shows the ft ir results of pure and composite polymer hydrogels information for the incorporation of f mwcnt can be obtained by comparison of these spectra for the pure paa co pma hydrogel the curve shows the presence of oh bonds at 3238 cm 1 ch bonds at 2932 cm 1 and co stretching vibration absorption bonds at 1590 cm 1 these characteristic peaks confirmed the polymerization of aa and ma monomers and formation of pure paa co pma hydrogel as compared to the spectra of pure polymer hydrogel composite polymer hydrogel paa co pmamw3 exhibited the characteristic absorption signals of f mwcnt functional groups in the region of 1500 1700 and 1300 1400 cm 1 that confirmed the incorporation of f mwcnt within the polymer network and successfully synthesis of composite hydrogels in addition compared with the ftir spectrum of the pure paa co pma hydrogel the composite hydrogel shows two increased absorption bands at 1690 cm 1 and 1380 cm 1 which indicates that the f mwcnt phases have been successfully added into the polymer hydrogel matrix surface characteristic of the hydrogels has the significant effects on water absorbency of hydrogels and its retention rate hence hydrogel microstructure morphologies are one of the main properties must be attended in synthesized hydrogels in order to investigate the effect of f mwcnt incorporation on polymer hydrogel morphology the sem images of the pure and composite polymer hydrogels with different weight ratio of f mwcnt 0 4 1 2 wt were taken at low and high magnification as shown in fig 4 the sem micrographs confirm that all of the hydrogel samples have average sizes ranging from 10 μm to 20 μm and showed significant differences in the surface morphology after f mwcnt incorporation compared to hydrogel without f mwcnt incorporation as controls in the sem images fig 4a pure polymer hydrogel without f mwcnt incorporation shows a much dense and smoother surface than those of f mwcnt incorporated composite hydrogel fig 4c d indicates the morphology of composite polymer hydrogels with 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 wt of f mwcnt in which the carbon nanotube disperse within the polymer matrix as can be seen composite hydrogel possess slightly rougher surfaces these rough and wrinkle surfaces arising from the incorporation of f mwcnt can be assigned to the faster water releasing and network contraction during the composite hydrogel drying process the sem images revealed that the f mwcnt incorporation changes morphology of the pure polymer hydrogel so that composite hydrogels had 3d network structure with pore diameters at the micrometric level 3 3 mechanical properties stress strain test for all samples were investigated and shown in fig 5 as can be seen the concentration of f mwcnt has significant influences on mechanical properties of polymer hydrogels paa co pmamw3 has higher values of tensile strength and modulus than pristine and other composite polymer hydrogels when the concentration of mwcnt within the composite polymer hydrogel is increased from 0 4 wt to 1 2 wt the tensile strength is improved from 150 kpa to 300 kpa the highest tensile strength of the pristine polymer hydrogel were calculated to be 130 kpa when 1 2 wt of the mwcnt dispersed in monomer solution and incorporated in polymer hydrogel matrix the maximum strength in fabricated composite polymer hydrogel reach to 2 2 times of the pristine hydrogel as a result of reinforcement effect from the finely dispersed f mwcnts nanofillers throughout the polymer matrix in particular the addition of f mwcnt into polymer hydrogel matrix is shortening the interlayer gap consequently strengthening the interaction between polymer hydrogel matrix leads to enhancement of their mechanical properties as specified by the increase of tensile strength and modulus 26 3 4 swelling behavior in appraisal of the properties of polymer hydrogels the swelling capacity is one of the most attending parameters important parameters must be considered fig 6 compares the swelling ratios of different polymer hydrogels including pure hydrogel without f mwcnt incorporation and composite hydrogels with f mwcnt incorporation the swelling behavior of hydrogels is impressed by the presence of f mwcnt with increasing the f mwcnt loading in hydrogels matrix the outcome composite polymer hydrogels exhibit higher swelling capacity the swelling capacity of polymer hydrogel mainly controlled by an interior osmotic pressure gradient that is directly related to the number of ionic functional groups crosslinking points hydrophilicity and the interaction between the polymer and the solvent the improvement of swelling ratios in composite hydrogels can be ascribed to the hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups at the surface of f mwcnt which are incorporated in the polymer matrix and causes faster water diffusion in the polymer network moreover the incorporation of these nanofillers with polar surfaces into polymer hydrogel matrix may increase the driving force osmotic pressure by increasing the accessibility of the charged groups inside the hydrogel matrix 21 the increase of osmotic pressure in hydrogels by incorporation f mwcnt may responsible to the improvement in the water uptake capacity and swelling ratio of composite hydrogels it has been proven that increasing accessible surface area by creation of porosity in polymer hydrogel network is an effective way to enhance swelling capacity in polymer hydrogels 27 the swelling behavior of polymer hydrogels in 2000 ppm sodium chloride aqueous solution compared to di water and results are presented in fig 6b as can be seen the absorption values of both pure and composited polymer hydrogel are much lower than di water there might be two reasons i decrease in the concentration difference between the surrounding solution and hydrogel matrix thus decreasing in the osmotic pressure as driving force and ii the screening effect of the counter ions na on the anionic functional groups coo of paa co pma polymer hydrogel and f mwcnt nano fillers 3 5 fo process for water treatment by fo process we need draw solution with high osmolality to provide high osmotic pressure driving force and thus high water flux fig 7 a demonstrated the water flux profiles as a function of fo process duration of each hydrogel pure and different composite polymer hydrogels in powder form for the pure polymer hydrogel the water flux in the first 0 5 h fo process is 0 75 lmh l m2 h whereas the water flux produced by 0 4 wt incorporated f mwcnt is 1 2 lmh and water flux for the other composite polymer hydrogels increased by raising f mwcnt loadings in polymer hydrogel matrix at 1 2 wt of f mwcnt loading the paa co pmamw3 composite hydrogel achieves a water flux of 2 2 lmh which represents 227 enhancement as compared with the pure polymer hydrogel the improved fluxes in the fo process by incorporation hydrophilic f mwcnt can be attributed to the enhancement of swelling osmotic pressures of composite polymer hydrogels in addition rough and wrinkle surface in composite hydrogel lead to higher surface area compared to the pure polymer hydrogel as can be seen the water fluxes for both pure and composite polymer hydrogels after a few hours of testing decreased during the fo test the natural osmotic pressure gradient between hydrogel and feed solution act as driving force so the pure water is driven through the semipermeable membrane from feed to the side of draw agents by rejecting hydrated salts na and cl as the fo process proceeds the networks of polymer hydrogels entrap the permeated water and become swollen hence the swelling pressure of the polymer hydrogels decreased thus a reduction in water flux was observed in conclusion composite polymer hydrogel with around 1 2 wt of f mwcnt achieved the highest water fluxes which are consistent with the trend in their swelling ratios in the present study we worked on the recyclability of our pure and composite polymer hydrogels in four cycles we select pure polymer hydrogel and paa co pmamw3 hydrogel as a model for composite hydrogels to be used in recycling process as can be seen from fig 7b both pure and composite polymer hydrogels show good recyclability in terms of water flux in four cycles 4 conclusion the present study gives the synthesis of f mwcnt incorporated polymer hydrogels as draw agent in forward osmosis process for these hydrogels structural conformation was obtained from ft ir and sem analysis the resulting f mwcnt incorporated nanocomposite hydrogel shows better swelling properties compared with the pure polymer hydrogel water flux data in fo process confirmed promising characteristic of composited polymer hydrogel than pure polymer hydrogel combined with other merits such as easy synthesis procedure no degradation effects on the fo membrane and long durability make this nanocomposite hydrogel polymer as an ideal draw agent for fo desalination acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial and instrumental

14538,in this study we functionalized multiwall carbon nanotube with polar groups including cooh and oh groups f mwcnt and synthesized composite polymer hydrogel via dispersion in monomer solution and by using a simple poly acrylic acid co maleic anhydride paa co pma crosslinking reaction incorporation of the f mwcnt phase into the paa co pma hydrogel network was verified using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir and scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the physico chemical properties of the composite polymer hydrogels were investigated and compered to pure hydrogel in addition the effect of f mwcnt incorporation on polymer hydrogels performance as forward osmosis draw agent was studied the results indicated that the addition of f mwcnt 1 2 wt within the polymer hydrogel enhanced the water adsorbing capacity of the composite hydrogel as expected furthermore the composite hydrogel 1 2 wt of incorporated f mwcnt displayed a much higher water flux compared with the pure paa co pma polymer hydrogel during the fo test the facile and efficient preparation of the f mwcnt incorporated paa co pma composite hydrogel means it will have potential applications as a novel draw agent keywords draw agent forward osmosis multiwall carbon nanotube polymer hydrogel 1 introduction in recent years fresh water scarcity has become one of the major global issues due to the growing population 1 2 which has in part been addressed by the seawater desalination as well as recycling wastewater to date various technologies have been developed for sea and saline water desalination in which membrane based reverse osmosis ro and thermal based multistage flash msf evaporation processes are mostly dominated 3 but this current technology is energy intensive processes due to the high solute concentration of seawater and limited energy efficiency of conventional thermal separation 4 5 thus developing environmentally low cost and high efficiency technologies or methods for water purification and seawater desalination are of strategic importance for meeting the all current and foreseeable demands of clean water 6 forward osmosis fo as a novel membrane based water treatment process has attracted much attention in recent years owing to its lower energy consumption easy operation higher rejection of contaminants and much lower fouling tendency compared to reverse osmosis desalination 3 7 8 in fo process the natural osmotic pressure gradient between two solutions with different solute concentration act as driving force spontaneously water molecules of the feed solution with lower osmotic pressure can be moved to the draw solution with higher osmotic pressure 9 11 one of the obstacles to the development of fo desalination is the limited choice of draw agent of which type and concentration influence the efficiency of the fo process 12 thus the selection of a suitable draw agent is highly important for a high performance fo system 13 in general an ideal draw or osmotic agent should generate high enough osmotic pressure relative to the feed solution and should be easily and efficiently regenerated and recovered from diluted feed solution with minimized energy consumption in addition other criteria like low reverse solute flux non toxicity and capability for large scale production should also be taken into consideration 14 hydrogels as three dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks when brought into contact with water are capable of swelling and retaining significant amounts of water within its structure 15 16 of various hydrogels chemically cross linked polymer hydrogels are the most widely used in applications in particular presence of large amount of ionic functional groups in polymer backbone of hydrogels cause to an osmotic pressure difference between the interior of the hydrogel and the surrounding solution thus water molecules can be drawn into the polymer chains of hydrogel network 17 18 in synthesis of polymer hydrogels polymer with ionic functional groups also hydrophilic and flexible characteristic is required but this polymer generally lacks sufficient rigidity strength and mechanical properties whereas carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube cnt and graphene oxide go because of their exceptional electrical conductivity are stiffer and stronger so by incorporation such nanomaterials within the polymer hydrogels nanocomposite hydrogels with improved characteristic were obtained carbon nanotubes cnts as graphene sheets rolled into tubes based on the number of concentric walls are classified into two different categories single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts which usually don t have polar functional groups in their pristine form non functionalized or unmodified cnts need to be functionalized with polar functional groups i e carboxyl cooh or hydroxyl oh groups via different methods to make high stable dispersed solution or make them soluble in aqueous medium 19 cnt based nanocomposite polymer hydrogels have applications in a wide variety of fields including high performance composites drug delivery sensors actuators and water treatment 20 in this study composite poly acrylic acid co maleic anhydride paa co pmamw hydrogels were developed by incorporation cooh functionalized mwcnt as the reinforcing phase within the paa co pma polymer hydrogels the concentration of f mwcnt within the paa co pma polymer hydrogel matrix was varied to investigate the effects on resultant mechanical and other physicochemical properties results will help establish composite paa co pmamw polymer hydrogels as a new draw agent for forward osmosis process to our knowledge this is the first time functionalized mwcnt based paa co pma polymer hydrogels have been fabricated and tested for fo draw agent 2 experimental section 2 1 materials mwcnts were provided by tsinghua maine nano powder commercialization engineering centre mwcnt the average diameters is about 10 20 nm and the average length is about 30 μm and functionalized by hno3 acrylic acid aa merck and maleic anhydride ma merck as a monomer methylene bisacrylamide mba merck as a crosslinker and ammonium persulphate aps sigma aldrich as initiator was used for the synthesis of polymer hydrogel 2 2 functionalization of mwcnts in a typical procedure 0 3 g of the pristine mwcnts were add to a 25 ml of the nitric acid 65 wt in a 100 ml round bottom flask and dispersed for 30 min at room temperature the obtained mixture is warmed to refluxing temperature and then refluxed under magnetic stirring for 48 h after which the reaction mixture diluted with water and then by using a vacuum filtration was filtered the precipitated sample was washed with di water until ph is neutralized and then dried in vacuum oven at 40 c for 24 h this sample is named as oxidative functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes and designated with f mwcnts 2 3 synthesis of pure and composite polymer hydrogels to synthesize the pure polymer hydrogel 1 ml of acrylic acid aa and 0 5 g of maleic anhydride ma as monomers and 0 08 g of mba as cross linker were dissolved in 30 ml of di water in a tree neck round bottom flask the reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min at 4 c and for residual oxygen removal nitrogen gas was bubbled in the solution for 30 min once the solution had cooled to 4 c a solution of aps as initiator 8 mg was dissolve in di water 5 ml and added to the reaction mixture which was then stirred at 70 c for 1 h after completion of polymerization reaction to remove any unreacted starting material including monomers cross linker or initiator the resultant hydrogels were cut into small pieces and immersed into ultra pure water at r t after 3 days the polymer hydrogel collected and dried at 80 c in a convection oven composite polymer hydrogels were prepared similar to the described procedure except that prior to the free radical polymerization process functionalized mwcnt with different concentration was dispersed in the monomer solution the synthesized composite polymer hydrogels were denoted by paa co pmamw1 paa co pmamw2 and paa co pmamw3 corresponding to the f mwcnt loading of 0 4 wt 0 8 wt and 1 2 wt in monomer solution respectively the procedure used for the synthesis of pure and composite polymer hydrogels was schematically illustrated in scheme 1 2 4 characterization and measurements the hydrogel surface morphology was determined by scanning electronic microscopy sem zeiss dsm 960 a germany attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir bruker equinox 55 spectroscopy was used to study the chemical compositions of the polymeric hydrogel samples over the wave number range of 600 3900 cm 1 to investigate the effect of mwcnt incorporation on mechanical strength of the prepared composite hydrogels hydrogel samples with rectangular stripes were formed in the glass tube with a diameter of 10 mm and a length of 40 mm and stretched by a tensile machine ct3 texture analyzer tensile testing equipment brookfield engineering and for decrease error each experiment conducted 4 times 2 5 swelling ratio of polymer hydrogels the swelling ratios srs of both pure and composite polymer hydrogels were gravimetrically measured as follows 0 1 g of dried samples were immersed into 250 ml ultra pure water and the mass weighed at different times from 0 to 24 h the sr was calculated by eq 1 21 1 s r w s w d w d where ws and wd are the weight of the swollen hydrogel after a certain time of test and the initial weight of the dry hydrogel powder before swelling test respectively the srs of the polymer hydrogels in 2000 ppm nacl aqueous solution was measured in the same way all experiments were operated in r t and three times 2 6 water flux evaluation the performance of the obtained polymer hydrogels as draw agent was evaluated in a lab scale fo set up schematically illustrated in fig 1 first of all a semipermeable membrane placed in the set up between the feed solution and draw agent and two parts of set up clamped 0 2 g of the grounded hydrogel powders as draw agent were put onto fo membrane with selective layer facing the hydrogel active layer facing draw solution al ds fo mode the fo process was conducted at room temperature as it is shown in fig 1 saline water as feed solution passes the fo membrane to the hydrogel as draw agent the water permeation flux jv lmh was determined by the feed volume decrement as the following equation 22 f 2 j v δ v a a t where δva is the volume change l of the feed solution over a specific period of time t h a m2 is the effective area of the fo membrane 4 9 cm2 2 7 hydrogel recycling evaluation the investigation of polymer hydrogel reusability was evaluated in a manner similar to that previously described in refs 11 22 the polymer hydrogels were removed from the fo set up and dried in oven at 50 c for 24 h to a constant weight after grounding the dried polymer hydrogel samples into fine powders for the second cycle fo performance of hydrogel as draw agent was measured similar to described manner where the volume changes of the feed solution upon trial time were recorded to calculate water flux the same approach was repeated for the subsequent cycles 3 result and

14539,access to clean water is one of the challenges of the 21st century thus water purification is inevitable one method of water treatment is purification by magnetic particles in the presence of magnetic field the contaminants are attached to the magnetic particles and then by applying a magnetic field magnetic particles and thus the pollutants can be collected for the optimal design of a water treatment system the effect of important parameters in the design such as magnetic fields particle size and reynolds number are determined numerically by modeling and simulating the water treatment process two methods are used to create the magnetic field permanent magnet and coils it is shown that there is very little difference in the collection efficiency particle size is varied from micrometers to nanometers in general the collection efficiency increases by increasing the particle diameter and decreasing the reynolds number for example it is shown that with a magnetic field of strength 0 05 t and reynolds number of 100 particles with a diameter of 30 micrometers and above are collected completely however with decreasing particle diameter to the nanometer collection efficiency finds a sharp drop using baffles to shift the particles toward regions with stronger fields it is possible to increase the collection efficiency for nanoparticles keywords water purification micro and nanoscavengers magnetic field simulation 1 introduction water is the most important aspect of the human life and development of civilization access to clean and usable water resources is one of the most important goals of human beings and clean water accessibility is considered as the most important challenge in the 21 st century the main sources of drinking water are including groundwater lakes seas and rain nowadays the severe crisis in relation to water resources is ahead of us according to the world health organization who about 780 million people do not have access to reliable sources of drinking water all over the world 1 today unfortunately different industries bring many pollutions such as industrial waste toxic substances heavy metals alkalis toxic gasses radioactive materials pathogenic microorganisms fats and oils into freshwater resources thus unclean water purification is inevitable 2 in general water purification methods are classified into six groups adsorption biotechnology catalytic processes membrane processes radiation processes and processes using the magnetic field magnetism is the only physical property that independently affects the physical properties of contaminants and thus helps water purification water treatment using magnetic field has been developed over decades for example mahmoud et al 3 used magnetic treatment for hard water they found that the anti scaling efficiency of the applied permanent magnets was about 45 high gradient magnetic separation hgms is a method which commonly used in magnetic separation hgms can separate paramagnetic materials with sizes less than one micrometer at a rate equal to several hundred faster than the old methods 4 yano et al used hgms for the separation of steel waste they found that the use of hgms in terms of operational costs and space requirements is better than the sand filter 5 svoboda 6 presented a model for describing particles behavior in high gradient magnetic separation moeser et al 7 have studied high gradient magnetic separation of magnetic nanoparticles with the size of about 8 nm collection of magnetic nanoclusters with hgms has been studied experimentally by ditsch et al 8 they have developed the method so that nearly all clusters with sizes of more than 50 nm have been collected 99 9 shape and strength of the magnetic field source are the main parameters which affect separation li et al 9 have studied the effect of different shapes of magnetic sources in hgms theoretically in addition to hgms methods some simple ways are proposed using the single magnet for example gabrielli et al 10 have built a household magnetic device for water treatment using the permanent magnet eskandarpour et al 11 have studied performance recovery and design of superconducting magnetic filter for wastewater treatment magnetic separation is a known method for ion metal removal many works have been done in this field 12 broomberg et al 13 have reviewed works which have been done for removing metal ion using magnetic separation mehta et al reviewed the works done in the field of magnetic adsorbents 14 on the other hand using micro and nanoparticles is a developing method for water purification and many works have been conducted 1 15 one type of particle which is used in water purification is magnetic particle 2 16 20 shen et al 21 used fe3o4 nanoparticles for polluted water purification they showed that this particle is suitable for removing of metal ions like ni cu cd and cr also they found that the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 particles increased when the particle size decreased or the surface area increased many efforts have been made to improve particles properties and thus improve the treatment efficiency 22 one of them is coating particles with silver silver coated magnetic particles have received much attention due to their antimicrobial effects 23 30 zhang et al 31 used multilayer magnetic particles with the ag coated shell to remove pathogen and heavy metals from water they used a permanent magnet to collect the magnetic particles the collection efficiency was very good and within 5 min over 99 percent of particles were collected the contaminants stick to particles and hence using a permanent magnet can collect particles and contaminants as well with all the above explanations using magnetic particles to adsorb contaminants such as metal ions and pathogen is a robust way for water purification the good contaminant absorption of magnetic particles their very rapid response to magnetic field in order to collect them and capability of being recovered in any purification cycle are the reasons which stimulate researchers and water purification industries to use magnetic particles in water treatment but challenges in post treatment remain it is very important to know how magnetic field strength fluid flow and particle diameter affect collection efficiency of the magnetic particle however to the best of our knowledge no reliable experimental or numerical work on the collection of these magnetic particles has been reported yet many factors should be count on to achieve an optimum water purification system such as particles size magnetic field strength in the present work we attempt to determine these factors to design the required purification system we employ a finite element model to simulate the collection process and understand the effects of each parameter the magnetic field and the laminar flow are solved in the first step forces acting on each particle are calculated at every time step the motion of particles is a time dependent process thus the unsteady particle motion is studied in the next step the values obtained from the first step are used as the input values for the second step then the position of each particle is obtained and the process is repeated until the end of the simulation the results show that the collection efficiency increases by increasing the particle diameter and decreasing the reynolds number the details of the modeling solution results and discussions will be presented in the next sections 2 the system geometry in water treatment by micro and nanomagnetic particles the particles enter the tank in which infected water is available the particles are given a little time to collect pollutants and contaminants and then they depart from the tank in the outlet pipe magnetic particles which contain contaminants including bacteria and germs are separated from the water using a magnetic field in this way the purified water is obtained a schematic representation of the system is shown in fig 1 magnetic particles are coated with silver to collect more pollutants like bacteria and pathogen besides heavy metals fig 2 a then by applying the magnetic field magnetic particles and thus the attached contaminants are collected hence the water is purified from pollution forces exerted on the particles and the path of the particles during collection are shown in fig 2b and c in the present study the reynolds number is considered 100 thus the flow regime is laminar the purpose of the simulations is to investigate the main parameters which affect particles collection for designing an optimum system to maximize attraction of the magnetic particles used in the water treatment 3 governing equations velocity field of the fluid flow is obtained from the continuity and the navier stokes equations 1 v 0 2 d v d t υ 2 v g where v and υ are the flow velocity and kinematic viscosity respectively the magnetic field is described using maxwell s equations 3 j h 4 b 0 5 b μ 0 h m μ 0 h χ h where j h and b are the current density magnetic density and magnetic field respectively also μ 0 m and χ represent the vacuum permeability material magnetization and magnetic susceptibility respectively newton s second law describes the momentum of a particle as below 6 f d u p d t 7 f f d f m f b where f is the net force acting on the particle fig 2 f d is the drag force which is obtained by following equations 8 f d 1 τ p m p u v 9 τ p ρ p d p 2 18 μ where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water d p and ρ p are particle s diameter and density respectively u v represents the particle s relative velocity and f m is the magnetic force acting on the particle which is calculated by the following relation 10 f m 2 π r p 3 μ 0 μ r f k h 2 where h is magnetic field intensity μ 0 and μ r f are the vacuum and relative permittivity respectively f b is the brownian force and is obtained from the following equation 11 f b ζ 12 π k b μ t r p δ t where t is absolute temperature k b is the boltzmann constant δt is time step and ζ is the gaussian random number with zero mean and unit standard deviation thus eq 6 can be rewritten as 12 m p d u p d t 1 τ p m p u v 2 π r p 3 μ 0 μ r f k h 2 ζ 12 π k b μ t r p δ t the collection efficiency is defined as below 13 η n t o t a l n t r a p p e d n t o t a l where η n total and n trapped are the collection efficiency the number of total particles and number of collected particles respectively 3 1 initial and boundary conditions the no slip boundary condition is assumed for all the walls uniform velocity profile and atmospheric pressure are assumed for the pipe inlet and the outlet respectively carrying fluid is water with a density of 1000 kg m3 all the initial conditions for solving velocity and magnetic field are assumed to be zero additional detailed information is provided in table 1 in this study fe 3o4 was used as the magnetic particle which is coated with silver for its antibacterial and antimicrobial effect particle density is considered to be 7870 kg m3 4 solution algorithm lagrangian definition of a problem is possible by solving newton s law of motion newton s law of motion requires determination of particle mass and forces acting on a particle the magnetic force is calculated by the finite element model for each particle an ordinary equation is solved for each component thus for two dimensional geometry two ordinary equations are solved for each particle forces acting on each particle are calculated using the magnetic field in particle s position at every time step then particle s position is obtained and the process is repeated until the end of the simulation magnetic field and laminar flow are solved steadily in the first step particles motion is time dependent thus the unsteady particle motion is solved in the next step the values obtained from the first step are used as the input values for the second step the simulation procedure is shown schematically in fig 3 first of all the magnetic field and the fluid flow are solved then forces acting on the particle are calculated and from newton s second law the particle acceleration and velocity are obtained and then by integrating from particle velocity its position is determined this calculation is repeated in each time step until the end of the simulation time all of the above steps are repeated for each particle 4 1 mesh independency for mesh independency assessment we introduced three kinds of meshes fine finer and extra fine collection efficiency was calculated in the same condition a pair coil with 5a current and 300 turns was used the reynolds number and particle diameter were 100 and 20 micrometer respectively results are shown in table 2 according to the table efficiencies for the finer and the extra fine meshes are the same and have only 0 3 difference with the fine mesh thus the finer mesh with 463404 elements was selected 4 2 validation to verify the results of the present study one of the theoretical studies in the field of magnetic particle motion in the magnetic field has been conducted numerically cherry et al simulated magnetic particles motion in the presence of external magnetic field 32 they studied the effect of particle size magnetic field gradient strength and blood flow velocity on the efficiency of holding particles stationary the flow was laminar with a bulk velocity of 5 cm s they used maxwell coil pair to produce a non uniform gradient particle density and diameter were 7870 kg m3 and 30 μm respectively the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and the tube radius were selected to be 8 94 10 4 n s m2 and 6 36 10 3 m respectively also the number of turns in each coil and coil radius were supposed to be 70 and 0 05 m respectively they have simulated a total number of 1000 particles the collection efficiency versus coil current in the cherry et al work and the present study are compared in fig 4 it can be seen that results are in reasonable agreement for complete verification we simulate may and clifford experimental study on the impaction efficiency of particles on the ribbon 33 the ribbon length is 0 038 m and inlet velocity is 4 5 m s drag and gravity are the forces acting on the particles air viscosity and particle density are 1 8 10 5 pas and 1050 kg m3 respectively thus the particle s diameter is obtained from stokes number s t k ρ p u 0 d p 2 18 μ h the simulation was conducted for 100 particles so the number of particles deposition on the ribbon divided by 100 shows the collection efficiency 15444 mesh elements were used for the simulation impaction efficiency of particles against stokes number stk is plotted below fig 5 it shows that present study is in very good agreement with the experimental data and has a lower error than other two theoretical studies 34 35 5 simulation results to attract the magnetic particles it is necessary to apply a strong magnetic force on the particle to overcome the brownian and the drag forces therefore we applied two kinds of magnetic field namely using coil and permanent magnet 5 1 collecting microparticles 5 1 1 using one coil coil produces non uniform magnetic field around the system this non uniform magnetic field means the presence of magnetic field gradient therefore with a strong enough field gradient the magnetic particles can be collected magnetic field distribution of coil is shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows particle collection efficiency in terms of the reynolds number as is clear from the figure the collection decreases with increasing the reynolds number for reynolds less than 50 all particles have been collected the curve can be well represented by 37 67 22 21exp 0 051x 82 6exp 0 0072x which shows an exponential decay for reynolds larger than 50 in a fixed pipe diameter when the reynolds number increases the fluid velocity increases and thus the drag force acting on the particles also increases that is why in a uniform magnetic field the particle collection efficiency decreases in higher reynolds numbers in fig 8 percent of particle collection as a function of particle diameter is plotted by increasing the particle diameter the collection increases linearly with the slope of 2 97 the reason is that by increasing the diameter of the particle magnetic dipoles of particle become strong and therefore the magnetic force exerted on the particle increases however by increasing the particle diameter drag force also increases but overall the percentage of increase in magnetic force is greater than drag force for particles greater than 40 μm all the particles are collected because the magnetic force exerted on the bigger particle is large enough to overcome the drag force particle collection efficiency is plotted versus the number of the coil turns in fig 9 by increasing the number of turns the particle collection increases as 100 79 1 e x p x 184 58 93 the reason is that due to the increasing number of turns the applied field becomes stronger therefore the magnetic force exerted on the particle increases for coil turns larger than 500 all the particles have been collected and further increase in coil turns has no effect on the collection efficiency because the magnetic field is strong enough to overcome drag and brownian forces 5 1 2 using two coils as depicted in figs 10 and 11 applying two coils increases collection efficiency however the rate of increase is not linear because the particles which have smaller kinetic energy are near the wall of the tube and they are collected when passing through the first coil the remaining particles have higher kinetic energy when they pass through the second coil with the magnetic field similar to the first coil therefore they have not attracted as much as the first coil in other words to trap remained particles that have higher kinetic energy the stronger field required 5 1 3 use of permanent magnet sometimes access to a power supply to create coil current is not possible in this case it is possible to use a permanent magnet to create the required magnetic field around the permanent magnet the magnetic field is non uniform and has a gradient this makes the field appropriate for collecting particles figs 12 and 13 compare the effect of permanent magnet and coil on the collection efficiency i order to have a better comparison the same field strength for the coil and permanent magnet has been considered the coil current and turns are 5 a and 300 respectively which produce a magnetic field of strength 0 05 t approximately the permanent magnet and the coil locations in the simulations are the same collection efficiency is plotted versus the reynolds number in fig 12 as is shown two charts show little difference for the same field strength 0 05 t the collection efficiency of the coil is smoothly larger than that of the permanent magnet and can be represented as 37 2 73 34exp 0 0087x 12 42exp 0 143x the field created by the coil has more gradient since the magnetic force exerted on the particle depends on the field magnitude and its gradient simultaneously the collection efficiency of the coil is larger than that of the permanent magnet collection efficiency is plotted against particle diameter for the coil and permanent magnet with the same field strength in fig 13 the reynolds number is assumed to be equal to 100 an examination of the figure reveals that for particle diameters larger than around 40 μm the two curves overlap as the collection efficiency becomes 100 percent however for the coil due to the larger gradient collection efficiency is larger in the range of particle diameter between 20 and 40 μm 5 2 collecting nanoparticles with the same specifications that are considered for the collection of microparticles nanoparticles have been collected very little the collection efficiency of micro and nanoparticles with the same field strength are compared in fig 14 here a pair of coil current of 5a and 300 respectively are used the reynolds number is 100 as is clear from the graph the efficiency of collection of nanosize particles is much smaller than that of the microparticles with the same conditions by making the magnetic field stronger and decreasing the reynolds at the same time more nanoparticle can be attracted however it is not always possible to increase magnetic field strength due to the high costs and the technical limits thus alternative approaches are required our proposed method is using a baffle the baffle changes the particle s path to stronger magnetic field regions thus the magnetic force acting on the particles increases and the collection efficiency increases several times without increasing the magnetic field and the additional costs a schematic representation of the tube with the baffle is depicted in fig 15 table 3 shows the effect of the baffle dimension and its location on the collection efficiency as is highlighted higher efficiency 75 is obtained for the case of the baffle with 1 mm width and 0 1 distance from the entrance this efficiency is much larger than that without baffle efficiency order of less than 10 6 conclusion in this research we studied various factors that are involved in collecting magnetic particles for water purification purpose factors such as the reynolds number particle diameter and the strength of the magnetic field are the fundamental factors affecting the collection of particles the results showed that the collection efficiency decreases with increasing reynolds number so in such a system we should try to hold down the reynolds collection efficiency increases by increasing the particle diameter it was shown that common field strength is not sufficient for collecting nano size particle so we used baffles to shift the particles toward a stronger field the efficiency of collection also increases with increasing field strength therefore all parameters should be considered in designing an optimal water purification system 
14539,access to clean water is one of the challenges of the 21st century thus water purification is inevitable one method of water treatment is purification by magnetic particles in the presence of magnetic field the contaminants are attached to the magnetic particles and then by applying a magnetic field magnetic particles and thus the pollutants can be collected for the optimal design of a water treatment system the effect of important parameters in the design such as magnetic fields particle size and reynolds number are determined numerically by modeling and simulating the water treatment process two methods are used to create the magnetic field permanent magnet and coils it is shown that there is very little difference in the collection efficiency particle size is varied from micrometers to nanometers in general the collection efficiency increases by increasing the particle diameter and decreasing the reynolds number for example it is shown that with a magnetic field of strength 0 05 t and reynolds number of 100 particles with a diameter of 30 micrometers and above are collected completely however with decreasing particle diameter to the nanometer collection efficiency finds a sharp drop using baffles to shift the particles toward regions with stronger fields it is possible to increase the collection efficiency for nanoparticles keywords water purification micro and nanoscavengers magnetic field simulation 1 introduction water is the most important aspect of the human life and development of civilization access to clean and usable water resources is one of the most important goals of human beings and clean water accessibility is considered as the most important challenge in the 21 st century the main sources of drinking water are including groundwater lakes seas and rain nowadays the severe crisis in relation to water resources is ahead of us according to the world health organization who about 780 million people do not have access to reliable sources of drinking water all over the world 1 today unfortunately different industries bring many pollutions such as industrial waste toxic substances heavy metals alkalis toxic gasses radioactive materials pathogenic microorganisms fats and oils into freshwater resources thus unclean water purification is inevitable 2 in general water purification methods are classified into six groups adsorption biotechnology catalytic processes membrane processes radiation processes and processes using the magnetic field magnetism is the only physical property that independently affects the physical properties of contaminants and thus helps water purification water treatment using magnetic field has been developed over decades for example mahmoud et al 3 used magnetic treatment for hard water they found that the anti scaling efficiency of the applied permanent magnets was about 45 high gradient magnetic separation hgms is a method which commonly used in magnetic separation hgms can separate paramagnetic materials with sizes less than one micrometer at a rate equal to several hundred faster than the old methods 4 yano et al used hgms for the separation of steel waste they found that the use of hgms in terms of operational costs and space requirements is better than the sand filter 5 svoboda 6 presented a model for describing particles behavior in high gradient magnetic separation moeser et al 7 have studied high gradient magnetic separation of magnetic nanoparticles with the size of about 8 nm collection of magnetic nanoclusters with hgms has been studied experimentally by ditsch et al 8 they have developed the method so that nearly all clusters with sizes of more than 50 nm have been collected 99 9 shape and strength of the magnetic field source are the main parameters which affect separation li et al 9 have studied the effect of different shapes of magnetic sources in hgms theoretically in addition to hgms methods some simple ways are proposed using the single magnet for example gabrielli et al 10 have built a household magnetic device for water treatment using the permanent magnet eskandarpour et al 11 have studied performance recovery and design of superconducting magnetic filter for wastewater treatment magnetic separation is a known method for ion metal removal many works have been done in this field 12 broomberg et al 13 have reviewed works which have been done for removing metal ion using magnetic separation mehta et al reviewed the works done in the field of magnetic adsorbents 14 on the other hand using micro and nanoparticles is a developing method for water purification and many works have been conducted 1 15 one type of particle which is used in water purification is magnetic particle 2 16 20 shen et al 21 used fe3o4 nanoparticles for polluted water purification they showed that this particle is suitable for removing of metal ions like ni cu cd and cr also they found that the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 particles increased when the particle size decreased or the surface area increased many efforts have been made to improve particles properties and thus improve the treatment efficiency 22 one of them is coating particles with silver silver coated magnetic particles have received much attention due to their antimicrobial effects 23 30 zhang et al 31 used multilayer magnetic particles with the ag coated shell to remove pathogen and heavy metals from water they used a permanent magnet to collect the magnetic particles the collection efficiency was very good and within 5 min over 99 percent of particles were collected the contaminants stick to particles and hence using a permanent magnet can collect particles and contaminants as well with all the above explanations using magnetic particles to adsorb contaminants such as metal ions and pathogen is a robust way for water purification the good contaminant absorption of magnetic particles their very rapid response to magnetic
