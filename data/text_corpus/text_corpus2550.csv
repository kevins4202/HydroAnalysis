12750,a series of zif 8 ond hybrid nanostructures with different percentages of oxidized nanodiamond ond was prepared then the adsorptive removal performance of pristine zif 8 and its nanohybrids with ond towards methylene blue mb was investigated the fabricated adsorbents were characterized via thermogravimetric analysis x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nitrogen adsorption desorption field emission scanning electron microscopy and zeta potential measurements the maximal adsorption capacity of zif 8 242 mg g was found to grow steadily with the increment in ond content and reached an approximate plateau at 343 mg g for the nanohybrid containing 5 wt ond i e znd 5 with a rod like morphology it was realized that kinetics and isotherm of the adsorption of mb onto all the prepared adsorbents were best suited with pseudo second order and langmuir models moreover the adsorption rate of zif 8 multiplied by nearly four orders of magnitude by hybridization with ond due to synergistic effects between ond and zif 8 thermodynamic studies proved the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 to be an endothermic spontaneous and entropy governed process the impact of different parameters was investigated and the optimum conditions for the adsorptive removal of mb from polluted water were found to be at 50 c and ph 11 abbreviations 2 mim 2 methylimidazole cv crystal violet

nanodiamond hybrid nanostructures data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction today s fast paced and continuous progress in technology and industry has led to water contamination organic contaminants specifically organic dyes are among the most important sources of water pollution bringing about health problems for people and wildlife due to their toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity thus using an effective method in order to remove these contaminants before their discharge into the environment has become a tremendous worldwide concern 1 2 to tackle this issue a number of methods including membrane filtration ion exchange membranes coagulation flocculation ozonation photo degradation and adsorption have been employed adsorption owing to its low cost ease of the process high efficiency flexibility and versatility has shown appropriate capability to be the most promising method compared to the mentioned techniques 3 hence finding suitable adsorbents for removing organic dyes from water has turned into a hot topic to date several types of materials including graphenic materials zeolites polymers metal oxides and metal organic frameworks mofs have been prepared for the adsorptive removal of organic dyes 4 mofs among them have gained special attention to be used as high performance adsorbents thanks to their versatility high porosity and surface area flexibility and tailored chemical functionalities 5 mofs are a type of nanoporous and crystalline materials made by joining secondary building units i e clusters or ions of metals and ligands which are organic linkers through coordination bonds 6 zif 8 an mof formed by crosslinking 2 methyl imidazole and zn2 ions is a proper choice for the adsorption of dyes from effluents due to its ultrahigh specific surface area good dispersibility and high porosity so it has been used for the adsorption of organic dyes by other researchers 7 for example santoso et al synthesized zif 8 nanoparticles utilizing acetic acid as solvent and reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 24 57 mg g for mb dye adsorption 8 alinezhad et al fabricated zif 8 with leaf shaped morphology with a surprisingly low specific surface area of 20 m2 g and reached an adsorption capacity of 205 mg g 9 however like most mofs zif 8 suffers some drawbacks such as difficulty in separating and recycling of zif 8 nanoparticles from aqueous media hindering its application as an efficient adsorbent for dye removal 10 it must be noted that the adsorptive removal of methylene blue as one of the most conventional dyes used by industries such as wood industries using zif based nanomaterials has remained a challenge for researchers 11 despite the extremely high efficiency of zif 8 in the adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes such as malachite green and congo red its ability to remove mb is limited 12 13 one approach to overcome such downsides is combining pristine mof with other functional materials such as metal oxides silica polymers carbon nanotubes etc and creating hybrid nanostructures with more positive points and restricted downfalls 14 as a carbonaceous nanomaterial nanodiamond has gained great attention in wastewater treatment due to its non toxicity chemical stability high specific surface area controllable surface functional groups and good affinity to organic pollutants 15 17 previously our group conducted research works on the adsorption performance of nanodiamond the results revealed that thermally oxidized nanodiamond has significant adsorption capacity towards both anionic and cationic dyes compared to neat nanodiamond 15 furthermore the hybridization of nanodiamond with mof nanoparticles was investigated in which uio 66 ond was synthesized with different percentages of ond in the hybrid adsorbents ranging from 0 5 to 10 wt the adsorbent with 3 wt ond showed the best adsorptive performance increasing the adsorption capacity of methyl red onto uio 66 and intensifying its dye adsorption rate to four times higher than uio 66 18 thus ond was selected for the synthesis of an mof based nanohybrid i e zif 8 ond for the adsorption based removal of mb dye in the present work an assortment of zif 8 ond nanohybrids with increasing content of ond from 0 5 to 5 wt was prepared this study aims to improve the adsorption performance of zif 8 in both adsorption capacity and rate aspects for the removal of mb from wastewater to this end kinetics and isotherm studies were performed on all the synthesized adsorbents moreover the influence of initial ph adsorbent dosage ionic strength as well as selective adsorption of mb in the mixture of mb dye with anionic methyl orange mo and methyl red mr as well as cationic malachite green mg and crystal violet cv was investigated on the best performing nanohybrid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials untreated nanodiamond nd with 98 99 purity was purchased from nabond technologies co china the rest of the used materials including zn no3 2 6h2o zinc nitrate hexahydrate 2 methylimidazole 2 mim methanol methylene blue mb methyl orange mo malachite green mg crystal violet cv and methyl red mr were obtained from merck company germany 2 2 oxidation of nd nanoparticles before hybridization as received nd underwent thermal oxidization process at high temperature under air atmosphere to homogenize the external surface with carboxyl groups 19 to do this a certain amount of as received nd was first oxidized in a furnace at 450 c for 4 5 h to obtain a uniform layer of carboxyl group on the surface of nd during the oxidation process nd lost about 20 of its weight due to burning a number of surface graphitic layers turning into co2 and homogenizing the external surface with carboxylic groups 2 3 preparation of zif 8 and zif 8 ond nanohybrids zif 8 nanoparticles were synthesized according to our previous work 20 in brief 50 ml 2 mim 0 11 m and 50ml zinc nitrate hexahydrate 0 36 m methanolic solutions were prepared separately then the two solutions were mixed and sonicated for 5 min followed by keeping stationary at 50 c for 6 h the final white powder was washed with methanol three times by centrifugation applying sonication in between and dried at 100 c over night nanohybrid adsorbents were prepared by the addition of calculated amounts of ond to the zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution and the rest of the preparation method was the same as zif 8 nanoparticles 2 4 adsorption experiments to assess the adsorption capacities of the fabricated adsorbents 0 02 g of the adsorbents were added to 0 1 l of the dye solution with 20 mg l concentration and stirred in the dark for 2 h the adsorbents were collected and taken out of the solution using centrifugation in specified time intervals at 30 c to evaluate the adsorption kinetics parameters isotherm analyses were carried out by differing the initial dye concentration in the range of 20 500 mg l at three different temperatures the concentration of mb was monitored via uv vis spectrometry by comparing the maximum absorbance wavelength of mb solutions at 631 nm eventually the adsorption capacity was computed using the equations below 1 q t c 0 c t v w 2 q e c 0 c e v w where qt mg g and qe mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium where the adsorption and desorption rates become equal respectively similarly ct and ce mg l are dye at time t and equilibrium condition c0 w and v are the initial dye concentration mg l the adsorbent s weight g and the solution volume l the influence of ph was studied by regulating the solution s ph varying from 3 to 11 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl the investigation of ionic strength was performed by adding specific amounts of nacl creating solutions with concentrations varying from 0 01 to 1 m to assess the impact of adsorbent dosage the mass of adsorbent was determined to be in the range of 5 50 mg in the study on the ability of the prepared adsorbent for selective adsorption of mb over anionic dyes and other cationic dyes binary solutions of mb with mr mo mg and cv were prepared with equal concentrations of 10 mg l the ideal adsorption selectivity s was calculated by the equation below 3 s q i c i q j c j in which qi is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent towards dye i at equilibrium corresponding to a concentration of ci similarly qj and cj are the adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentration corresponding to dye j 2 5 characterization the crystalline structure of the synthesized adsorbents and ond was determined using an x pert philis pw 3040 60 x ray diffractometer fourier transform infrared ftir spectra perkin elmer was used from 400 to 4000 cm 1 to scrutinize the surface chemistry of the prepared nanomaterials a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem mira3 tescan was employed in order to explore the nanoparticles morphology nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of pure nanoparticles and nanohybrids were carried out at 70 k with a belsorp miniii gas adsorption analyzer to evaluate surface porosity of the adsorbents tga technique was applied to probe the thermal stability of the nanoparticles and nanohybrids via a linseis thermogravimetric analyzer tga under n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 c min from 25 c to 800 c the adsorbents surface charges were characterized using an sz 100z dynamic light scattering zeta potential analyzer horiba france 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization xrd patterns of the synthesized nanomaterials are exhibited in fig 1a to investigate their crystalline structure ond displays two broad peaks located at 2θ 43 6 and 75 3 corresponding to 111 and 220 sp3 reflection planes 21 the xrd pattern of zif 8 exhibits its highly crystalline structures with distinctive peaks at 2θ 7 10 3 12 5 14 7 16 5 18 2 19 5 22 1 24 5 25 5 26 8 29 6 which are attributed to 200 211 220 310 222 321 411 332 510 and 440 reflection planes respectively 22 it can be noticed from fig 1a that the addition of ond to zif 8 does not harm the mof nanoparticles crystal structure moreover the characteristic peaks of ond are covered by zif 8 peaks which has been seen in other researchers works 18 however with the increment in ond content to 5 wt the main characteristic peak of ond at 2θ 43 6 appears confirming successful hybridization of zif 8 and ond nanoparticles ftir spectra of ond zif 8 and their hybrids are shown in fig 1b according to fig 1b in the ftir pattern corresponding to ond the broad peak located at about 3400 cm 1 and the peaks observed at 2850 2920 cm 1 1790 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 are assigned to oh stretching vibrations of surface adsorbed water molecules and carboxylic acid functional group stretching vibrations of different aliphatic ch groups co stretching mode of the carboxylic acid and oh bending vibration of physisorbed water respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 1000 1200 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibrations of diverse co and coc groups on the surface of ond 23 24 ftir spectrum of as synthesized zif 8 accords with the literature in which absorption peaks discerned at 3131 and 2925 cm 1 are representatives of aromatic and aliphatic ch stretches of imidazole the stretching mode of cn bond accounts for the peak noticed at 1587 cm 1 the intense and elaborate peaks in the range of 1350 1500 cm 1 including the observed peaks at 1380 1422 and 1455 cm 1 are accredited to the entire ring s vibrational stretching the bands between 950 and 1350 cm 1 are ascribed to the ring s in plane bending whereas bands at 695 and 756 cm 1 are related to the ring s out of plane bending the observed peak at 420 cm 1 represents znn stretch mode 25 furthermore it can be noticed that the intensity of co escalates as ond content increases among the hybrid sample which is most noticeable in znd 5 sample tga analysis was applied to explore the thermal stability of the prepared nanomaterials in this study and the results are illustrated in fig 1c the tga curve of zif 8 indicates a mass loss at around 100 c which is due to the evaporation of the solvent methanol and physisorbed water with increasing the temperature to about 600 c a huge weight loss is observed presaging the destruction of zif 8 framework and decomposition of its organic linker that proceeds to 800 c 26 although the tga plot of ond shows great thermal stability up to around 500 c the weight loss at higher temperatures indicates the presence of oxygen containing groups on nanodiamond s graphitic surface that turns into co2 18 the hydrophobic nature of ond can explain the absence of mass loss due to volatilization in the tga curve of the prepared nanohybrids as was observed in the ond materials what is more as nanohybrid samples possess slightly higher thermal stability than neat zif 8 the amount of ash left after thermal analysis is higher for hybrid samples than zif 8 these results are consistent with previous studies conducted on the hybridization of mofs with nanodiamond 18 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pertinent details are illustrated in fig 2a and table 1 to assess the porosity of the prepared adsorbents according to fig 2a the nitrogen adsorption desorption plot of ond demonstrates type iv isotherm characteristics and shows a large hysteresis exhibiting mesoporous structure 15 however the n2 adsorption desorption plots of zif 8 and the synthesized nanohybrids show type i isotherm with steep n2 adsorption at low relative pressures below 0 1 that exhibits microporous structures 27 nevertheless the minor hysteresis seen in the adsorption desorption isotherm of nanohybrids denotes mesoporous structure in light of the existence of ond particles according to table 1 the specific surface area of neat zif 8 is 1773 m2 g which is in agreement with what is reported in the literature 28 specific surface area of ond is 327 m2 g which is lower compared with zif 8 therefore the bet surface area decreases by increasing the content of ond in nanohybrids structure the surface charges of as synthesized adsorbents and ond particles are measured and the results are enumerated in table 1 accordingly the surface charge of zif 8 nearly doubles in value with the increase in the percentage of ond particles which may be due to the augmentation in electronegative functional groups i e carboxylic acid present at the graphitic layer at the surface of ond particles in other words the increase in the surface charge is caused by the dissociation of more carboxyl groups cooh coo h on the surface of ond 29 morphology of pure and hybrid nanomaterials are shown in fig 3 as illustrated the morphology of ond is spherical with particle of around 50 nm in size the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the fesem image of ond can be observed the crystal morphology of pure zif 8 is a polygonal structure with sizes in the range of 100 150 nm it can be found from fesem images corresponding to zif 8 ond nanohybrids that by increasing the ond loading the size of zif 8 particles increases and changes to a rod shaped morphology eventually at 5 loading of ond the crystal growth of zif 8 can be explained by three steps 1 nucleation 2 crystal growth in which a metastable phase appears and the relative crystallinity increases and 3 stationary period during which the crystallinity increases until the metastable phase is depleted completely and stable surface forms 30 the increase in the size of zif 8 particles can be explained by the presence of ond nanoparticles with carboxylic acid groups on their surface it can be assumed that during the in situ synthesis of zif 8 nanoparticles zn2 ions become adsorbed on the surface of ond particles and the nucleation process occurs on ond surface thus ond nanoparticles act as nucleation centers for the growth of zif 8 crystals consequently they can interfere with the nucleation and growth steps of zif 8 crystal formation probably by lowering the nucleation rate which results in larger particles moreover with the increment in ond content the zn2 ions can be adsorbed on the surface of ond and carboxylic acid groups act as capping agent by selectively hindering the crystal growth in certain facets of zif 8 controlling the relative growth rate of crystal in different directions causing an anisotropic crystal growth which has resulted in forming nanorods in addition the presence of ond particles sticking to zif 8 is evident in all nanohybrid samples in the znd 5 sample a small aggregate of ond can be seen as well 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption capacities of the prepared adsorbents as a function of time at ambient temperature are depicted in fig 4 obviously the adsorption capacity rises sharply in the first 16 min and then reaches a plateau with the passage of time coming to equilibrium after 2 h of adsorption this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that at the starting moments of the adsorption process the large number of empty adsorption sites enables dye molecules to easily interact at the adsorbent s surface 31 the following decrease in the adsorption rate rises from the coverage and saturation of the adsorbents surface resulting in the availability of fewer vacant adsorption sites 32 moreover it is evident that the increment in ond content in mof based nanohybrids increases the adsorption capacity of pure zif 8 48 mg g the presence of 5 ond in the nanohybrid sample znd 5 increases the adsorption capacity of neat zif 8 by around 30 65 mg g to get a deeper insight into the impact of contact time on the adsorption of mb onto the synthesized adsorbents the first 16 min of the adsorption were investigated with time intervals of 2 min fig 4 conspicuously shows that most of the dye removal occurs in the first 2 min of the adsorption process for the samples encompassing ond znd 5 reaches nearly 95 of its equilibrium adsorption capacity in merely 2 min while zif 8 approaches 62 of its adsorption equilibrium in the same time these results denote that the addition of ond not only raises the adsorption capacity of zif 8 but also enhances the adsorption rate in spite of the reduction of specific surface area of zif 8 nanohybrids compared to neat zif 8 the adsorption capacity of the nanohybrids exhibit higher values e g up to 30 for znd 5 on the other hand the surface charge of the nanohybrids is actually higher than that of neat zif 8 these observations suggest that the possible mechanism for the adsorption may be electrostatic attraction forces therefore it can also be concluded that the influence of increment in attractive electrostatic forces overcomes the reduction in the specific surface area of the adsorbent additionally the enhancement in the adsorption rate in the kinetics study confirms the synergistic effect between zif 8 and ond as reported in our previous study on the hybridizing of uio 66 with ond 18 to further investigate the adsorption mechanism and the prospective rate controlling step three well established kinetics models are testified the pseudo first order model expresses that physisorption is the decisive step that controls the rate of adsorption pseudo second order model describes chemisorption as the rate controlling stage in the adsorption process and diffusion is the rate controlling stage according to the intraparticle diffusion model 33 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models in their linear forms are represented as eqs 4 and 5 34 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe mg g are adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are pseudo first order models and pseudo second order model s rate constant eq 6 expresses the intra particle diffusion model 35 6 q t k id t 1 2 c where qt is the same as previous equations kid g mg min1 2 represents the model s rate constant and c mg g corresponds to the boundary layer s thickness same as all other constants mentioned earlier can be calculated from the linear regression of the corresponding kinetics models the results regarding data fitting to the mentioned models are described in table 2 and fig s1 based on the computed correlation constant r2 the adsorption of mb onto all the prepared adsorbents can be best delineated by the pseudo second order model in addition the obtained qe from this model is remarkably close to the experimental value providing strong proof of the legitimacy of the pseudo second order model imposing that chemisorption controls the adsorption rate moreover the rate constant of the model is evidently multiplied due to the presence of ond which is in line with the observation that ond particles enhance the adsorption rate of zif 8 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm is a key parameter that helps get a deeper understanding of the interactions between dye molecules and the adsorbent thus the influence of initial dye concentration was investigated as depicted in fig 5 the adsorption capacity rises sharply at low initial concentrations of mb dye then undergoes a subtle increase until reaching a plateau which stands for the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto fabricated adsorbents the steep increment in the adsorption capacity is ascribed to the increased mass transfer driving force resulting from the augmentation in the dye concentration that causes a higher concentration gradient 36 the aforementioned data was fitted to three distinguished isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich to gain a clear insight into the adsorption mechanism the langmuir model assumes that at a confined number of equivalent sites on the adsorbent s surface homogeneous and monolayer adsorption of adsorbate occurs its linear form is expressed as below 37 7 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max in which kl is langmuir binding constant and qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity the separation factor rl is calculated using the following equation 8 r l 1 1 c 0 k l where kl and c0 are the langmuir constant and the initial dye concentration respectively in general four possible adsorption processes can be derived based on the obtained rl value including 1 irreversible rl 0 2 favorable 0 rl 1 3 linear rl 1 and 4 unfavorable rl 1 38 the linear form of the freundlich isotherm model that proposes multilayer adsorption at a heterogeneous adsorption surface that has nonuniform available sites with diverse energies of adsorption is described as follows 9 ln q e ln k f 1 n f ln c e in which kf is the adsorption capacity and 1 nf describes the adsorption affinity 39 the linear form of dubinin radushkevich model is as follows 40 10 ln q e ln q max b ε 2 in which qmax mg g is theoretical saturation capacity b mol2 kj2 is a constant that indicates the adsorption energy and ε kj mol is the polany potential which can be derived from eq 11 11 ε rtln 1 1 c where r j molk is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and c mg l is the equilibrium dye concentration the mean adsorption energy e kj mol which is the free energy change based on the transformation of a unit mole of the adsorbate from an infinite distance in the solution to the surface of the adsorbent can be calculated via the equation below 40 12 e 1 2 b the amount of mean adsorption energy can distinguish between the adsorption type when e 8 kj mol the adsorption is physical in nature and 8 e 16 kj mol indicates chemical ion exchange adsorption process 40 the extracted data regarding the curve fitting of the isotherm experiments with the aforementioned models are illustrated in table 3 and fig s2 accordingly due to the high regression coefficient r2 corresponding to the langmuir model all the synthesized adsorbents are well fitted with this model however the adsorption data of zif 8 fitted to the freundlich model as well showing that the adsorption of mb onto zif 8 can be considered both multilayer and monolayer partially the adsorption of mb onto the synthesized nanohybrids is homogeneous denoting a homogeneous uniform monolayer in which all the adsorption sites have a similar affinity with the dye molecules without any impediment interaction among the adsorbed molecules 8 moreover the separation factor obtained from the langmuir model is found to be between zero and unity for all the adsorbents which signifies favorable adsorption and strong affinity between the prepared adsorbents and mb dye finally although the langmuir model does not provide a clear understanding of the adsorption mechanism it estimates the adsorption capacity quite accurately as shown in fig 5 with respect to the adsorption mechanism dubinin radushkevich model gives insight into the nature of the adsorption accordingly the mean adsorption energy for all the adsorbents in this study was 8 kj mol signifying a physical adsorption process which accords with the results from the kinetics studies 40 the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 and other zif 8 based adsorbents presented in the literature are compared in table 4 it can be found from table 4 that the synthesized adsorbents in this study have relatively high adsorption capacity towards mb compared to other adsorbents based on zif 8 and its hybrid structures 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption experiment was operated at assorted temperatures to get a deeper perception of the adsorption process of mb onto znd 5 as depicted in fig 6a the equilibrium mb adsorption capacity of znd 5 elevates with the rise in temperature positing that the adsorption process is endothermic to further scrutinize the adsorption process thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy g kj mol standard enthalpy h kj mol and standard entropy s j mol k were reckoned via the equations below 38 13 ln q e c e s r h rt 14 g h t s where slope and intercept of the linear plot of lnqe ce against 1 t were used to elicit the h and s values while g was computed from eq 14 t and r are temperature k and universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k according to the data provided in table 5 the negative g values of the adsorption prove that in all operating temperatures the adsorption of mb dye onto znd 5 comes about spontaneously the positive h value verifies the endothermic origin of the adsorption which aligns with the enhancement in the adsorption uptake of mb with increasing temperature the enthalpy change has a positive value which is unfavorable for the spontaneous adsorption process it is necessary for mb cations to be first stripped out of the hydration shell around them to be able to travel through the solution and approach the adsorbent s surface which needs energy intake while attractive forces related to the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 do not surpass the dehydration energy of mb cations the energy balance leads to positive enthalpy change moreover the calculated value of enthalpy change 5 117 kj mol implies that the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 is a physical process since the h value is smaller than 40 kj mol 46 additionally the entropy change in this study was positive indicating the augmentation in the randomness at the solid liquid interface throughout the adsorption process which proposes the good affinity of mb molecules towards znd 5 hence this positive value is in favor of the adsorption 47 based on the derived thermodynamic factors and taking into account that positive enthalpy change is unfavorable to the adsorption while the positive entropy change is conducive to such process it can be concluded that the adsorption of mb dye onto znd 5 is entropically governed 3 5 impact of adsorbent dosage as a determining factor in adsorption studies the adsorbent dose was assessed in this work to this end the adsorption of mb dye with a constant concentration onto znd 5 with diverse concentrations varying from 0 05 g l to 0 5 g l was investigated fig 7a demonstrates the impact of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 in which the adsorption capacity falls from 109 to 31 mg g with the increment of znd 5 dosage the increase in the adsorbent dosage in a fixed dye concentration and solution volume may cause an abundant amount of active adsorption sites to remain unsaturated leading to a decline in the adsorption capacity 48 furthermore the effect of adsorption dosage on the removal efficiency of mb from the solution was scrutinized and the results are illustrated in fig 7b as anticipated the removal percentage clearly elevated with increasing znd 5 dosage which is resulted from the increased number of available adsorption sites on the adsorbent s surface owing to the increased dosage 49 3 6 influence of solution ph since the initial ph of the solution can alter the adsorbent surface charge and the dye molecules ionization degree it is a pivotal factor in the adsorption process therefore the initial ph of the solution was regulated to various values ranging from 3 to 13 to probe the impact of the solution s initial ph on the mb adsorption capacity of znd 5 as illustrated in fig 7c the adsorption capacity of mb dye onto znd 5 rises as the ph of the solution increases followed by a slight decrease at ph 13 which may be due to the conversion of mb molecules to other compounds at highly basic media hindering the adsorption of mb 50 to gain insight into the effect of ph on the adsorption process zeta potential of znd 5 was screened in determined ph values the point of zero charge pzc corresponding to znd 5 is about 4 8 below which znd 5 has a positive value while the surface charge of the adsorbent grows dramatically in negative values at ph 4 8 as seen in fig 7d with the comparison of zeta potential of the adsorbent and adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 it can be concluded that the increment in attractive electrostatic forces between the adsorbent and the dye molecules increases leading to a rise in the adsorption capacity hence electrostatic attraction forces have a substantial role in the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 51 it should be noted that mb is in its neutral form at ph values less than its pka which is equal to 3 8 and becomes positively charged above this value 52 in addition the adsorbent has a positive surface charge at ph 3 where the adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 is 35 mg g which endorses the fact that electrostatic attraction is not the only mechanism controlling the adsorption because while znd 5 possesses positive charge mb is neutral and there is no electrostatic attraction in this condition other mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and π π stacking can also play a role in the adsorption process 3 7 selective adsorption due to the presence of an assortment of organic dyes in contaminated water the adsorption selectivity is a crucial factor that indicates the affinity of an adsorbent towards a specific dye in this regard the adsorption selectivity of znd 5 in binary solutions containing mb as a positively charged dye coupled with mo and mr as negatively charged dyes as well as mg and cv as positively charged dyes was investigated fig 8a and b exhibit uv vis spectroscopy of the mixture of mb with anionic dyes before and after the adsorption by znd 5 according to fig 8a and b the reduction in absorbance peak attributed to mb in both solutions is remarkably more than mo as well as mr in addition as depicted in fig 8c and d the absorption peaks related to mg and cv decreases significantly as compared to mb moreover adsorption capacity and selectivity index calculated using eq 3 is shown in fig 8e accordingly the values of adsorption capacity for mb in binary solutions with both anionic dyes are noticeably higher than mo and mr resulting in selectivity indices higher than one which shows that znd 5 selectively adsorbs mb which is a cationic dye model over mo and mr as anionic dyes these observations can be justified by the fact that interfacial interactions between znd 5 and mb are electrostatic attraction forces in contrast electrostatic repulsion forces between the surface of znd 5 and either mo and mr are the dominant interfacial interaction however while the adsorption capacity of znd 5 towards mb in the binary solutions with mg and cv does not change remarkably it is less than both cationic dyes resulting in selectivity indices less than unity which indicates higher affinity of znd 5 towards cv and mg rather than mb as in physisorption based adsorption the properties of dye molecules such as kinetics diameter polarizability dipole moment as well as adsorbent s physical characterization play major roles in the separation process the difference in adsorption capacity and in turn selectivity index can be attributed to different physical characteristics of dye molecules and their interactions with mb dye molecules 52 in addition in the case of binary cationic dye solutions the involvement of mechanisms other than electrostatic attraction such as π π interaction can account for the higher affinity of the adsorbent towards mg and cv 3 8 influence of ionic strength the intricacy of the wastewater due to the presence of a variety of salts and surfactants that can whether boost or hinder the adsorption performance through the competitive binding complexation dissociation of the dye molecules or screen electrostatic interactions of opposite charges makes it axiomatic to examine ionic strength in adsorption studies 53 herein the impact of sodium chloride s concentration a copious salt that is often present in contaminated water and changes its ionic strength on znd 5 adsorption capacity towards mb is examined the results depicted in fig 9a demonstrate that the adsorption capacity enhances with the elevation in nacl concentration in general the increase in the ionic strength reduces the adsorption capacity when there are attractive electrostatic forces between dye molecules and the adsorbent s surface 38 nevertheless the observed rise in the adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 can be attributed to dye agglomeration in the solution which can be caused by salt ions or intermolecular interactions such as dipole dipole ion dipole and van der waals forces leading to an improved degree of adsorption in addition rising ionic strength may increase the negative surface charge of znd 5 leading to greater electrostatic interactions with mb cationic dye 54 55 3 9 adsorption mechanism probing the mechanism of dye removal through the adsorption process provides deeper insight into interactions between the adsorbent and dye molecules and facilitates designing high efficiency adsorbents edx spectra of znd 5 before and after the adsorption of znd 5 are shown in fig s3 accordingly while no sulfur and chloride were found in virgin znd 5 the existence of these elements after the adsorption is a valid proof of the occurrence of mb molecules on the surface of the adsorbent in light of the above discussion regarding ph and its influence on adsorption it is likely that attractive electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and the adsorbent is the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 in addition comparing the zeta potential analysis and the adsorption capacities obtained from the fabricated adsorbents indicates that as the content of ond grows in the nanohybrid samples the surface charge increases which leads to an increment in the adsorption capacity despite the decrease in the specific surface area such an observation further proves the assumption that the predominant mechanism for the adsorption of mb dye onto the prepared adsorbents is electrostatic attraction isotherm studies indicated that the langmuir model can describe the adsorption of mb onto the adsorbent thus the adsorption occurs homogeneously on the adsorption sites with similar energies forming a monolayer which means that once a dye molecule occupies an adsorption site no more molecules can be adsorbed onto that specific site 56 according to the kinetics studies since the pseudo second order model was the best suiting model to describe the adsorption it can be concluded that the adsorption of mb dye onto all the prepared adsorbents dominated chiefly by physical adsorption this result was in accordance with the thermodynamics studies in which the enthalpy change of the adsorption was found to be 5 117 kj mol which is lower than 40 kj mol indicating that the adsorption process is physical rather than chemisorption brought about by the exchange or sharing of electrons 57 moreover the mean energy of adsorption e 8 kj mol obtained from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model supports this statement in order to get more insight into the adsorption mechanism znd 5 before and after the adsorption process as well as pure mb dye was examined through ftir and the results are exhibited in fig 9b obviously znd 5 has preserved all its characteristic peaks after the adsorption process nevertheless the intensity of aromatic rings of mb was reduced after the adsorption onto znd 5 which indicates the occurrence of π π stacking interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 38 moreover the appearance of the broad peak centered at about 3450 cm 1 proves the formation of hydrogen bonding between mb and the adsorbent 58 3 10 reusability and stability the reusability and stability of an adsorbent are crucial factors in evaluating its potential commercial applications therefore the reusability of znd 5 was examined using a mixture of water and ethanol as eluent for the desorption of adsorbed dye after the desorption the adsorbent was dried at 100 c overnight as illustrated in fig 10a the adsorption capacity of znd 5 was decreased from 65 mg g to 51 mg g after 4 consecutive cycles which means that the adsorption capacity was reduced by about 20 indicating acceptable reusability of the adsorption in order to evaluate the stability of the adsorbent xrd analysis was performed after the adsorption of mb dye as well as after four adsorption desorption cycles it is evident from fig 10b that the main characteristic peaks of the adsorbent are retained both after the adsorption and after the reusability study indicating good stability of the crystal structure of znd 5 the decline in the intensity of the characteristic peaks can be assigned to the coverage of a layer of mb dye on the surface of znd 5 moreover it can be inferred from this observation that the loss in the adsorption capacity may be due to the loss in some binding sites of the adsorption rather than the degradation of the adsorbent s structure 52 fesem of znd 5 after the adsorption of mb fig 10c indicates that znd 5 has preserved its structure since no remarkable change is noted in its structure nevertheless as compared to the fesem image of znd 5 before the adsorption fig 3 it is obvious that the adsorbent s surface has become slightly coarser after the adsorption suggesting that the dye molecules have covered the surface of the adsorbent which agrees with xrd analysis 4 conclusion in the current research work a series of zif 8 ond nanohybrid structures with various loadings of ond 0 5 5 wt was successfully prepared and exerted for the adsorptive removal of mb dye from wastewater according to kinetics investigations all the synthesized adsorbents best matched with the pseudo second order model demonstrating that chemisorption is the rate controlling stage of the adsorption in addition the adsorption rate of znd 5 was found to be around four times higher than pristine zif 8 nanoparticles which proves the influence of ond on the adsorption rate of mb onto zn mof based adsorbent based on isotherm studies the langmuir isotherm model best delineates the adsorption of mb onto all the synthesized adsorbents and by increasing the mass loading of ond on zif 8 the maximum adsorption capacity increases significantly by taking into account both kinetics and isotherm studies it can be deduced that the synergistic effect between zif 8 and ond nanoparticles works in favor of adsorptive removal of mb from aqueous media which is resulted from the increment in surface charge of the adsorbent further examinations were carried out on znd 5 the best performing adsorbent thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 is endothermic spontaneous and controlled by entropy as the solution s initial ph increased the adsorption capacity was enhanced remarkably and reached a maximum at ph 11 due to a dramatic increase in zeta potential of the adsorbent indicating that znd 5 works best in basic conditions ph 11 for the adsorption of mb selective separation investigations denoted that znd 5 has more affinity towards mb over mo and mr due to electrostatic attraction forces yet it shows a higher adsorption capacity for cationic mg and cv based on the results observed from zeta potential initial ph and ionic strength examinations it could be deduced that electrostatic attraction is the chief mechanism for the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 π π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding were found to be other mechanisms involved in the adsorption process finally the adsorbent proved well stability and reusability by maintaining over 80 of its adsorption capacity

12750,a series of zif 8 ond hybrid nanostructures with different percentages of oxidized nanodiamond ond was prepared then the adsorptive removal performance of pristine zif 8 and its nanohybrids with ond towards methylene blue mb was investigated the fabricated adsorbents were characterized via thermogravimetric analysis x ray diffraction fourier transform infrared spectroscopy nitrogen adsorption desorption field emission scanning electron microscopy and zeta potential measurements the maximal adsorption capacity of zif 8 242 mg g was found to grow steadily with the increment in ond content and reached an approximate plateau at 343 mg g for the nanohybrid containing 5 wt ond i e znd 5 with a rod like morphology it was realized that kinetics and isotherm of the adsorption of mb onto all the prepared adsorbents were best suited with pseudo second order and langmuir models moreover the adsorption rate of zif 8 multiplied by nearly four orders of magnitude by hybridization with ond due to synergistic effects between ond and zif 8 thermodynamic studies proved the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 to be an endothermic spontaneous and entropy governed process the impact of different parameters was investigated and the optimum conditions for the adsorptive removal of mb from polluted water were found to be at 50 c and ph 11 abbreviations 2 mim 2 methylimidazole cv crystal violet

nanodiamond hybrid nanostructures data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction today s fast paced and continuous progress in technology and industry has led to water contamination organic contaminants specifically organic dyes are among the most important sources of water pollution bringing about health problems for people and wildlife due to their toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity thus using an effective method in order to remove these contaminants before their discharge into the environment has become a tremendous worldwide concern 1 2 to tackle this issue a number of methods including membrane filtration ion exchange membranes coagulation flocculation ozonation photo degradation and adsorption have been employed adsorption owing to its low cost ease of the process high efficiency flexibility and versatility has shown appropriate capability to be the most promising method compared to the mentioned techniques 3 hence finding suitable adsorbents for removing organic dyes from water has turned into a hot topic to date several types of materials including graphenic materials zeolites polymers metal oxides and metal organic frameworks mofs have been prepared for the adsorptive removal of organic dyes 4 mofs among them have gained special attention to be used as high performance adsorbents thanks to their versatility high porosity and surface area flexibility and tailored chemical functionalities 5 mofs are a type of nanoporous and crystalline materials made by joining secondary building units i e clusters or ions of metals and ligands which are organic linkers through coordination bonds 6 zif 8 an mof formed by crosslinking 2 methyl imidazole and zn2 ions is a proper choice for the adsorption of dyes from effluents due to its ultrahigh specific surface area good dispersibility and high porosity so it has been used for the adsorption of organic dyes by other researchers 7 for example santoso et al synthesized zif 8 nanoparticles utilizing acetic acid as solvent and reported a maximum adsorption capacity of 24 57 mg g for mb dye adsorption 8 alinezhad et al fabricated zif 8 with leaf shaped morphology with a surprisingly low specific surface area of 20 m2 g and reached an adsorption capacity of 205 mg g 9 however like most mofs zif 8 suffers some drawbacks such as difficulty in separating and recycling of zif 8 nanoparticles from aqueous media hindering its application as an efficient adsorbent for dye removal 10 it must be noted that the adsorptive removal of methylene blue as one of the most conventional dyes used by industries such as wood industries using zif based nanomaterials has remained a challenge for researchers 11 despite the extremely high efficiency of zif 8 in the adsorption of cationic and anionic dyes such as malachite green and congo red its ability to remove mb is limited 12 13 one approach to overcome such downsides is combining pristine mof with other functional materials such as metal oxides silica polymers carbon nanotubes etc and creating hybrid nanostructures with more positive points and restricted downfalls 14 as a carbonaceous nanomaterial nanodiamond has gained great attention in wastewater treatment due to its non toxicity chemical stability high specific surface area controllable surface functional groups and good affinity to organic pollutants 15 17 previously our group conducted research works on the adsorption performance of nanodiamond the results revealed that thermally oxidized nanodiamond has significant adsorption capacity towards both anionic and cationic dyes compared to neat nanodiamond 15 furthermore the hybridization of nanodiamond with mof nanoparticles was investigated in which uio 66 ond was synthesized with different percentages of ond in the hybrid adsorbents ranging from 0 5 to 10 wt the adsorbent with 3 wt ond showed the best adsorptive performance increasing the adsorption capacity of methyl red onto uio 66 and intensifying its dye adsorption rate to four times higher than uio 66 18 thus ond was selected for the synthesis of an mof based nanohybrid i e zif 8 ond for the adsorption based removal of mb dye in the present work an assortment of zif 8 ond nanohybrids with increasing content of ond from 0 5 to 5 wt was prepared this study aims to improve the adsorption performance of zif 8 in both adsorption capacity and rate aspects for the removal of mb from wastewater to this end kinetics and isotherm studies were performed on all the synthesized adsorbents moreover the influence of initial ph adsorbent dosage ionic strength as well as selective adsorption of mb in the mixture of mb dye with anionic methyl orange mo and methyl red mr as well as cationic malachite green mg and crystal violet cv was investigated on the best performing nanohybrid 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials untreated nanodiamond nd with 98 99 purity was purchased from nabond technologies co china the rest of the used materials including zn no3 2 6h2o zinc nitrate hexahydrate 2 methylimidazole 2 mim methanol methylene blue mb methyl orange mo malachite green mg crystal violet cv and methyl red mr were obtained from merck company germany 2 2 oxidation of nd nanoparticles before hybridization as received nd underwent thermal oxidization process at high temperature under air atmosphere to homogenize the external surface with carboxyl groups 19 to do this a certain amount of as received nd was first oxidized in a furnace at 450 c for 4 5 h to obtain a uniform layer of carboxyl group on the surface of nd during the oxidation process nd lost about 20 of its weight due to burning a number of surface graphitic layers turning into co2 and homogenizing the external surface with carboxylic groups 2 3 preparation of zif 8 and zif 8 ond nanohybrids zif 8 nanoparticles were synthesized according to our previous work 20 in brief 50 ml 2 mim 0 11 m and 50ml zinc nitrate hexahydrate 0 36 m methanolic solutions were prepared separately then the two solutions were mixed and sonicated for 5 min followed by keeping stationary at 50 c for 6 h the final white powder was washed with methanol three times by centrifugation applying sonication in between and dried at 100 c over night nanohybrid adsorbents were prepared by the addition of calculated amounts of ond to the zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution and the rest of the preparation method was the same as zif 8 nanoparticles 2 4 adsorption experiments to assess the adsorption capacities of the fabricated adsorbents 0 02 g of the adsorbents were added to 0 1 l of the dye solution with 20 mg l concentration and stirred in the dark for 2 h the adsorbents were collected and taken out of the solution using centrifugation in specified time intervals at 30 c to evaluate the adsorption kinetics parameters isotherm analyses were carried out by differing the initial dye concentration in the range of 20 500 mg l at three different temperatures the concentration of mb was monitored via uv vis spectrometry by comparing the maximum absorbance wavelength of mb solutions at 631 nm eventually the adsorption capacity was computed using the equations below 1 q t c 0 c t v w 2 q e c 0 c e v w where qt mg g and qe mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium where the adsorption and desorption rates become equal respectively similarly ct and ce mg l are dye at time t and equilibrium condition c0 w and v are the initial dye concentration mg l the adsorbent s weight g and the solution volume l the influence of ph was studied by regulating the solution s ph varying from 3 to 11 using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl the investigation of ionic strength was performed by adding specific amounts of nacl creating solutions with concentrations varying from 0 01 to 1 m to assess the impact of adsorbent dosage the mass of adsorbent was determined to be in the range of 5 50 mg in the study on the ability of the prepared adsorbent for selective adsorption of mb over anionic dyes and other cationic dyes binary solutions of mb with mr mo mg and cv were prepared with equal concentrations of 10 mg l the ideal adsorption selectivity s was calculated by the equation below 3 s q i c i q j c j in which qi is the adsorption capacity of adsorbent towards dye i at equilibrium corresponding to a concentration of ci similarly qj and cj are the adsorption capacity and equilibrium concentration corresponding to dye j 2 5 characterization the crystalline structure of the synthesized adsorbents and ond was determined using an x pert philis pw 3040 60 x ray diffractometer fourier transform infrared ftir spectra perkin elmer was used from 400 to 4000 cm 1 to scrutinize the surface chemistry of the prepared nanomaterials a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem mira3 tescan was employed in order to explore the nanoparticles morphology nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of pure nanoparticles and nanohybrids were carried out at 70 k with a belsorp miniii gas adsorption analyzer to evaluate surface porosity of the adsorbents tga technique was applied to probe the thermal stability of the nanoparticles and nanohybrids via a linseis thermogravimetric analyzer tga under n2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 c min from 25 c to 800 c the adsorbents surface charges were characterized using an sz 100z dynamic light scattering zeta potential analyzer horiba france 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization xrd patterns of the synthesized nanomaterials are exhibited in fig 1a to investigate their crystalline structure ond displays two broad peaks located at 2θ 43 6 and 75 3 corresponding to 111 and 220 sp3 reflection planes 21 the xrd pattern of zif 8 exhibits its highly crystalline structures with distinctive peaks at 2θ 7 10 3 12 5 14 7 16 5 18 2 19 5 22 1 24 5 25 5 26 8 29 6 which are attributed to 200 211 220 310 222 321 411 332 510 and 440 reflection planes respectively 22 it can be noticed from fig 1a that the addition of ond to zif 8 does not harm the mof nanoparticles crystal structure moreover the characteristic peaks of ond are covered by zif 8 peaks which has been seen in other researchers works 18 however with the increment in ond content to 5 wt the main characteristic peak of ond at 2θ 43 6 appears confirming successful hybridization of zif 8 and ond nanoparticles ftir spectra of ond zif 8 and their hybrids are shown in fig 1b according to fig 1b in the ftir pattern corresponding to ond the broad peak located at about 3400 cm 1 and the peaks observed at 2850 2920 cm 1 1790 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 are assigned to oh stretching vibrations of surface adsorbed water molecules and carboxylic acid functional group stretching vibrations of different aliphatic ch groups co stretching mode of the carboxylic acid and oh bending vibration of physisorbed water respectively the characteristic peaks observed at 1000 1200 cm 1 correspond to stretching vibrations of diverse co and coc groups on the surface of ond 23 24 ftir spectrum of as synthesized zif 8 accords with the literature in which absorption peaks discerned at 3131 and 2925 cm 1 are representatives of aromatic and aliphatic ch stretches of imidazole the stretching mode of cn bond accounts for the peak noticed at 1587 cm 1 the intense and elaborate peaks in the range of 1350 1500 cm 1 including the observed peaks at 1380 1422 and 1455 cm 1 are accredited to the entire ring s vibrational stretching the bands between 950 and 1350 cm 1 are ascribed to the ring s in plane bending whereas bands at 695 and 756 cm 1 are related to the ring s out of plane bending the observed peak at 420 cm 1 represents znn stretch mode 25 furthermore it can be noticed that the intensity of co escalates as ond content increases among the hybrid sample which is most noticeable in znd 5 sample tga analysis was applied to explore the thermal stability of the prepared nanomaterials in this study and the results are illustrated in fig 1c the tga curve of zif 8 indicates a mass loss at around 100 c which is due to the evaporation of the solvent methanol and physisorbed water with increasing the temperature to about 600 c a huge weight loss is observed presaging the destruction of zif 8 framework and decomposition of its organic linker that proceeds to 800 c 26 although the tga plot of ond shows great thermal stability up to around 500 c the weight loss at higher temperatures indicates the presence of oxygen containing groups on nanodiamond s graphitic surface that turns into co2 18 the hydrophobic nature of ond can explain the absence of mass loss due to volatilization in the tga curve of the prepared nanohybrids as was observed in the ond materials what is more as nanohybrid samples possess slightly higher thermal stability than neat zif 8 the amount of ash left after thermal analysis is higher for hybrid samples than zif 8 these results are consistent with previous studies conducted on the hybridization of mofs with nanodiamond 18 nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pertinent details are illustrated in fig 2a and table 1 to assess the porosity of the prepared adsorbents according to fig 2a the nitrogen adsorption desorption plot of ond demonstrates type iv isotherm characteristics and shows a large hysteresis exhibiting mesoporous structure 15 however the n2 adsorption desorption plots of zif 8 and the synthesized nanohybrids show type i isotherm with steep n2 adsorption at low relative pressures below 0 1 that exhibits microporous structures 27 nevertheless the minor hysteresis seen in the adsorption desorption isotherm of nanohybrids denotes mesoporous structure in light of the existence of ond particles according to table 1 the specific surface area of neat zif 8 is 1773 m2 g which is in agreement with what is reported in the literature 28 specific surface area of ond is 327 m2 g which is lower compared with zif 8 therefore the bet surface area decreases by increasing the content of ond in nanohybrids structure the surface charges of as synthesized adsorbents and ond particles are measured and the results are enumerated in table 1 accordingly the surface charge of zif 8 nearly doubles in value with the increase in the percentage of ond particles which may be due to the augmentation in electronegative functional groups i e carboxylic acid present at the graphitic layer at the surface of ond particles in other words the increase in the surface charge is caused by the dissociation of more carboxyl groups cooh coo h on the surface of ond 29 morphology of pure and hybrid nanomaterials are shown in fig 3 as illustrated the morphology of ond is spherical with particle of around 50 nm in size the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the fesem image of ond can be observed the crystal morphology of pure zif 8 is a polygonal structure with sizes in the range of 100 150 nm it can be found from fesem images corresponding to zif 8 ond nanohybrids that by increasing the ond loading the size of zif 8 particles increases and changes to a rod shaped morphology eventually at 5 loading of ond the crystal growth of zif 8 can be explained by three steps 1 nucleation 2 crystal growth in which a metastable phase appears and the relative crystallinity increases and 3 stationary period during which the crystallinity increases until the metastable phase is depleted completely and stable surface forms 30 the increase in the size of zif 8 particles can be explained by the presence of ond nanoparticles with carboxylic acid groups on their surface it can be assumed that during the in situ synthesis of zif 8 nanoparticles zn2 ions become adsorbed on the surface of ond particles and the nucleation process occurs on ond surface thus ond nanoparticles act as nucleation centers for the growth of zif 8 crystals consequently they can interfere with the nucleation and growth steps of zif 8 crystal formation probably by lowering the nucleation rate which results in larger particles moreover with the increment in ond content the zn2 ions can be adsorbed on the surface of ond and carboxylic acid groups act as capping agent by selectively hindering the crystal growth in certain facets of zif 8 controlling the relative growth rate of crystal in different directions causing an anisotropic crystal growth which has resulted in forming nanorods in addition the presence of ond particles sticking to zif 8 is evident in all nanohybrid samples in the znd 5 sample a small aggregate of ond can be seen as well 3 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption capacities of the prepared adsorbents as a function of time at ambient temperature are depicted in fig 4 obviously the adsorption capacity rises sharply in the first 16 min and then reaches a plateau with the passage of time coming to equilibrium after 2 h of adsorption this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that at the starting moments of the adsorption process the large number of empty adsorption sites enables dye molecules to easily interact at the adsorbent s surface 31 the following decrease in the adsorption rate rises from the coverage and saturation of the adsorbents surface resulting in the availability of fewer vacant adsorption sites 32 moreover it is evident that the increment in ond content in mof based nanohybrids increases the adsorption capacity of pure zif 8 48 mg g the presence of 5 ond in the nanohybrid sample znd 5 increases the adsorption capacity of neat zif 8 by around 30 65 mg g to get a deeper insight into the impact of contact time on the adsorption of mb onto the synthesized adsorbents the first 16 min of the adsorption were investigated with time intervals of 2 min fig 4 conspicuously shows that most of the dye removal occurs in the first 2 min of the adsorption process for the samples encompassing ond znd 5 reaches nearly 95 of its equilibrium adsorption capacity in merely 2 min while zif 8 approaches 62 of its adsorption equilibrium in the same time these results denote that the addition of ond not only raises the adsorption capacity of zif 8 but also enhances the adsorption rate in spite of the reduction of specific surface area of zif 8 nanohybrids compared to neat zif 8 the adsorption capacity of the nanohybrids exhibit higher values e g up to 30 for znd 5 on the other hand the surface charge of the nanohybrids is actually higher than that of neat zif 8 these observations suggest that the possible mechanism for the adsorption may be electrostatic attraction forces therefore it can also be concluded that the influence of increment in attractive electrostatic forces overcomes the reduction in the specific surface area of the adsorbent additionally the enhancement in the adsorption rate in the kinetics study confirms the synergistic effect between zif 8 and ond as reported in our previous study on the hybridizing of uio 66 with ond 18 to further investigate the adsorption mechanism and the prospective rate controlling step three well established kinetics models are testified the pseudo first order model expresses that physisorption is the decisive step that controls the rate of adsorption pseudo second order model describes chemisorption as the rate controlling stage in the adsorption process and diffusion is the rate controlling stage according to the intraparticle diffusion model 33 the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models in their linear forms are represented as eqs 4 and 5 34 4 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qt and qe mg g are adsorption capacities at time t and equilibrium k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min are pseudo first order models and pseudo second order model s rate constant eq 6 expresses the intra particle diffusion model 35 6 q t k id t 1 2 c where qt is the same as previous equations kid g mg min1 2 represents the model s rate constant and c mg g corresponds to the boundary layer s thickness same as all other constants mentioned earlier can be calculated from the linear regression of the corresponding kinetics models the results regarding data fitting to the mentioned models are described in table 2 and fig s1 based on the computed correlation constant r2 the adsorption of mb onto all the prepared adsorbents can be best delineated by the pseudo second order model in addition the obtained qe from this model is remarkably close to the experimental value providing strong proof of the legitimacy of the pseudo second order model imposing that chemisorption controls the adsorption rate moreover the rate constant of the model is evidently multiplied due to the presence of ond which is in line with the observation that ond particles enhance the adsorption rate of zif 8 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm is a key parameter that helps get a deeper understanding of the interactions between dye molecules and the adsorbent thus the influence of initial dye concentration was investigated as depicted in fig 5 the adsorption capacity rises sharply at low initial concentrations of mb dye then undergoes a subtle increase until reaching a plateau which stands for the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto fabricated adsorbents the steep increment in the adsorption capacity is ascribed to the increased mass transfer driving force resulting from the augmentation in the dye concentration that causes a higher concentration gradient 36 the aforementioned data was fitted to three distinguished isotherm models i e langmuir freundlich and dubinin radushkevich to gain a clear insight into the adsorption mechanism the langmuir model assumes that at a confined number of equivalent sites on the adsorbent s surface homogeneous and monolayer adsorption of adsorbate occurs its linear form is expressed as below 37 7 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max in which kl is langmuir binding constant and qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity the separation factor rl is calculated using the following equation 8 r l 1 1 c 0 k l where kl and c0 are the langmuir constant and the initial dye concentration respectively in general four possible adsorption processes can be derived based on the obtained rl value including 1 irreversible rl 0 2 favorable 0 rl 1 3 linear rl 1 and 4 unfavorable rl 1 38 the linear form of the freundlich isotherm model that proposes multilayer adsorption at a heterogeneous adsorption surface that has nonuniform available sites with diverse energies of adsorption is described as follows 9 ln q e ln k f 1 n f ln c e in which kf is the adsorption capacity and 1 nf describes the adsorption affinity 39 the linear form of dubinin radushkevich model is as follows 40 10 ln q e ln q max b ε 2 in which qmax mg g is theoretical saturation capacity b mol2 kj2 is a constant that indicates the adsorption energy and ε kj mol is the polany potential which can be derived from eq 11 11 ε rtln 1 1 c where r j molk is the universal gas constant t k is the absolute temperature and c mg l is the equilibrium dye concentration the mean adsorption energy e kj mol which is the free energy change based on the transformation of a unit mole of the adsorbate from an infinite distance in the solution to the surface of the adsorbent can be calculated via the equation below 40 12 e 1 2 b the amount of mean adsorption energy can distinguish between the adsorption type when e 8 kj mol the adsorption is physical in nature and 8 e 16 kj mol indicates chemical ion exchange adsorption process 40 the extracted data regarding the curve fitting of the isotherm experiments with the aforementioned models are illustrated in table 3 and fig s2 accordingly due to the high regression coefficient r2 corresponding to the langmuir model all the synthesized adsorbents are well fitted with this model however the adsorption data of zif 8 fitted to the freundlich model as well showing that the adsorption of mb onto zif 8 can be considered both multilayer and monolayer partially the adsorption of mb onto the synthesized nanohybrids is homogeneous denoting a homogeneous uniform monolayer in which all the adsorption sites have a similar affinity with the dye molecules without any impediment interaction among the adsorbed molecules 8 moreover the separation factor obtained from the langmuir model is found to be between zero and unity for all the adsorbents which signifies favorable adsorption and strong affinity between the prepared adsorbents and mb dye finally although the langmuir model does not provide a clear understanding of the adsorption mechanism it estimates the adsorption capacity quite accurately as shown in fig 5 with respect to the adsorption mechanism dubinin radushkevich model gives insight into the nature of the adsorption accordingly the mean adsorption energy for all the adsorbents in this study was 8 kj mol signifying a physical adsorption process which accords with the results from the kinetics studies 40 the maximum adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 and other zif 8 based adsorbents presented in the literature are compared in table 4 it can be found from table 4 that the synthesized adsorbents in this study have relatively high adsorption capacity towards mb compared to other adsorbents based on zif 8 and its hybrid structures 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption experiment was operated at assorted temperatures to get a deeper perception of the adsorption process of mb onto znd 5 as depicted in fig 6a the equilibrium mb adsorption capacity of znd 5 elevates with the rise in temperature positing that the adsorption process is endothermic to further scrutinize the adsorption process thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy g kj mol standard enthalpy h kj mol and standard entropy s j mol k were reckoned via the equations below 38 13 ln q e c e s r h rt 14 g h t s where slope and intercept of the linear plot of lnqe ce against 1 t were used to elicit the h and s values while g was computed from eq 14 t and r are temperature k and universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k according to the data provided in table 5 the negative g values of the adsorption prove that in all operating temperatures the adsorption of mb dye onto znd 5 comes about spontaneously the positive h value verifies the endothermic origin of the adsorption which aligns with the enhancement in the adsorption uptake of mb with increasing temperature the enthalpy change has a positive value which is unfavorable for the spontaneous adsorption process it is necessary for mb cations to be first stripped out of the hydration shell around them to be able to travel through the solution and approach the adsorbent s surface which needs energy intake while attractive forces related to the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 do not surpass the dehydration energy of mb cations the energy balance leads to positive enthalpy change moreover the calculated value of enthalpy change 5 117 kj mol implies that the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 is a physical process since the h value is smaller than 40 kj mol 46 additionally the entropy change in this study was positive indicating the augmentation in the randomness at the solid liquid interface throughout the adsorption process which proposes the good affinity of mb molecules towards znd 5 hence this positive value is in favor of the adsorption 47 based on the derived thermodynamic factors and taking into account that positive enthalpy change is unfavorable to the adsorption while the positive entropy change is conducive to such process it can be concluded that the adsorption of mb dye onto znd 5 is entropically governed 3 5 impact of adsorbent dosage as a determining factor in adsorption studies the adsorbent dose was assessed in this work to this end the adsorption of mb dye with a constant concentration onto znd 5 with diverse concentrations varying from 0 05 g l to 0 5 g l was investigated fig 7a demonstrates the impact of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 in which the adsorption capacity falls from 109 to 31 mg g with the increment of znd 5 dosage the increase in the adsorbent dosage in a fixed dye concentration and solution volume may cause an abundant amount of active adsorption sites to remain unsaturated leading to a decline in the adsorption capacity 48 furthermore the effect of adsorption dosage on the removal efficiency of mb from the solution was scrutinized and the results are illustrated in fig 7b as anticipated the removal percentage clearly elevated with increasing znd 5 dosage which is resulted from the increased number of available adsorption sites on the adsorbent s surface owing to the increased dosage 49 3 6 influence of solution ph since the initial ph of the solution can alter the adsorbent surface charge and the dye molecules ionization degree it is a pivotal factor in the adsorption process therefore the initial ph of the solution was regulated to various values ranging from 3 to 13 to probe the impact of the solution s initial ph on the mb adsorption capacity of znd 5 as illustrated in fig 7c the adsorption capacity of mb dye onto znd 5 rises as the ph of the solution increases followed by a slight decrease at ph 13 which may be due to the conversion of mb molecules to other compounds at highly basic media hindering the adsorption of mb 50 to gain insight into the effect of ph on the adsorption process zeta potential of znd 5 was screened in determined ph values the point of zero charge pzc corresponding to znd 5 is about 4 8 below which znd 5 has a positive value while the surface charge of the adsorbent grows dramatically in negative values at ph 4 8 as seen in fig 7d with the comparison of zeta potential of the adsorbent and adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 it can be concluded that the increment in attractive electrostatic forces between the adsorbent and the dye molecules increases leading to a rise in the adsorption capacity hence electrostatic attraction forces have a substantial role in the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 51 it should be noted that mb is in its neutral form at ph values less than its pka which is equal to 3 8 and becomes positively charged above this value 52 in addition the adsorbent has a positive surface charge at ph 3 where the adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 is 35 mg g which endorses the fact that electrostatic attraction is not the only mechanism controlling the adsorption because while znd 5 possesses positive charge mb is neutral and there is no electrostatic attraction in this condition other mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and π π stacking can also play a role in the adsorption process 3 7 selective adsorption due to the presence of an assortment of organic dyes in contaminated water the adsorption selectivity is a crucial factor that indicates the affinity of an adsorbent towards a specific dye in this regard the adsorption selectivity of znd 5 in binary solutions containing mb as a positively charged dye coupled with mo and mr as negatively charged dyes as well as mg and cv as positively charged dyes was investigated fig 8a and b exhibit uv vis spectroscopy of the mixture of mb with anionic dyes before and after the adsorption by znd 5 according to fig 8a and b the reduction in absorbance peak attributed to mb in both solutions is remarkably more than mo as well as mr in addition as depicted in fig 8c and d the absorption peaks related to mg and cv decreases significantly as compared to mb moreover adsorption capacity and selectivity index calculated using eq 3 is shown in fig 8e accordingly the values of adsorption capacity for mb in binary solutions with both anionic dyes are noticeably higher than mo and mr resulting in selectivity indices higher than one which shows that znd 5 selectively adsorbs mb which is a cationic dye model over mo and mr as anionic dyes these observations can be justified by the fact that interfacial interactions between znd 5 and mb are electrostatic attraction forces in contrast electrostatic repulsion forces between the surface of znd 5 and either mo and mr are the dominant interfacial interaction however while the adsorption capacity of znd 5 towards mb in the binary solutions with mg and cv does not change remarkably it is less than both cationic dyes resulting in selectivity indices less than unity which indicates higher affinity of znd 5 towards cv and mg rather than mb as in physisorption based adsorption the properties of dye molecules such as kinetics diameter polarizability dipole moment as well as adsorbent s physical characterization play major roles in the separation process the difference in adsorption capacity and in turn selectivity index can be attributed to different physical characteristics of dye molecules and their interactions with mb dye molecules 52 in addition in the case of binary cationic dye solutions the involvement of mechanisms other than electrostatic attraction such as π π interaction can account for the higher affinity of the adsorbent towards mg and cv 3 8 influence of ionic strength the intricacy of the wastewater due to the presence of a variety of salts and surfactants that can whether boost or hinder the adsorption performance through the competitive binding complexation dissociation of the dye molecules or screen electrostatic interactions of opposite charges makes it axiomatic to examine ionic strength in adsorption studies 53 herein the impact of sodium chloride s concentration a copious salt that is often present in contaminated water and changes its ionic strength on znd 5 adsorption capacity towards mb is examined the results depicted in fig 9a demonstrate that the adsorption capacity enhances with the elevation in nacl concentration in general the increase in the ionic strength reduces the adsorption capacity when there are attractive electrostatic forces between dye molecules and the adsorbent s surface 38 nevertheless the observed rise in the adsorption capacity of mb onto znd 5 can be attributed to dye agglomeration in the solution which can be caused by salt ions or intermolecular interactions such as dipole dipole ion dipole and van der waals forces leading to an improved degree of adsorption in addition rising ionic strength may increase the negative surface charge of znd 5 leading to greater electrostatic interactions with mb cationic dye 54 55 3 9 adsorption mechanism probing the mechanism of dye removal through the adsorption process provides deeper insight into interactions between the adsorbent and dye molecules and facilitates designing high efficiency adsorbents edx spectra of znd 5 before and after the adsorption of znd 5 are shown in fig s3 accordingly while no sulfur and chloride were found in virgin znd 5 the existence of these elements after the adsorption is a valid proof of the occurrence of mb molecules on the surface of the adsorbent in light of the above discussion regarding ph and its influence on adsorption it is likely that attractive electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and the adsorbent is the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 in addition comparing the zeta potential analysis and the adsorption capacities obtained from the fabricated adsorbents indicates that as the content of ond grows in the nanohybrid samples the surface charge increases which leads to an increment in the adsorption capacity despite the decrease in the specific surface area such an observation further proves the assumption that the predominant mechanism for the adsorption of mb dye onto the prepared adsorbents is electrostatic attraction isotherm studies indicated that the langmuir model can describe the adsorption of mb onto the adsorbent thus the adsorption occurs homogeneously on the adsorption sites with similar energies forming a monolayer which means that once a dye molecule occupies an adsorption site no more molecules can be adsorbed onto that specific site 56 according to the kinetics studies since the pseudo second order model was the best suiting model to describe the adsorption it can be concluded that the adsorption of mb dye onto all the prepared adsorbents dominated chiefly by physical adsorption this result was in accordance with the thermodynamics studies in which the enthalpy change of the adsorption was found to be 5 117 kj mol which is lower than 40 kj mol indicating that the adsorption process is physical rather than chemisorption brought about by the exchange or sharing of electrons 57 moreover the mean energy of adsorption e 8 kj mol obtained from the dubinin radushkevich isotherm model supports this statement in order to get more insight into the adsorption mechanism znd 5 before and after the adsorption process as well as pure mb dye was examined through ftir and the results are exhibited in fig 9b obviously znd 5 has preserved all its characteristic peaks after the adsorption process nevertheless the intensity of aromatic rings of mb was reduced after the adsorption onto znd 5 which indicates the occurrence of π π stacking interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate 38 moreover the appearance of the broad peak centered at about 3450 cm 1 proves the formation of hydrogen bonding between mb and the adsorbent 58 3 10 reusability and stability the reusability and stability of an adsorbent are crucial factors in evaluating its potential commercial applications therefore the reusability of znd 5 was examined using a mixture of water and ethanol as eluent for the desorption of adsorbed dye after the desorption the adsorbent was dried at 100 c overnight as illustrated in fig 10a the adsorption capacity of znd 5 was decreased from 65 mg g to 51 mg g after 4 consecutive cycles which means that the adsorption capacity was reduced by about 20 indicating acceptable reusability of the adsorption in order to evaluate the stability of the adsorbent xrd analysis was performed after the adsorption of mb dye as well as after four adsorption desorption cycles it is evident from fig 10b that the main characteristic peaks of the adsorbent are retained both after the adsorption and after the reusability study indicating good stability of the crystal structure of znd 5 the decline in the intensity of the characteristic peaks can be assigned to the coverage of a layer of mb dye on the surface of znd 5 moreover it can be inferred from this observation that the loss in the adsorption capacity may be due to the loss in some binding sites of the adsorption rather than the degradation of the adsorbent s structure 52 fesem of znd 5 after the adsorption of mb fig 10c indicates that znd 5 has preserved its structure since no remarkable change is noted in its structure nevertheless as compared to the fesem image of znd 5 before the adsorption fig 3 it is obvious that the adsorbent s surface has become slightly coarser after the adsorption suggesting that the dye molecules have covered the surface of the adsorbent which agrees with xrd analysis 4 conclusion in the current research work a series of zif 8 ond nanohybrid structures with various loadings of ond 0 5 5 wt was successfully prepared and exerted for the adsorptive removal of mb dye from wastewater according to kinetics investigations all the synthesized adsorbents best matched with the pseudo second order model demonstrating that chemisorption is the rate controlling stage of the adsorption in addition the adsorption rate of znd 5 was found to be around four times higher than pristine zif 8 nanoparticles which proves the influence of ond on the adsorption rate of mb onto zn mof based adsorbent based on isotherm studies the langmuir isotherm model best delineates the adsorption of mb onto all the synthesized adsorbents and by increasing the mass loading of ond on zif 8 the maximum adsorption capacity increases significantly by taking into account both kinetics and isotherm studies it can be deduced that the synergistic effect between zif 8 and ond nanoparticles works in favor of adsorptive removal of mb from aqueous media which is resulted from the increment in surface charge of the adsorbent further examinations were carried out on znd 5 the best performing adsorbent thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 is endothermic spontaneous and controlled by entropy as the solution s initial ph increased the adsorption capacity was enhanced remarkably and reached a maximum at ph 11 due to a dramatic increase in zeta potential of the adsorbent indicating that znd 5 works best in basic conditions ph 11 for the adsorption of mb selective separation investigations denoted that znd 5 has more affinity towards mb over mo and mr due to electrostatic attraction forces yet it shows a higher adsorption capacity for cationic mg and cv based on the results observed from zeta potential initial ph and ionic strength examinations it could be deduced that electrostatic attraction is the chief mechanism for the adsorption of mb onto znd 5 π π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding were found to be other mechanisms involved in the adsorption process finally the adsorbent proved well stability and reusability by maintaining over 80 of its adsorption capacity

12751,in powdered activated carbon pac activated sludge as treatment pac is directly dosed into the as tank in this study batch and pilot plant experiments were carried out to investigate the efficacy of pac as treatment concerning the removal of organic micropollutants omps batch and pilot plant experiments showed comparable removal efficiency of nine omps a mean removal of 80 could be achieved at a specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc during a pac cut off experiment the removal performance leveled off in the first 6 h without pac dosage a further investigation involving an intermittent dosage of pac demonstrated that omps were removed stably when pac was dosed every 6 h which implies the possibility of reduced investment and maintenance costs of a dosing unit doc was removed by 18 4 when the pac doses ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 mg pac mg doc in this study a more detailed characterization of the organic matter was performed by means of size exclusion chromatography coupled with organic carbon detection sec ocd the high molecular weight fraction f1 and hydrophobic organic compounds doch were most adsorbed by pac revealed by batch and pilot plant experiments it indicates a

sec ocd advanced wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is widely acknowledged that a vast number of organic micropollutants omps are not or only to a certain extent degraded and transformed to metabolites within the biological treatment steps of wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 3 omps consist of various chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products food additives industrial chemicals and pesticides overall removal of omps in conventional wwtps varies from high removal e g ibuprofen approximately 90 to moderate or variable removal sulfamethoxazole average reduction of around 60 to low removal carbamazepine and diclofenac average reduction of 30 35 4 6 wwtp is therefore a significant source of omp input into the aquatic environment 5 7 11 the presence of omps in aquatic bodies is a concern due to their potential persistence and suspected adverse effects on ecosystems 12 17 additional techniques involving advanced treatment processes are thus essential to eliminate the omps to a greater extent and by this reduce their impact on the ecosystem many studies have shown effective removal of omps by implementing powdered activated carbon pac treatment as the third or final treatment in wwtps 10 18 25 the main factors affecting the omps removal in the effluent involve the pac dosage and the concentration of dissolved organic matter dom analyzed as dissolved organic carbon doc since the concentration of dom in the effluent is much higher than that of omps adsorption of dom to the pac can influence the efficiency of omp removal by pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites 26 30 combining the factors of pac dose and dom concentration the specific pac dose mg pac mg doc is found to be closely correlated to omp removal 31 in literature pac was dosed not only in the secondary effluent but could also be dosed in activated sludge as tanks in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs or in membrane bioreactors mbrs 32 37 among them most full scale wwtps with advanced pac treatment focused on the dosage of pac in the secondary effluent or the activated sludge tank direct pac dosage into the activated sludge tank pac as treatment combines the use of pac with the activated sludge process in which pac is directly added to the aeration tank so that biological degradation and physical adsorption occur simultaneously 38 this process was developed in the 1970s to treat wastewater such as refinery wastewater or landfill leachate 39 a downstream filter is required to ensure that the concentration of suspended solids including pac meets the local requirements a few studies regarding pac as treatment for municipal wastewater are available in the literature 6 32 34 40 41 these studies involving pac as treatment focused on process feasibility comparison of pac dosage in the as tank and secondary effluent regarding omp removal and operational cost large scale pilot operations of simultaneous pac dosing published by obrecht et al 40 showed that efficient omp removal by more than 80 was achieved for selected omps for both dry weather and rain event a mean omp removal of more than 80 on rain free days was often used in literature as a parameter for sufficient treatment and is required for example in switzerland and in germany in the state of baden württemberg 42 43 the mean omp removal is calculated and listed for omps in different countries and regions compared to pac dosage in the effluent boehler et al 32 found that to fulfill the similar elimination efficiency pac dose in the activated sludge tank was double as high compared to a pac dose in the secondary effluent with pac recycling to the activated sludge tank evers et al 41 confirmed that only half of the pac dose was needed to achieve equal omp removal when pac was dosed in the secondary effluent compared to dosage in the activated sludge tank however the mechanisms which may affect the omp removal in the pac as treatment haven t been well studied possible reasons could be that pac was enclosed in the sludge flocs in pac as treatment which may reduce the potential adsorption sites of pac 44 moreover the doc concentration in the latter stage nitrification stage of the activated sludge process where pac was often dosed was slightly higher than the doc concentration of the effluent 45 furthermore it is unclear if dom in the activated sludge displays stronger adsorption competition against omps compared to dom in secondary effluent an advanced technique to characterize dom is size exclusion chromatography sec with online organic carbon detection ocd where molecules are separated by their physical and chemical differences 46 47 sec ocd has been applied to investigate the impact of dom size on competition in pac adsorption of omp from treated wastewater 28 guillossou et al 29 compared the dom fractions before and after pac adsorption by means of sec ocd to study the favorable adsorbed dom fraction from treated wastewater till now very few studies investigated the impact of dom in activated sludge on pac as treatment although pac as treatment showed lower omp removal efficiency than pac dosage in the secondary effluent it has recently gained increasing attention since it can be integrated into existing activated sludge systems at relatively low costs 48 similar to pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac was continuously dosed in the activated sludge tank in the published studies obrecht et al 40 and campinas et al 6 reported that after stopping pac dosing in pac as treatment omp removal performance didn t break immediately implying that the remaining pac in the system still had adsorption capacity indeed compared to pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac as treatment has the advantage of ensuring pac exhaustion due to the very long pac residence time which is equal to the sludge age 6 this implies the possibility of discontinuous or intermittent pac dosage to the best of our knowledge the intermittent pac dosage in conventional activated sludge tanks hasn t been systematically clarified the main aim of the investigations was to study the application of pac in eliminating omps from municipal wastewater by direct dosage into the activated sludge tank hence the study focused on 1 the examination of the performance regarding omp removal of the pac as treatment by laboratory batch experiments as well as experiments on a pilot plant installed in a municipal wwtp 2 determination of specific pac dose for a mean removal of 80 of the selected omps 3 the adsorption competition of dom and omps in the pac as system by performing size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon detection sec ocd for an advanced dom characterization 4 investigations of omp removal in pac cut off condition and intermittent dosage to set up an operation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and pac as pilot plant the pilot plant was operated at the municipal wwtp achern 30 200 population equivalent germany the pilot plant consisted of two identical but independent biological treatment lines line 1 served as reference no pac dosage pac was dosed in line 2 each line comprised a non aerated activated sludge as tank 2 m3 an aerated as tank 2 m3 and a secondary settling tank 1 m3 with excess sludge removal membrane disc diffusers were used during nitrification to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of approximately 2 mg l o2 the pilot plant was constantly fed with pre treated wastewater from wwtp achern at a flow rate of 150 l h in each line sludge recirculation from the secondary settling tank to the non aerated as tank was 100 of inflow volume the flow scheme of the pilot plant is demonstrated in fig s1 in the supplementary information in general the pilot plant was operated similarly to the wwtp achern except that no coagulant was dosed in the pilot plant as performed in the wwtp achern therefore the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the pilot plant was adjusted accordingly to achieve a comparable solid retention time srt to the full scale wwtp of around 13 days pac was prepared in a slurry with tap water 3 g l and circulated with a progressive cavity pump to maintain a homogenous suspension dosing into the aerated tank was done by a peristaltic squeeze pump in the inflow and the outflow of the pilot plant automated sampling devices were installed the pilot plant was operated continuously for six months from may to october 2020 2 2 characteristics of wastewater influent of the pilot plant the pilot plant was constantly fed with pre treated wastewater from wwtp achern the pre treatment includes screening and grit trapping due to limited space there is no primary settling tank in the plant the mean values for chemical oxygen demand cod doc concentration and the uv absorption at 254 nm uva254 of the influent of the pilot plant were 118 13 mg l 38 9 mg l and 38 3 1 m for the period of sampling respectively 2 3 batch adsorption experiments omp adsorption on four different pac products was tested in four batch experiments with activated sludge all experiments were conducted with background concentrations of omps in activated sludge no spiking activated sludge grab samples were manually taken at the day of the experiment from the nitrification tank of wwtp achern and transported in stainless steel containers in each batch test 1000 ml activated sludge was spiked with defined pac suspension of 0 6 12 and 18 mg l in a glass beaker fig 1 followed by constant stirring of the sludge samples for 24 h on magnetic stir plates the original sludge samples were analyzed before and after stirring no pac addition to quantify the change caused just by stirring for 24 h the original sludge samples without pac and without stirring were analyzed and served as blank samples blank doc cod omps and uva254 were measured for the blank samples and the samples after 24 h stirring in order to minimize errors by weighing small amounts of pac a stock suspension of 10 g l pac was prepared the four pac products tested in batch experiments were norit sae super cabot usa hereafter called norit carbopal ap donaucarbon germany hereafter called carbopal chemviron pulsorb wp235 chemviron germany hereafter called chemviron and csc pharma clean 30 carbon service consulting germany hereafter called csc the characteristics of the pac products are shown in supplementary information table s1 2 4 pilot plant experiments to investigate the removal efficiency of pac defined doses of pac were spiked in line 2 of the pilot plant while line 1 served as the reference line without the addition of pac norit and csc were applied in the pilot plant at different doses table 1 doc cod omps and uva254 were analyzed from the influent of the pilot plant and the effluent of the two lines two sampling campaigns duplicate determination were performed in each experimental phase the adsorption capacity of the preloaded pac which was recirculated by the return sludge was studied by running a pac cut off experiment for this purpose pac dosage in line 2 was stopped while line 1 continued to serve as a reference the drop in omp removal efficiency was observed over 6 d after the cut off after the cut off experiment the pac dosage was raised again to the level before the cut off which was 18 mg l pac norit in line 2 an intermittent dosage experiment was performed to study the necessity of continuous pac dosage the pac was dosed every 6 h in line 2 and continuously in line 1 for 18 d the removal efficiency of intermittent dosage was compared to that under continuous dosage in this study the composite samples were taken by automatic sampling devices over 6 or 24 h see table 1 composite samples consist of a series of individual grab samples taken at specified time intervals and in proportion to time the 6 h composite samples were only taken during the first 24 h of the cut off experiment to catch the potential fast change in omp concentrations after stopping the pac dosage 2 5 sample preparation and analytical methods for analysis of doc cod uva254 and omps liquid samples were filtered using a cellulose nitrate membrane filter 0 45 μm sartorius stedim biotech gmbh germany for sludge samples in batch experiments liquid samples were drawn from the supernatant of sludge after 30 min of settling the doc concentration mg l was analyzed by using two different methods 1 doc using oxidative combustion

this work always refers to doc using the shimadzu technique the dom of two batch experiments and three pilot experiments was fractionated by means of sec ocd a detailed description of the experimental chromatographical performance is given in the supplementary information text s1 and fig s2 the docc in mg l reflects the amount of organic carbon which is eluting after sec separation chromatographable and is attributed to the hydrophilic portion of the organic carbon 47 49 the non chromatographable portion sorbing on the column resin is calculated by the difference of docsec docc and is related to the hydrophobic doc portion doch mg l 47 49 the chromatograms of the docc part were divided into four fractions which were related to retention times based on the molecular weight mw range of the selected fractions fraction 1 f1 was considered as high molecular weight organic matter 2 106 20 000 g mol fraction 2 f2 as intermediate mw organic matter 20 000 1550 g mol fraction 3 f3 1550 100 g mol and fraction 4 f4 lower than 100 g mol as low mw organic matter the detailed assignment of the retention times is listed in table s2 of the supplementary information due to adsorption and ion exchange phenomena occurring between the resin material and the analytes high molecular weight compounds may elute later than expected 49 51 in a first attempt the retention times are inversely correlated with the molecular size and in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted substances uva254 was measured using a lambda 265 uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer technologies gmbh co kg walluf germany at λ 254 nm value given in 1 m omps were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent 1290 and api 6500 mass spectrometer absciex at tzw dvgw technologiezentrum wasser german water centre in karlsruhe germany the analyzed omps included several pharmaceuticals and anti corrosive agents which are considered for evaluation of sufficient omp removal within advanced treatment processes in baden württemberg germany 43 a mean removal efficiency of 80 of these compounds is required for sufficient omp removal 43 the limit of quantification loq of each micropollutant is shown in supplementary information table s3 2 6 data processing measurement of the omp concentration involves analytical uncertainty in this study if both the influent or reference concentration and the effluent concentrations were between 1 and 5 times the loq or both below loq the removal was not calculated in order to limit the propagation of uncertainties if the influent or reference concentration was higher than loq and the effluent concentration was below loq a value of half of the loq was adopted for effluent concentration the removal was normally calculated in other cases this approach has already been implemented in other studies 20 52 3 results and discussion 3 1 omp removal 3 1 1 batch experiments in order to test the performance of four different pac products four batch experiments were carried out with activated sludge doc and cod concentrations of the liquid phase in the blank were 7 6 1 6 mg l and 24 1 3 7 mg l respectively fig 2 shows the removal of different omps compared to blank samples after 24 h stirring by two pac products norit and csc the specific pac doses mg pac mg doc were different in the norit and csc experiments since the experiments were carried out on different days and the doc concentration in the aqueous solution of the sludge was different results of the pac products carbopal and chemviron are presented in fig s3 of the supplementary information in the experiments without pac dosage removal of some omps such as sulfamethoxazole 30 40 removal 4 and 5 methylbenzoziazole 10 30 removal benzotriazole 40 80 removal and metoprolol 20 80 removal can be observed this can be attributed to biodegradation and bio adsorption to sludge lakshminarasimman et al 53 studied the biotransformation rate of benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole in batch experiments with activated sludge and additional nutrients they found removal of ca 40 48 for sulfamethoxazole and 8 70 for benzotriazole after 24 h under aerobic condition 53 the experimental condition in this study was not the same as the study by lakshminarasimman et al 53 since no nutrients were added in this study however the removal of sulfamethoxazole and benzotriazole in both batch experiments after 24 h is comparable the behavior of carbamazepine and diclofenac was different and they were not removed biologically in this study literature studies also indicate the poor removal of these two compounds in the activated sludge and conventional biological treatment 4 5 53 table 2 displayed the calculated specific pac doses for four omps when they were 80 removed assuming linear correlation in this study the detailed calculation process is described in text 2 in the supplementary information very few published studies conducted omp removal experiments on batch scale with activated sludge under aerobic conditions altmann et al 31 also calculated the specific pac doses for these omps when they were 80 removed however they used secondary effluent doc ranged from 9 5 mg l to 14 4 mg l instead of activated sludge compared to batch experiments applying secondary effluent 31 and this study the required specific pac doses for an 80 elimination of benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole are similar table 2 probably due to the good biological elimination of these two omps in sludge however lower removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac was found in the activated sludge in this study compared to their removal in secondary effluent table 2 3 1 2 pilot plant experiments norit and csc were used in the pilot plant experiments to compare the omp removal performance between the two pac products norit was chosen for most pilot plant studies including three pac concentrations a pac cut off and an intermittent dosage experiment table 1 the csc experiment was run with a concentration of 18 mg l table 1 it was of concern that adding pac in the as tank might reduce the srt and could thus influence the nitrification process however complete nitrification was achieved at an srt of around 13 days during the operation the pilot plant ran well during the whole operating time fig 3 displays the omp removal between the influent and effluent of the pilot plant experiments it shows that the best removal was found for metoprolol 4 and 5 methylbenzotriazole benzotriazole and carbamazepine with norit which is similar to batch experiments the removal at specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc reached 92 0 5 for metoprolol 86 2 for benzotriazole and 78 7 for carbamazepine respectively however it has to be mentioned that the average removal of benzotriazole and metoprolol in the reference line pac 0 mg l was already between 50 and 60 revealing good biodegradability and sorption to the sludge of these two omps the detailed omp concentrations in pilot experiments are listed in table s5 s8 in the supplementary information diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole showed good removal 60 80 at a specific pac dose of 2 3 mg pac mg doc an average of 80 elimination of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole was estimated to be fulfilled at a specific pac dose of 3 5 mg pac mg doc assuming a linear correlation between removal and specific pac dose of these two omps table 2 compared to this study boehler et al 32 observed a higher elimination of diclofenac about 70 referred to the primary effluent already at a specific pac dose of 2 mg pac mg doc in the pac as treatment whereas the removal of sulfamethoxazole approx 30 referred to the primary effluent was lower compared to this study 3 1 3 comparison of batch and pilot plant experiments fig 4 demonstrates the mean removal of the nine omps as a function of the specific pac dose depending on the individual omp component the removal can be attributed to adsorption to pac and the sludge as well as to biological degradation csc showed a slightly better removal performance compared to norit in both batch and pilot experiments in this study the results reveal the possibility of choosing a suitable pac product for wwtps using batch experiments a clear dependence of the mean removal on the specific pac doses can be observed regardless of batch or pilot plant experiments the data displayed in fig 4 unveils that a mean elimination of 80 of the nine omps is achievable at a specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc for batch and pilot plant experiments in this study a mean omp removal of more than 80 was often used in literature to indicate sufficient treatment 3 2 comparison of omp removal with literature studies on pilot scale a comparison of omp removal using pac as treatment in this study and in literature is illustrated in fig 5 studies applying pac in the secondary effluent pac eff were also included in fig 5 due to the interest in comparing the two typical pac applications pac as and pac eff in the wastewater treatment plant data from literature studies of pilot scale experiments were reviewed and compared with this study the detailed information of each study is presented in table s12 supplementary information the removal efficiency of pac as treatment was generally calculated by referring to the concentration in the primary effluent 32 34 and the removal performance was associated with biological treatment and pac adsorption however the removal efficiency of the pac eff treatment was usually calculated referring to the concentration in the secondary effluent associating with almost only pac adsorption for better comparison the data of the removal efficiency from the pac as treatment as given in literature and in this study were recalculated to present the removal performance due to pac adsorption alone the characteristics of pac influences the adsorption mechanisms and by this the omps removal 20 54 except for the data from lübken et al 34 using powdered reactivated carbon and mailler et al 20 using a pac material comparable to norit the data presented in fig 5 literture data and this study used norit as shown in fig 5 pac as treatment solid columns showed that the elimination of benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from this study was comparable to the pac as study in the literature 32 34 55 although this study didn t investigate the pac addition in secondary effluent pac eff treatment the literature review shows that pac as demonstrates generally lower removal of benzotriazole carbamazepine and diclofenac compared to the pac eff treatment due to the high variation of its removal efficiency the advantage of the pac eff treatment regarding sulfamethoxazole was not as distinct as that for benzotriazole carbamazepine and diclofenac 3 3 adsorption of dom by pac in batch experiments it was shown above that lower pac doses were needed to achieve equal omp removal when pac was dosed in the secondary effluent compared to the pac as treatment since dom is one of the main factors affecting the omps removal by pac this study further analyzed the change of dom and dom fraction in the mixed liquor of sludge with and without pac adsorption 3 3 1 change of doc in batch experiments in batch experiments pac was stirred with sludge for 24 h applying four different pac products the doc concentration of the blank samples no stirring before starting the experiment was 7 2 1 8 mg l after 24 h of stirring the doc increased by approximately 50 when no pac was added 11 2 2 7 mg l fig s4 in the supplementary information potential causes for the rise of doc will be discussed below as expected samples stirred with 18 mg l pac displayed lower doc 7 5 1 5 mg l compared to samples without pac dosage after 24 h stirring probably due to adsorption of organic matters on pac the increase of doc in the aqueous sludge samples within 24 h without pac dosage could be explained by the hydrolysis of organic particles by microorganisms during the stirring process and the production of soluble microbial products alvarado et al 47 observed that accumulation of doc occurred during the first two days in aerobic conditions with wastewater particles due to hydrolysis of particulate organic matter as no additional substrate was added during the batch experiments in this study the microorganisms were probably under starvation conditions which could facilitate the hydrolysis process furthermore an increase of doc in activated sludge samples under starvation conditions was also reported to be associated with the production of soluble microbial products including metabolites produced during microbial growth phases and products from cell lysis 56 59 in order to better understand which dom fractions increased during stirring and were preferentially removed by pac adsorption sec ocd was used for a more detailed dom characterization 3 3 2 change of doc fractions in batch experiments by sec ocd fig 6 a shows a typical sec ocd chromatogram of a blank sludge sample in the batch experiment fig 6 b displays the distribution of the different doc fractions f1 to f4 of blank samples which are comparable with literature studies of activated sludge 46 due to the limited sample numbers analyzed the error bar in fig 6 b is long more experiments and measurements in the future are necessary to study the doc fractions in sludge the results of docc sum of f1 to f4 are consistent with the doc data given above demonstrating the increase of soluble organic matter after 24 h of stirring fig 7 shows that the higher and intermediate mw fractions f1 and f2 built up more during the 24 h of stirring compared to the lower mw fractions e g f1 by 80 chemviron and 150 norit fig 7 a alvarado et al 47 also found that f1 showed the highest rise among the four doc fractions during the first two days of aerobic hydrolysis with wastewater particles dosage of pac removed fractions f1 and f3 preferentially compared to the samples 0 mg l pac 24 h stirred half of f1 was removed with the dosage of 12 mg l chemviron specific pac dose 2 4 mg pac mg doc when applying norit 18 of f1 was removed by dosing 18 mg l norit specific pac dose 3 5 mg pac mg doc fig 7 a fractions f2 and f4 were not or only slightly removed when adding pac when using the bypass mode of the sec ocd the amount of docc and doch can be analyzed the non chromatographable part of the organic matter doch has a hydrophobic character whereas docc is much more hydrophilic fig 8 shows that doch decreased from 1 8 mg l to 1 mg l by 44 after 24 h stirring with 18 mg l pac specific pac dose 3 5 mg pac mg doc together with data shown in fig 7 it shows that doch and f1 are preferred to sorb on the pac the results are similar to the studies of guillossou et al 29 they reported that doch from wwtp effluent was the second most adsorbed fraction 32 following f1 34 after a 72 h batch test with pac moreover the analysis in this study was based on the control samples stirred for 24 h in parallel it is unknown if the organic matter in wastewater effluent samples changed after stirring for 72 h without dosage of pac in the studies mentioned above since such data were not shown 29 3 4 adsorption of dom by pac in pilot plant experiments in pilot plant experiments cod and doc concentrations of effluent line 1 reference line cod 27 5 mg l doc 9 6 0 8 mg l showed higher values compared to that of line 2 cod 23 4 mg l doc 7 9 0 7 mg l in which pac was dosed a doc removal of 18 4 was seen in this study when the pac doses range from 1 9 to 2 3 mg pac mg doc table s10 in the supplementary information this is comparable to other studies showing the doc removal with pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac eff treatment mailler et al 20 reported a doc removal efficiency of 35 24 at an average specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc in the secondary effluent without further filtration step which is comparable to this study margot et al 10 found that pac alone had an influence of about 20 to 35 doc removal at an average specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc for pilot experiments applying 12 mg l norit 18 mg l norit and 18 mg l csc the samples were further characterized using sec ocd the chromatograms of the wwtp effluent of the reference line resemble that of the blank sludge sample without stirring in batch experiments see fig s5 in supplementary information this observation is consistent with the finding from streicher et al 45 showing that the character of the chromatographable organic matter docc from samples in the activated sludge step nitrification tank resembles that in the final effluent similar to batch experiments f1 and f3 were favorably removed in experiments dosed with norit and csc see fig 9 a and table s11 in supplementary information at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l norit or 18 mg l csc f1 was removed by 17 to 19 fig 9 a similar to batch experiments the hydrophobic assigned fraction doch contributed a large part 70 to the docsec docc doch removal in the pilot plant experiments table 3 shows that the doch of effluent where pac was dosed was much lower 0 6 mg l compared to the reference line 2 3 mg l on the other side docc in the effluents of both lines displayed less than 10 variation table 3 the parameter specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is the ratio between uva254 and doc suva254 has been shown to be a useful proxy for natural aquatic dom aromatic content 60 61 an average drop of suva254 by 7 at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l norit and a drop of 12 at a specific pac dose of 2 3 mg pac mg doc 24 mg l norit implies the favorable removal of the aromatic compounds in this study table s10 in supplementary information the pac product csc showed a better elimination of suva254 and lowered the suva254 by 13 already at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l csc table s10 in supplementary information altmann et al 31 showed higher removal at a higher pac dosage in batch experiments they reported that suva254 decreased by 30 at a specific pac dose of approx 3 5 mg pac mg doc after pac dosage in secondary effluent 3 5 factors influencing omp removal in the pac as treatment as discussed above the removal of the four omps shown in fig 5 in pac as treatment was generally lower compared to the pac eff treatment to our knowledge there is still no studies that systematically investigated this aspect based on results from this study and from literature review we propose the following three possible mechanisms 1 sludge supernatant and secondary effluent contain different dom compositions which causes different adsorption competition against omps 2 enclosure of pac in the sludge flocs which may lower omp adsorption due to reduced adsorption sites and diffusion limitation and 3 possible change of microbial community in the presence of pac which affects the omp removal all these possible causes will be discussed below for the first mechanism mentioned above this study found that hydrophobic organic matter fraction doch was more abundant in the activated sludge compared to that in the effluent fig s6 in supplementary information doch was favorably adsorbed by pac in this study and literature 29 a higher amount of doch in the activated sludge may cause a higher adsorption competition potential again omps which could reduce omp removal in the pac as treatment compared to pac eff treatment future studies concerning the comparative analysis of doc fractions in mixed liquor of sludge and secondary effluent shall be conducted to test this mechanism huber et al 62 reported that 82 of the docc and 93 of the doch from municipal wastewater were removed from conventional wastewater treatment indicating a higher removal of doch compared to docc this is consistent with the data from this study moreover komatsu et al 63 found that during anaerobic or anoxic wastewater treatment the influent dom was homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity and aerobic treatment was able to transform or remove such dom the pac as plants from this study and in literature consisted of both anoxic and aerobic treatment stages it implies that the nitrification stage is essential to further remove dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity which are favored for pac adsorption 19 20 64 65 in pac as treatment microscope pictures from wunderlin et al 44 showed that pac was fully enclosed by the sludge floc the adsorption sites are thus supposed to be reduced and the diffusion layer for omp adsorption expands which may decrease the omp removal streicher et al 45 showed that although pac adsorptive kinetic of diclofenac and carbamazepine was lower in activated sludge compared to that in the secondary effluent the total adsorptive removal after 4 h was similar in the sludge and effluent it demonstrates that competition between dom and omps for adsorption sites was not a significant mechanism since it only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it 29 the longer hydraulic and pac retention times inside pac as treatment might compensate for a lower adsorptive kinetic rate compared to pac eff treatment another study from cimbritz et al 35 studied the omp removal at various pac doses in three batch experiments 1 secondary effluent 2 effluent with mbbr carrier 1 5 g l and 3 effluent with additional sludge 1 2 g l they reported that adsorption to pac was not negatively affected by the presence of biomass or carriers indicating low interference with the suspended solids 35 therefore pac enclosure by sludge shall not be the primary reason for lower omp removal in the pac as treatment regarding the change of microbial community in the presence of pac asif et al 36 found that pac addition increased the microbial biodiversity and was favorable for nitrifying and denitrifying functional genes in a lab scale anoxic aerobic ceramic mbr simultaneous nitrification and denitrification have been reported to improve the biodegradation of certain micropollutants in mbr 36 66 67 however the omp removal due to a change of microbial community in the presence of pac couldn t be quantified yet to summarize the possible causes that lower the omp removal in pac as treatment compared to pac eff treatment the difference in the dom composition especially the hydrophobic dom appears to play an important role based on the results of this research the enclosure of pac in the activated sludge displays a minor role due to the longer hydraulic and pac retention times inside the activated sludge tank moreover the knowledge gap regarding microbial community change and their contribution to omp removal shall be closed 3 6 operational parameters 3 6 1 dosage cut off experiment to investigate the decline of omp removal in case of a breakdown of the dosing unit a cut off experiment was conducted over six days during pilot plant operation as shown in fig 10 removal efficiencies of the omps leveled off during the first 6 h the mean removal efficiency of nine omps after 6 h was still 98 of the original removal efficiency before the pac cut off the highest decline occurred within the first 6 to 12 h after the cut off of the dosage between days 4 and 6 only minor removal of the easily adsorbable omps is visible the results are in good line with data obtained by obrecht et al 40 who also investigated omp removal after a pac cut off for three days during the pilot plant operation of a pac as system the cut off experiment confirms the assumption that the sorption capacity of the pac in the as tank and return sludge is not yet exhausted and continues to contribute to the overall elimination it also addresses the importance of fresh pac dosage no later than 6 h cut off to ensure constant removal of omps the outcome also gives insight into whether the system can be temporarily influenced during peak inflows or breakdown of the dosing unit 3 6 2 continuous and intermittent dosage to investigate the influence of intermittent dosing which potentially reduces investment and maintenance costs of the required dosing unit intermittent dosage of pac every 6 h in line 2 was compared with continuous dosage line 1 fig 11 illustrates that no significant difference in omp removal was observed as a result continuous dosing of pac is not critical for sufficient omp removal however dosing intervals should not exceed 6 h as shown in the cut off experiment 3 6 3 correlation between omp removal and uva254 abatement as shown in fig 12 the mean removal of nine omps referred to the influent of the pilot plant correlates strongly with the corresponding uva254 abatement the average omp removal can be thus monitored by uva254 abatement in the pac as treatment which is similar to pac eff treatment 22 31 45 68 the uva254 abatement referred to the reference line is calculated to reflect the treatment efficiency of pac adsorption only it is observed that the coefficient of determination r2 referred to reference line is 0 89 which is stronger than that referred to influent 0 74 similar to the study from zietzschmann et al 69 this study found that removal of diclofenac shows the best correlation with the corresponding uva254 abatement followed by carbamazepine when referring to the influent concentration data not shown these two compounds were poorly removed by biological treatment and are mainly eliminated by pac adsorption fig 2 and fig 3 biological degradation of the omps may result in transformation products which still may contribute to the uva254 abatement 4 conclusions a series of batch experiments using activated sludge and four different pac products as well as a six month pilot scale experiment of pac direct dosing to as reactor were conducted in this study based on the overall batch and pilot plant experiments mean omp removal of 80 could be achieved at a specific pac dose of proximately 2 5 mg pac mg doc in the pac as treatment process uva254 abatement correlates strongly with the mean removal of nine omps indicating the possibility of using uva254 abatement as a surrogate for omp removal in pac as treatment during a pac cut off experiment the omp removal leveled off in the first 6 h and dropped sharply between 6 and 12 h it suggests that the system is capable of handling short term peak inflows or breakdowns of the dosing unit intermittent dosage showed comparable omp removal performance compared to continuous dosage and the dosage interval shall not exceed 6 h doc was removed by 18 4 when the pac doses ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 mg pac mg doc in this study which is similar to the process in which pac is dosed in the secondary effluent pac eff a closer look at the different characteristics of the organic matter fractions showed that f1 high molecular weight fraction and the hydrophobic organic matter fraction doch were adsorbed the most by pac which may cause a higher adsorption competition potential

a specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc during a pac cut off experiment the removal performance leveled off in the first 6 h without pac dosage a further investigation involving an intermittent

sec ocd advanced wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction it is widely acknowledged that a vast number of organic micropollutants omps are not or only to a certain extent degraded and transformed to metabolites within the biological treatment steps of wastewater treatment plants wwtps 1 3 omps consist of various chemicals including pharmaceuticals and personal care products food additives industrial chemicals and pesticides overall removal of omps in conventional wwtps varies from high removal e g ibuprofen approximately 90 to moderate or variable removal sulfamethoxazole average reduction of around 60 to low removal carbamazepine and diclofenac average reduction of 30 35 4 6 wwtp is therefore a significant source of omp input into the aquatic environment 5 7 11 the presence of omps in aquatic bodies is a concern due to their potential persistence and suspected adverse effects on ecosystems 12 17 additional techniques involving advanced treatment processes are thus essential to eliminate the omps to a greater extent and by this reduce their impact on the ecosystem many studies have shown effective removal of omps by implementing powdered activated carbon pac treatment as the third or final treatment in wwtps 10 18 25 the main factors affecting the omps removal in the effluent involve the pac dosage and the concentration of dissolved organic matter dom analyzed as dissolved organic carbon doc since the concentration of dom in the effluent is much higher than that of omps adsorption of dom to the pac can influence the efficiency of omp removal by pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites 26 30 combining the factors of pac dose and dom concentration the specific pac dose mg pac mg doc is found to be closely correlated to omp removal 31 in literature pac was dosed not only in the secondary effluent but could also be dosed in activated sludge as tanks in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs or in membrane bioreactors mbrs 32 37 among them most full scale wwtps with advanced pac treatment focused on the dosage of pac in the secondary effluent or the activated sludge tank direct pac dosage into the activated sludge tank pac as treatment combines the use of pac with the activated sludge process in which pac is directly added to the aeration tank so that biological degradation and physical adsorption occur simultaneously 38 this process was developed in the 1970s to treat wastewater such as refinery wastewater or landfill leachate 39 a downstream filter is required to ensure that the concentration of suspended solids including pac meets the local requirements a few studies regarding pac as treatment for municipal wastewater are available in the literature 6 32 34 40 41 these studies involving pac as treatment focused on process feasibility comparison of pac dosage in the as tank and secondary effluent regarding omp removal and operational cost large scale pilot operations of simultaneous pac dosing published by obrecht et al 40 showed that efficient omp removal by more than 80 was achieved for selected omps for both dry weather and rain event a mean omp removal of more than 80 on rain free days was often used in literature as a parameter for sufficient treatment and is required for example in switzerland and in germany in the state of baden württemberg 42 43 the mean omp removal is calculated and listed for omps in different countries and regions compared to pac dosage in the effluent boehler et al 32 found that to fulfill the similar elimination efficiency pac dose in the activated sludge tank was double as high compared to a pac dose in the secondary effluent with pac recycling to the activated sludge tank evers et al 41 confirmed that only half of the pac dose was needed to achieve equal omp removal when pac was dosed in the secondary effluent compared to dosage in the activated sludge tank however the mechanisms which may affect the omp removal in the pac as treatment haven t been well studied possible reasons could be that pac was enclosed in the sludge flocs in pac as treatment which may reduce the potential adsorption sites of pac 44 moreover the doc concentration in the latter stage nitrification stage of the activated sludge process where pac was often dosed was slightly higher than the doc concentration of the effluent 45 furthermore it is unclear if dom in the activated sludge displays stronger adsorption competition against omps compared to dom in secondary effluent an advanced technique to characterize dom is size exclusion chromatography sec with online organic carbon detection ocd where molecules are separated by their physical and chemical differences 46 47 sec ocd has been applied to investigate the impact of dom size on competition in pac adsorption of omp from treated wastewater 28 guillossou et al 29 compared the dom fractions before and after pac adsorption by means of sec ocd to study the favorable adsorbed dom fraction from treated wastewater till now very few studies investigated the impact of dom in activated sludge on pac as treatment although pac as treatment showed lower omp removal efficiency than pac dosage in the secondary effluent it has recently gained increasing attention since it can be integrated into existing activated sludge systems at relatively low costs 48 similar to pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac was continuously dosed in the activated sludge tank in the published studies obrecht et al 40 and campinas et al 6 reported that after stopping pac dosing in pac as treatment omp removal performance didn t break immediately implying that the remaining pac in the system still had adsorption capacity indeed compared to pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac as treatment has the advantage of ensuring pac exhaustion due to the very long pac residence time which is equal to the sludge age 6 this implies the possibility of discontinuous or intermittent pac dosage to the best of our knowledge the intermittent pac dosage in conventional activated sludge tanks hasn t been systematically clarified the main aim of the investigations was to study the application of pac in eliminating omps from municipal wastewater by direct dosage into the activated sludge tank hence the study focused on 1 the examination of the performance regarding omp removal of the pac as treatment by laboratory batch experiments as well as experiments on a pilot plant installed in a municipal wwtp 2 determination of specific pac dose for a mean removal of 80 of the selected omps 3 the adsorption competition of dom and omps in the pac as system by performing size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon detection sec ocd for an advanced dom characterization 4 investigations of omp removal in pac cut off condition and intermittent dosage to set up an operation strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and pac as pilot plant the pilot plant was operated at the municipal wwtp achern 30 200 population equivalent germany the pilot plant consisted of two identical but independent biological treatment lines line 1 served as reference no pac dosage pac was dosed in line 2 each line comprised a non aerated activated sludge as tank 2 m3 an aerated as tank 2 m3 and a secondary settling tank 1 m3 with excess sludge removal membrane disc diffusers were used during nitrification to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of approximately 2 mg l o2 the pilot plant was constantly fed with pre treated wastewater from wwtp achern at a flow rate of 150 l h in each line sludge recirculation from the secondary settling tank to the non aerated as tank was 100 of inflow volume the flow scheme of the pilot plant is demonstrated in fig s1 in the supplementary information in general the pilot plant was operated similarly to the wwtp achern except that no coagulant was dosed in the pilot plant as performed in the wwtp achern therefore the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the pilot plant was adjusted accordingly to achieve a comparable solid retention time srt to the full scale wwtp of around 13 days pac was prepared in a slurry with tap water 3 g l and circulated with a progressive cavity pump to maintain a homogenous suspension dosing into the aerated tank was done by a peristaltic squeeze pump in the inflow and the outflow of the pilot plant automated sampling devices were installed the pilot plant was operated continuously for six months from may to october 2020 2 2 characteristics of wastewater influent of the pilot plant the pilot plant was constantly fed with pre treated wastewater from wwtp achern the pre treatment includes screening and grit trapping due to limited space there is no primary settling tank in the plant the mean values for chemical oxygen demand cod doc concentration and the uv absorption at 254 nm uva254 of the influent of the pilot plant were 118 13 mg l 38 9 mg l and 38 3 1 m for the period of sampling respectively 2 3 batch adsorption experiments omp adsorption on four different pac products was tested in four batch experiments with activated sludge all experiments were conducted with background concentrations of omps in activated sludge no spiking activated sludge grab samples were manually taken at the day of the experiment from the nitrification tank of wwtp achern and transported in stainless steel containers in each batch test 1000 ml activated sludge was spiked with defined pac suspension of 0 6 12 and 18 mg l in a glass beaker fig 1 followed by constant stirring of the sludge samples for 24 h on magnetic stir plates the original sludge samples were analyzed before and after stirring no pac addition to quantify the change caused just by stirring for 24 h the original sludge samples without pac and without stirring were analyzed and served as blank samples blank doc cod omps and uva254 were measured for the blank samples and the samples after 24 h stirring in order to minimize errors by weighing small amounts of pac a stock suspension of 10 g l pac was prepared the four pac products tested in batch experiments were norit sae super cabot usa hereafter called norit carbopal ap donaucarbon germany hereafter called carbopal chemviron pulsorb wp235 chemviron germany hereafter called chemviron and csc pharma clean 30 carbon service consulting germany hereafter called csc the characteristics of the pac products are shown in supplementary information table s1 2 4 pilot plant experiments to investigate the removal efficiency of pac defined doses of pac were spiked in line 2 of the pilot plant while line 1 served as the reference line without the addition of pac norit and csc were applied in the pilot plant at different doses table 1 doc cod omps and uva254 were analyzed from the influent of the pilot plant and the effluent of the two lines two sampling campaigns duplicate determination were performed in each experimental phase the adsorption capacity of the preloaded pac which was recirculated by the return sludge was studied by running a pac cut off experiment for this purpose pac dosage in line 2 was stopped while line 1 continued to serve as a reference the drop in omp removal efficiency was observed over 6 d after the cut off after the cut off experiment the pac dosage was raised again to the level before the cut off which was 18 mg l pac norit in line 2 an intermittent dosage experiment was performed to study the necessity of continuous pac dosage the pac was dosed every 6 h in line 2 and continuously in line 1 for 18 d the removal efficiency of intermittent dosage was compared to that under continuous dosage in this study the composite samples were taken by automatic sampling devices over 6 or 24 h see table 1 composite samples consist of a series of individual grab samples taken at specified time intervals and in proportion to time the 6 h composite samples were only taken during the first 24 h of the cut off experiment to catch the potential fast change in omp concentrations after stopping the pac dosage 2 5 sample preparation and analytical methods for analysis of doc cod uva254 and omps liquid samples were filtered using a cellulose nitrate membrane filter 0 45 μm sartorius stedim biotech gmbh germany for sludge samples in batch experiments liquid samples were drawn from the supernatant of sludge after 30 min of settling the doc concentration mg l was analyzed by using two different methods 1 doc using oxidative combustion

this work always refers to doc using the shimadzu technique the dom of two batch experiments and three pilot experiments was fractionated by means of sec ocd a detailed description of the experimental chromatographical performance is given in the supplementary information text s1 and fig s2 the docc in mg l reflects the amount of organic carbon which is eluting after sec separation chromatographable and is attributed to the hydrophilic portion of the organic carbon 47 49 the non chromatographable portion sorbing on the column resin is calculated by the difference of docsec docc and is related to the hydrophobic doc portion doch mg l 47 49 the chromatograms of the docc part were divided into four fractions which were related to retention times based on the molecular weight mw range of the selected fractions fraction 1 f1 was considered as high molecular weight organic matter 2 106 20 000 g mol fraction 2 f2 as intermediate mw organic matter 20 000 1550 g mol fraction 3 f3 1550 100 g mol and fraction 4 f4 lower than 100 g mol as low mw organic matter the detailed assignment of the retention times is listed in table s2 of the supplementary information due to adsorption and ion exchange phenomena occurring between the resin material and the analytes high molecular weight compounds may elute later than expected 49 51 in a first attempt the retention times are inversely correlated with the molecular size and in good approximation with the molecular weight of the eluted substances uva254 was measured using a lambda 265 uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer technologies gmbh co kg walluf germany at λ 254 nm value given in 1 m omps were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry hplc ms ms agilent 1290 and api 6500 mass spectrometer absciex at tzw dvgw technologiezentrum wasser german water centre in karlsruhe germany the analyzed omps included several pharmaceuticals and anti corrosive agents which are considered for evaluation of sufficient omp removal within advanced treatment processes in baden württemberg germany 43 a mean removal efficiency of 80 of these compounds is required for sufficient omp removal 43 the limit of quantification loq of each micropollutant is shown in supplementary information table s3 2 6 data processing measurement of the omp concentration involves analytical uncertainty in this study if both the influent or reference concentration and the effluent concentrations were between 1 and 5 times the loq or both below loq the removal was not calculated in order to limit the propagation of uncertainties if the influent or reference concentration was higher than loq and the effluent concentration was below loq a value of half of the loq was adopted for effluent concentration the removal was normally calculated in other cases this approach has already been implemented in other studies 20 52 3 results and discussion 3 1 omp removal 3 1 1 batch experiments in order to test the performance of four different pac products four batch experiments were carried out with activated sludge doc and cod concentrations of the liquid phase in the blank were 7 6 1 6 mg l and 24 1 3 7 mg l respectively fig 2 shows the removal of different omps compared to blank samples after 24 h stirring by two pac products norit and csc the specific pac doses mg pac mg doc were different in the norit and csc experiments since the experiments were carried out on different days and the doc concentration in the aqueous solution of the sludge was different results of the pac products carbopal and chemviron are presented in fig s3 of the supplementary information in the experiments without pac dosage removal of some omps such as sulfamethoxazole 30 40 removal 4 and 5 methylbenzoziazole 10 30 removal benzotriazole 40 80 removal and metoprolol 20 80 removal can be observed this can be attributed to biodegradation and bio adsorption to sludge lakshminarasimman et al 53 studied the biotransformation rate of benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole in batch experiments with activated sludge and additional nutrients they found removal of ca 40 48 for sulfamethoxazole and 8 70 for benzotriazole after 24 h under aerobic condition 53 the experimental condition in this study was not the same as the study by lakshminarasimman et al 53 since no nutrients were added in this study however the removal of sulfamethoxazole and benzotriazole in both batch experiments after 24 h is comparable the behavior of carbamazepine and diclofenac was different and they were not removed biologically in this study literature studies also indicate the poor removal of these two compounds in the activated sludge and conventional biological treatment 4 5 53 table 2 displayed the calculated specific pac doses for four omps when they were 80 removed assuming linear correlation in this study the detailed calculation process is described in text 2 in the supplementary information very few published studies conducted omp removal experiments on batch scale with activated sludge under aerobic conditions altmann et al 31 also calculated the specific pac doses for these omps when they were 80 removed however they used secondary effluent doc ranged from 9 5 mg l to 14 4 mg l instead of activated sludge compared to batch experiments applying secondary effluent 31 and this study the required specific pac doses for an 80 elimination of benzotriazole and sulfamethoxazole are similar table 2 probably due to the good biological elimination of these two omps in sludge however lower removal of carbamazepine and diclofenac was found in the activated sludge in this study compared to their removal in secondary effluent table 2 3 1 2 pilot plant experiments norit and csc were used in the pilot plant experiments to compare the omp removal performance between the two pac products norit was chosen for most pilot plant studies including three pac concentrations a pac cut off and an intermittent dosage experiment table 1 the csc experiment was run with a concentration of 18 mg l table 1 it was of concern that adding pac in the as tank might reduce the srt and could thus influence the nitrification process however complete nitrification was achieved at an srt of around 13 days during the operation the pilot plant ran well during the whole operating time fig 3 displays the omp removal between the influent and effluent of the pilot plant experiments it shows that the best removal was found for metoprolol 4 and 5 methylbenzotriazole benzotriazole and carbamazepine with norit which is similar to batch experiments the removal at specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc reached 92 0 5 for metoprolol 86 2 for benzotriazole and 78 7 for carbamazepine respectively however it has to be mentioned that the average removal of benzotriazole and metoprolol in the reference line pac 0 mg l was already between 50 and 60 revealing good biodegradability and sorption to the sludge of these two omps the detailed omp concentrations in pilot experiments are listed in table s5 s8 in the supplementary information diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole showed good removal 60 80 at a specific pac dose of 2 3 mg pac mg doc an average of 80 elimination of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole was estimated to be fulfilled at a specific pac dose of 3 5 mg pac mg doc assuming a linear correlation between removal and specific pac dose of these two omps table 2 compared to this study boehler et al 32 observed a higher elimination of diclofenac about 70 referred to the primary effluent already at a specific pac dose of 2 mg pac mg doc in the pac as treatment whereas the removal of sulfamethoxazole approx 30 referred to the primary effluent was lower compared to this study 3 1 3 comparison of batch and pilot plant experiments fig 4 demonstrates the mean removal of the nine omps as a function of the specific pac dose depending on the individual omp component the removal can be attributed to adsorption to pac and the sludge as well as to biological degradation csc showed a slightly better removal performance compared to norit in both batch and pilot experiments in this study the results reveal the possibility of choosing a suitable pac product for wwtps using batch experiments a clear dependence of the mean removal on the specific pac doses can be observed regardless of batch or pilot plant experiments the data displayed in fig 4 unveils that a mean elimination of 80 of the nine omps is achievable at a specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc for batch and pilot plant experiments in this study a mean omp removal of more than 80 was often used in literature to indicate sufficient treatment 3 2 comparison of omp removal with literature studies on pilot scale a comparison of omp removal using pac as treatment in this study and in literature is illustrated in fig 5 studies applying pac in the secondary effluent pac eff were also included in fig 5 due to the interest in comparing the two typical pac applications pac as and pac eff in the wastewater treatment plant data from literature studies of pilot scale experiments were reviewed and compared with this study the detailed information of each study is presented in table s12 supplementary information the removal efficiency of pac as treatment was generally calculated by referring to the concentration in the primary effluent 32 34 and the removal performance was associated with biological treatment and pac adsorption however the removal efficiency of the pac eff treatment was usually calculated referring to the concentration in the secondary effluent associating with almost only pac adsorption for better comparison the data of the removal efficiency from the pac as treatment as given in literature and in this study were recalculated to present the removal performance due to pac adsorption alone the characteristics of pac influences the adsorption mechanisms and by this the omps removal 20 54 except for the data from lübken et al 34 using powdered reactivated carbon and mailler et al 20 using a pac material comparable to norit the data presented in fig 5 literture data and this study used norit as shown in fig 5 pac as treatment solid columns showed that the elimination of benzotriazole carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole from this study was comparable to the pac as study in the literature 32 34 55 although this study didn t investigate the pac addition in secondary effluent pac eff treatment the literature review shows that pac as demonstrates generally lower removal of benzotriazole carbamazepine and diclofenac compared to the pac eff treatment due to the high variation of its removal efficiency the advantage of the pac eff treatment regarding sulfamethoxazole was not as distinct as that for benzotriazole carbamazepine and diclofenac 3 3 adsorption of dom by pac in batch experiments it was shown above that lower pac doses were needed to achieve equal omp removal when pac was dosed in the secondary effluent compared to the pac as treatment since dom is one of the main factors affecting the omps removal by pac this study further analyzed the change of dom and dom fraction in the mixed liquor of sludge with and without pac adsorption 3 3 1 change of doc in batch experiments in batch experiments pac was stirred with sludge for 24 h applying four different pac products the doc concentration of the blank samples no stirring before starting the experiment was 7 2 1 8 mg l after 24 h of stirring the doc increased by approximately 50 when no pac was added 11 2 2 7 mg l fig s4 in the supplementary information potential causes for the rise of doc will be discussed below as expected samples stirred with 18 mg l pac displayed lower doc 7 5 1 5 mg l compared to samples without pac dosage after 24 h stirring probably due to adsorption of organic matters on pac the increase of doc in the aqueous sludge samples within 24 h without pac dosage could be explained by the hydrolysis of organic particles by microorganisms during the stirring process and the production of soluble microbial products alvarado et al 47 observed that accumulation of doc occurred during the first two days in aerobic conditions with wastewater particles due to hydrolysis of particulate organic matter as no additional substrate was added during the batch experiments in this study the microorganisms were probably under starvation conditions which could facilitate the hydrolysis process furthermore an increase of doc in activated sludge samples under starvation conditions was also reported to be associated with the production of soluble microbial products including metabolites produced during microbial growth phases and products from cell lysis 56 59 in order to better understand which dom fractions increased during stirring and were preferentially removed by pac adsorption sec ocd was used for a more detailed dom characterization 3 3 2 change of doc fractions in batch experiments by sec ocd fig 6 a shows a typical sec ocd chromatogram of a blank sludge sample in the batch experiment fig 6 b displays the distribution of the different doc fractions f1 to f4 of blank samples which are comparable with literature studies of activated sludge 46 due to the limited sample numbers analyzed the error bar in fig 6 b is long more experiments and measurements in the future are necessary to study the doc fractions in sludge the results of docc sum of f1 to f4 are consistent with the doc data given above demonstrating the increase of soluble organic matter after 24 h of stirring fig 7 shows that the higher and intermediate mw fractions f1 and f2 built up more during the 24 h of stirring compared to the lower mw fractions e g f1 by 80 chemviron and 150 norit fig 7 a alvarado et al 47 also found that f1 showed the highest rise among the four doc fractions during the first two days of aerobic hydrolysis with wastewater particles dosage of pac removed fractions f1 and f3 preferentially compared to the samples 0 mg l pac 24 h stirred half of f1 was removed with the dosage of 12 mg l chemviron specific pac dose 2 4 mg pac mg doc when applying norit 18 of f1 was removed by dosing 18 mg l norit specific pac dose 3 5 mg pac mg doc fig 7 a fractions f2 and f4 were not or only slightly removed when adding pac when using the bypass mode of the sec ocd the amount of docc and doch can be analyzed the non chromatographable part of the organic matter doch has a hydrophobic character whereas docc is much more hydrophilic fig 8 shows that doch decreased from 1 8 mg l to 1 mg l by 44 after 24 h stirring with 18 mg l pac specific pac dose 3 5 mg pac mg doc together with data shown in fig 7 it shows that doch and f1 are preferred to sorb on the pac the results are similar to the studies of guillossou et al 29 they reported that doch from wwtp effluent was the second most adsorbed fraction 32 following f1 34 after a 72 h batch test with pac moreover the analysis in this study was based on the control samples stirred for 24 h in parallel it is unknown if the organic matter in wastewater effluent samples changed after stirring for 72 h without dosage of pac in the studies mentioned above since such data were not shown 29 3 4 adsorption of dom by pac in pilot plant experiments in pilot plant experiments cod and doc concentrations of effluent line 1 reference line cod 27 5 mg l doc 9 6 0 8 mg l showed higher values compared to that of line 2 cod 23 4 mg l doc 7 9 0 7 mg l in which pac was dosed a doc removal of 18 4 was seen in this study when the pac doses range from 1 9 to 2 3 mg pac mg doc table s10 in the supplementary information this is comparable to other studies showing the doc removal with pac dosage in the secondary effluent pac eff treatment mailler et al 20 reported a doc removal efficiency of 35 24 at an average specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc in the secondary effluent without further filtration step which is comparable to this study margot et al 10 found that pac alone had an influence of about 20 to 35 doc removal at an average specific pac dose of 2 5 mg pac mg doc for pilot experiments applying 12 mg l norit 18 mg l norit and 18 mg l csc the samples were further characterized using sec ocd the chromatograms of the wwtp effluent of the reference line resemble that of the blank sludge sample without stirring in batch experiments see fig s5 in supplementary information this observation is consistent with the finding from streicher et al 45 showing that the character of the chromatographable organic matter docc from samples in the activated sludge step nitrification tank resembles that in the final effluent similar to batch experiments f1 and f3 were favorably removed in experiments dosed with norit and csc see fig 9 a and table s11 in supplementary information at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l norit or 18 mg l csc f1 was removed by 17 to 19 fig 9 a similar to batch experiments the hydrophobic assigned fraction doch contributed a large part 70 to the docsec docc doch removal in the pilot plant experiments table 3 shows that the doch of effluent where pac was dosed was much lower 0 6 mg l compared to the reference line 2 3 mg l on the other side docc in the effluents of both lines displayed less than 10 variation table 3 the parameter specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 is the ratio between uva254 and doc suva254 has been shown to be a useful proxy for natural aquatic dom aromatic content 60 61 an average drop of suva254 by 7 at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l norit and a drop of 12 at a specific pac dose of 2 3 mg pac mg doc 24 mg l norit implies the favorable removal of the aromatic compounds in this study table s10 in supplementary information the pac product csc showed a better elimination of suva254 and lowered the suva254 by 13 already at a specific pac dose of 1 9 mg pac mg doc 18 mg l csc table s10 in supplementary information altmann et al 31 showed higher removal at a higher pac dosage in batch experiments they reported that suva254 decreased by 30 at a specific pac dose of approx 3 5 mg pac mg doc after pac dosage in secondary effluent 3 5 factors influencing omp removal in the pac as treatment as discussed above the removal of the four omps shown in fig 5 in pac as treatment was generally lower compared to the pac eff treatment to our knowledge there is still no studies that systematically investigated this aspect based on results from this study and from literature review we propose the following three possible mechanisms 1 sludge supernatant and secondary effluent contain different dom compositions which causes different adsorption competition against omps 2 enclosure of pac in the sludge flocs which may lower omp adsorption due to reduced adsorption sites and diffusion limitation and 3 possible change of microbial community in the presence of pac which affects the omp removal all these possible causes will be discussed below for the first mechanism mentioned above this study found that hydrophobic organic matter fraction doch was more abundant in the activated sludge compared to that in the effluent fig s6 in supplementary information doch was favorably adsorbed by pac in this study and literature 29 a higher amount of doch in the activated sludge may cause a higher adsorption competition potential again omps which could reduce omp removal in the pac as treatment compared to pac eff treatment future studies concerning the comparative analysis of doc fractions in mixed liquor of sludge and secondary effluent shall be conducted to test this mechanism huber et al 62 reported that 82 of the docc and 93 of the doch from municipal wastewater were removed from conventional wastewater treatment indicating a higher removal of doch compared to docc this is consistent with the data from this study moreover komatsu et al 63 found that during anaerobic or anoxic wastewater treatment the influent dom was homogenized into intermediate molecular size dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity and aerobic treatment was able to transform or remove such dom the pac as plants from this study and in literature consisted of both anoxic and aerobic treatment stages it implies that the nitrification stage is essential to further remove dom with high hydrophobicity and aromaticity which are favored for pac adsorption 19 20 64 65 in pac as treatment microscope pictures from wunderlin et al 44 showed that pac was fully enclosed by the sludge floc the adsorption sites are thus supposed to be reduced and the diffusion layer for omp adsorption expands which may decrease the omp removal streicher et al 45 showed that although pac adsorptive kinetic of diclofenac and carbamazepine was lower in activated sludge compared to that in the secondary effluent the total adsorptive removal after 4 h was similar in the sludge and effluent it demonstrates that competition between dom and omps for adsorption sites was not a significant mechanism since it only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it 29 the longer hydraulic and pac retention times inside pac as treatment might compensate for a lower adsorptive kinetic rate compared to pac eff treatment another study from cimbritz et al 35 studied the omp removal at various pac doses in three batch experiments 1 secondary effluent 2 effluent with mbbr carrier 1 5 g l and 3 effluent with additional sludge 1 2 g l they reported that adsorption to pac was not negatively affected by the presence of biomass or carriers indicating low interference with the suspended solids 35 therefore pac enclosure by sludge shall not be the primary reason for lower omp removal in the pac as treatment regarding the change of microbial community in the presence of pac asif et al 36 found that pac addition increased the microbial biodiversity and was favorable for nitrifying and denitrifying functional genes in a lab scale anoxic aerobic ceramic mbr simultaneous nitrification and denitrification have been reported to improve the biodegradation of certain micropollutants in mbr 36 66 67 however the omp removal due to a change of microbial community in the presence of pac couldn t be quantified yet to summarize the possible causes that lower the omp removal in pac as treatment compared to pac eff treatment the difference in the dom composition especially the hydrophobic dom appears to play an important role based on the results of this research the enclosure of pac in the activated sludge displays a minor role due to the longer hydraulic and pac retention times inside the activated sludge tank moreover the knowledge gap regarding microbial community change and their contribution to omp removal shall be closed 3 6 operational parameters 3 6 1 dosage cut off experiment to investigate the decline of omp removal in case of a breakdown of the dosing unit a cut off experiment was conducted over six days during pilot plant operation as shown in fig 10 removal efficiencies of the omps leveled off during the first 6 h the mean removal efficiency of nine omps after 6 h was still 98 of the original removal efficiency before the pac cut off the highest decline occurred within the first 6 to 12 h after the cut off of the dosage between days 4 and 6 only minor removal of the easily adsorbable omps is visible the results are in good line with data obtained by obrecht et al 40 who also investigated omp removal after a pac cut off for three days during the pilot plant operation of a pac as system the cut off experiment confirms the assumption that the sorption capacity of the pac in the as tank and return sludge is not yet exhausted and continues to contribute to the overall elimination it also addresses the importance of fresh pac dosage no later than 6 h cut off to ensure constant removal of omps the outcome also gives insight into whether the system can be temporarily influenced during peak inflows or breakdown of the dosing unit 3 6 2 continuous and intermittent dosage to investigate the influence of intermittent dosing which potentially reduces investment and maintenance costs of the required dosing unit intermittent dosage of pac every 6 h in line 2 was compared with continuous dosage line 1 fig 11 illustrates that no significant difference in omp removal was observed as a result continuous dosing of pac is not critical for sufficient omp removal however dosing intervals should not exceed 6 h as shown in the cut off experiment 3 6 3 correlation between omp removal and uva254 abatement as shown in fig 12 the mean removal of nine omps referred to the influent of the pilot plant correlates strongly with the corresponding uva254 abatement the average omp removal can be thus monitored by uva254 abatement in the pac as treatment which is similar to pac eff treatment 22 31 45 68 the uva254 abatement referred to the reference line is calculated to reflect the treatment efficiency of pac adsorption only it is observed that the coefficient of determination r2 referred to reference line is 0 89 which is stronger than that referred to influent 0 74 similar to the study from zietzschmann et al 69 this study found that removal of diclofenac shows the best correlation with the corresponding uva254 abatement followed by carbamazepine when referring to the influent concentration data not shown these two compounds were poorly removed by biological treatment and are mainly eliminated by pac adsorption fig 2 and fig 3 biological degradation of the omps may result in transformation products which still may contribute to the uva254 abatement 4 conclusions a series of batch experiments using activated sludge and four different pac products as well as a six month pilot scale experiment of pac direct dosing to as reactor were conducted in this study based on the overall batch and pilot plant experiments mean omp removal of 80 could be achieved at a specific pac dose of proximately 2 5 mg pac mg doc in the pac as treatment process uva254 abatement correlates strongly with the mean removal of nine omps indicating the possibility of using uva254 abatement as a surrogate for omp removal in pac as treatment during a pac cut off experiment the omp removal leveled off in the first 6 h and dropped sharply between 6 and 12 h it suggests that the system is capable of handling short term peak inflows or breakdowns of the dosing unit intermittent dosage showed comparable omp removal performance compared to continuous dosage and the dosage interval shall not exceed 6 h doc was removed by 18 4 when the pac doses ranged from 1 9 to 2 3 mg pac mg doc in this study which is similar to the process in which pac is dosed in the secondary effluent pac eff a closer look at the different characteristics of the organic matter fractions showed that f1 high molecular weight fraction and the hydrophobic organic matter fraction doch were adsorbed the most by pac which may cause a higher adsorption competition potential again omps compared to other doc fractions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12752,landfill leachate was the most important secondary pollutant produced by the traditional waste treatment landfill leachate has high complexity and biotoxicity and simultaneously soil and water were used as mediators for migration or penetration it has gradually become a potential threat to environmental safety and human health studies have shown that compared with existing physicochemical techniques bioremediation can achieve better green purification through normal natural life activities and natural behaviors of different organisms such as excessive storage degradation filtration extraction transformation etc this technology can meet the needs of normal life activities of different organisms and enrich green resources and it can realize recycling while green recycling of soil and water polluted by landfill leachate this kind of technology can effectively make up for the shortcomings of existing physical and chemical treatment methods and effectively reduced the high cost of landfill leachate and the generation of tertiary pollutants it is a more environmentally friendly and economical way to explore the green purification of landfill leachate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bioremediation landfill leachate purification water treatment pollutant removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the process of rapid economic development an increasing amount of waste has become a key concern of environmental quality according to statistics china produced nearly 1 billion tons of garbage every year and it was growing at a rate of about 5 8 per year 1 3 nowadays landfill has become one of the most accepted treatment methods in most countries in the world due to its low operating cost high technical feasibility and convenient management 4 5 and landfill leachate was the main secondary pollution product of this method landfill leachate composition was affected by many factors such as garbage type age of landfill climate temperature and so on 6 high organic content of kitchen waste will lead to high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod for landfill leachate 7 8 at the same time industrial waste often carries a large number of heavy metals organic inorganic pollutants and even persistent organic pollutants pops 9 10 in addition drugs personal care products surfactants flame retardants pesticides nanomaterials and so on have gradually become new pollutants in landfill leachate 5 11 meanwhile due to the change of the age of the landfill site the composition of the landfill leachate will be further complicated table 1 12 14 this leads to different purification efficiency of landfill leachate in different stages treated by different technologies fig 1 these harmful landfill leachate will further migrate and enrich after being washed by precipitation and soaked in surface water and groundwater 1 15 16 at present physicochemical technology is the most widely used landfill leachate purification technology mainly relying on adsorption electrical neutralization adsorption neutralization precipitation flocculation aggregation and so on to achieve the evolution of harmful substances in wastewater 17 18 this kind of technology solves the landfill leachate very well meanwhile the existing physical and chemical treatment methods also have certain limitations such as the generation of tertiary pollutants 19 22 some studies have shown that landfill leachate may be a valuable resource pool and recycling its rich valuable resources such as heavy metals and organic matter can indirectly achieve green and low pollution in industrial production and consumption the green environmentally friendly treatment method has become the main exploration direction to reduce the potential risks of landfill leachate to the environment and human health 23 among them bioremediation was considered as a promising development direction bioremediation can selectively absorb complex compositions in landfill leachate by its own absorption synthesis transport and degradation capabilities 24 and these nutrients can be converted into biological growth and biomass thus recycling the valuable resources of landfill leachate such as heavy metals 25 26 at present landfill leachate bioremediation technology is still in an exploratory stage and the main exploration directions include screening of biological purification model optimization of treatment conditions mechanism composition and toxicity of landfill leachate etc among then microorganisms and plants were the main research objects of bioremediation 27 different organisms have different ways to purify different pollutants from landfill leachate for example different microorganisms mainly attach or absorb different heavy metals to achieve bioconversion or biosynthesis for purification purposes 28 29 these absorbed heavy metals will be degraded or synthesized into metal compounds plants mainly absorb heavy metals in the environment through roots and accumulate them in different parts such as roots and stems under the influence of translocation factors 19 in addition studies have gradually shown that microbial assisted phytoremediation technology can well optimize the shortcomings of simple microbial remediation or phytoremediation bacteria have proved to be very beneficial in phytoremediation by producing plant growth promoters organic acids polysaccharides etc 30 32 biological tolerance is an important issue in the development of bioremediation technology with the continuous advancement result shows that among the affecting factors of bioremediation technology efficiency biological species and their life activities play a very important role at present bioremediation technology exploration mainly focuses on these two aspects and on this basis further explore or optimize high quality biological models by other means to solve the limitations of bioremediation 6 30 with the continuous exploration and optimization of bioremediation it has been possible to treat landfill leachate raw solution with biorefinery technology 12 33 this indicates that bioremediation has great potential to realize the green purification of landfill leachate hence this paper reviewed the research results of bioremediation applied to landfill leachate the landfill leachate toxicity mechanism and influencing factors of the existing bioremediation for landfill leachate treatment were summarized the goal of this article is to provides some reference experience for the further development of bioremediation in landfill leachate purification 2 toxicity of landfill leachate when landfills were active they can release many harmful substances different hazardous chemicals can permeate groundwater in the form of leachates or release hazardous pollutant particles in the form of gases with extremely high toxicological potential for soil groundwater and surface water 36 37 for example the direct discharge of landfill leachate will lead to land compaction and salinization increase soil salinity and decrease soil quality 38 in the process of rainfall landfill leachate can enter groundwater and indirectly pollute water source and affect the growth of aquatic organisms 39 according to research the groundwater and surrounding soil in some areas were polluted and the polluted area can spread out at the speed of 1 km per year 40 the analysis of pollutant components in landfill leachate showed that agricultural insecticides such as isodieldrite dieldrin and aldrin had the highest content in the landfill leachate 5 this kind of poisonous substance has certain damage to human body nerve endocrine and viscera function 5 24 junior et al found out the biological toxicity of landfill leachate exposure of earthworms to landfill leachate would lead to a decrease in their reproductive capacity biomass and chronic toxicity 41 even if landfill leachate is only rich in trace amounts of heavy metals it exhibits more than one type of biotoxicity 42 in addition rainwater erosion makes it possible for pathogenic microorganisms from the garbage or environment to enter the landfill leachate on the one hand highly pathogenic microorganisms can cause human and animal diseases or infections on the other hand further studies showed that pathogens were more tolerant to different concentrations of landfill leachate than human cells 43 45 therefore in the process of landfill leachate production and concentration some pathogenic microorganisms were more likely to produce resistance genes which was not conducive to future microbial control in addition a new pollutant microplastics has been found in landfill leachate and identified as a potential host for antibiotic resistant microorganisms 46 47 therefore directly discharged landfill leachate can migrate to the environment through infiltration into groundwater and various harmful substances in landfill leachate can migrate long distance through groundwater and through the absorption of lower plants and animals into the food chain eventually harm the human body posing a threat to ecosystems and public health 25 43 48 reasonable management measures and effective landfill leachate purification process research were helpful to help human avoid unknown or potential risks fig 2 continuous exploration optimization and upgrading of landfill leachate technology to achieve green purification is of great significance to the human health and ecological health protection 3 existing research methods for landfill leachate nowadays there are four main treatment methods for collected and stored landfill leachate first directly discharged into the sewage treatment plant second joint treatment in the city sewage treatment plant after pretreatment third back spray treatment fourth independent sewage treatment system construction 12 however landfill leachate was not suitable to be directly mixed with municipal sewage because of its high concentration of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen meanwhile the establishment of independent treatment systems requires a large investment so the second and third treatment ways were often used 40 3 1 physicochemical method most of the existing municipal solid waste leachate pretreatment technologies or treatment technology were designed and applied based on the characteristics of municipal solid waste leachate such as high cod and bod complex composition of organic and inorganic substances high content of heavy metals and so on 44 50 at present physicochemical method was the most widely used treatment technology or pretreatment technologies which can well deal with the problem of large displacement high pollution concentration and has good condition stability the characteristics of different physicochemical methods are shown in table 2 advanced oxidation adsorption and ion exchange coagulation flocculation membrane filtration and other physical and chemical methods were common pretreatment technologies of landfill leachate 16 advanced oxidation methods aops commonly include ultraviolet uv aftab et al 2021 fenton ozone and electrochemical oxidation eo etc silva et al 2017 the combination of oxidant and catalyst in the solution can produce hydroxyl oh which can directly degrade landfill leachate organic matter or indirectly reduce the concentration and chroma of ammonia and nitrogen compounds through active substances 14 30 long response times high operating costs and low circulation were the major defect of aops methods adsorption ion exchange was also one of the commonly used pretreatment techniques for landfill leachate this technology mainly uses the surface specificity or porosity of adsorbent to adsorb pollutants from landfill leachate 51 the common adsorbents are activated carbon resin humic acid and other adsorbents 47 52 at the same time adsorbents can be regenerated through heating regeneration pharmaceutical regeneration and biological regeneration the method is easy to operate and simple to design but it is not sensitive to toxic substances at the same time the adsorption reaction was reversible under certain conditions so rely only on this technique can t be achieved the ideal result meanwhile membrane treatment technology was one of the most frequently used technologies in wastewater treatment due to the difference in membrane pore size it can be divided into microfiltration 0 02 10 μm ultrafiltration 0 001 0 02 μm reverse osmosis 0 0001 0 001 μm and nanofiltration 2 nm 48 this technology uses low energy consumption simple operation and does not require the use of chemicals and the desalination rate can reach 90 however problems such as high pressure scaling and blockage of pipelines often occur 53 to sum up the single processing technology often has low processing effect and the effective processing object was relatively single a combination of two or more technologies was often required in order to achieve the ideal purification effect the advantages of different technologies should be complementary among then a variety of technologies combined treatment to achieve efficient and green landfill leachate pollution reduction has become the main exploration direction 49 3 2 bioremediation method at present the removal of organic pollutants in landfill leachate mainly adopts physical and chemical methods after this kind of technology treatment the pollutants enriched in landfill leachate were greatly reduced this provides a good development space for bioremediation technology to become an effective combined treatment technology and makes it possible to further realize landfill leachate green purification the exploration and application of bioremediation technology can further reduce the problems of high energy consumption high cost and easy generation of tertiary pollutants in the existing treatment technology and further realize landfill leachate recovery and beneficial value resource utilization 33 at present bioremediation mainly includes microbial remediation phytoremediation and combined remediation the characteristics of different bioremediation are shown in table 2 it mainly uses the normal life activities and transport behavior of plants animals or microorganisms to accumulate degrade transform or adsorb environmental pollutants by form harmless products to supply their own life activities or stored in the body so as to reduce the concentration of toxic and harmful substances in the environment or make them harmless 18 in this purification process the organism itself functions as a bio accumulator and bio purifier for example in microorganisms heavy metals will be bio transformed or chelated to form heavy metal chelates or metal compounds to supply their own life activities or to be released in vitro as harmless secretions nowadays bioremediation technology especially microbial reactor method such as comprehensive adsorption combined bioreactor membrane filtration combined bioreactor superoxidation combined bioreactor and so on has gradually become an important part of landfill leachate pretreatment process and often used in combination with a variety of physical and chemical methods 26 in recent years many studies have shown that some plants and microorganisms can purify landfill leachate significantly and even achieve the primary treatment of landfill leachate stock solution bioremediation conforms to the green development trend of green and ecological and has far reaching significance for maintaining sustainable and healthy development therefore bioremediation technology has great potential in pure green purification of landfill leachate 4 application of bioremediation in landfill leachate purification 4 1 microbial remediation technology microorganisms degrade and purify pollutants mainly through normal life activities such as adsorption absorption and transformation the absorption process mainly utilizes the ability of microorganisms to degrade and accumulate pollutants in order to meet their own nutritional requirements or achieve accumulation the purification capacity of different bacteria varies mainly relying on degradable plasmids and spores adhesive ability refers to the ability of microorganisms to separate pollutants by using the binding capacity of surfaces and pollutants 46 traditional nitrification denitrification was one of the common microbial remediation methods the main principle is that bacteria oxidize ammonia to ammonia oxide and then convert it to nitrite no2 which is further converted to nitrate finally n2 was formed by denitrification in the absence of oxygen by heterotrophic bacteria however due to the complex composition of landfill leachate nitrification denitrification technology often needs to be improved to achieve higher deamination and denitrification effects among them the microbial purification mechanism and treatment conditions are effective exploration directions according to the types of microorganisms life activity traditional microbial remediation techniques can be divided into aerobic process and anaerobic process the specific differences are shown in table 3 at present denitrifying bacteria are widely distributed in bacteria archaea and fungi denitrifying bacteria supply energy mainly through the electrochemical gradient of cell membrane and convert no3 no2 and n2o to n2 in the cytoplasm to achieve nitrogen removal in this process ammonia nitrogen will be oxidized to no3 and organic carbon will be used as carbon source through denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal and organic matter degradation the types of terminal products of complete denitrification are closely related to their corresponding enzymes for example nitrate reductase nar for no3 nitrite reductase nir for no2 nitric oxide reductase nor for no and nitrous oxide reductase n2or for n2o there were two different types of nar which are categorized as a periplasmic reductase and b membrane bound reductase periplasmic reductase were found in proteobacteria while the membrane bound reductase were distributed in proteobacteria actinobacteria archaea etc in the anaerobic process according to the way of microbial nutrition it can be divided into autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in heterotrophic denitrification under anoxic conditions organic carbon from pollutants acts as an electron donor for heterotrophic bacteria driving the conversion of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen in the face of mature landfill leachate with high ammonia content and low chemical oxygen demand additional carbon sources are often required to prevent secondary pollutants caused by incomplete oxidation on the contrary in the process of autotrophic denitrification thiobacillus denitrificans and thiomicropira denitrificans and so on can use inorganic carbon elements or organic carbon sources together as growth carbon sources to achieve biosynthesis and biological growth through inorganic substances oxidation reduction reactions and nitrate or nitrite reduction reactions obtained energy supply the existing autotrophic denitrification can reduce the sludge production and the sludge treatment cost but there are also drawbacks such as the increase of solid solubility hardness and low alkalinity with the continuous advancement of research autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification combined technology can greatly shorten nitrification and denitrification process nh4 are oxidized to no2 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria and reduced to n2 by denitrifying bacteria among them the purification efficiency of this technology was affected by temperature dissolved oxygen sludge stagnation time ph and other factors and also inhibited by the concentration of free ammonia and nitrite according to the existing research when the free ammonia concentration is 0 1 1 mg l it has a certain inhibitory effect on nitrous oxide oxidizing bacteria while the free ammonia concentration is 10 150 mg l and the ph value is neutral or alkaline the anammox bacteria are mainly affected by nitrous acid the specific process is shown in fig 3 in the aerobic process aerobic methanogens and denitrifying bacteria were closely related to the nitrogen cycle and biogeochemical methane aerobic methane bacteria mainly include crenothrix polyspora filamentous aerobic methanotrophic g proteobacteria proteobacterial origin methylococcaceae 14 genera methylocystaceae 2 genera and beijerinckiaceae 3 genera acidimethylosilex fumarolicum solv methylokorus infernorum v4 methyloacida kamchatkensis kam1 and so on in this process aerobic methane bacteria mainly rely on ample oxygen and enzymes methanal dehydrogenase to convert methane into carbon dioxide the process was initiated by methane monooxygenase mmo where methanol is produced as an intermediate the produced methanol was oxidized by pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq dependent methanol dehydrogenase mdh to form formaldehyde further studies have shown that aerobic methanogenic bacteria with denitrification genes can assist the completion of nitrification which was closely related to the bacterial genotype for instance no3 to n2o was performed by methylobacter rundripaludum aerobic methanotrophic bacteria with narg and nirs genes followed by methylomonas methanica or methylomicrobium alcaliphilum aerobic methanotrophic bacteria with norb gene aerobic methanotrophic bacteria use methane as carbon source and energy supply and generate methanol acetate citrate polysaccharide protein and other intermediate metabolites as denitrifying bacteria electron donors to produce no3 and no2 among the industrial purification methods microbial reactor was a kind of biological purification technology commonly used to treat waste liquid or soil the purification effect is achieved by placing the contaminated soil in the reactor and using enzymes or organisms in the reactor to simulate the in vitro reaction of pollutants according to its principle and different types of microorganisms it is mainly divided into aerobic bioreactor and anaerobic bioreactor which is mainly used for organic matter degradation in landfill leachate 53 before aerobic bioreactor purification activated sludge containing high concentration of bacteria fungi and protozoa should be established in advance complete degradation of organic matter and denitrification can be achieved through continuous aeration of activated bacterial community however aerobic bioreactors require a high concentration of dissolved oxygen to achieve the purpose of nitrogen removal in contrast anaerobic bioreactors can decompose organic or inorganic substances without the need for oxygen molecules the common anaerobic bioreactor includes upstream anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expansive granular sludge blanket egsb reactor and anaerobic ammonium oxidation method for example anaerobic ammonia method anaerobic amine bacteria can convert ammonia electron donor and nitrite electron acceptor into nitrogen and use carbon dioxide as carbon source for growth so as to achieve the purpose of denitrification however it takes a long time has high temperature sensitivity and large error variation which leads to low working efficiency a variety of signal molecules and secondary metabolites were released during the remediation process so microbial diversity plays a key role in the detoxification process of metal containing industrial wastewater 20 as shown in table 4 climate the age of landfill leachate microbial genotype processing conditions and so on are effective reasons to affect purification efficiency in addition with the non selective catalytic activity of fungi extracellular enzymes gradually emerging fungi have become a potential tool for landfill leachate treatment now the endogenous fungi isolated from sewage have been successfully applied to sewage purification federica spina et al compared five endogenous fungi with strong biodegradation function including penicillium brevistica 793 pseudalish burgneri 721 pseudalish burgneri 1269 wood decay bacteria 1284 and flammulina velatus 1275 with five exogenous fungi it was found that wood rot fungus 1585 had better decolorization effect and exogenous fungi were also potential microbial repair materials 1 in addition acidophilic bacteria alkali producing bacteria bacillus mycobacterium pseudomonas and erythrococcus have been widely reported to play a positive role in repair and purification 4 2 phytoremediation technology phytoremediation technology has been an effective exploration direction of green restoration in recent years among which wetland has been gradually accepted and used as an effective method to regulate ecological stability and purify water quality 61 phytoremediation techniques purify contaminated land water and groundwater by using different pathways such as phytovolatilization phytodegradation phytoextraction rhizofiltration hyperaccumulator and so on fig 4 over the course of 500 million years of evolution plants have developed highly regulated mechanisms to mitigate toxicity some of these waste heavy metals such as zinc copper manganese nickel and cobalt were essential trace elements for plant growth 24 or through the unique and selective absorption transport and bioaccumulation of plant roots to achieve pollutant degradation and removal therefore phytoremediation combined with other methods were also commonly used phytoremediation efficiency was often affected by many factors such as plant type pollutant concentration composition accumulation decomposition site auxiliary methods and even the genotype of the same plant 52 table 6 at present the development and exploration directions of phytoremediation mainly include treatment condition exploration plant model screening model optimization method and repair mechanism etc the current plant screening models mainly include aquatic plants herbaceous plants and woody plants its growth cycle growth environment growth rate rhizosphere characteristics and nutritional characteristics were closely related to its purification efficiency 48 according to the existing research different types of plants have different ability to remove pollutants and different genotypes of the same plant have different purification efficiency table 6 it has been found that broad leaved compositae sunflower hemp and other plants were one of the efficient plant metal accumulators but their purification efficiency was closely related to the characteristics of plant types 9 by constructing small wetlands analyzed the pollutant degradation capacity of ten different types of aquatic plants such as phragmites communis cattail purple pine flower rush sea life flower and pinus among them calamus cattail bulrush small cattail and purple pine flower showed a high pollutant removal effect 62 in addition studies have shown that different genotypes of willow have different rhizosphere microbial distribution which can also induce different repair effects for example af was the main microorganism in j011genotype willow rhizosphere which achieve purification by promoting the increase of plant growth however ecm microorganisms were mainly enriched in the rhizosphere of j2345 genotypes willow and purification was mainly achieved by alleviating plant metal stress 6 although landfill leachate was nutrient rich prominent substrate conditions such as ph heavy metal content or salt content can inhibit or affect normal plant growth as shown in table 5 the maximum pollutants tolerance of different plants have certain differences such as heavy metals and ammonia nitrogen when the concentration of environmental pollutants was too high it will lead to the imbalance of soil nutrients inhibit the normal growth of plants and slow down or inhibit the plants purification efficiency therefore the establishment of accurate treatment conditions and vegetation cover model was helpful to maximize the efficiency of phytoremediation for example b endula and s caprea as alkali tolerant plants are suitable for higher alkaline landfill leachate purification while clematis vitalba and artemisia vulgaris are suitable for the purification of sodium rich landfill leachate 63 the proper concentration of landfill leachate treatment was one of the key factors to achieve the ideal purification efficiency zohaib abbas et al used different concentrations of raw landfill leachate to treat water hyacinth and water lily 64 when the concentration of landfill leachate was 50 or 75 the purification effect was better and without affecting the biomass growth 64 the ability of roots stems and leaves of different plants to accumulate heavy metals and degrade pollutants were different the accumulation effect of different parts of hibiscus on landfill leachate was further studied 4 compared with the medium the root system of hibiscus has higher absorption capacity to the heavy metals in the soil such as arsenic and iron and the cumulative amount can be as high as 87 91 4 however the repair efficiency will decrease when the concentration of landfill leachate exceeds the maximum tolerance limit of plants this is due to the high ammonia content lack of phosphorus resources high salinity and alkalinity of landfill leachate etc excessive landfill leachate irrigation results in soil nutrient imbalance and inhibits the normal growth and reproduction of plants 8 therefore the selection of appropriate landfill leachate treatment concentration was one of the key factors to achieve the ideal purification efficiency which can be screened by its migration factor mesquita et al studied the correlation between the optimal treatment concentration of leachate at different concentrations and heavy metal transport factors of elephant grass 65 it was found that heavy metals accumulated in the root of elephant grass but the transport factor was positively correlated with the optimal treatment concentration 66 in addition proper rhizotomy treatment can effectively increase the contents of amino acids and organic acids in plant rhizosphere exudates reduce ph value promote rhizosphere growth and enhance rhizosphere vitality which has been proved to be an effective auxiliary method 67 phytoremediation has a good function of promoting plant growth and improved good soil properties it can not only reduce heavy metal pollution in polluted soil but also enhance soil nutrients and enzyme activities improve degraded land and promote sustainable development of regional economy and society 68 therefore plants with super accumulation function were an efficient and low burden technical solution for landfill leachate remediation in the process of optimization and exploration of phytoremediation it is found that microorganisms play an important role in phytoremediation 4 3 microbial assisted phytoremediation microbial assisted phytoremediation technology was further developed on the basis of phytoremediation technology as shown in fig 5 compared with simple phytoremediation technology microbial assisted phytoremediation technology can better realize stress transfer and load capacity improvement by using the power of microorganisms 15 studies have shown that a good microbial assisted community was beneficial to promote the double improvement of plant purification ability and plant growth the roots stems and leaves of most plants were rich in a large number of endophytic bacteria and companion bacteria which coexist in a good symbiotic relationship 42 78 leila shadmani et al found that among the barley endophytes irrigated with landfill leachate alternans had the highest tolerance to cd and the maximum tolerance value could reach 2000 mg l 79 the presence of endophytic bacteria greatly improved barley s over storage capacity for cd 80 in addition the study shows that plant companion bacteria can promote plant growth and enhance plant stress resistance potential by controlling the production of growth hormone ferritin secondary metabolites and improving antioxidant enzyme system 65 79 strengthen or cooperate with plants to further absorb accumulate degrade and transform toxic and harmful substances in water air and soil 81 for example different chelates such as glutathione metallothionein and plant chelate can chelate heavy metals to achieve pollutant uptake and transfer through the xylem in vacuoles and cell walls 73 good plant endophytes can promote soil fertility and health reduced plant diseases improved crop toxic metals tolerance and enhanced plant nutrient uptake metal accumulation and efflux 74 fig 5 and table 7 at the same time microorganisms can also promote plant growth by controlling hormones and nutrient balance producing growth factors triggering plant pathogen resistance mobilization of nutrients development of extracellular polysaccharides and rhizobia etc so that plants can cope with adverse atmosphere 69 the efficiency of microbial assisted phytoremediation was closely related to the species metabolites abundance and function of plant associated bacteria table 7 82 in addition cadmium contamination in willow rhizosphere was correlated with the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb and mycorrhizal fungi 25 83 these results indicate that the abundance of beneficial bacteria in plants was one of the key factors of microbial assisted phytoremediation 84 at present naturally occurring endophytic bacteria and associated bacteria in plants generally have low content single species and low ability to assist plants 59 therefore inoculation technology has gradually become a key research direction to optimize the disadvantages of microbial assisted phytoremediation technology with the continuous exploration of technology studies have shown that when microorganisms were inoculated into the soil the total number of bacteria and biomass in the soil will increase and the change of soil properties can promote the recycling of mineral nutrients 69 effective microbial assistance can help plants overcome the disadvantages of high growing environment requirements slow growth and easy poisoning plant roots also help spread bacteria through the soil while plant derived secretions also further promoted bacterial biomass and activity 55 the increase of biomass helps to promote plants chlorophyll and protein enhancement in addition inoculation of auxiliary microorganisms can also promote the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduce the content of malondialdehyde so as to reduce the oxidative stress damage of plants under the stress of pollutants 64 meanwhile the metabolites generated by inoculated bacteria such as siderophore surfactants and organic acids are effective factors to improve the efficacy of phytoremediation iron was abundant in the soil but plants cannot absorb it directly siderophore was a necessary mineral nutrient for plant growth and auxiliary bacteria can produce siderophore to promote plant growth and serve as the iron nutrition material source for plants 82 in addition increased organic acids and acidification increase metal availability promote the release of cadmium zinc and copper from the soil increase the water soluble fraction and improve the soil s phosphorus and iron nutrient supply 85 studies have shown that microbial inoculum was positively correlated with soil phosphorus content and high phosphorus reserve can alleviate the moderate inhibitory effect of plant metals at the same time surfactant was a kind of complex active substance on the microorganism surface which was mainly produced by the cell or as a part of cell membrane the release of surfactant helps to reduce the soil water interfacial tension and fluid force promote the resolution of metals and flow to the soil solution in addition biofilm formation was also an effective bioremediation agent and bio stabilizer on the one hand rhizosphere microorganisms trap metals in spores and hyphae or sequester them in vacuoles this pathway can reduce the bioavailability of metals and increase the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the flow of some trace elements 86 on the other hand microorganisms can facilitate long distance transport of nutrients and trace elements through the formation of mycelium coat the existence of capillary channels between mycelium cell walls can also enhance the accumulation of rhizosphere cells rhizosphere microorganisms can promote mineral nutrition and water nutrition and alleviate the stress of pollutants 87 5 prospects and challenges of future bioremediation as people gradually pay more and more attention to green environmental protection pollutant remediation and recycling have become the focus of most industrial production at present 90 landfill leachate was the most important secondary pollutant produced in landfill the organisms used in bioremediation come from the natural ecology which is of great significance to protect the environment and soil fertility and improve land health bioremediation as a green remediation method can well alleviate the high cost and secondary pollution of products caused by traditional physical and chemical methods 71 91 it can also be combined with industrial treatment to become a more effective secondary treatment method or replace the traditional method to become a new in situ purification means 8 12 in addition biorefinery also has a certain potential of resource recovery which has a great development space for the recycling and utilization of valuable substances in landfill leachate 17 92 however although bioremediation is being gradually explored as an excellent means of pollution purification its shortcomings can t be ignored the results show that the repair rate of bioremediation was closely related to biological species repair mechanism and exposure conditions fig 6 phytoremediation is also a plants growth process the repair cycle may coincide with the growth cycle and may last for months or years 92 this was likely to result in local growth inhibition that limits purification capacity and rate 91 93 at the same time the sustainable and healthy growth of plants is closely related to environmental climate growth conditions and exposure conditions 94 plants with short growth cycles have shorter root systems plant based remediation systems cannot completely remove groundwater pollutants which greatly inhibits the remediation function of plants 95 and there is still a long way to truly become a first level remediation method for landfill leachate the future direction of exploration may mainly include the optimization and exploration of auxiliary methods and the potential threat of new pollutants on one hand with the further clarification of bioremediation mechanism bioremediation methods based on pollutant absorption degradation and recycling mechanism will be further developed in the future 81 however any new approach ultimately requires a deeper understanding of microbial activity and its phytoremediation mechanisms and interactions 30 96 among them genetic engineering was considered to be one of the effective methods to improve the degradation ability of microorganisms by gene editing of the strains strains with enhanced plant extraction characteristics can be generated to adapt to different types of contamination optimization of plant function by means of inoculation was an effective direction to promote microbial assisted phytoremediation continuous optimization but this development approach also has certain limitations 97 for example how plants can effectively distinguish infectious or favorable microorganisms achieve effective control of host microbe protection and further understanding of the genetic regulatory systems responsible for host microbe interactions 18 36 98 in addition many new auxiliary methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of bioremediation for example plants or microorganisms with good super storage capacity can be screened or cultured by plant tissue treatment genetic engineering chelating agent addition cell isolation bacterial inoculation electrical pretreatment magnetic field pretreatment and other methods 24 32 such as increasing plant growth by cutting or removing terminal buds or by exploring the genome databases of terrestrial plants and microorganisms for key transporters and regulatory proteins that were sensitive to toxic metals by regulating related genes it can promote the rapid growth of plants and improve the storage capacity of heavy metals besides since green environmental protection and sustainable development have been advocated many countries are slowly paying more attention to waste sorting and recycling which has effectively reduced the complexity of solid waste and its leachate on this basis bioremediation technology was a very good development direction therefore in order to realize different green recycling of landfill leachate the green diversified purification means of landfill leachate has become one of the key points of sustainable green development the further utilization and recovery of bioaccumulation is an effective exploration direction to realize the resource utilization of valuable materials in landfill leachate on the other hand new environmental pollutants can also be a potential risk affecting the effectiveness of bioremediation technologies in recent years microplastics as a new type of pollutant have received wide attention 46 in particular plastic products are the main type of solid waste with the extension of landfill time microplastics will continue to be produced and enriched in landfill leachate according to previous studies microplastics are easy to be trapped by plant rhizosphere or adsorbed by plant rhizosphere biofilm in the process of water migration and enriched in plant rhizosphere 99 this phenomenon will lead to changes in the abundance of rhizosphere flora and affect the normal life activities of plants in addition further studies have shown that microplastics have certain enrichment or adsorption effects on environmental pollutants 100 when microplastics subject to retention effects and it could lead to microplastic rich areas have higher pollutants concentrations 101 102 it will be a great challenge to the normal life activities of plants and the efficiency of repair microplastics effects on plants and rhizosphere communities as well as the enrichment distribution and concentration of pollutants pose great challenges to plants or microorganisms normal life activities and bioremediation efficiency assessment and prediction 103 6 conclusion bioremediation is a kind of pollution purification process based on the normal life activities of natural organisms compared with the traditional physicochemical method bioremediation is more in line with the development needs of green environmental protection and economy bioremediation is an effective and potential method for landfill leachate purification but there is still a lot of room for large scale application at present the limitations and trends of bioremediation mainly include the following aspects limitations of current bioremediation technology 1 lack of purification efficiency evaluation standard 2 biology confers limitations 3 the primary treatment model still needs to be explored development tendency of bioremediation technology 1 broaden biological tolerance 2 united technologies 3 diversified biological assemblage 4 standardized inspection standards 5 mechanism exploration 6 new pollutants potential risks 7 sustainable bio waste management to solve the limitations of bioremediation more new bioremediation technologies should be developed landfill leachate is a constantly evolving medium so the influence of internal processes and external factors on landfill leachate should be further studied and the future development trend of bioremediation technology mainly includes feasibility and sustainability in terms of feasibility internal conditions biological tolerance biological cycle biological growth characteristics etc and external influences landfill leachate characteristics social changes new pollutants potential risks etc should be given special consideration to strengthen the feasibility of the internal impact of bioremediation exploring efficient and diverse biological combinations applying mechanisms to implement auxiliary means and using scientific and technological means to improve biological tolerance are all considered as effective exploration methods in addition highly sensitive analytical techniques are effective means to improve the ability of bioremediation to cope with external risks moreover standardized assessment criteria combined with detailed level analysis can determine the best combination of bioremediation and select the best treatment conditions to treat different types of pollutants in terms of sustainability the sustainable development of bioremediation is also one of the important exploration trends sustainable waste management and recovery during bioremediation such as recycling aquatic plants into paper materials biochar and biogas can further improve the cost effectiveness and potential value of bioremediation declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest

12752,landfill leachate was the most important secondary pollutant produced by the traditional waste treatment landfill leachate has high complexity and biotoxicity and simultaneously soil and water were used as mediators for migration or penetration it has gradually become a potential threat to environmental safety and human health studies have shown that compared with existing physicochemical techniques bioremediation can achieve better green purification through normal natural life activities and natural behaviors of different organisms such as excessive storage degradation filtration extraction transformation etc this technology can meet the needs of normal life activities of different organisms and enrich green resources and it can realize recycling while green recycling of soil and water polluted by landfill leachate this kind of technology can effectively make up for the shortcomings of existing physical and chemical treatment methods and effectively reduced the high cost of landfill leachate and the generation of tertiary pollutants it is a more environmentally friendly and economical way to explore the green purification of landfill leachate graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bioremediation landfill leachate purification water treatment pollutant removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the process of rapid economic development an increasing amount of waste has become a key concern of environmental quality according to statistics china produced nearly 1 billion tons of garbage every year and it was growing at a rate of about 5 8 per year 1 3 nowadays landfill has become one of the most accepted treatment methods in most countries in the world due to its low operating cost high technical feasibility and convenient management 4 5 and landfill leachate was the main secondary pollution product of this method landfill leachate composition was affected by many factors such as garbage type age of landfill climate temperature and so on 6 high organic content of kitchen waste will lead to high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod for landfill leachate 7 8 at the same time industrial waste often carries a large number of heavy metals organic inorganic pollutants and even persistent organic pollutants pops 9 10 in addition drugs personal care products surfactants flame retardants pesticides nanomaterials and so on have gradually become new pollutants in landfill leachate 5 11 meanwhile due to the change of the age of the landfill site the composition of the landfill leachate will be further complicated table 1 12 14 this leads to different purification efficiency of landfill leachate in different stages treated by different technologies fig 1 these harmful landfill leachate will further migrate and enrich after being washed by precipitation and soaked in surface water and groundwater 1 15 16 at present physicochemical technology is the most widely used landfill leachate purification technology mainly relying on adsorption electrical neutralization adsorption neutralization precipitation flocculation aggregation and so on to achieve the evolution of harmful substances in wastewater 17 18 this kind of technology solves the landfill leachate very well meanwhile the existing physical and chemical treatment methods also have certain limitations such as the generation of tertiary pollutants 19 22 some studies have shown that landfill leachate may be a valuable resource pool and recycling its rich valuable resources such as heavy metals and organic matter can indirectly achieve green and low pollution in industrial production and consumption the green environmentally friendly treatment method has become the main exploration direction to reduce the potential risks of landfill leachate to the environment and human health 23 among them bioremediation was considered as a promising development direction bioremediation can selectively absorb complex compositions in landfill leachate by its own absorption synthesis transport and degradation capabilities 24 and these nutrients can be converted into biological growth and biomass thus recycling the valuable resources of landfill leachate such as heavy metals 25 26 at present landfill leachate bioremediation technology is still in an exploratory stage and the main exploration directions include screening of biological purification model optimization of treatment conditions mechanism composition and toxicity of landfill leachate etc among then microorganisms and plants were the main research objects of bioremediation 27 different organisms have different ways to purify different pollutants from landfill leachate for example different microorganisms mainly attach or absorb different heavy metals to achieve bioconversion or biosynthesis for purification purposes 28 29 these absorbed heavy metals will be degraded or synthesized into metal compounds plants mainly absorb heavy metals in the environment through roots and accumulate them in different parts such as roots and stems under the influence of translocation factors 19 in addition studies have gradually shown that microbial assisted phytoremediation technology can well optimize the shortcomings of simple microbial remediation or phytoremediation bacteria have proved to be very beneficial in phytoremediation by producing plant growth promoters organic acids polysaccharides etc 30 32 biological tolerance is an important issue in the development of bioremediation technology with the continuous advancement result shows that among the affecting factors of bioremediation technology efficiency biological species and their life activities play a very important role at present bioremediation technology exploration mainly focuses on these two aspects and on this basis further explore or optimize high quality biological models by other means to solve the limitations of bioremediation 6 30 with the continuous exploration and optimization of bioremediation it has been possible to treat landfill leachate raw solution with biorefinery technology 12 33 this indicates that bioremediation has great potential to realize the green purification of landfill leachate hence this paper reviewed the research results of bioremediation applied to landfill leachate the landfill leachate toxicity mechanism and influencing factors of the existing bioremediation for landfill leachate treatment were summarized the goal of this article is to provides some reference experience for the further development of bioremediation in landfill leachate purification 2 toxicity of landfill leachate when landfills were active they can release many harmful substances different hazardous chemicals can permeate groundwater in the form of leachates or release hazardous pollutant particles in the form of gases with extremely high toxicological potential for soil groundwater and surface water 36 37 for example the direct discharge of landfill leachate will lead to land compaction and salinization increase soil salinity and decrease soil quality 38 in the process of rainfall landfill leachate can enter groundwater and indirectly pollute water source and affect the growth of aquatic organisms 39 according to research the groundwater and surrounding soil in some areas were polluted and the polluted area can spread out at the speed of 1 km per year 40 the analysis of pollutant components in landfill leachate showed that agricultural insecticides such as isodieldrite dieldrin and aldrin had the highest content in the landfill leachate 5 this kind of poisonous substance has certain damage to human body nerve endocrine and viscera function 5 24 junior et al found out the biological toxicity of landfill leachate exposure of earthworms to landfill leachate would lead to a decrease in their reproductive capacity biomass and chronic toxicity 41 even if landfill leachate is only rich in trace amounts of heavy metals it exhibits more than one type of biotoxicity 42 in addition rainwater erosion makes it possible for pathogenic microorganisms from the garbage or environment to enter the landfill leachate on the one hand highly pathogenic microorganisms can cause human and animal diseases or infections on the other hand further studies showed that pathogens were more tolerant to different concentrations of landfill leachate than human cells 43 45 therefore in the process of landfill leachate production and concentration some pathogenic microorganisms were more likely to produce resistance genes which was not conducive to future microbial control in addition a new pollutant microplastics has been found in landfill leachate and identified as a potential host for antibiotic resistant microorganisms 46 47 therefore directly discharged landfill leachate can migrate to the environment through infiltration into groundwater and various harmful substances in landfill leachate can migrate long distance through groundwater and through the absorption of lower plants and animals into the food chain eventually harm the human body posing a threat to ecosystems and public health 25 43 48 reasonable management measures and effective landfill leachate purification process research were helpful to help human avoid unknown or potential risks fig 2 continuous exploration optimization and upgrading of landfill leachate technology to achieve green purification is of great significance to the human health and ecological health protection 3 existing research methods for landfill leachate nowadays there are four main treatment methods for collected and stored landfill leachate first directly discharged into the sewage treatment plant second joint treatment in the city sewage treatment plant after pretreatment third back spray treatment fourth independent sewage treatment system construction 12 however landfill leachate was not suitable to be directly mixed with municipal sewage because of its high concentration of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen meanwhile the establishment of independent treatment systems requires a large investment so the second and third treatment ways were often used 40 3 1 physicochemical method most of the existing municipal solid waste leachate pretreatment technologies or treatment technology were designed and applied based on the characteristics of municipal solid waste leachate such as high cod and bod complex composition of organic and inorganic substances high content of heavy metals and so on 44 50 at present physicochemical method was the most widely used treatment technology or pretreatment technologies which can well deal with the problem of large displacement high pollution concentration and has good condition stability the characteristics of different physicochemical methods are shown in table 2 advanced oxidation adsorption and ion exchange coagulation flocculation membrane filtration and other physical and chemical methods were common pretreatment technologies of landfill leachate 16 advanced oxidation methods aops commonly include ultraviolet uv aftab et al 2021 fenton ozone and electrochemical oxidation eo etc silva et al 2017 the combination of oxidant and catalyst in the solution can produce hydroxyl oh which can directly degrade landfill leachate organic matter or indirectly reduce the concentration and chroma of ammonia and nitrogen compounds through active substances 14 30 long response times high operating costs and low circulation were the major defect of aops methods adsorption ion exchange was also one of the commonly used pretreatment techniques for landfill leachate this technology mainly uses the surface specificity or porosity of adsorbent to adsorb pollutants from landfill leachate 51 the common adsorbents are activated carbon resin humic acid and other adsorbents 47 52 at the same time adsorbents can be regenerated through heating regeneration pharmaceutical regeneration and biological regeneration the method is easy to operate and simple to design but it is not sensitive to toxic substances at the same time the adsorption reaction was reversible under certain conditions so rely only on this technique can t be achieved the ideal result meanwhile membrane treatment technology was one of the most frequently used technologies in wastewater treatment due to the difference in membrane pore size it can be divided into microfiltration 0 02 10 μm ultrafiltration 0 001 0 02 μm reverse osmosis 0 0001 0 001 μm and nanofiltration 2 nm 48 this technology uses low energy consumption simple operation and does not require the use of chemicals and the desalination rate can reach 90 however problems such as high pressure scaling and blockage of pipelines often occur 53 to sum up the single processing technology often has low processing effect and the effective processing object was relatively single a combination of two or more technologies was often required in order to achieve the ideal purification effect the advantages of different technologies should be complementary among then a variety of technologies combined treatment to achieve efficient and green landfill leachate pollution reduction has become the main exploration direction 49 3 2 bioremediation method at present the removal of organic pollutants in landfill leachate mainly adopts physical and chemical methods after this kind of technology treatment the pollutants enriched in landfill leachate were greatly reduced this provides a good development space for bioremediation technology to become an effective combined treatment technology and makes it possible to further realize landfill leachate green purification the exploration and application of bioremediation technology can further reduce the problems of high energy consumption high cost and easy generation of tertiary pollutants in the existing treatment technology and further realize landfill leachate recovery and beneficial value resource utilization 33 at present bioremediation mainly includes microbial remediation phytoremediation and combined remediation the characteristics of different bioremediation are shown in table 2 it mainly uses the normal life activities and transport behavior of plants animals or microorganisms to accumulate degrade transform or adsorb environmental pollutants by form harmless products to supply their own life activities or stored in the body so as to reduce the concentration of toxic and harmful substances in the environment or make them harmless 18 in this purification process the organism itself functions as a bio accumulator and bio purifier for example in microorganisms heavy metals will be bio transformed or chelated to form heavy metal chelates or metal compounds to supply their own life activities or to be released in vitro as harmless secretions nowadays bioremediation technology especially microbial reactor method such as comprehensive adsorption combined bioreactor membrane filtration combined bioreactor superoxidation combined bioreactor and so on has gradually become an important part of landfill leachate pretreatment process and often used in combination with a variety of physical and chemical methods 26 in recent years many studies have shown that some plants and microorganisms can purify landfill leachate significantly and even achieve the primary treatment of landfill leachate stock solution bioremediation conforms to the green development trend of green and ecological and has far reaching significance for maintaining sustainable and healthy development therefore bioremediation technology has great potential in pure green purification of landfill leachate 4 application of bioremediation in landfill leachate purification 4 1 microbial remediation technology microorganisms degrade and purify pollutants mainly through normal life activities such as adsorption absorption and transformation the absorption process mainly utilizes the ability of microorganisms to degrade and accumulate pollutants in order to meet their own nutritional requirements or achieve accumulation the purification capacity of different bacteria varies mainly relying on degradable plasmids and spores adhesive ability refers to the ability of microorganisms to separate pollutants by using the binding capacity of surfaces and pollutants 46 traditional nitrification denitrification was one of the common microbial remediation methods the main principle is that bacteria oxidize ammonia to ammonia oxide and then convert it to nitrite no2 which is further converted to nitrate finally n2 was formed by denitrification in the absence of oxygen by heterotrophic bacteria however due to the complex composition of landfill leachate nitrification denitrification technology often needs to be improved to achieve higher deamination and denitrification effects among them the microbial purification mechanism and treatment conditions are effective exploration directions according to the types of microorganisms life activity traditional microbial remediation techniques can be divided into aerobic process and anaerobic process the specific differences are shown in table 3 at present denitrifying bacteria are widely distributed in bacteria archaea and fungi denitrifying bacteria supply energy mainly through the electrochemical gradient of cell membrane and convert no3 no2 and n2o to n2 in the cytoplasm to achieve nitrogen removal in this process ammonia nitrogen will be oxidized to no3 and organic carbon will be used as carbon source through denitrification to achieve nitrogen removal and organic matter degradation the types of terminal products of complete denitrification are closely related to their corresponding enzymes for example nitrate reductase nar for no3 nitrite reductase nir for no2 nitric oxide reductase nor for no and nitrous oxide reductase n2or for n2o there were two different types of nar which are categorized as a periplasmic reductase and b membrane bound reductase periplasmic reductase were found in proteobacteria while the membrane bound reductase were distributed in proteobacteria actinobacteria archaea etc in the anaerobic process according to the way of microbial nutrition it can be divided into autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification in heterotrophic denitrification under anoxic conditions organic carbon from pollutants acts as an electron donor for heterotrophic bacteria driving the conversion of nitrate and nitrite to nitrogen in the face of mature landfill leachate with high ammonia content and low chemical oxygen demand additional carbon sources are often required to prevent secondary pollutants caused by incomplete oxidation on the contrary in the process of autotrophic denitrification thiobacillus denitrificans and thiomicropira denitrificans and so on can use inorganic carbon elements or organic carbon sources together as growth carbon sources to achieve biosynthesis and biological growth through inorganic substances oxidation reduction reactions and nitrate or nitrite reduction reactions obtained energy supply the existing autotrophic denitrification can reduce the sludge production and the sludge treatment cost but there are also drawbacks such as the increase of solid solubility hardness and low alkalinity with the continuous advancement of research autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification combined technology can greatly shorten nitrification and denitrification process nh4 are oxidized to no2 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria and reduced to n2 by denitrifying bacteria among them the purification efficiency of this technology was affected by temperature dissolved oxygen sludge stagnation time ph and other factors and also inhibited by the concentration of free ammonia and nitrite according to the existing research when the free ammonia concentration is 0 1 1 mg l it has a certain inhibitory effect on nitrous oxide oxidizing bacteria while the free ammonia concentration is 10 150 mg l and the ph value is neutral or alkaline the anammox bacteria are mainly affected by nitrous acid the specific process is shown in fig 3 in the aerobic process aerobic methanogens and denitrifying bacteria were closely related to the nitrogen cycle and biogeochemical methane aerobic methane bacteria mainly include crenothrix polyspora filamentous aerobic methanotrophic g proteobacteria proteobacterial origin methylococcaceae 14 genera methylocystaceae 2 genera and beijerinckiaceae 3 genera acidimethylosilex fumarolicum solv methylokorus infernorum v4 methyloacida kamchatkensis kam1 and so on in this process aerobic methane bacteria mainly rely on ample oxygen and enzymes methanal dehydrogenase to convert methane into carbon dioxide the process was initiated by methane monooxygenase mmo where methanol is produced as an intermediate the produced methanol was oxidized by pyrroloquinoline quinone pqq dependent methanol dehydrogenase mdh to form formaldehyde further studies have shown that aerobic methanogenic bacteria with denitrification genes can assist the completion of nitrification which was closely related to the bacterial genotype for instance no3 to n2o was performed by methylobacter rundripaludum aerobic methanotrophic bacteria with narg and nirs genes followed by methylomonas methanica or methylomicrobium alcaliphilum aerobic methanotrophic bacteria with norb gene aerobic methanotrophic bacteria use methane as carbon source and energy supply and generate methanol acetate citrate polysaccharide protein and other intermediate metabolites as denitrifying bacteria electron donors to produce no3 and no2 among the industrial purification methods microbial reactor was a kind of biological purification technology commonly used to treat waste liquid or soil the purification effect is achieved by placing the contaminated soil in the reactor and using enzymes or organisms in the reactor to simulate the in vitro reaction of pollutants according to its principle and different types of microorganisms it is mainly divided into aerobic bioreactor and anaerobic bioreactor which is mainly used for organic matter degradation in landfill leachate 53 before aerobic bioreactor purification activated sludge containing high concentration of bacteria fungi and protozoa should be established in advance complete degradation of organic matter and denitrification can be achieved through continuous aeration of activated bacterial community however aerobic bioreactors require a high concentration of dissolved oxygen to achieve the purpose of nitrogen removal in contrast anaerobic bioreactors can decompose organic or inorganic substances without the need for oxygen molecules the common anaerobic bioreactor includes upstream anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expansive granular sludge blanket egsb reactor and anaerobic ammonium oxidation method for example anaerobic ammonia method anaerobic amine bacteria can convert ammonia electron donor and nitrite electron acceptor into nitrogen and use carbon dioxide as carbon source for growth so as to achieve the purpose of denitrification however it takes a long time has high temperature sensitivity and large error variation which leads to low working efficiency a variety of signal molecules and secondary metabolites were released during the remediation process so microbial diversity plays a key role in the detoxification process of metal containing industrial wastewater 20 as shown in table 4 climate the age of landfill leachate microbial genotype processing conditions and so on are effective reasons to affect purification efficiency in addition with the non selective catalytic activity of fungi extracellular enzymes gradually emerging fungi have become a potential tool for landfill leachate treatment now the endogenous fungi isolated from sewage have been successfully applied to sewage purification federica spina et al compared five endogenous fungi with strong biodegradation function including penicillium brevistica 793 pseudalish burgneri 721 pseudalish burgneri 1269 wood decay bacteria 1284 and flammulina velatus 1275 with five exogenous fungi it was found that wood rot fungus 1585 had better decolorization effect and exogenous fungi were also potential microbial repair materials 1 in addition acidophilic bacteria alkali producing bacteria bacillus mycobacterium pseudomonas and erythrococcus have been widely reported to play a positive role in repair and purification 4 2 phytoremediation technology phytoremediation technology has been an effective exploration direction of green restoration in recent years among which wetland has been gradually accepted and used as an effective method to regulate ecological stability and purify water quality 61 phytoremediation techniques purify contaminated land water and groundwater by using different pathways such as phytovolatilization phytodegradation phytoextraction rhizofiltration hyperaccumulator and so on fig 4 over the course of 500 million years of evolution plants have developed highly regulated mechanisms to mitigate toxicity some of these waste heavy metals such as zinc copper manganese nickel and cobalt were essential trace elements for plant growth 24 or through the unique and selective absorption transport and bioaccumulation of plant roots to achieve pollutant degradation and removal therefore phytoremediation combined with other methods were also commonly used phytoremediation efficiency was often affected by many factors such as plant type pollutant concentration composition accumulation decomposition site auxiliary methods and even the genotype of the same plant 52 table 6 at present the development and exploration directions of phytoremediation mainly include treatment condition exploration plant model screening model optimization method and repair mechanism etc the current plant screening models mainly include aquatic plants herbaceous plants and woody plants its growth cycle growth environment growth rate rhizosphere characteristics and nutritional characteristics were closely related to its purification efficiency 48 according to the existing research different types of plants have different ability to remove pollutants and different genotypes of the same plant have different purification efficiency table 6 it has been found that broad leaved compositae sunflower hemp and other plants were one of the efficient plant metal accumulators but their purification efficiency was closely related to the characteristics of plant types 9 by constructing small wetlands analyzed the pollutant degradation capacity of ten different types of aquatic plants such as phragmites communis cattail purple pine flower rush sea life flower and pinus among them calamus cattail bulrush small cattail and purple pine flower showed a high pollutant removal effect 62 in addition studies have shown that different genotypes of willow have different rhizosphere microbial distribution which can also induce different repair effects for example af was the main microorganism in j011genotype willow rhizosphere which achieve purification by promoting the increase of plant growth however ecm microorganisms were mainly enriched in the rhizosphere of j2345 genotypes willow and purification was mainly achieved by alleviating plant metal stress 6 although landfill leachate was nutrient rich prominent substrate conditions such as ph heavy metal content or salt content can inhibit or affect normal plant growth as shown in table 5 the maximum pollutants tolerance of different plants have certain differences such as heavy metals and ammonia nitrogen when the concentration of environmental pollutants was too high it will lead to the imbalance of soil nutrients inhibit the normal growth of plants and slow down or inhibit the plants purification efficiency therefore the establishment of accurate treatment conditions and vegetation cover model was helpful to maximize the efficiency of phytoremediation for example b endula and s caprea as alkali tolerant plants are suitable for higher alkaline landfill leachate purification while clematis vitalba and artemisia vulgaris are suitable for the purification of sodium rich landfill leachate 63 the proper concentration of landfill leachate treatment was one of the key factors to achieve the ideal purification efficiency zohaib abbas et al used different concentrations of raw landfill leachate to treat water hyacinth and water lily 64 when the concentration of landfill leachate was 50 or 75 the purification effect was better and without affecting the biomass growth 64 the ability of roots stems and leaves of different plants to accumulate heavy metals and degrade pollutants were different the accumulation effect of different parts of hibiscus on landfill leachate was further studied 4 compared with the medium the root system of hibiscus has higher absorption capacity to the heavy metals in the soil such as arsenic and iron and the cumulative amount can be as high as 87 91 4 however the repair efficiency will decrease when the concentration of landfill leachate exceeds the maximum tolerance limit of plants this is due to the high ammonia content lack of phosphorus resources high salinity and alkalinity of landfill leachate etc excessive landfill leachate irrigation results in soil nutrient imbalance and inhibits the normal growth and reproduction of plants 8 therefore the selection of appropriate landfill leachate treatment concentration was one of the key factors to achieve the ideal purification efficiency which can be screened by its migration factor mesquita et al studied the correlation between the optimal treatment concentration of leachate at different concentrations and heavy metal transport factors of elephant grass 65 it was found that heavy metals accumulated in the root of elephant grass but the transport factor was positively correlated with the optimal treatment concentration 66 in addition proper rhizotomy treatment can effectively increase the contents of amino acids and organic acids in plant rhizosphere exudates reduce ph value promote rhizosphere growth and enhance rhizosphere vitality which has been proved to be an effective auxiliary method 67 phytoremediation has a good function of promoting plant growth and improved good soil properties it can not only reduce heavy metal pollution in polluted soil but also enhance soil nutrients and enzyme activities improve degraded land and promote sustainable development of regional economy and society 68 therefore plants with super accumulation function were an efficient and low burden technical solution for landfill leachate remediation in the process of optimization and exploration of phytoremediation it is found that microorganisms play an important role in phytoremediation 4 3 microbial assisted phytoremediation microbial assisted phytoremediation technology was further developed on the basis of phytoremediation technology as shown in fig 5 compared with simple phytoremediation technology microbial assisted phytoremediation technology can better realize stress transfer and load capacity improvement by using the power of microorganisms 15 studies have shown that a good microbial assisted community was beneficial to promote the double improvement of plant purification ability and plant growth the roots stems and leaves of most plants were rich in a large number of endophytic bacteria and companion bacteria which coexist in a good symbiotic relationship 42 78 leila shadmani et al found that among the barley endophytes irrigated with landfill leachate alternans had the highest tolerance to cd and the maximum tolerance value could reach 2000 mg l 79 the presence of endophytic bacteria greatly improved barley s over storage capacity for cd 80 in addition the study shows that plant companion bacteria can promote plant growth and enhance plant stress resistance potential by controlling the production of growth hormone ferritin secondary metabolites and improving antioxidant enzyme system 65 79 strengthen or cooperate with plants to further absorb accumulate degrade and transform toxic and harmful substances in water air and soil 81 for example different chelates such as glutathione metallothionein and plant chelate can chelate heavy metals to achieve pollutant uptake and transfer through the xylem in vacuoles and cell walls 73 good plant endophytes can promote soil fertility and health reduced plant diseases improved crop toxic metals tolerance and enhanced plant nutrient uptake metal accumulation and efflux 74 fig 5 and table 7 at the same time microorganisms can also promote plant growth by controlling hormones and nutrient balance producing growth factors triggering plant pathogen resistance mobilization of nutrients development of extracellular polysaccharides and rhizobia etc so that plants can cope with adverse atmosphere 69 the efficiency of microbial assisted phytoremediation was closely related to the species metabolites abundance and function of plant associated bacteria table 7 82 in addition cadmium contamination in willow rhizosphere was correlated with the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as plant growth promoting bacteria pgpb and mycorrhizal fungi 25 83 these results indicate that the abundance of beneficial bacteria in plants was one of the key factors of microbial assisted phytoremediation 84 at present naturally occurring endophytic bacteria and associated bacteria in plants generally have low content single species and low ability to assist plants 59 therefore inoculation technology has gradually become a key research direction to optimize the disadvantages of microbial assisted phytoremediation technology with the continuous exploration of technology studies have shown that when microorganisms were inoculated into the soil the total number of bacteria and biomass in the soil will increase and the change of soil properties can promote the recycling of mineral nutrients 69 effective microbial assistance can help plants overcome the disadvantages of high growing environment requirements slow growth and easy poisoning plant roots also help spread bacteria through the soil while plant derived secretions also further promoted bacterial biomass and activity 55 the increase of biomass helps to promote plants chlorophyll and protein enhancement in addition inoculation of auxiliary microorganisms can also promote the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and reduce the content of malondialdehyde so as to reduce the oxidative stress damage of plants under the stress of pollutants 64 meanwhile the metabolites generated by inoculated bacteria such as siderophore surfactants and organic acids are effective factors to improve the efficacy of phytoremediation iron was abundant in the soil but plants cannot absorb it directly siderophore was a necessary mineral nutrient for plant growth and auxiliary bacteria can produce siderophore to promote plant growth and serve as the iron nutrition material source for plants 82 in addition increased organic acids and acidification increase metal availability promote the release of cadmium zinc and copper from the soil increase the water soluble fraction and improve the soil s phosphorus and iron nutrient supply 85 studies have shown that microbial inoculum was positively correlated with soil phosphorus content and high phosphorus reserve can alleviate the moderate inhibitory effect of plant metals at the same time surfactant was a kind of complex active substance on the microorganism surface which was mainly produced by the cell or as a part of cell membrane the release of surfactant helps to reduce the soil water interfacial tension and fluid force promote the resolution of metals and flow to the soil solution in addition biofilm formation was also an effective bioremediation agent and bio stabilizer on the one hand rhizosphere microorganisms trap metals in spores and hyphae or sequester them in vacuoles this pathway can reduce the bioavailability of metals and increase the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the flow of some trace elements 86 on the other hand microorganisms can facilitate long distance transport of nutrients and trace elements through the formation of mycelium coat the existence of capillary channels between mycelium cell walls can also enhance the accumulation of rhizosphere cells rhizosphere microorganisms can promote mineral nutrition and water nutrition and alleviate the stress of pollutants 87 5 prospects and challenges of future bioremediation as people gradually pay more and more attention to green environmental protection pollutant remediation and recycling have become the focus of most industrial production at present 90 landfill leachate was the most important secondary pollutant produced in landfill the organisms used in bioremediation come from the natural ecology which is of great significance to protect the environment and soil fertility and improve land health bioremediation as a green remediation method can well alleviate the high cost and secondary pollution of products caused by traditional physical and chemical methods 71 91 it can also be combined with industrial treatment to become a more effective secondary treatment method or replace the traditional method to become a new in situ purification means 8 12 in addition biorefinery also has a certain potential of resource recovery which has a great development space for the recycling and utilization of valuable substances in landfill leachate 17 92 however although bioremediation is being gradually explored as an excellent means of pollution purification its shortcomings can t be ignored the results show that the repair rate of bioremediation was closely related to biological species repair mechanism and exposure conditions fig 6 phytoremediation is also a plants growth process the repair cycle may coincide with the growth cycle and may last for months or years 92 this was likely to result in local growth inhibition that limits purification capacity and rate 91 93 at the same time the sustainable and healthy growth of plants is closely related to environmental climate growth conditions and exposure conditions 94 plants with short growth cycles have shorter root systems plant based remediation systems cannot completely remove groundwater pollutants which greatly inhibits the remediation function of plants 95 and there is still a long way to truly become a first level remediation method for landfill leachate the future direction of exploration may mainly include the optimization and exploration of auxiliary methods and the potential threat of new pollutants on one hand with the further clarification of bioremediation mechanism bioremediation methods based on pollutant absorption degradation and recycling mechanism will be further developed in the future 81 however any new approach ultimately requires a deeper understanding of microbial activity and its phytoremediation mechanisms and interactions 30 96 among them genetic engineering was considered to be one of the effective methods to improve the degradation ability of microorganisms by gene editing of the strains strains with enhanced plant extraction characteristics can be generated to adapt to different types of contamination optimization of plant function by means of inoculation was an effective direction to promote microbial assisted phytoremediation continuous optimization but this development approach also has certain limitations 97 for example how plants can effectively distinguish infectious or favorable microorganisms achieve effective control of host microbe protection and further understanding of the genetic regulatory systems responsible for host microbe interactions 18 36 98 in addition many new auxiliary methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of bioremediation for example plants or microorganisms with good super storage capacity can be screened or cultured by plant tissue treatment genetic engineering chelating agent addition cell isolation bacterial inoculation electrical pretreatment magnetic field pretreatment and other methods 24 32 such as increasing plant growth by cutting or removing terminal buds or by exploring the genome databases of terrestrial plants and microorganisms for key transporters and regulatory proteins that were sensitive to toxic metals by regulating related genes it can promote the rapid growth of plants and improve the storage capacity of heavy metals besides since green environmental protection and sustainable development have been advocated many countries are slowly paying more attention to waste sorting and recycling which has effectively reduced the complexity of solid waste and its leachate on this basis bioremediation technology was a very good development direction therefore in order to realize different green recycling of landfill leachate the green diversified purification means of landfill leachate has become one of the key points of sustainable green development the further utilization and recovery of bioaccumulation is an effective exploration direction to realize the resource utilization of valuable materials in landfill leachate on the other hand new environmental pollutants can also be a potential risk affecting the effectiveness of bioremediation technologies in recent years microplastics as a new type of pollutant have received wide attention 46 in particular plastic products are the main type of solid waste with the extension of landfill time microplastics will continue to be produced and enriched in landfill leachate according to previous studies microplastics are easy to be trapped by plant rhizosphere or adsorbed by plant rhizosphere biofilm in the process of water migration and enriched in plant rhizosphere 99 this phenomenon will lead to changes in the abundance of rhizosphere flora and affect the normal life activities of plants in addition further studies have shown that microplastics have certain enrichment or adsorption effects on environmental pollutants 100 when microplastics subject to retention effects and it could lead to microplastic rich areas have higher pollutants concentrations 101 102 it will be a great challenge to the normal life activities of plants and the efficiency of repair microplastics effects on plants and rhizosphere communities as well as the enrichment distribution and concentration of pollutants pose great challenges to plants or microorganisms normal life activities and bioremediation efficiency assessment and prediction 103 6 conclusion bioremediation is a kind of pollution purification process based on the normal life activities of natural organisms compared with the traditional physicochemical method bioremediation is more in line with the development needs of green environmental protection and economy bioremediation is an effective and potential method for landfill leachate purification but there is still a lot of room for large scale application at present the limitations and trends of bioremediation mainly include the following aspects limitations of current bioremediation technology 1 lack of purification efficiency evaluation standard 2 biology confers limitations 3 the primary treatment model still needs to be explored development tendency of bioremediation technology 1 broaden biological tolerance 2 united technologies 3 diversified biological assemblage 4 standardized inspection standards 5 mechanism exploration 6 new pollutants potential risks 7 sustainable bio waste management to solve the limitations of bioremediation more new bioremediation technologies should be developed landfill leachate is a constantly evolving medium so the influence of internal processes and external factors on landfill leachate should be further studied and the future development trend of bioremediation technology mainly includes feasibility and sustainability in terms of feasibility internal conditions biological tolerance biological cycle biological growth characteristics etc and external influences landfill leachate characteristics social changes new pollutants potential risks etc should be given special consideration to strengthen the feasibility of the internal impact of bioremediation exploring efficient and diverse biological combinations applying mechanisms to implement auxiliary means and using scientific and technological means to improve biological tolerance are all considered as effective exploration methods in addition highly sensitive analytical techniques are effective means to improve the ability of bioremediation to cope with external risks moreover standardized assessment criteria combined with detailed level analysis can determine the best combination of bioremediation and select the best treatment conditions to treat different types of pollutants in terms of sustainability the sustainable development of bioremediation is also one of the important exploration trends sustainable waste management and recovery during bioremediation such as recycling aquatic plants into paper materials biochar and biogas can further improve the cost effectiveness and potential value of bioremediation declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest

12753,biofouling is a bottleneck in restricting ultrafiltration uf application for drinking water treatment in the present study we developed a simple rapid and cost effective modification approach for both anti bacterial and algal inhibition enhancement of the commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane the membrane surface was successively coated with tannic acid ta copper ion cu2 and ferric ion fe3 the introduction of ta was to reduce cu2 in situ to form copper nanoparticles cu0nps on the membrane for enhanced anti bacterial ability and to intensify the algal inhibition efficiency of the membrane as well as to increase the hydrophilicity of the coating layer in addition the ferric ion formed a coordinated complex compound with ta to enhance the stability of the coating layer the resultant membrane showed an excellent ability for simultaneous anti bacterial and algal inhibition performance with a 98 9 inactivation efficiency of escherichia coli a 96 9 inhibition efficacy of bacillus subtilis and a 100 extermination of microcystis aeruginosa without sacrificing the water flux at a molar ratio of 1 1 0 1 for ta cu fe the facile ta cu fe coating process with the intensified anti biofouling ability created in this study provides a promising membrane surface modification approach for practical applications which can be explored for further development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration biofouling anti bacteria algal inhibition hydrophilicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to population growth economic development and environmental pollution widespread water scarcity is becoming one of the main challenges around the world potable water is an important indispensable component of the water infrastructure in many cities to address water scarcity 1 membrane filtration technology particularly ultrafiltration uf with its excellent separation efficiency easy maintenance and low energy requirement 2 3 has played a critical role in producing highly purified water however a bottleneck that challenges uf application for the drinking water treatment is biofouling 4 6 since the microorganism species present in the influent readily colonize on the membrane surface to form a biofilm resulting in a significant increase of the filtration resistance 7 current studies on biofouling mainly focus on the fouling derived from bacteria 7 9 in reality microalgae are also one of the main microorganisms that could induce severe membrane fouling 10 11 in particular the microcystis widely found in algae laden water could grow on the membrane surface and produce serious biofouling since its small size is not usually effectively retained in the pretreatment of conventional drinking water treatment while the organic fouling induced by algae derived organic matter has been studied broadly 12 14 the associated research of biofouling especially its control with respect to low concentration microorganism proliferation are still lacking among all the biofouling control methods designing a membrane with anti biofouling properties is regarded as an urgent and useful manner that could inhibit the growth of microorganism in particular incorporation of metal and organic anti bacterial materials onto membrane surface is a promising strategy due to the strong anti bacterial ability of some specific metals 7 of all the anti microbial agents utilized silver nanoparticles agnps have been investigated extensively due to their excellent anti bacterial ability 8 15 16 however an intrinsic disadvantage of embedding silver into the membrane is the agglomeration of nanoparticles which can induce the formation of defects and thus further attenuate the membrane filtration performance 17 to avoid the aggregation researchers have adopted reducing materials to in situ form agnps onto the membrane surface 8 18 19 as a typical agent the mussel inspired polydopamine pda has been widely investigated as a result of its high hydrophilicity and strong adhesive properties to various substrates 8 9 20 21 although pda can in situ reduce silver ions to form uniformly dispersed agnps inside the coating layer 8 22 the deposition process of pda on the membrane surface is time consuming i e several to a dozen hours 8 23 other reducing materials either toxic solvents e g sodium borohydride 19 24 or high concentrations of reductants e g 10 vol ammonium hydroxide and 0 4 m formaldehyde 25 have also been adopted furthermore although agnps have better antimicrobial ability 7 the high cost of silver is not suitable for the extensive application in drinking water treatment therefore a rapid facile cost effective and environmentally friendly membrane fabrication approach that can be used for a sustainable application is greatly needed recently the coordination complexes of the natural polyphenol tannic acid ta and ferric ion fe3 have attracted researchers as they can provide a robust conformal coating within only a few minutes 26 at the same time the materials such as ta and ferric ions are inexpensive with enough availability 27 and also environmental friendliness 28 more importantly the plant producing phenolic acids such as ta have allelopathic inhibition to microalgae 29 31 and therefore ta can be adopted for coating uf membrane to enhance algal inhibition performance in terms of membrane anti bacterial ability copper with its much higher availability and lower cost as well as strong anti bacterial ability 32 33 is an attractive substitute for silver for membrane coating layer since ta possesses strong reducibility 34 the in situ reduction of copper by ta on the membrane surface becomes an option that can be developed for both anti bacterial and anti algae functionalities the objective of the present study is to develop a sustainable membrane modification technology that is simple and effective i e uf coating with combined ta cu fe to improve the anti fouling properties not only for anti bacterial functionalities but also for algal inhibition capabilities copper ion was immobilized by ta to an in situ form of cu nanoparticles cu0nps on uf membrane surface and ferric ion was employed to further strengthen the coating stabilities before detailed results are reported the materials and methodologies are presented below 2 materials and methodologies 2 1 materials and chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane mwco 100 kda commercially available from sinap shanghai china were used as the original membrane for further modification in this study unless specified otherwise all chemicals were of analytical grades tannic acid ta and ferric chloride fecl3 purchased from macklin shanghai china and copper sulfate cuso4 obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china were adopted for membrane coating lb broth powder and agar powder acquired from sangon biotech shanghai china were used for bacterial cultivation 2 2 membrane coating based on prior relevant studies 34 35 the preparation procedures for the ta cu fe coating are illustrated with the schematic diagram shown in fig 1 a bare pvdf membrane coupon was first thoroughly rinsed and soaked in milli q water overnight afterward the membrane was placed in a custom designed container that only allowed the rejection layer to be exposed to the solution then 10 ml ta solution 10 m mol l 10 ml cuso4 solution 0 20 m mol l and 10 ml fecl3 solution 0 3 m mol l were added to the container successively with 30 s shaking when each solution was added to obtain a stable ta cu fe coating on uf membrane the solution ph was adjusted to 8 0 intentionally after that the container was placed in a 25 c water bath oscillator for 15 min to ensure the coating was evenly distributed on the uf membrane the resultant membrane was then rinsed thoroughly with milli q water to remove the unreacted residues before further testing 2 3 anti bacterial performance gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis cmcc b 63501 and gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc25922 were used as the model bacteria they were cultured to the stable stage with the lb nutrient solutions viable cells were quantified using the colony forming unit cfu method the anti bacterial abilities of the bare and the modified membranes were evaluated using the following method a membrane coupon with a surface area of 9 cm2 was placed in a glass culture dish and 200 μl solution with a bacteria concentration of 105 cfu ml was dripped on the membrane and then cultured for 2 h in a 37 c incubator after that 20 ml nacl solution with a concentration of 8 5 was used to elute the bacteria solution of the membrane surface then 100 μl elution was collected and coated on another glass dish with lb agar medium for additional 18 h culture also in the same 37 c incubator and the number of the resulting cfu was denoted as m to determine the anti microbial efficiency the bacteria solution without contacting with the membrane was also cultured at the same conditions with the final cfu noted as n thus the anti bacterial efficiency r can be calculated with eq 1 as 1 r n m n 100 2 4 algal inhibition test microcystis aeruginosa 905 m aeruginosa purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology in china fachb collection was used as the model algae for the inhibition test the microalgae biomass of m aeruginosa was determined via optical density at 680 nm wavelength following the calibration curve of c a 680 2 107 69 669 where c is the algae biomass and a 680 is the absorbance value the inhibition experiment procedure was as follows a membrane with a surface area of 19 cm2 was immersed in a blue algae solution with 1 000 000 cells per ml solution an improved bg11 solution was adopted to culture the algae solution in 8 h light and 16 h dark periodically in the 37 c incubator 36 the algae biomass at a certain culturing duration is noted as b for three replicates to determine the algal inhibition efficiency the algae solution without contact with the membrane was also cultivated at the same condition with the algae biomass denoted as d for three replicates thus the anti algae efficiency i of the membrane can be calculated with eq 2 as 2 i d b b 100 2 5 membrane flux test membrane permeate flux measurement was carried out using a cup type dead end filtration vessel under constant pressure mode which is described in our previous work in detail 37 specifically milli q water at a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa was filtered through the membrane with an effective surface area of 38 cm2 for at least 30 min to achieve a stable flux the pure water flux j was then determined by measuring the mass of the permeate water collected over a specified time interval according to eq 3 as 3 j m ρa t where m g is the permeate mass in the time interval of δt h ρ g l is the permeate density and a m2 is the effective membrane surface area in the present study the pure water flux j 0 of the original pvdf membrane at the 0 1 m pa pressure was 445 l m2 h the specific flux j j 0 was utilized to evaluate the performance of the modified membrane where j is the membrane flux after coating 2 6 membrane stability assessment the leakage concentration and load concentration of copper elements and iron ions from the membrane surface were used to evaluate the stability of the modified membranes the copper iron seepage concentration was determined as follows a sample of the modified membrane with a surface area of 1 cm2 was immersed in 20 ml milli q water and then fixed on a shaker for 24 72 h at a speed of 200 rpm after that the membrane was taken out and the soaking solution was then acidized with 1 hno3 to determine the seepage concentration of cu2 c m in g cm2 via inductively coupled plasma icp measurement icap rq thermo fisher to determine the copper iron load the modified membrane with a surface area of 1 cm2 was submerged in 20 ml hno3 solution with a concentration of 1 and placed on a shaker also for 24 h shaking at a speed of 200 rpm for a complete eluting of the metal ions by hno3 then the membrane was taken out and the copper iron load concentration c b in g cm2 was determined by measuring the copper ion concentrations in the eluate with icp in addition the influences of solution ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 ionic strength 1 and 10 mm nacl and dissolved organic compounds 5 mg l humic acid ha on membrane stability were also examined following the above test approach the stability of the modified membrane s thus can be computed with eq 4 as 4 s 1 c m c b 100 2 7 membrane surface characterization field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem lyra3 xmu was adopted to scan the membrane surface morphology according to a previously reported method 8 38 39 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi was used to perform elemental analysis on the membrane surface based on the method reported elsewhere 40 43 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50 was employed to analyze the surface functional groups of the membrane 44 45 furthermore a contact angle goniometer dsa30s was utilized to determine the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of both the original and the modified membranes 46 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of ta cu molar ratio on membrane anti bacterial and algae inhibition performance the optimization of ta and copper molar ratios in the absence of ferric ion on pvdf membrane modification in terms of anti microbial and algal inhibition abilities as well as water flux enhancement was first investigated fig 2 shows the anti bacterial efficacy with three replicates of the coating membranes with different molar ratios of ta and cu compared with the bare pvdf membrane ta0 cu0 the modified membrane has obvious anti bacterial effects on both gram positive b subtilis and gram negative e coli when the pvdf membrane was coated with only ta ta1 cu0 the anti bacterial efficiency was up to 70 which is consistent with a prior study showing ta had potential anti bacterial ability 47 the anti microbial capabilities of polyphenol derivatives including ta are ascribed to the phenolic groups 27 48 which can react with enzymes and or some essential elements of microorganisms or directly work as a microbial reactant through the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation 27 48 with the increased involvement of copper in the coating layer the anti bacterial ability of the modified membrane also improved as well specifically when the molar ratio of ta and copper was 1 0 25 ta1 cu0 25 the mortalities of e coli and b subtilis were 99 9 and 84 5 respectively it seems that copper was more effective for the inactivation of e coli which may be attributed to the thinner cell wall of the gram negative e coli than the gram positive b subtilis 49 for the ta cu molar ratio of 1 1 the inactivation ratios of the two types of bacteria were both over 99 which suggested that copper had very strong anti bacterial abilities although the biocidal property of copper has been recognized for a long history the exact anti bacterial mechanism of copper remains elusive nevertheless several mechanisms have been proposed it was suggested that copper increases the intracellular reactive oxygen species ros production causing oxidative stress and dna damage 50 51 in addition copper may also destroy the cell membrane to inactivate the bacteria 52 furthermore the continuous release of copper ions under wet conditions 53 that attach to the bacterial cell wall would enhance the anti bacterial activity this interaction thus could result in cell death through disrupting the cell membrane the m aeruginosa algal inhibition performance of the modified membranes is exhibited in fig 3 as compared with the control membrane ta0 cu0 the modified membrane with ta cu coating layer behaved much better in terms of algal inhibition abilities with a contact duration of 48 h the algal inhibition ratio of the modified membrane achieved 60 it should be noted that with different coating ratios of copper the algal inhibition ratios were similar which suggested that ta rather than copper played the key role in the inactivation of algae cells ta is a kind of phenolic acid which could induce the allelopathy and inhibition effect on algae cells 54 56 the existing studies indicate that the inactivation of blue algae by phenolic acids can be achieved through the following two mechanisms 1 phenolic acids could block electron transfer in algal photosynthetic systems and further influence the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate 29 57 58 and 2 autoxidation of the polyphenols produced radicals and induced fatal damage to algal cells and or metabolic pathways 29 30 59 in present study the algal inhibition efficiencies by ta intensified with the increased contact time with a contact time of 72 h the algal inhibition ratios were 96 6 99 0 for all the modified membranes while they were even up to 100 with a longer contact time of 96 h 3 2 effect of ta cu molar ratio on membrane flux performance the pure water flux of the ta cu modified membranes is shown in fig 4 as compared with the original pvdf membrane the modified membrane with only ta coating had an additional 30 higher water flux which is consistent with the study of yan et al 60 that shows ta coating could enhance the membrane flux due to the improved hydrophilicity as a result of the phenolic hydroxyl function groups however increased copper content led to a decreased water flux when the molar ratios of ta and copper in the coating layer were 1 1 and 1 2 the water fluxes of the modified membranes were comparable to the original control pvdf membrane i e 110 and 103 of that of the uncoated membrane respectively which was probably due to the increased filtration resistance with the introduction of cu0nps in the coating layer restricting the water pathways in order to balance both anti bacterial and algal inhibition abilities and water flux enhancement the ta cu molar ratio of 1 1 was adopted in the following studies 3 3 effect of ferric ion concentration on membrane stability flux and anti biofouling performance to enhance the stability of the coating layer of the above modified membranes the involvement of ferric ion in the coating layer was further examined fig 5 shows the stability in terms of the leakage concentration as defined in section 2 6 and the water flux of the modified membranes coating with different molar ratios of ferric ions from the ta1 cu1 membranes at the molar ratio of 1 1 0 of ta cu fe no addition of fe a moderate stability of copper is obtained the stability of the modified membranes improved with more ferric ion introduced in the coating layer which was probably ascribed to the phenolic hydroxyl function groups in ta that could provide free electrons for fe3 to form complex compounds for a strong stable and compacted structure 26 61 further avoiding the leakage of the copper however the water flux was significantly affected with the introduction of ferric ions i e the water flux fell from 110 to 75 of the original pvdf membrane with a total of over 30 flux loss when the molar ratio of ta cu fe changed from 1 1 0 to 1 1 0 3 which was probably due to the thick ta fe layer on the membrane surface constraining the water pathway and thus reducing the water flux thus the stability of the modified membrane with the introduction of ferric ion was enhanced at the sacrifice of the water flux to balance both stability and water flux the molar ratio of 1 1 0 1 ta1 cu1 fe0 1 was selected as an optimized value at which the modified membrane had a stability of 84 5 and a similar water flux as the original pvdf membrane for anti microbial and algal inactivation performance as shown in fig 6 the coupled ta1 cu1 fe0 1 coating membrane exhibited a 98 9 inactivation efficiency of e coli a 96 9 inhibition efficacy of b subtilis and a 100 extermination of m aeruginosa at a contact time of 96 h suggesting a very good anti biofouling ability it is worth noting that the stable ta cu fe coating layer was prepared at ph 8 0 while the typical ph in drinking water source is in the range of 6 5 8 5 62 to achieve a better understanding of metallic release from membrane matrix we further examined the stability of copper elements as well as ferric ions at various ph values as shown in fig 7a b shifting solution ph from 6 5 to 8 5 led to slightly increased stability of both cu and fe compounds which was ascribed to the fact that the increased alkaline environment was more favored to coordinate ta and fe3 thus effectively immobilizing metal elements ions in the coating layer 26 at all examined ph solutions ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 the modified membrane can maintain its reasonably satisfied stability i e 73 for cu elements and 75 for fe ions without more significant leakage at extended test period from 24 to 72 h in addition the water resource generally contains dissolved compounds ions to cater for the actual condition we also investigated the role of ionic strength and dissolved organics on membrane stability as shown in fig 8 limited decrease of membrane stability 4 6 was observed after adding nacl 1 and 10 mm to milli q water further dosing 5 mg l ha to 10 mm nacl solution merely led to additional 3 leakage of cu elements despite that the interaction between dissolved compounds ions and membrane may compete with the attachment of cu fe ta on the membrane the complexation of ta fe can provide a robust conformal coating onto the substrate 26 that could effectively prevent substantial seepage of cu fe elements from the membrane active layer 3 4 membrane characterization the surface properties of a membrane play an important part in the anti biomass performance 7 in order to determine the impact of the coating layer in this work on the membrane surface morphology and chemical characteristics the sem images of the original control pvdf and the modified membrane with the ta cu fe molar ratio of 1 1 0 1 were examined with the results illustrated in fig 9 as a result of the deposition of the coating layer on the membrane surface the modified membrane presents fewer number of membrane pores compared to the bare pvdf membrane further leading to the increase of the filtration resistance and the reduction of permeate flux fig 5 to determine the chemical characteristics of the modified membrane the xps measurement was conducted to investigate the components of the membrane surface as shown in fig 10a there were mainly two peaks i e c1s and f1s of the original pvdf membrane while there was an additional peak of o1s the intensity of the f1s peak strongly reduced and the intensity of the c1s peak slightly increased in the modified ta cu fe membrane the peaks of the binding energies of 932 6 and 953 3 ev in the high resolution cu2p spectra of the modified membrane fig 10b indicated the existence of copper element 63 suggesting the formation of cu0nps on the modified membrane surface the c1s peaks in the high resolution spectra of the bare membrane and the modified membrane in the xps measurement are shown in fig 8c and d respectively the characteristic peaks of the carbon chemical bonds changed as well i e the bonding energies for ch cc and cf of the original pvdf membrane were 283 9 285 9 and 290 4 ev respectively 64 65 while the appearance of the co and the aromatic cc bonds at the binding energies of 288 6 and 284 6 ev which are the characteristic peaks of ta suggested the successful coating of ta onto the pvdf membrane surface 66 the ftir spectra of the membrane before and after modifications are shown in fig 11 the bare pvdf membrane has obvious absorbance peaks at 1400 and 1169 cm 1 which were ch and cf stretching vibration absorption peaks of pvdf membranes respectively 67 68 compared with the original pvdf membrane the ta cu fe modified membrane had new peaks at 3455 1722 and 1601 cm 1 with the first two for oh and co stretching vibration absorption peaks and the remaining one for characteristic absorbance peaks of benzene rings ta has all these absorbance peaks thus this demonstrated that ta was successfully coated onto the membrane surface which was consistent with xps measurement fig 10 the existence of ta and copper enabled the anti bacterial and algal inhibition abilities of the modified membranes 49 fig 12 shows the contact angles of the pvdf membranes before and after coating the average contact angle of the original pvdf membrane was approximately 71 while it reduced to 40 after the ta cu fe modification which agrees with the previous study that showed the phenolic hydroxyl groups of ta could enhance the hydrophilicity of the membranes 69 the increase in the hydrophilicity raised the permeability of the membrane which compensated for the water flux drop induced by the introduction of the coating layer therefore the modified membrane had an improved anti biofouling ability without the sacrifice of the water flux 4 implications and conclusions for the first time we report a novel simple and facile method to modify pvdf uf membrane to improve anti biofouling ability the introduction of ta in the coating layer enhanced the membrane anti algae performance and strengthened the membrane hydrophilicity for an intensified water flux while cu was immobilized by ta for an enhanced anti bacterial property the involvement of ferric ion generated a strong complex compound to reinforce the stabilities of the modified membranes as compared with time consuming decoration e g pda 8 23 toxic solvents utilization e g sodium borohydride 19 24 and high cost materials e g silver 24 34 that are commonly adopted in membrane modification process the ta cu fe coating is rapid 15 min green plant derived and cost effective in addition the convenient availability of ta copper ion and ferric ion as well as the facile coating enables a sustainable membrane modification technique that can be easily scaled up for the real application unlike previous studies for anti biofouling only in consideration of the inactivation of the bacterium a distinct feature of this study is that the resultant membrane can simultaneously possess the functionalities of not only anti bacterium but also anti algae when the molar ratio of ta cu fe was 1 1 0 1 the modified pvdf membrane exhibited a 98 9 inactivation efficiency of e coli a 96 9 inhibition efficacy of b subtilis and a 100 extermination of algal species m aeruginosa at a contact time of 96 h without sacrificing the water flux thus the present study provides an effective modification technology that can be developed in a sustainable application for anti biofouling capability of drinking water treatment however it should be mentioned that the original pvdf membrane adopted in this study is flat sheet while most commercial membranes used in real water treatment are hollow fibres unlike flat sheet membranes the surfaces of hollow fibres are cambered therefore the anti biofouling effects of hollow fibre membranes with ta cu fe coating need to be carefully examined before implementation in the future in addition the leach of copper from the coating layer is an unignorable issue thus the associated long term stability of the coating layer and the possibility of recoating would require further investigation which shall be also explored

12753,biofouling is a bottleneck in restricting ultrafiltration uf application for drinking water treatment in the present study we developed a simple rapid and cost effective modification approach for both anti bacterial and algal inhibition enhancement of the commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane the membrane surface was successively coated with tannic acid ta copper ion cu2 and ferric ion fe3 the introduction of ta was to reduce cu2 in situ to form copper nanoparticles cu0nps on the membrane for enhanced anti bacterial ability and to intensify the algal inhibition efficiency of the membrane as well as to increase the hydrophilicity of the coating layer in addition the ferric ion formed a coordinated complex compound with ta to enhance the stability of the coating layer the resultant membrane showed an excellent ability for simultaneous anti bacterial and algal inhibition performance with a 98 9 inactivation efficiency of escherichia coli a 96 9 inhibition efficacy of bacillus subtilis and a 100 extermination of microcystis aeruginosa without sacrificing the water flux at a molar ratio of 1 1 0 1 for ta cu fe the facile ta cu fe coating process with the intensified anti biofouling ability created in this study provides a promising membrane surface modification approach for practical applications which can be explored for further development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration biofouling anti bacteria algal inhibition hydrophilicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to population growth economic development and environmental pollution widespread water scarcity is becoming one of the main challenges around the world potable water is an important indispensable component of the water infrastructure in many cities to address water scarcity 1 membrane filtration technology particularly ultrafiltration uf with its excellent separation efficiency easy maintenance and low energy requirement 2 3 has played a critical role in producing highly purified water however a bottleneck that challenges uf application for the drinking water treatment is biofouling 4 6 since the microorganism species present in the influent readily colonize on the membrane surface to form a biofilm resulting in a significant increase of the filtration resistance 7 current studies on biofouling mainly focus on the fouling derived from bacteria 7 9 in reality microalgae are also one of the main microorganisms that could induce severe membrane fouling 10 11 in particular the microcystis widely found in algae laden water could grow on the membrane surface and produce serious biofouling since its small size is not usually effectively retained in the pretreatment of conventional drinking water treatment while the organic fouling induced by algae derived organic matter has been studied broadly 12 14 the associated research of biofouling especially its control with respect to low concentration microorganism proliferation are still lacking among all the biofouling control methods designing a membrane with anti biofouling properties is regarded as an urgent and useful manner that could inhibit the growth of microorganism in particular incorporation of metal and organic anti bacterial materials onto membrane surface is a promising strategy due to the strong anti bacterial ability of some specific metals 7 of all the anti microbial agents utilized silver nanoparticles agnps have been investigated extensively due to their excellent anti bacterial ability 8 15 16 however an intrinsic disadvantage of embedding silver into the membrane is the agglomeration of nanoparticles which can induce the formation of defects and thus further attenuate the membrane filtration performance 17 to avoid the aggregation researchers have adopted reducing materials to in situ form agnps onto the membrane surface 8 18 19 as a typical agent the mussel inspired polydopamine pda has been widely investigated as a result of its high hydrophilicity and strong adhesive properties to various substrates 8 9 20 21 although pda can in situ reduce silver ions to form uniformly dispersed agnps inside the coating layer 8 22 the deposition process of pda on the membrane surface is time consuming i e several to a dozen hours 8 23 other reducing materials either toxic solvents e g sodium borohydride 19 24 or high concentrations of reductants e g 10 vol ammonium hydroxide and 0 4 m formaldehyde 25 have also been adopted furthermore although agnps have better antimicrobial ability 7 the high cost of silver is not suitable for the extensive application in drinking water treatment therefore a rapid facile cost effective and environmentally friendly membrane fabrication approach that can be used for a sustainable application is greatly needed recently the coordination complexes of the natural polyphenol tannic acid ta and ferric ion fe3 have attracted researchers as they can provide a robust conformal coating within only a few minutes 26 at the same time the materials such as ta and ferric ions are inexpensive with enough availability 27 and also environmental friendliness 28 more importantly the plant producing phenolic acids such as ta have allelopathic inhibition to microalgae 29 31 and therefore ta can be adopted for coating uf membrane to enhance algal inhibition performance in terms of membrane anti bacterial ability copper with its much higher availability and lower cost as well as strong anti bacterial ability 32 33 is an attractive substitute for silver for membrane coating layer since ta possesses strong reducibility 34 the in situ reduction of copper by ta on the membrane surface becomes an option that can be developed for both anti bacterial and anti algae functionalities the objective of the present study is to develop a sustainable membrane modification technology that is simple and effective i e uf coating with combined ta cu fe to improve the anti fouling properties not only for anti bacterial functionalities but also for algal inhibition capabilities copper ion was immobilized by ta to an in situ form of cu nanoparticles cu0nps on uf membrane surface and ferric ion was employed to further strengthen the coating stabilities before detailed results are reported the materials and methodologies are presented below 2 materials and methodologies 2 1 materials and chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf uf membrane mwco 100 kda commercially available from sinap shanghai china were used as the original membrane for further modification in this study unless specified otherwise all chemicals were of analytical grades tannic acid ta and ferric chloride fecl3 purchased from macklin shanghai china and copper sulfate cuso4 obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china were adopted for membrane coating lb broth powder and agar powder acquired from sangon biotech shanghai china were used for bacterial cultivation 2 2 membrane coating based on prior relevant studies 34 35 the preparation procedures for the ta cu fe coating are illustrated with the schematic diagram shown in fig 1 a bare pvdf membrane coupon was first thoroughly rinsed and soaked in milli q water overnight afterward the membrane was placed in a custom designed container that only allowed the rejection layer to be exposed to the solution then 10 ml ta solution 10 m mol l 10 ml cuso4 solution 0 20 m mol l and 10 ml fecl3 solution 0 3 m mol l were added to the container successively with 30 s shaking when each solution was added to obtain a stable ta cu fe coating on uf membrane the solution ph was adjusted to 8 0 intentionally after that the container was placed in a 25 c water bath oscillator for 15 min to ensure the coating was evenly distributed on the uf membrane the resultant membrane was then rinsed thoroughly with milli q water to remove the unreacted residues before further testing 2 3 anti bacterial performance gram positive bacillus subtilis b subtilis cmcc b 63501 and gram negative escherichia coli e coli atcc25922 were used as the model bacteria they were cultured to the stable stage with the lb nutrient solutions viable cells were quantified using the colony forming unit cfu method the anti bacterial abilities of the bare and the modified membranes were evaluated using the following method a membrane coupon with a surface area of 9 cm2 was placed in a glass culture dish and 200 μl solution with a bacteria concentration of 105 cfu ml was dripped on the membrane and then cultured for 2 h in a 37 c incubator after that 20 ml nacl solution with a concentration of 8 5 was used to elute the bacteria solution of the membrane surface then 100 μl elution was collected and coated on another glass dish with lb agar medium for additional 18 h culture also in the same 37 c incubator and the number of the resulting cfu was denoted as m to determine the anti microbial efficiency the bacteria solution without contacting with the membrane was also cultured at the same conditions with the final cfu noted as n thus the anti bacterial efficiency r can be calculated with eq 1 as 1 r n m n 100 2 4 algal inhibition test microcystis aeruginosa 905 m aeruginosa purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology in china fachb collection was used as the model algae for the inhibition test the microalgae biomass of m aeruginosa was determined via optical density at 680 nm wavelength following the calibration curve of c a 680 2 107 69 669 where c is the algae biomass and a 680 is the absorbance value the inhibition experiment procedure was as follows a membrane with a surface area of 19 cm2 was immersed in a blue algae solution with 1 000 000 cells per ml solution an improved bg11 solution was adopted to culture the algae solution in 8 h light and 16 h dark periodically in the 37 c incubator 36 the algae biomass at a certain culturing duration is noted as b for three replicates to determine the algal inhibition efficiency the algae solution without contact with the membrane was also cultivated at the same condition with the algae biomass denoted as d for three replicates thus the anti algae efficiency i of the membrane can be calculated with eq 2 as 2 i d b b 100 2 5 membrane flux test membrane permeate flux measurement was carried out using a cup type dead end filtration vessel under constant pressure mode which is described in our previous work in detail 37 specifically milli q water at a constant pressure of 0 1 mpa was filtered through the membrane with an effective surface area of 38 cm2 for at least 30 min to achieve a stable flux the pure water flux j was then determined by measuring the mass of the permeate water collected over a specified time interval according to eq 3 as 3 j m ρa t where m g is the permeate mass in the time interval of δt h ρ g l is the permeate density and a m2 is the effective membrane surface area in the present study the pure water flux j 0 of the original pvdf membrane at the 0 1 m pa pressure was 445 l m2 h the specific flux j j 0 was utilized to evaluate the performance of the modified membrane where j is the membrane flux after coating 2 6 membrane stability assessment the leakage concentration and load concentration of copper elements and iron ions from the membrane surface were used to evaluate the stability of the modified membranes the copper iron seepage concentration was determined as follows a sample of the modified membrane with a surface area of 1 cm2 was immersed in 20 ml milli q water and then fixed on a shaker for 24 72 h at a speed of 200 rpm after that the membrane was taken out and the soaking solution was then acidized with 1 hno3 to determine the seepage concentration of cu2 c m in g cm2 via inductively coupled plasma icp measurement icap rq thermo fisher to determine the copper iron load the modified membrane with a surface area of 1 cm2 was submerged in 20 ml hno3 solution with a concentration of 1 and placed on a shaker also for 24 h shaking at a speed of 200 rpm for a complete eluting of the metal ions by hno3 then the membrane was taken out and the copper iron load concentration c b in g cm2 was determined by measuring the copper ion concentrations in the eluate with icp in addition the influences of solution ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 ionic strength 1 and 10 mm nacl and dissolved organic compounds 5 mg l humic acid ha on membrane stability were also examined following the above test approach the stability of the modified membrane s thus can be computed with eq 4 as 4 s 1 c m c b 100 2 7 membrane surface characterization field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem lyra3 xmu was adopted to scan the membrane surface morphology according to a previously reported method 8 38 39 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi was used to perform elemental analysis on the membrane surface based on the method reported elsewhere 40 43 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is50 was employed to analyze the surface functional groups of the membrane 44 45 furthermore a contact angle goniometer dsa30s was utilized to determine the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of both the original and the modified membranes 46 3 results and discussions 3

the aromatic cc bonds at the binding energies of 288 6 and 284 6 ev which are the characteristic peaks of ta suggested the successful coating of ta onto the pvdf membrane surface 66 the ftir spectra of the membrane before and after modifications are shown in fig 11 the bare pvdf membrane has obvious absorbance peaks at 1400 and 1169 cm 1 which were ch and cf stretching vibration absorption peaks of pvdf membranes respectively 67 68 compared with the original pvdf membrane the ta cu fe modified membrane had new peaks at 3455 1722 and 1601 cm 1 with the first two for oh and co stretching vibration absorption peaks and the remaining one for characteristic absorbance peaks of benzene rings ta has all these absorbance peaks thus this demonstrated that ta was successfully coated onto the membrane surface which was consistent with xps measurement fig 10 the existence of ta and copper enabled the anti bacterial and algal inhibition abilities of the modified membranes 49 fig 12 shows the contact angles of the pvdf membranes before and after coating the average contact angle of the original pvdf membrane was approximately 71 while it reduced to 40 after the ta cu fe modification which agrees with the previous study that showed the phenolic hydroxyl groups of ta could enhance the hydrophilicity of the membranes 69 the increase in the hydrophilicity raised the permeability of the membrane which compensated for the water flux drop induced by the introduction of the coating layer therefore the modified membrane had an improved anti biofouling ability without the sacrifice of the water flux 4 implications and conclusions for the first time we report a novel simple and facile method to modify pvdf uf membrane to improve anti biofouling ability the introduction of ta in the coating layer enhanced the membrane anti algae performance and strengthened the membrane hydrophilicity for an intensified water flux while cu was immobilized by ta for an enhanced anti bacterial property the involvement of ferric ion generated a strong complex compound to reinforce the stabilities of the modified membranes as compared with time consuming decoration e g pda 8 23 toxic solvents utilization e g sodium borohydride 19 24 and high cost materials e g silver 24 34 that are commonly adopted in membrane modification process the ta cu fe coating is rapid 15 min green plant derived and cost effective in addition the convenient availability of ta copper ion and ferric ion as well as the facile coating enables a sustainable membrane modification technique that can be easily scaled up for the real application unlike previous studies for anti biofouling only in consideration of the inactivation of the bacterium a distinct feature of this study is that the resultant membrane can simultaneously possess the functionalities of not only anti bacterium but also anti algae when the molar ratio of ta cu fe was 1 1 0 1 the modified pvdf membrane exhibited a 98 9 inactivation efficiency of e coli a 96 9 inhibition efficacy of b subtilis and a 100 extermination of algal species m aeruginosa at a contact time of 96 h without sacrificing the water flux thus the present study provides an effective modification technology that can be developed in a sustainable application for anti biofouling capability of drinking water treatment however it should be mentioned that the original pvdf membrane adopted in this study is flat sheet while most commercial membranes used in real water treatment are hollow fibres unlike flat sheet membranes the surfaces of hollow fibres are cambered therefore the anti biofouling effects of hollow fibre membranes with ta cu fe coating need to be carefully examined before implementation in the future in addition the leach of copper from the coating layer is an unignorable issue thus the associated long term stability of the coating layer and the possibility of recoating would require further investigation which shall be also explored

12754,this study reports the pollutant removal performance of unplanted planted tidal flow constructed wetlands with and without electrodes integration that received municipal wastewater the wetland

with electrodes integrated unplanted planted wetlands was dependent upon wastewater fill and contact periods variation nh4 n no3 n tn removal of the unplanted planted wetlands with or without electrodes relied upon the former operational factor the chemical composition of the stone dust media supported nutrient adsorption and microbial pollutant removal routes power density production of the electrodes integrated wetlands decreased during 3 h fill and 5 h wastewater contact periods when pollutant removal performance was higher the maximum power density produced across the electrodes integrated unplanted and planted wetlands was 113 and 147 mw m3 respectively graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption constructed wetlands microbial fuel cell nutrient organic tidal phases data availability data is available in the manuscript 1 introduction tidal flow constructed wetlands are intensified wastewater treatment systems that generate alternative wet and dry cycles to achieve microbial and chemical based pollutant removals 1 such recurring wet and dry cycles are achieved through the sequential wastewater fill contact drain and bed rest periods 2 the dry cycles draining bed rest periods allow substantial oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere into media pores to support aerobic pollutant removal routes 3 4 the wet cycles wastewater fill contact periods depend upon the utilization of the available oxygen from the previous dry cycle in the media pores because of limited oxygen diffusion in saturated media 5 hence an anaerobic gradient often develops inside the media during wet cycles that favor associated removal pathways media oriented chemical pollutant removal routes are also supported during wet cycles 6 the electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands emerged recently that achieve concurrent wastewater treatment and bioenergy production by sharing the operational mechanisms of normal without electrodes integration tidal flow wetlands and bio electrochemical technologies 7 the rhythmic wet and dry cycles support electrochemically inactive microbial and chemical pollutant removal routes oxidation of electrochemical based organic matter progresses around the anode electrode in the presence of an anaerobic environment 8 10 published literature indicates the application of alternative wastewater feeding approaches effluent recirculation different media and carbon addition to creating favorable conditions to boost chemical and microbial based pollutant removal pathways employing tidal flow constructed wetlands with and without electrodes integration 4 8 9 11 16 the ratio between wet and dry period cycles was also investigated to establish a balance between the development of recurring aerobic anaerobic environments and associated pollutant removal pathways 1 2 6 7 15 the optimal balance between wet and dry time ratio in such reported tidal flow based wetland studies was achieved primarily through altering the duration of two phases i e wastewater contact and bed rest periods contact periods ranging between 3 and 24 h and rest periods ranging between 1 and 16 h had been investigated to understand their impact on pollutant removals the other two phases i e wastewater fill and drain periods were not altered in these studies due to following rapid wastewater fill and discharge strategies 20 min tidal flow based wetlands performance also depends upon wastewater filling and draining periods as such phases control oxygen transmission rates inside the media pores li hu 5 designed normal tidal flow wetlands with longer wastewater filling time i e 36 h and observed rapid pollutant removal within 6 h of tidal cycle commencement that coincided with the filling duration phase such a reported trend reflects the necessity of designing an experimental protocol with tidal flow based systems with and without electrodes integration operated under variable wastewater fill and drain periods to identify their impact on pollutant removal integration of wastewater contact and bed rest periods variation with such a proposed protocol would identify the impact of each of the four phases on pollutant removal performance with tidal flow wetlands with and without electrodes integration but has not been investigated to date previous studies reported a positive combined impact of plants and electrodes to improve pollutant removal with tidal flow wetlands than parallel designed normal planted tidal flow systems i e without electrodes integration 15 17 integration of additional systems i e unplanted tidal flow wetlands with and without electrodes integration might reveal the individual impact of such wetland components i e plants and electrodes on pollutant removal performance when operated under variable operational tidal flow based conditions fill contact drain rest periods such experimental based evidence might allow better designing of tidal flow based wetlands to achieve better pollutant removals this study provides comparative pollutant removal from municipal wastewater performance assessment employing stone dust media based unplanted and planted tidal flow constructed wetlands with or without electrodes integration the tidal flow based wetlands were operated under variable wastewater fill drain time ratio wastewater contact and bed rest periods the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of plants electrodes integration and sequential phases of tidal based protocol variation on pollutant removal performances along with voltage and power density production with tidal flow based wetland systems 2 materials and method 2 1 wetland configuration four polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders were used to build constructed wetlands a1 a2 a3 and a4 at the university of asia pacific dhaka bangladesh the diameter and height of each constructed wetland were 0 15 and 0 91 m respectively the wetlands were filled with stone dust particles that achieved 0 82 m depth in each wetland unit the size and porosity of the stone dust were 0 5 4 9 mm and 32 respectively the stone dust media was overlaid and underlaid by large stones of 0 02 m depth for influent distribution inside the media and effluent drainage two aluminium plates were integrated as anode and cathode electrodes in the media of each of the a2 and a4 wetland units the dimension of a single electrode was 0 1 m 0 1 m the distance of the two electrodes in the a2 or a4 wetland unit was 0 2 m and was separated by glass wool thermal insulator foam the two electrodes of the a2 or a4 unit were connected by electrically insulated copper wires a 10 000 ω resistor and a multimeter canna indica species were planted in a3 and a4 wetland units the remaining two systems i e a1 and a2 were kept unplanted after the plantation the four systems were waterlogged with wastewater for 10 weeks to allow plant and biofilm growth inside the media depending on the structural configurations the four systems are designated as a1 unplanted wetland system 1 a2 unplanted microbial fuel cell wetland system 2 a3 planted wetland system 3 a4 planted microbial fuel cell wetland system 4 fig 1 provides an operational diagram of the four experimental wetland systems 2 2 wastewater dosing the wetland systems of this study received real municipal wastewater as influent for 36 weeks the first 6 weeks of hydraulic dosing allowed wetland systems adaptation to the municipal wastewater the experiment continued within the remaining 30 weeks the four constructed wetlands were operated following sequential wastewater fill contact drain bed rest protocols i e the tidal flow approach the experimental campaign commenced with 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol the dosing cycle started by applying 8 l of wastewater per day on the media surfaces of each wetland unit the pore spaces of the media were filled with 8 l of wastewater within 1 h defined as the fill period three wastewater contact periods were selected i e 20 10 and 5 h the experimental systems were operated for 5 weeks including 1 week of stabilization period with each of the selected contact periods resulting in 15 weeks sampling campaign under 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol after completing the defined contact period the retained wastewater was fully drained from the wetland systems within 3 h defined as the drain period after wastewater draining the wetlands were kept under the rest dry phase before the commencement of the next dosing cycle each of the four wetlands was subjected to dry periods of 4 h for 20 h contact period 14 h for 10 h contact period and 19 h for 5 h contact period per day the selected wastewater contact and bed rest periods with tidal flow based wetlands of this study coincided with previously reported ranges 1 2 6 7 15 the 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol was followed by a reversed wastewater filling draining strategy i e 3 h fill 1 h drain phase the media pore spaces of the four wetland units were filled with 8 l of wastewater within 3 h such filling duration was longer than the fill period i e 1 h of the previous fill drain phase but was shorter than that i e 36 h reported by li hu 5 with normal tidal flow wetlands similar contact periods i e 20 10 5 h and experimental duration i e 5 weeks for each contact period including 1 week of stabilization period of the previous fill drain phase were maintained the wastewater was fully drained within 1 h after the completion of each contact period the drying periods per day associated with each of the three contact periods during 3 h fill period were similar to 1 h fill phase wastewater fill contact and drain periods were controlled by pumping motors connected to digital time controllers table 1 summarizes the tidal based operational protocol employed with wetland systems of this study 2 3 wastewater samples analysis influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected weekly from the four unplanted unplanted microbial fuel cell planted and

samples analysis the nutrient nh4 n tp adsorption capacity of the unused fresh stone dust media was quantified according to the protocol described by zhu cui 18 and hsu lu 19 ammonium chloride nh4cl and potassium dihydrogen phosphate salts kh2po4 were used to prepare standard ammonium and phosphate solutions of 50 and 100 mg l concentrations respectively three grams of unused stone dust media and 20 ml of the prepared nh4 or p standard solution of 50 mg l concentration were transferred to a 50 ml polyethylene bottle a similar protocol was followed with nh4 or p standard solution of 100 mg l concentration two drops of chloroform were added to the media and standard solutions mixture to prevent microbial growth that might interfere with the chemical adsorption process the polyethylene bottles that contained nh4 or p standard solutions of 50 100 mg l concentration were shaken at a speed of 180 r min and 25 c temperature the supernatant produced in the polyethylene bottles during the shaking process was extracted at different intervals i e 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h using a 0 45 μm membrane the extracted samples were analyzed with a uv vis spectrophotometer to quantify nh4 n and p concentrations nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the unused used stone dust media was also measured after the termination of the experimental campaign the used stone dust media was collected from a1 a2 a3 a4 wetlands at 0 1 and 0 7 m depth measured from the media surface area the collected used media was analyzed following digestion distillation vanadomolybdo phosphoric yellow color methods to quantify nutrient concentration a detailed protocol of nutrient concentration measurement of the media has been described by saeed majed 20 the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis of the unused fresh used collected from the wetland systems after the termination of the experimental protocol stone dust material was conducted such an analysis aimed to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the media that often influence microbial based pollutant removal in wetland systems besides energy dispersive x ray analysis eds of the unused and used stone dust media was also undertaken to identify the influence of chemical components of the media in supporting chemical and microbial based pollutant removal pathways plants were harvested from a3 and a4 wetlands after the termination of the experimental campaign the objective of such harvesting was to assess the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissues as plant uptake contributes to wastewater nutrient removal in wetland systems 21 the harvested plants were divided into underground ug and aboveground ag portions and oven dried at 80 c temperature to achieve a constant dry weight dried ug and ag plant biomass were powdered nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the powdered biomass was measured by following digestion distillation and vanadomolybdo phosphoric yellow color protocols a detailed description of nutrient concentration analysis of plant tissues has been described by saeed and jihad miah 15 2 5 voltage current and power density the voltage production of the electrodes

concentration profiles table 2 summarizes the mean influent and effluent redox concentration profiles of a1 a2 a3 and a4 wetlands throughout the experimental campaign the mean effluent redox concentration values across all wetland systems were higher compared to the mean influent concentration values table 2 two way anova analysis supplementary material s1 indicated that the two variable factors i e plants or electrodes had a statistically insignificant impact p 0 05 on mean effluent redox profiles across all wetland systems the positive influence of plants in providing additional oxygen due to oxygen leakage from rhizosphere inside the media of free draining normal without electrodes and electrodes based constructed wetlands had been reported previously 20 22 the ability of tidal flow protocol to transfer atmospheric oxygen inside the media pores could have primarily contributed to effluent redox concentration increment with the tidal flow based wetlands of this study 1 5 and undermined the influence of plants in providing additional oxygen inside the bed matrix table 2 summarizes the mean influent and effluent redox concentration profiles of a1 a2 a3 and a4 wetlands throughout the experimental campaign the mean effluent redox concentration values across all wetland systems were higher compared to the mean influent concentration values table 2 two way anova analysis supplementary material s1 indicated that the two variable factors i e plants or electrodes had a statistically insignificant impact p 0 05 on mean effluent redox profiles across all wetland systems the positive influence of plants in providing additional oxygen due to oxygen leakage from rhizosphere inside the media of free draining normal without electrodes and electrodes based constructed wetlands had been reported previously 20 22 the ability of tidal flow protocol to transfer atmospheric oxygen inside the media pores could have primarily contributed to effluent redox concentration increment with the tidal flow based wetlands of this study 1 5 and undermined the influence of plants in providing additional oxygen inside the bed matrix 3 2 influence of plants on pollutant removal the mean influent effluent bod cod tkn nh4 n no3 n tn and tp concentration profiles measured throughout the experimental campaign across the four wetland systems are summarized in table 2 the mean influent effluent pollutant concentration differences across all wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by the t test supplementary material s1 the mean influent effluent bod cod tkn nh4 n no3 n tn and tp concentration profiles measured throughout the experimental campaign across the four wetland systems are summarized in table 2 the mean influent effluent pollutant concentration differences across all wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by the t test supplementary material s1 tidal flow constructed wetlands often boost aerobic organic removal ammonification organic nitrogen transformation to nh4 n and nitrification transformation of nh4 n to no2 n and finally to no3 n during bed rest and the initial phase of the wastewater contact period because of higher oxygen availability in media pore spaces contributed by the dry periods 1 6 15 rapid oxygen utilization by aerobic pathways during the initial part of the wastewater contact phase along with decreased oxygen transmission from the atmosphere to media due to a saturated environment diminishes oxygen availability inside the wetland media 5 therefore an anaerobic gradient develops in the bed matrix during the latter phase of the contact period that fosters the progression of the anaerobic based organic removal pathway and denitrification i e no3 n reduction to n2 gas 2 3 such aerobic and anaerobic removal routes could have contributed to influent organic and nitrogen removal in tidal flow wetlands of this study the mean effluent concentration of organic and nitrogen compounds across the planted a3 and a4 wetlands was beneath those of the unplanted a1 a2 systems table 2 two way anova analysis showed a significant impact p 0 05 of plants presence on the overall mean effluent organic nitrogen concentration across the wetland units post hoc comparison illustrated statistically significant p 0 05 mean effluent organic nitrogen concentration difference between wetland systems with and without plants although the contribution of plants in providing supplementary oxygen was not statistically evident section 3 1 plant roots support the growth of diverse microbial colonies around the rootzone 23 the presence of such microbial colonies might have allowed for achieving lower mean effluent organic and nitrogen concentration across the planted wetlands compared to unplanted units moreover root exudates of the planted wetlands could have provided carbon compounds to the denitrifiers to complete the classical denitrification route resulting in lower mean effluent no3 n and tn concentrations than those of the unplanted units 20 besides supplementing microbial based removal plants contribute to nutrient removal through uptake 23 table 3 summarizes nitrogen and phosphorus concentration g kg and accumulation percentage with respect to total removal in aboveground ag and underground ug biomass of canna indica plants in this study as observed in table 3 the nitrogen accumulation percentage was low i e 2 in ug ag plant biomass such lower nitrogen accumulation percentage further confirms the indirect influence of plants in producing lower effluent nitrogen concentration a similar trend was observed with plant based phosphorus removal performance the accumulation percentage was negligible i e 0 2 in ug ag plant tissues with respect to total phosphorus removal therefore significant influence p 0 05 of plants presence on producing lower mean effluent phosphorus concentration indicated by two way anova analysis compared to the unplanted systems or mean significant effluent phosphorus concentration differences p 0 05 between planted and unplanted wetlands systems indicated by the post hoc comparison could not be attributed to plant based phosphorus uptake it should be noted that constructed wetlands achieve incoming phosphorus removal primarily through media based adsorption 13 24 besides the integration of electrodes with constructed wetland systems improved phosphorus removal 20 the influence of these components along with the presence of plants on phosphorus removal is discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the mean influent effluent coliform number difference was statistically significant p 0 05 with all wetlands as illustrated by the t test two way anova analysis showed a statistically significant influence of plants p 0 05 on mean effluent coliform concentration across the wetland units post hoc tukey test indicated a significant mean effluent coliform number difference p 0 05 within the planted and unplanted wetland systems sedimentation filtration by media adsorption oxidation exposure to the toxin produced by microbial activities and biological predation contribute to coliform removal in subsurface flow constructed wetlands 25 26 the presence of plants additionally improves coliform removal in constructed wetlands because of filtration and organic compounds generation by plant roots that act as disinfectants 25 such supplementary contribution of plants could have improved coliform removal in the planted wetlands a3 a4 compared to those of unplanted systems a1 a2 3 3 influence of electrodes on pollutant removal better organic and nutrient removal was reported with free draining or upflow based microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands compared to parallel designed wetlands without electrodes 20 27 the coexistence of electrochemically active inactive microbial population and the occurrence of different removal mechanisms in the cathode anode compartments improved organic nutrient removal of the reported electrodes integrated wetlands 20 28 in this study the presence of electrodes had an insignificant impact p 0 05 indicated by two way anova on the mean effluent organic nutrient concentration of the tidal flow wetlands table 2 post hoc comparison signified statistically insignificant p 0 05 mean effluent organic nutrient concentration differences between the wetland systems with and without electrodes integration in fact the a4 wetland produced a mean effluent organic concentration slightly above table 2 that of the a3 system the organic biodegradation ratio of the municipal wastewater was 0 4 a ratio 0 5 indicates limited biodegradable organic compounds availability in wastewater that could have adversely influenced the progression of electrochemical organic matter oxidation with the planted microbial fuel cell wetland 28 moreover the decaying root biomass of such wetland might have additionally interfered with the progression of electrochemical organic matter oxidation 23 such a hypothesis is further supported by comparing the organic removal performance between the a2 and a1 wetlands table 2 the former system achieved a lower mean effluent organic concentration than the latter however the a4 wetland still achieved better organic removal performance than the a2 wetland indicating the necessity of plants presence with electrodes integrated constructed wetland systems on the other hand better organic removal of the a3 system could be linked to electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic removal routes that progressed during dry and wet periods respectively regarding nutrient removal the a4 wetland achieved the lowest mean effluent nutrient concentration followed by a3 a2 and a1 wetlands although the unplanted microbial fuel cell wetland achieved better nutrient removal than the unplanted system the influence of electrodes on achieving such performance could not be confirmed due to a lack of statistical support on the other hand the overall efficient nutrient removal performance of the planted microbial fuel cell wetland than the other systems elucidates the positive influence of plants on electrodes in supporting electrodes dependent microbial and chemical reactions and improving overall nutrient removal performance 29 similar phenomena were observed with planted electrodes integrated free draining wetlands compared to only planted systems 20 electrodes integration significantly influenced coliform removal p 0 05 with all tidal flow based wetlands as indicated by two way anova analysis post hoc tukey test specifies significant mean effluent coliform concentration differences p 0 05 between wetland systems with and without electrodes integration as such the lower mean effluent coliform concentration of the a2 and a4 wetlands compared to those of the a1 and a3 wetlands respectively could be attributed to the positive influence of electrodes on coliform mortality however the a3 wetland achieved better coliform removal performance than the a2 wetland signifying that the influence of plants on coliform mortality exceeded that of electrodes 3 4 media based removal media based adsorption often supports nutrient nh4 n and phosphorus removal in constructed wetlands 13 14 fig 2 signifies the nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust media with respect to contact periods exposure in standard nutrient solutions as observed in fig 2 the stone dust media of this study showed higher nutrient adsorption capacity within 3 h contact periods nutrient adsorption capacity decreased within contact periods 3 h due to reaching a saturation state the stone dust media showed higher nutrient adsorption capacity when the nutrient concentration of the standard solutions increased from 50 to 100 mg l presence of cations such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k and sodium na support media based nh4 n adsorption because of forming cation exchange sites on the media surface 30 31 on the other hand specific elements of the wetland media i e calcium ca aluminium al iron fe promote phosphorus removal through adsorption 24 eds analysis table 4 of the unused fresh and used stone dust media collected from the wetlands after experiment termination signifies the probable presence of the elements that favor nutrient media based adsorption in wetland systems and is confirmed by nutrient adsorption capacity analysis fig 2 the influence of the wetland media on nutrient removal is further assessed through table 5 that summarizes nutrient concentration profiles of the unused used media as observed in table 5 the nitrogen concentration of the used media collected at 0 1 and 0 7 m depths from the media surface decreased with all wetland units compared to unused stone dust media concentration profiles eds analysis table 4 also indicates a probable nitrogen percentage decrease with the used media of the four wetland systems compared to the unused media percentage profiles it should be noted that the unused stone dust media showed nh4 n adsorption characteristics fig 2 that should have increased nitrogen concentration with the used media over the unused media concentration profiles considering the trends of adsorption capacity fig 2 eds table 4 and media concentration table 5 analysis it could be stated that the incoming nh4 n or the nh4 n produced from the ammonification process inside the wetland systems was adsorbed by the media such adsorbed nh4 n was nitrified and denitrified by the attached biofilm on media surfaces during aerobic and anaerobic stages of the tidal flow cycle resulting in nitrogen concentration decrease with the used media eds analysis also indicates probable carbon composition of the unused stone dust media that decreased with the used media such probable carbon composition reduction could be attributed to carbon utilization by the denitrifiers and electrochemically active microbial population because of limited biodegradable organic compounds availability in the municipal wastewater as indicated by bod cod ratio 13 22 organic carbon availability from plant roots and completion of electrodes based nitrogen removal routes in the presence of plants might have additionally improved nitrogen removal performance with a3 a4 wetlands compared to a1 a2 systems 23 29 phosphorus concentration increased with the used media of all wetland units than the unused media concentration profiles table 5 eds analysis table 4 demonstrates a similar trend i e probable phosphorus percentage increment with the used media the results of eds table 4 concentration based table 5 analysis of the unused used media and adsorption capacity fig 2 of the unused media signify media based adsorption as the probable dominant phosphorus removal route in tidal flow wetlands efficient phosphorus removal in a3 and a4 wetlands particularly in the latter system table 2 enlightens the possible influence of electrodes in promoting diverse microbial growth that supplemented incoming phosphorus removal 27 the physical characteristics of the unused and used stone dust media were assessed through sem analysis the sem images fig 3 signify that the particles on the surface areas of the unused stone dust media were flattened however aggregates formation was observed on the surface areas of the used stone dust media collected from the wetland units after experimental termination probably due to the deposition of organic particles root fragments and biofilm formation 15 27 it was likely that microbial based pollutant removal existed in aerobic and anaerobic zones of such formed biolayer that primarily contributed to pollutant removal in the wetland systems of this study 3 5 wastewater filling draining periods effluent redox value within the four wetlands ranged between 111 and 114 mv during 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol and increased ranging between 167 and 182 mv during 3 h fill 1 h drain period such mean effluent redox value differences across each of the four wetland systems within the two fill drain periods were statistically significant p 0 05 as indicated by the t test the media of the four tidal flow based wetlands was completely saturated from bottom to top portion after 3 h during 3 h fill 1 h drain period that exceeded the required period i e 1 h to achieve complete media saturation during the reversed protocol i e 1 h fill 3 h drain period a longer wastewater filling period 3 h allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the bed matrix through the upper unsaturated media portion before achieving complete media saturation such diffusion replenished the oxygen consumed by the aerobic removal pathways in the saturated media portion and increased oxygen availability inside the media as the tidal flow based wetlands shifted towards complete media saturation wastewater contact phase when atmospheric oxygen diffusion is a limiting factor 3 6 on the other hand lower effluent redox value of the tidal flow based wetlands during 3 h drain period and opposite trends during a shorter drain period 1 h could be attributed to the dependency of tidal flow wetlands on oxygen diffusion rather than the passive oxygen pumping rate during drain periods 1 fig 4 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetland systems achieved during two wastewater fill drain periods the electrodes based wetlands a2 a4 achieved statistically significant bod removal percentage increment p 0 05 i e 10 12 during 3 h fill period compared to that of 1 h fill phase the a1 a3 wetlands without electrodes integration also achieved higher bod removal percentage 4 8 during the 3 h fill period than 1 h fill phase that was not statistically significant p 0 05 bod removal performance improvement with electrodes based wetlands during the 3 h fill period coincided with a statistically significant effluent redox profiles increment trend the operational performance of the electrodes based wetlands heavily depends upon maintaining the required stratified aerobic anoxic anaerobic redox gradient between the electrodes 32 it was likely that better oxygen distribution inside the bed matrix during 3 h fill period hindered the predominant anoxic anaerobic gradient development between the electrodes of microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetlands particularly during the wastewater contact period and supported organic removal via electrochemical oxidation pathway statistically insignificant p 0 05 removal bod performance of the unplanted planted wetlands without electrodes integration reflects bod removal independency upon fill drain time ratio variation electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic based removal pathways contribute to incoming organic compounds removal in the case of normal without electrodes tidal flow based wetlands during its continuous transition between aerobic and anaerobic environmental conditions 1 13 statistically significant nh4 n removal percentage increment p 0 05 i e 9 30 was observed with all wetland systems during 3 h fill period compared to the corresponding removal of the reversed protocol fig 4 such removal percentage improvement with all wetlands during the 3 h fill period could be linked to the nh4 n adsorption capacity of the stone dust media fig 2 higher nh4 n adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust media was observed within 3 h of the contact period fig 2 moreover better oxygen availability during the 3 h fill period supported nitrification of the rapidly adsorbed nh4 n by the attached biofilm establishing an equilibrium between influent nh4 n adsorption nitrification and subsequent no3 n desorption from the media on the other hand lower nh4 n removal with all wetlands during the 1 h fill period could be attributed to faster media saturation and associated anaerobic environment development inside the media that could have influenced nh4 n adsorption capacity of the media because of the slower nitrification rate no3 n and tn removal performance of the four experimental wetland systems coincided with the nh4 n removal trend removal percentage increased i e 54 66 and 10 20 respectively with the four wetland systems during 3 h fill 1 h drain period compared to the corresponding performance of 1 h fill 3 h drain period fig 4 the removal performance differences between the two periods were statistically significant p 0 05 higher nh4 n removal during the 3 h fill phase increased no3 n availability for denitrification which is often considered a rate limiting step for completing classical denitrification pathways statistically significant p 0 05 phosphorus removal performance decrease 30 was observed with the a1 wetland without electrodes during 3 h fill 1 h drain period compared to 1 h fill 3 h drain phase fig 4 the a2 and a3 wetlands without electrodes also demonstrated phosphorus removal performance decrease during the same period that was not statistically significant p 0 05 the a4 wetland achieved almost a similar phosphorus removal percentage within the two wastewater fill drain time ratios because of statistically insignificant phosphorus removal differences with most of the wetlands between two fill drain periods it could not be confirmed whether the fill drain time ratio variation influenced the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the employed stone dust media coliform removal performance increased 14 19 with all wetland systems during 3 h fill period compared to the reversed protocol fig 4 statistically significant p 0 05 coliform removal performance improvement of the wetland systems without electrodes a1 and a3 during a longer fill period 3 h suggests coliform mortality through protozoa that prefer aerobic environments based predation and oxidation processes due to existence of aerobic conditions inside the media 25 26 on the other hand statistically insignificant coliform removal performance differences p 0 05 of the electrodes based wetlands a2 and a4 between the fill drain phases signify the dominance of other removal routes in the presence of electrodes 3 6 wastewater contact period variation fig 5 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetlands with respect to wastewater contact periods variation i e 20 10 and 5 h cod removal percentage increment and contact period duration decrease were positively correlated with the electrodes integrated a2 a4 wetlands which were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by one way anova analysis supplementary material s1 post hoc tukey test revealed removal percentage differences because of efficient cod removal performance p 0 05 during 5 h contact period the effluent redox profile differences within the three contact periods across all the wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 due to the mean effluent redox concentration of 5 h contact period such wastewater contact period cycle allowed a longer bed resting period of 19 h per day prior to the commencement of the subsequent dosing cycle hence a longer bed rest period allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the media of the electrodes integrated wetlands maintained oxygen availability around the cathode electrode and the stratified redox gradient between the cathode and anode electrodes to support electrochemical organic matter oxidation 4 32 fig 5 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetlands with respect to wastewater contact periods variation i e 20 10 and 5 h cod removal percentage increment and contact period duration decrease were positively correlated with the electrodes integrated a2 a4 wetlands which were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by one way anova analysis supplementary material s1 post hoc tukey test revealed removal percentage differences because of efficient cod removal performance p 0 05 during 5 h contact period the effluent redox profile differences within the three contact periods across all the wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 due to the mean effluent redox concentration of 5 h contact period such wastewater contact period cycle allowed a longer bed resting period of 19 h per day prior to the commencement of the subsequent dosing cycle hence a longer bed rest period allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the media of the electrodes integrated wetlands maintained oxygen availability around the cathode electrode and the stratified redox gradient between the cathode and anode electrodes to support electrochemical organic matter oxidation 4 32 in contrast cod removal percentage differences of the a1 and a3 wetlands without electrodes between the three contact periods were not statistically significant p 0 05 therefore statistically significant redox profile variation between the three contact periods did not influence cod removal of the tidal flow based wetlands without electrodes sufficient atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the systems during bed rest phases additional oxygen contribution during fill periods and development of an anaerobic environment during wastewater contact periods fulfilled the requirements of electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic based organic matter degradation tkn removal trends of the four wetland systems with respect to contact periods variation coincided with cod removal profiles the a2 or a4 wetland with electrodes achieved statistically significant better tkn removal p 0 05 during the 5 h contact period whereas the wetland systems without electrodes a1 and a3 did not exhibit such trends therefore ammonification i e conversion of organic nitrogen to nh4 n was likely to be influenced by the integrated electrodes under favorable environmental conditions of 5 h contact period the presence of plants supplemented the influence of electrodes on ammonification as the planted microbial fuel cell wetland achieved better tkn removal than the electrodes based unplanted wetland during 5 h and the other two wastewater contact periods nh4 n removal percentage differences of the four wetland systems with respect to wastewater contact bed rest time variation were not statistically significant p 0 05 previous studies reported better nh4 n removal in tidal flow based microbial fuel cell or normal without electrodes wetlands due to an increase in bed rest period length that developed more aerobic gradients inside the wetland media and supported autotrophic nitrification 4 6 the positive linkage between nh4 n removal and bed rest duration increment of the reported tidal flow based systems could be attributed to rapid wastewater filling within 10 min and subsequent complete media saturation oxygen diffusion was limited in these stages thus developing the dependency of the reported systems on oxygen contribution by passive pumping during draining and diffusion during bed rest tidal flow wetlands depend critically on the oxygen availability contributed by bed rest periods 1 resulting in the dependency of aerobic nh4 n removal in the reported wetlands on bed rest duration length in this study nh4 n removal with all wetlands was influenced by fill drain periods variation but was independent of wastewater contact bed rest periods duration differences primarily due to additional oxygen contribution from the filling phases section 3 5 no3 n and tn removal performance of the tidal flow based wetlands in this study with respect to contact periods variation followed the nh4 n removal trend removal percentage differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 reflecting the availability of no3 n from nitrification to complete denitrification during the wastewater contact periods such a trend signifies that carbon availability from internal sources particularly from the stone dust media table 4 and anaerobic environment development within the three contact periods fulfilled denitrification requirements tp removal percentage differences of the four wetlands with respect to contact time variation were not statistically significant p 0 05 adsorption test analysis specified higher phosphorus adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust during its exposure to standard phosphorus solutions of 50 100 mg l concentrations fig 2 within 3 h contact period that was beneath the wastewater contact period length 5 10 and 20 h of the wetland systems coliform removal percentage differences of the four wetland systems were independent of contact time variation as signified by statistically insignificant removal percentage differences p 0 05 3 7 bioenergy production table 6 summarizes the mean voltage and power density production of the electrodes integrated wetlands a2 a4 with respect to wastewater fill drain time ratios and contact periods variation as observed in table 6 the electrodes integrated wetlands produced lower voltage and power density during 3 h fill and 5 h contact periods compared to 1 h fill and 10 or 20 h contact periods based profiles respectively the ability of microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands to host a wider range of electrochemically inactive microbial populations particularly when dosed with real wastewater had been reported 33 the electrons produced because of electrochemical based organic matter oxidation could be utilized by such electrochemically inactive microbial population instead of anode electrode such interference commonly referred to as electron losses often results in lower voltage and power density production 29 the interference of electrochemically inactive microbial population on bioenergy production could have been intensified during 3 h fill and 5 h contact periods with electrodes based tidal flow wetlands of this study that received real wastewater due to achieving better pollutant removal performances through different electrochemically inactive pathways polarization tests were conducted to assess probable current loss occurrence with the electrodes integrated wetlands a2 a4 during the experimental protocol external resistors between 100 and 33 000 ω were connected with the electrodes based wetlands to conduct polarization tests fig 6 represents current power density and the voltage produced across the electrodes integrated unplanted planted wetlands during polarization tests the maximum power density of 113 and 147 mw m3 was produced across the electrodes based unplanted and planted wetlands when connected to a 1000 ω resistor respectively as observed from the polarization curve higher power density production of the electrodes based planted wetland than the unplanted system elucidates the dependency of electrode performance upon the presence of plants the capacity of the root biomass to supply oxygen and exudates to cathode electrode and electrochemically active microbial population respectively often improves the operational performance of the electrodes integrated wetlands 23 previous studies reported maximum power density production ranging between 16 and 527 mw m3 with electrodes based tidal flow wetlands that received synthetic or real wastewater 2 7 32 the maximum power density produced by electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands of this study coincided with the previously reported performance ranges it should be noted that power density production could vary substantially between electrodes based wetlands of different studies due to variations in the chemical microbial composition of the wastewater geographic locations plants media and electrode configuration three distinct patterns due to current loss such as an initial sharp drop of voltage activation loss a mid stage slow drop of voltage ohmic loss and a last stage fast drop of voltage when current intensities were higher concentration loss were observed in the polarization curve fig 6 similar patterns were reported with electrodes based constructed wetlands that received synthetic 34 or real wastewater 20 22 4 conclusions between the two wetland components i e the presence of plants and electrodes the former component heavily influenced pollutant removal with tidal flow based wetland systems of this study the presence of plants supplemented the performance of the electrodes the physicochemical properties of the media supported chemical and electrochemically active inactive microbial pollutant removal wastewater fill drain time ratios or contact period variation influenced organic removal with electrodes integrated unplanted planted wetlands the removal of nitrogenous compounds in the four wetlands was influenced by fill drain time ratio variation but was independent of contact period duration differences the variable operational parameters did not control the phosphorus removal trend of the wetland systems mean operational voltage and power density production with the electrodes based unplanted or planted wetland decreased during 3 h fill or 5 h contact period of wastewater when better pollutant removal was achieved the maximum power density production of the electrodes based planted wetland exceeded those of the unplanted unit this study indicates the influence of plants electrode

phases data availability data is available in the manuscript 1 introduction tidal flow constructed wetlands are intensified wastewater treatment systems that generate alternative wet and dry cycles to achieve microbial and chemical based pollutant removals 1 such recurring wet and dry cycles are achieved through the sequential wastewater fill contact drain and bed rest periods 2 the dry cycles draining bed rest periods allow substantial oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere into media pores to support aerobic pollutant removal routes 3 4 the wet cycles wastewater fill contact periods depend upon the utilization of the available oxygen from the previous dry cycle in the media pores because of limited oxygen diffusion in saturated media 5 hence an anaerobic gradient often develops inside the media during wet cycles that favor associated removal pathways media oriented chemical pollutant removal routes are also supported during wet cycles 6 the electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands emerged recently that achieve concurrent wastewater treatment and bioenergy production by sharing the operational mechanisms of normal without electrodes integration tidal flow wetlands and bio electrochemical technologies 7 the rhythmic wet and dry cycles support electrochemically inactive microbial and chemical pollutant removal routes oxidation of electrochemical based organic matter progresses around the anode electrode in the presence of an anaerobic environment 8 10 published literature indicates the application of alternative wastewater feeding approaches effluent recirculation different media and carbon addition to creating favorable conditions to boost chemical and microbial based pollutant removal pathways employing tidal flow constructed wetlands with and without electrodes integration 4 8 9 11 16 the ratio between wet and dry period cycles was also investigated to establish a balance between the development of recurring aerobic anaerobic environments and associated pollutant removal pathways 1 2 6 7 15 the optimal balance between wet and dry time ratio in such reported tidal flow based wetland studies was achieved primarily through altering the duration of two phases i e wastewater contact and bed rest periods contact periods ranging between 3 and 24 h and rest periods ranging between 1 and 16 h had been investigated to understand their impact on pollutant removals the other two phases i e wastewater fill and drain periods were not altered in these studies due to following rapid wastewater fill and discharge strategies 20 min tidal flow based wetlands performance also depends upon wastewater filling and draining periods as such phases control oxygen transmission rates inside the media pores li hu 5 designed normal tidal flow wetlands with longer wastewater filling time i e 36 h and observed rapid pollutant removal within 6 h of tidal cycle commencement that coincided with the filling duration phase such a reported trend reflects the necessity of designing an experimental protocol with tidal flow based systems with and without electrodes integration operated under variable wastewater fill and drain periods to identify their impact on pollutant removal integration of wastewater contact and bed rest periods variation with such a proposed protocol would identify the impact of each of the four phases on pollutant removal performance with tidal flow wetlands with and without electrodes integration but has not been investigated to date previous studies reported a positive combined impact of plants and electrodes to improve pollutant removal with tidal flow wetlands than parallel designed normal planted tidal flow systems i e without electrodes integration 15 17 integration of additional systems i e unplanted tidal flow wetlands with and without electrodes integration might reveal the individual impact of such wetland components i e plants and electrodes on pollutant removal performance when operated under variable operational tidal flow based conditions fill contact drain rest periods such experimental based evidence might allow better designing of tidal flow based wetlands to achieve better pollutant removals this study provides comparative pollutant removal from municipal wastewater performance assessment employing stone dust media based unplanted and planted tidal flow constructed wetlands with or without electrodes integration the tidal flow based wetlands were operated under variable wastewater fill drain time ratio wastewater contact and bed rest periods the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of plants electrodes integration and sequential phases of tidal based protocol variation on pollutant removal performances along with voltage and power density production with tidal flow based wetland systems 2 materials and method 2 1 wetland configuration four polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders were used to build constructed wetlands a1 a2 a3 and a4 at the university of asia pacific dhaka bangladesh the diameter and height of each constructed wetland were 0 15 and 0 91 m respectively the wetlands were filled with stone dust particles that achieved 0 82 m depth in each wetland unit the size and porosity of the stone dust were 0 5 4 9 mm and 32 respectively the stone dust media was overlaid and underlaid by large stones of 0 02 m depth for influent distribution inside the media and effluent drainage two aluminium plates were integrated as anode and cathode electrodes in the media of each of the a2 and a4 wetland units the dimension of a single electrode was 0 1 m 0 1 m the distance of the two electrodes in the a2 or a4 wetland unit was 0 2 m and was separated by glass wool thermal insulator foam the two electrodes of the a2 or a4 unit were connected by electrically insulated copper wires a 10 000 ω resistor and a multimeter canna indica species were planted in a3 and a4 wetland units the remaining two systems i e a1 and a2 were kept unplanted after the plantation the four systems were waterlogged with wastewater for 10 weeks to allow plant and biofilm growth inside the media depending on the structural configurations the four systems are designated as a1 unplanted wetland system 1 a2 unplanted microbial fuel cell wetland system 2 a3 planted wetland system 3 a4 planted microbial fuel cell wetland system 4 fig 1 provides an operational diagram of the four experimental wetland systems 2 2 wastewater dosing the wetland systems of this study received real municipal wastewater as influent for 36 weeks the first 6 weeks of hydraulic dosing allowed wetland systems adaptation to the municipal wastewater the experiment continued within the remaining 30 weeks the four constructed wetlands were operated following sequential wastewater fill contact drain bed rest protocols i e the tidal flow approach the experimental campaign commenced with 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol the dosing cycle started by applying 8 l of wastewater per day on the media surfaces of each wetland unit the pore spaces of the media were filled with 8 l of wastewater within 1 h defined as the fill period three wastewater contact periods were selected i e 20 10 and 5 h the experimental systems were operated for 5 weeks including 1 week of stabilization period with each of the selected contact periods resulting in 15 weeks sampling campaign under 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol after completing the defined contact period the retained wastewater was fully drained from the wetland systems within 3 h defined as the drain period after wastewater draining the wetlands were kept under the rest dry phase before the commencement of the next dosing cycle each of the four wetlands was subjected to dry periods of 4 h for 20 h contact period 14 h for 10 h contact period and 19 h for 5 h contact period per day the selected wastewater contact and bed rest periods with tidal flow based wetlands of this study coincided with previously reported ranges 1 2 6 7 15 the 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol was followed by a reversed wastewater filling draining strategy i e 3 h fill 1 h drain phase the media pore spaces of the four wetland units were filled with 8 l of wastewater within 3 h such filling duration was longer than the fill period i e 1 h of the previous fill drain phase but was shorter than that i e 36 h reported by li hu 5 with normal tidal flow wetlands similar contact periods i e 20 10 5 h and experimental duration i e 5 weeks for each contact period including 1 week of stabilization period of the previous fill drain phase were maintained the wastewater was fully drained within 1 h after the completion of each contact period the drying periods per day associated with each of the three contact periods during 3 h fill period were similar to 1 h fill phase wastewater fill contact and drain periods were controlled by pumping motors connected to digital time controllers table 1 summarizes the tidal based operational protocol employed with wetland systems of this study 2 3 wastewater samples analysis influent and effluent wastewater samples were collected weekly from the four unplanted unplanted microbial fuel cell planted and

and potassium dihydrogen phosphate salts kh2po4 were used to prepare standard ammonium and phosphate solutions of 50 and 100 mg l concentrations respectively three grams of unused stone dust media and 20 ml of the prepared nh4 or p standard solution of 50 mg l concentration were transferred to a 50 ml polyethylene bottle a similar protocol was followed with nh4 or p standard solution of 100 mg l concentration two drops of chloroform were added to the media and standard solutions mixture to prevent microbial growth that might interfere with the chemical adsorption process the polyethylene bottles that contained nh4 or p standard solutions of 50 100 mg l concentration were shaken at a speed of 180 r min and 25 c temperature the supernatant produced in the polyethylene bottles during the shaking process was extracted at different intervals i e 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 h using a 0 45 μm membrane the extracted samples were analyzed with a uv vis spectrophotometer to quantify nh4 n and p concentrations nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the unused used stone dust media was also measured after the termination of the experimental campaign the used stone dust media was collected from a1 a2 a3 a4 wetlands at 0 1 and 0 7 m depth measured from the media surface area the collected used media was analyzed following digestion distillation vanadomolybdo phosphoric yellow color methods to quantify nutrient concentration a detailed protocol of nutrient concentration measurement of the media has been described by saeed majed 20 the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis of the unused fresh used collected from the wetland systems after the termination of the experimental protocol stone dust material was conducted such an analysis aimed to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the media that often influence microbial based pollutant removal in wetland systems besides energy dispersive x ray analysis eds of the unused and used stone dust media was also undertaken to identify the influence of chemical components of the media in supporting chemical and microbial based pollutant removal pathways plants were harvested from a3 and a4 wetlands after the termination of the experimental campaign the objective of such harvesting was to assess the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissues as plant uptake contributes to wastewater nutrient removal in wetland systems 21 the harvested plants were divided into underground ug and aboveground ag portions and oven dried at 80 c temperature to achieve a constant dry weight dried ug and ag plant biomass were powdered nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the powdered biomass was measured by following digestion distillation and vanadomolybdo phosphoric yellow color protocols a detailed description of nutrient concentration analysis of plant tissues has been described by saeed and jihad miah 15 2 5 voltage current and power density the voltage production of the electrodes

concentration values across all wetland systems were higher compared to the mean influent concentration values table 2 two way anova analysis supplementary material s1 indicated that the two variable factors i e plants or electrodes had a statistically insignificant impact p 0 05 on mean effluent redox profiles across all wetland systems the positive influence of plants in providing additional oxygen due to oxygen leakage from rhizosphere inside the media of free draining normal without electrodes and electrodes based constructed wetlands had been reported previously 20 22 the ability of tidal flow protocol to transfer atmospheric oxygen inside the media pores could have primarily contributed to effluent redox concentration increment with the tidal flow based wetlands of this study 1 5 and undermined the influence of plants in providing additional oxygen inside the bed matrix table 2 summarizes the mean influent and effluent redox concentration profiles of a1 a2 a3 and a4 wetlands throughout the experimental campaign the mean effluent redox concentration values across all wetland systems were higher compared to the mean influent concentration values table 2 two way anova analysis supplementary material s1 indicated that the two variable factors i e plants or electrodes had a statistically insignificant impact p 0 05 on mean effluent redox profiles across all wetland

pollutant removal the mean influent effluent bod cod tkn nh4 n no3 n tn and tp concentration profiles measured throughout the experimental campaign across the four wetland systems are summarized in table 2 the mean influent effluent pollutant concentration differences across all wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by the t test supplementary material s1 the mean influent effluent bod cod tkn nh4 n no3 n tn and tp concentration profiles measured throughout the experimental campaign across the four wetland systems are summarized in table 2 the mean influent effluent pollutant concentration differences across all wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by the t test supplementary material s1 tidal flow constructed wetlands often boost aerobic organic removal ammonification organic nitrogen transformation to nh4 n and nitrification transformation of nh4 n to no2 n and finally to no3 n during bed rest and the initial phase of the wastewater contact period because of higher oxygen availability in media pore spaces contributed by the dry periods 1 6 15 rapid oxygen utilization by aerobic pathways during the initial part of the wastewater contact phase along with decreased oxygen transmission from the atmosphere to media due to a saturated environment diminishes oxygen availability inside the wetland media 5 therefore an anaerobic gradient develops in the bed matrix during the latter phase of the contact period that fosters the progression of the anaerobic based organic removal pathway and denitrification i e no3 n reduction to n2 gas 2 3 such aerobic and anaerobic removal routes could have contributed to influent organic and nitrogen removal in tidal flow wetlands of this study the mean effluent concentration of organic and nitrogen compounds across the planted a3 and a4 wetlands was beneath those of the unplanted a1 a2 systems table 2 two way anova analysis showed a significant impact p 0 05 of plants presence on the overall mean effluent organic nitrogen concentration across the wetland units post hoc comparison illustrated statistically significant p 0 05 mean effluent organic nitrogen concentration difference between wetland systems with and without plants although the contribution of plants in providing supplementary oxygen was not statistically evident section 3 1 plant roots support the growth of diverse microbial colonies around the rootzone 23 the presence of such microbial colonies might have allowed for achieving lower mean effluent organic and nitrogen concentration across the planted wetlands compared to unplanted units moreover root exudates of the planted wetlands could have provided carbon compounds to the denitrifiers to complete the classical denitrification route resulting in lower mean effluent no3 n and tn concentrations than those of the unplanted units 20 besides supplementing microbial based removal plants contribute to nutrient removal through uptake 23 table 3 summarizes nitrogen and phosphorus concentration g kg and accumulation percentage with respect to total removal in aboveground ag and underground ug biomass of canna indica plants in this study as observed in table 3 the nitrogen accumulation percentage was low i e 2 in ug ag plant biomass such lower nitrogen accumulation percentage further confirms the indirect influence of plants in producing lower effluent nitrogen concentration a similar trend was observed with plant based phosphorus removal performance the accumulation percentage was negligible i e 0 2 in ug ag plant tissues with respect to total phosphorus removal therefore significant influence p 0 05 of plants presence on producing lower mean effluent phosphorus concentration indicated by two way anova analysis compared to the unplanted systems or mean significant effluent phosphorus concentration differences p 0 05 between planted and unplanted wetlands systems indicated by the post hoc comparison could not be attributed to plant based phosphorus uptake it should be noted that constructed wetlands achieve incoming phosphorus removal primarily through media based adsorption 13 24 besides the integration of electrodes with constructed wetland systems improved phosphorus removal 20 the influence of these components along with the presence of plants on phosphorus removal is discussed in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the mean influent effluent coliform number difference was statistically significant p 0 05 with all wetlands as illustrated by the t test two way anova analysis showed a statistically significant influence of plants p 0 05 on mean effluent coliform concentration across the wetland units post hoc tukey test indicated a significant mean effluent coliform number difference p 0 05 within the planted and unplanted wetland systems sedimentation filtration by media adsorption oxidation exposure to the toxin produced by microbial activities and biological predation contribute to coliform removal in subsurface flow constructed wetlands 25 26 the presence of plants additionally improves coliform removal in constructed wetlands because of filtration and organic compounds generation by plant roots that act as disinfectants 25 such supplementary contribution of plants could have improved coliform removal in the planted wetlands a3 a4 compared to those of unplanted systems a1 a2 3 3 influence of electrodes on pollutant removal better organic and nutrient removal was reported with free draining or upflow based microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands compared to parallel designed wetlands without electrodes 20 27 the coexistence of electrochemically active inactive microbial population and the occurrence of different removal mechanisms in the cathode anode compartments improved organic nutrient removal of the reported electrodes integrated wetlands 20 28 in this study the presence of electrodes had an insignificant impact p 0 05 indicated by two way anova on the mean effluent organic nutrient concentration of the tidal flow wetlands table 2 post hoc comparison signified statistically insignificant p 0 05 mean effluent organic nutrient concentration differences between the wetland systems with and without electrodes integration in fact the a4 wetland produced a mean effluent organic concentration slightly above table 2 that of the a3 system the organic biodegradation ratio of the municipal wastewater was 0 4 a ratio 0 5 indicates limited biodegradable organic compounds availability in wastewater that could have adversely influenced the progression of electrochemical organic matter oxidation with the planted microbial fuel cell wetland 28 moreover the decaying root biomass of such wetland might have additionally interfered with the progression of electrochemical organic matter oxidation 23 such a hypothesis is further supported by comparing the organic removal performance between the a2 and a1 wetlands table 2 the former system achieved a lower mean effluent organic concentration than the latter however the a4 wetland still achieved better organic removal performance than the a2 wetland indicating the necessity of plants presence with electrodes integrated constructed wetland systems on the other hand better organic removal of the a3 system could be linked to electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic removal routes that progressed during dry and wet periods respectively regarding nutrient removal the a4 wetland achieved the lowest mean effluent nutrient concentration followed by a3 a2 and a1 wetlands although the unplanted microbial fuel cell wetland achieved better nutrient removal than the unplanted system the influence of electrodes on achieving such performance could not be confirmed due to a lack of statistical support on the other hand the overall efficient nutrient removal performance of the planted microbial fuel cell wetland than the other systems elucidates the positive influence of plants on electrodes in supporting electrodes dependent microbial and chemical reactions and improving overall nutrient removal performance 29 similar phenomena were observed with planted electrodes integrated free draining wetlands compared to only planted systems 20 electrodes integration significantly influenced coliform removal p 0 05 with all tidal flow based wetlands as indicated by two way anova analysis post hoc tukey test specifies significant mean effluent coliform concentration differences p 0 05 between wetland systems with and without electrodes integration as such the lower mean effluent coliform concentration of the a2 and a4 wetlands compared to those of the a1 and a3 wetlands respectively could be attributed to the positive influence of electrodes on coliform mortality however the a3 wetland achieved better coliform removal performance than the a2 wetland signifying that the influence of plants on coliform mortality exceeded that of electrodes 3 4 media based removal media based adsorption often supports nutrient nh4 n and phosphorus removal in constructed wetlands 13 14 fig 2 signifies the nutrient adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust media with respect to contact periods exposure in standard nutrient solutions as observed in fig 2 the stone dust media of this study showed higher nutrient adsorption capacity within 3 h contact periods nutrient adsorption capacity decreased within contact periods 3 h due to reaching a saturation state the stone dust media showed higher nutrient adsorption capacity when the nutrient concentration of the standard solutions increased from 50 to 100 mg l presence of cations such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 potassium k and sodium na support media based nh4 n adsorption because of forming cation exchange sites on the media surface 30 31 on the other hand specific elements of the wetland media i e calcium ca aluminium al iron fe promote phosphorus removal through adsorption 24 eds analysis table 4 of the unused fresh and used stone dust media collected from the wetlands after experiment termination signifies the probable presence of the elements that favor nutrient media based adsorption in wetland systems and is confirmed by nutrient adsorption capacity analysis fig 2 the influence of the wetland media on nutrient removal is further assessed through table 5 that summarizes nutrient concentration profiles of the unused used media as observed in table 5 the nitrogen concentration of the used media collected at 0 1 and 0 7 m depths from the media surface decreased with all wetland units compared to unused stone dust media concentration profiles eds analysis table 4 also indicates a probable nitrogen percentage decrease with the used media of the four wetland systems compared to the unused media percentage profiles it should be noted that the unused stone dust media showed nh4 n adsorption characteristics fig 2 that should have increased nitrogen concentration with the used media over the unused media concentration profiles considering the trends of adsorption capacity fig 2 eds table 4 and media concentration table 5 analysis it could be stated that the incoming nh4 n or the nh4 n produced from the ammonification process inside the wetland systems was adsorbed by the media such adsorbed nh4 n was nitrified and denitrified by the attached biofilm on media surfaces during aerobic and anaerobic stages of the tidal flow cycle resulting in nitrogen concentration decrease with the used media eds analysis also indicates probable carbon composition of the unused stone dust media that decreased with the used media such probable carbon composition reduction could be attributed to carbon utilization by the denitrifiers and electrochemically active microbial population because of limited biodegradable organic compounds availability in the municipal wastewater as indicated by bod cod ratio 13 22 organic carbon availability from plant roots and completion of electrodes based nitrogen removal routes in the presence of plants might have additionally improved nitrogen removal performance with a3 a4 wetlands compared to a1 a2 systems 23 29 phosphorus concentration increased with the used media of all wetland units than the unused media concentration profiles table 5 eds analysis table 4 demonstrates a similar trend i e probable phosphorus percentage increment with the used media the results of eds table 4 concentration based table 5 analysis of the unused used media and adsorption capacity fig 2 of the unused media signify media based adsorption as the probable dominant phosphorus removal route in tidal flow wetlands efficient phosphorus removal in a3 and a4 wetlands particularly in the latter system table 2 enlightens the possible influence of electrodes in promoting diverse microbial growth that supplemented incoming phosphorus removal 27 the physical characteristics of the unused and used stone dust media were assessed through sem analysis the sem images fig 3 signify that the particles on the surface areas of the unused stone dust media were flattened however aggregates formation was observed on the surface areas of the used stone dust media collected from the wetland units after experimental termination probably due to the deposition of organic particles root fragments and biofilm formation 15 27 it was likely that microbial based pollutant removal existed in aerobic and anaerobic zones of such formed biolayer that primarily contributed to pollutant removal in the wetland systems of this study 3 5 wastewater filling draining periods effluent redox value within the four wetlands ranged between 111 and 114 mv during 1 h fill 3 h drain protocol and increased ranging between 167 and 182 mv during 3 h fill 1 h drain period such mean effluent redox value differences across each of the four wetland systems within the two fill drain periods were statistically significant p 0 05 as indicated by the t test the media of the four tidal flow based wetlands was completely saturated from bottom to top portion after 3 h during 3 h fill 1 h drain period that exceeded the required period i e 1 h to achieve complete media saturation during the reversed protocol i e 1 h fill 3 h drain period a longer wastewater filling period 3 h allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the bed matrix through the upper unsaturated media portion before achieving complete media saturation such diffusion replenished the oxygen consumed by the aerobic removal pathways in the saturated media portion and increased oxygen availability inside the media as the tidal flow based wetlands shifted towards complete media saturation wastewater contact phase when atmospheric oxygen diffusion is a limiting factor 3 6 on the other hand lower effluent redox value of the tidal flow based wetlands during 3 h drain period and opposite trends during a shorter drain period 1 h could be attributed to the dependency of tidal flow wetlands on oxygen diffusion rather than the passive oxygen pumping rate during drain periods 1 fig 4 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetland systems achieved during two wastewater fill drain periods the electrodes based wetlands a2 a4 achieved statistically significant bod removal percentage increment p 0 05 i e 10 12 during 3 h fill period compared to that of 1 h fill phase the a1 a3 wetlands without electrodes integration also achieved higher bod removal percentage 4 8 during the 3 h fill period than 1 h fill phase that was not statistically significant p 0 05 bod removal performance improvement with electrodes based wetlands during the 3 h fill period coincided with a statistically significant effluent redox profiles increment trend the operational performance of the electrodes based wetlands heavily depends upon maintaining the required stratified aerobic anoxic anaerobic redox gradient between the electrodes 32 it was likely that better oxygen distribution inside the bed matrix during 3 h fill period hindered the predominant anoxic anaerobic gradient development between the electrodes of microbial fuel cell tidal flow wetlands particularly during the wastewater contact period and supported organic removal via electrochemical oxidation pathway statistically insignificant p 0 05 removal bod performance of the unplanted planted wetlands without electrodes integration reflects bod removal independency upon fill drain time ratio variation electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic based removal pathways contribute to incoming organic compounds removal in the case of normal without electrodes tidal flow based wetlands during its continuous transition between aerobic and anaerobic environmental conditions 1 13 statistically significant nh4 n removal percentage increment p 0 05 i e 9 30 was observed with all wetland systems during 3 h fill period compared to the corresponding removal of the reversed protocol fig 4 such removal percentage improvement with all wetlands during the 3 h fill period could be linked to the nh4 n adsorption capacity of the stone dust media fig 2 higher nh4 n adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust media was observed within 3 h of the contact period fig 2 moreover better oxygen availability during the 3 h fill period supported nitrification of the rapidly adsorbed nh4 n by the attached biofilm establishing an equilibrium between influent nh4 n adsorption nitrification and subsequent no3 n desorption from the media on the other hand lower nh4 n removal with all wetlands during the 1 h fill period could be attributed to faster media saturation and associated anaerobic environment development inside the media that could have influenced nh4 n adsorption capacity of the media because of the slower nitrification rate no3 n and tn removal performance of the four experimental wetland systems coincided with the nh4 n removal trend removal percentage increased i e 54 66 and 10 20 respectively with the four wetland systems during 3 h fill 1 h drain period compared to the corresponding performance of 1 h fill 3 h drain period fig 4 the removal performance differences between the two periods were statistically significant p 0 05 higher nh4 n removal during the 3 h fill phase increased no3 n availability for denitrification which is often considered a rate limiting step for completing classical denitrification pathways statistically significant p 0 05 phosphorus removal performance decrease 30 was observed with the a1 wetland without electrodes during 3 h fill 1 h drain period compared to 1 h fill 3 h drain phase fig 4 the a2 and a3 wetlands without electrodes also demonstrated phosphorus removal performance decrease during the same period that was not statistically significant p 0 05 the a4 wetland achieved almost a similar phosphorus removal percentage within the two wastewater fill drain time ratios because of statistically insignificant phosphorus removal differences with most of the wetlands between two fill drain periods it could not be confirmed whether the fill drain time ratio variation influenced the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the employed stone dust media coliform removal performance increased 14 19 with all wetland systems during 3 h fill period compared to the reversed protocol fig 4 statistically significant p 0 05 coliform removal performance improvement of the wetland systems without electrodes a1 and a3 during a longer fill period 3 h suggests coliform mortality through protozoa that prefer aerobic environments based predation and oxidation processes due to existence of aerobic conditions inside the media 25 26 on the other hand statistically insignificant coliform removal performance differences p 0 05 of the electrodes based wetlands a2 and a4 between the fill drain phases signify the dominance of other removal routes in the presence of electrodes 3 6 wastewater contact period variation fig 5 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetlands with respect to wastewater contact periods variation i e 20 10 and 5 h cod removal percentage increment and contact period duration decrease were positively correlated with the electrodes integrated a2 a4 wetlands which were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by one way anova analysis supplementary material s1 post hoc tukey test revealed removal percentage differences because of efficient cod removal performance p 0 05 during 5 h contact period the effluent redox profile differences within the three contact periods across all the wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 due to the mean effluent redox concentration of 5 h contact period such wastewater contact period cycle allowed a longer bed resting period of 19 h per day prior to the commencement of the subsequent dosing cycle hence a longer bed rest period allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the media of the electrodes integrated wetlands maintained oxygen availability around the cathode electrode and the stratified redox gradient between the cathode and anode electrodes to support electrochemical organic matter oxidation 4 32 fig 5 represents the mean organic nutrient and coliform removal percentages of the four wetlands with respect to wastewater contact periods variation i e 20 10 and 5 h cod removal percentage increment and contact period duration decrease were positively correlated with the electrodes integrated a2 a4 wetlands which were statistically significant p 0 05 indicated by one way anova analysis supplementary material s1 post hoc tukey test revealed removal percentage differences because of efficient cod removal performance p 0 05 during 5 h contact period the effluent redox profile differences within the three contact periods across all the wetland systems were statistically significant p 0 05 due to the mean effluent redox concentration of 5 h contact period such wastewater contact period cycle allowed a longer bed resting period of 19 h per day prior to the commencement of the subsequent dosing cycle hence a longer bed rest period allowed better atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the media of the electrodes integrated wetlands maintained oxygen availability around the cathode electrode and the stratified redox gradient between the cathode and anode electrodes to support electrochemical organic matter oxidation 4 32 in contrast cod removal percentage differences of the a1 and a3 wetlands without electrodes between the three contact periods were not statistically significant p 0 05 therefore statistically significant redox profile variation between the three contact periods did not influence cod removal of the tidal flow based wetlands without electrodes sufficient atmospheric oxygen diffusion inside the systems during bed rest phases additional oxygen contribution during fill periods and development of an anaerobic environment during wastewater contact periods fulfilled the requirements of electrochemically inactive aerobic anaerobic based organic matter degradation tkn removal trends of the four wetland systems with respect to contact periods variation coincided with cod removal profiles the a2 or a4 wetland with electrodes achieved statistically significant better tkn removal p 0 05 during the 5 h contact period whereas the wetland systems without electrodes a1 and a3 did not exhibit such trends therefore ammonification i e conversion of organic nitrogen to nh4 n was likely to be influenced by the integrated electrodes under favorable environmental conditions of 5 h contact period the presence of plants supplemented the influence of electrodes on ammonification as the planted microbial fuel cell wetland achieved better tkn removal than the electrodes based unplanted wetland during 5 h and the other two wastewater contact periods nh4 n removal percentage differences of the four wetland systems with respect to wastewater contact bed rest time variation were not statistically significant p 0 05 previous studies reported better nh4 n removal in tidal flow based microbial fuel cell or normal without electrodes wetlands due to an increase in bed rest period length that developed more aerobic gradients inside the wetland media and supported autotrophic nitrification 4 6 the positive linkage between nh4 n removal and bed rest duration increment of the reported tidal flow based systems could be attributed to rapid wastewater filling within 10 min and subsequent complete media saturation oxygen diffusion was limited in these stages thus developing the dependency of the reported systems on oxygen contribution by passive pumping during draining and diffusion during bed rest tidal flow wetlands depend critically on the oxygen availability contributed by bed rest periods 1 resulting in the dependency of aerobic nh4 n removal in the reported wetlands on bed rest duration length in this study nh4 n removal with all wetlands was influenced by fill drain periods variation but was independent of wastewater contact bed rest periods duration differences primarily due to additional oxygen contribution from the filling phases section 3 5 no3 n and tn removal performance of the tidal flow based wetlands in this study with respect to contact periods variation followed the nh4 n removal trend removal percentage differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 reflecting the availability of no3 n from nitrification to complete denitrification during the wastewater contact periods such a trend signifies that carbon availability from internal sources particularly from the stone dust media table 4 and anaerobic environment development within the three contact periods fulfilled denitrification requirements tp removal percentage differences of the four wetlands with respect to contact time variation were not statistically significant p 0 05 adsorption test analysis specified higher phosphorus adsorption capacity of the unused stone dust during its exposure to standard phosphorus solutions of 50 100 mg l concentrations fig 2 within 3 h contact period that was beneath the wastewater contact period length 5 10 and 20 h of the wetland systems coliform removal percentage differences of the four wetland systems were independent of contact time variation as signified by statistically insignificant removal percentage differences p 0 05 3 7 bioenergy production table 6 summarizes the mean voltage and power density production of the electrodes integrated wetlands a2 a4 with respect to wastewater fill drain time ratios and contact periods variation as observed in table 6 the electrodes integrated wetlands produced lower voltage and power density during 3 h fill and 5 h contact periods compared to 1 h fill and 10 or 20 h contact periods based profiles respectively the ability of microbial fuel cell constructed wetlands to host a wider range of electrochemically inactive microbial populations particularly when dosed with real wastewater had been reported 33 the electrons produced because of electrochemical based organic matter oxidation could be utilized by such electrochemically inactive microbial population instead of anode electrode such interference commonly referred to as electron losses often results in lower voltage and power density production 29 the interference of electrochemically inactive microbial population on bioenergy production could have been intensified during 3 h fill and 5 h contact periods with electrodes based tidal flow wetlands of this study that received real wastewater due to achieving better pollutant removal performances through different electrochemically inactive pathways polarization tests were conducted to assess probable current loss occurrence with the electrodes integrated wetlands a2 a4 during the experimental protocol external resistors between 100 and 33 000 ω were connected with the electrodes based wetlands to conduct polarization tests fig 6 represents current power density and the voltage produced across the electrodes integrated unplanted planted wetlands during polarization tests the maximum power density of 113 and 147 mw m3 was produced across the electrodes based unplanted and planted wetlands when connected to a 1000 ω resistor respectively as observed from the polarization curve higher power density production of the electrodes based planted wetland than the unplanted system elucidates the dependency of electrode performance upon the presence of plants the capacity of the root biomass to supply oxygen and exudates to cathode electrode and electrochemically active microbial population respectively often improves the operational performance of the electrodes integrated wetlands 23 previous studies reported maximum power density production ranging between 16 and 527 mw m3 with electrodes based tidal flow wetlands that received synthetic or real wastewater 2 7 32 the maximum power density produced by electrodes integrated tidal flow wetlands of this study coincided with the previously reported performance ranges it should be noted that power density production could vary substantially between electrodes based wetlands of different studies due to variations in the chemical microbial composition of the wastewater geographic locations plants media and electrode configuration three distinct patterns due to current loss such as an initial sharp drop of voltage activation loss a mid stage slow drop of voltage ohmic loss and a last stage fast drop of voltage when current intensities were higher concentration loss were observed in the polarization curve fig 6 similar patterns were reported with electrodes based constructed wetlands that received synthetic 34 or real wastewater 20 22 4 conclusions between the two wetland components i e the presence of plants and electrodes the former component heavily influenced pollutant removal with tidal flow based wetland systems of this study the presence of plants supplemented the performance of the electrodes the physicochemical properties of the media supported chemical and electrochemically active inactive microbial pollutant removal wastewater fill drain time ratios or contact period variation influenced organic removal with electrodes integrated unplanted planted wetlands the removal of nitrogenous compounds in the four wetlands was influenced by fill drain time ratio variation but was independent of contact period duration differences the variable operational parameters did not control the phosphorus removal trend of the wetland systems mean operational voltage and power density production with the electrodes based unplanted or planted wetland decreased during 3 h fill or 5 h contact period of wastewater when better pollutant removal was achieved the maximum power density production of the electrodes based planted wetland exceeded those of the unplanted unit this study indicates the influence of plants electrode
