12155,the evaluation of groundwater quality is an imperative part of water security and plays a significant role in ensuring its sustainable development the present paper reveals the quality of groundwater of kanker district situated in chhattisgarh state india groundwater samples from different regions were collected to observe the seasonal variation in uranium concentration the spatial distribution of major parameters and hydrochemical facies was described by geographic information system based maps correlation coefficient box plot and piper diagrams the uranium concentration ranges from 0 5 to 69 9 μg l and 0 5 87 9 μg l with the mean value of 4 8 μg l and 6 8 μg l in winter and summer season respectively the uranium concentrations for the samples taken from one area in winter and two areas in summer have been found to be slightly higher than the permissible limit of 60 μg l recommended by the atomic energy regulatory board the seasonal variation of uranium in groundwater depends upon the rainfall recharge and precipitation conditions of the geological formation and the environment in certain regions it is observed that the total hardness calcium magnesium and total alkalinity bicarbonate were found higher than the acceptable limit prescribed by the bureau of indian standards mixed type behaviors of tested samples were showed by the piper diagrams uranium exhibits a strong correlation with magnesium r 0 7 in both the seasons graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater kanker district uranium seasonal variation correlation 1 introduction india has considered one of the biggest users of groundwater and about half of its population are living in poor water quality regions in past years the study of groundwater quality has been done by many researchers the presence of radioactive elements in groundwater affects its quality due to the carcinogenic nature of radioactive substances present in the groundwater has given importance for its study uranium is one of the radioactive elements which presents naturally in groundwater and becomes harmful to the environment as well as human health the presence of uranium in the natural groundwater system depends on many factors like lithology geomorphology and other geological features of the region in addition to this the spatial variation of uranium is often dependent on geochemical factors rock water interaction and its duration in groundwater babu et al 2008 the assessment of groundwater quality includes the estimation of various parameters these parameters are based on the acceptable limits prescribed by the world health organization who the u s environmental protection agency us epa the bureau of indian standards bis and the atomic energy regulatory board aerb the distribution and impacts of uranium on the quality of groundwater have been established by zapecza and szabo 1986 the combined effects of geogenic and anthropogenic elements like the interaction between groundwater surface water aquifer minerals the geology of groundwater storage leaching of manures and other human activities are responsible for the variation of groundwater

szabo 1986 meinrath et al 2003 abdurabu et al 2016 in 1991 uranium confirmed as a human carcinogen group a by the united states environmental protection agency us epa and recommended that the acceptable limit for its carcinogenic risk is only zero tolerance at present us epa has suggested that the maximum contamination level mcl of uranium is 30 μg l usepa 1999b the interim maximum acceptable concentration imac of 20 μg l has been suggested by canada earlier the world health organization who 2004 had proposed a reference level 15 μg l but now the permissible limit of uranium concentration in drinking water is 30 μg l who 2011 india has also proposed a permissible limit of 60 μg l for uranium in drinking water based on radiotoxicity aerb and dae 2004 determination of the seasonal variation in uranium concentration in groundwater samples is of our prime interest kanker is selected for the sample collection due to the fact that it is the newly formed district of chhattisgarh and the almost entire district is covered with dense forest and minerals residing with few rare castes of tribal also due to its virgin scientific studies we have carried out this area keeping an account on the importance of public health the occurrence of uranium in groundwater in this area and its seasonal variation with physicochemical parameters were discussed in detail 2 geology and hydrogeology of the study area the kanker district which covers the total area of 5285 01 km2 is situated in the southern part of the chhattisgarh state fig 1 shows the study area under the present investigation the movement and occurrence of groundwater is related to the existing geology of the area groundwater is the main source of drinking water covering 1003 villages of the district geologically meta sediments and crystalline of precambrian making up bengpal bailadila nandgaon and abujhamar group of rocks are covered the district the formations comprise gneisses granite basalt rhyolite and banded hematite quartzite bhq acid and basic intrusive the district is divided geographically into five groups namely vindhyan hill group archaean hill group dharwar hill group mahanadi plains and kotri plains the vindhyan hill group located in the south eastern part of the district its main feature is quartzite sand the archaean hill group covers 95 of the district its main components are granite and gneiss rocks which spread over almost in the entire district the dharwar hill group includes weathered hills in the sambalpur and bhanupratappur blocks of the district the north eastern part of this district comes under the mahanadi plane and the altitude of this plane is less than 500 m the kotri plane comes under the bhanupratappur area and the height of this plane is less than 400 m the normal rainfall of the district is 1090 mm in winter the annual temperatures vary from 10 c and 42 c in the summer relative humidity varies from 87 to 32 during the rainy and winter season respectively physiographyically the district can be divided into two areas the chhattisgarh plain and the bastar plateau the maximum elevation at matla reserve forest area near temargaon pahar ranges is 917 m amsl and minimum 300 m amsl in the western parts of the district the average elevation is approximately 343 84 m amsl the groundwater occurs primarily in phreatic water table conditions and places under semi confined condition the weathered formation and the fractures in hard rock make up the aquifers in granite invariable it limits the fractures to a depth of 80 m cgwb 2012 2013 the geological data district resource map obtain from chhattisgarh council of science and technology raipur with a scale of 1 50 000 is overlaid with groundwater sample location point in arcgis to obtain the geological characteristic for each sample location as shown in fig 2 3 methods and materials 3 1 sampling arc gis 10 6 software was used to prepare a grid map 6 6 km2 of the kanker district after mapping 48 groundwater samples were collected from bore wells and hand pumps which are used for drinking purpose during winter january 2018 and summer may 2018 the standard protocol of the board of research in nuclear science brns was followed for the collection and storage of the samples samples were collected in pre processed polyethylene bottles separate samples were collected and acidified for the analysis of uranium concentration 3 2 determination of uranium the led fluorimeter lf 2 a quantalase enterprises pvt ltd indore india has been used for the estimation of uranium concentration in the groundwater samples of study area it is an established technique for measuring the uranium concentration in aqueous environmental samples the instrument based on the principle of measurement of fluorescence of uranium complexes in the aqueous sample the uranium complexes emit green fluorescence on excitation with uv light of suitable wavelength which can be measured by a sensitive photomultiplier tube pmt since the fluorescence yield is proportional to the intensity of excitation source and concentration of uranium in the sample measurement of fluorescence will give information about the concentration of uranium in the aqueous samples generally the water sample also contains other impurities the fluorescence of organic matter can be partially blocked by using a long pass optical filter to allow light only of wavelength above about 475 nm however this does not completely eliminate the fluorescence from organic materials the remaining fluorescence from organic matter can be completely eliminated by proper time gating of pmt hence the excitation source is a pulsed source it can measure the uranium concentration from 0 5 to 1000 μg l 5 sodium pyrophosphate was prepared in distilled water and orthophosphoric acid was then added to the solution drop by drop while monitoring the ph until it reaches the value of 7 and prepared solution was then added to the water sample in a ratio of 1 10 to convert all the uranium species into single form to finally obtain the same fluorescence yield before the determination of uranium in water samples the instrument was calibrated using standard solutions containing known concentrations of uranium 3 3 determination of physicochemical parameters physicochemical parameters are important to determine the suitability of water for drinking purposes ph was calibrated by the buffer 4 buffer 7 and buffer 9 2 and then measured by the aquasol ph meter pen type meter at the site hanna multiparameter instrument hi 5521 hi 5522 was used for measuring electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds in the samples sodium and potassium ions had been determined by using the microprocessor flame photometer model 1381 the fluoride content was measured by ion selective electrode orion 4 star thermo scientific the chloride concentration was estimated by mohr s argentometric titration total alkalinity bicarbonate was measured by hcl titrimetric method using methyl orange indicator sulfate and phosphate were determined by the turbidimetric method and stannous chloride method respectively using systronic uv vis spectrophotometer 117 nitrate has also estimated by systronic uv vis spectrophotometer 117 edta titrimetric method using eriochrome black t and p r patton and reeder indicator was used for the determination of total hardness and calcium hardness respectively the magnesium hardness was calculated by subtraction of calcium hardness from total hardness 4 results and discussion the study of seasonal variation helps us to determine the contribution of various factors in groundwater for the high or low concentration of particular ions the statistical summary of uranium concentrations and the other physicochemical parameters acquired from the analysis of groundwater samples of winter and summer has been shown by the box and whisker plot in fig 3 forty eight groundwater samples were collected and analysed for the interpretation fig 4 illustrates the spatial distribution of uranium during pre and post monsoon uranium concentration ranges between 0 5 and 69 9 μg l and 0 5 87 9 μg l during winter and summer respectively the aerb and dae 2004 health standard of 60 μg l of uranium in drinking water was considered the acceptable limit for the present study the uranium concentration in one area mohpur in winter and two areas mohpur and choriya in summer was found higher than the permissible limit prescribed by aerb the highest level of uranium was due to the presence of dongargarh granite in the study area uranium is an incompatible element so it enters the crystal at the later stage of crystallization of magma granite is a rock that forms at the later stage of crystallization hence uranium is mainly found in granite and rhyolite the volcanic equivalent of granite but this is not the case always the distribution of uranium in the granitic rocks mainly depends upon the concentration of uranium in the source of the magma from which the rock has formed it has been commonly observed that if the source contains an excessive amount of uranium then its concentration in the formed granite rock will be high seasonal variation in groundwater chemistry is mainly due to the variation in groundwater recharge geochemical reactions and lithology scheytt 1997 it has been observed that with the increase in tds the uranium content of groundwater increases irregular trends in seasonal variation of uranium concentration were observed also the concentrations were found to be high in summer due to the low water level besides after the dilution uranium concentration showed low value in winter due to the rainfall for the entire district the pre monsoon summer and the post monsoon winter groundwater level were observed in the range 3 46 16 23 mbgl and 1 83 9 15 mbgl respectively the fluctuations of water level were noticed between 0 32 and 14 19 mm cgwb 2012 13 table 1 shows the bis standards is 10500 limits for physicochemical parameters in drinking water as suggested by the bis 2012 the permissible limit of ph ranges from 6 5 to 8 5 the ph acid alkaline measurement of water observed ranges from 6 4 to 8 and 6 3 to 7 during winter and summer respectively on this basis 100 of the groundwater samples in winter and summer fall within the acceptable limit which has zero risks of health hazard with respect to the ph the electrical conductivity of the tested samples ranges from 69 5 to 969 2 μs cm and 77 4 1009 μs cm during winter and summer respectively it is well known that the electrical conductivity of water which has a strong association with the tds is a function of the concentration of its all ionic solutes cgwb 2014 15 fig 4 illustrates the spatial distribution of tds for both the monsoons also its level for the samples taken in the winter and summer has been found to be 34 7 484 1 mg l and 38 7 504 mg l respectively strong association of uranium concentration with the tds in groundwater of this area were observed however no seasonal variation has been seen for both the season it may be due to the extreme uses of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural practices that reach the groundwater resulting in the increased value of tds concentrations consequently more formation of uranium salts in groundwater hardness in groundwater is mainly contributed by bicarbonate carbonate sulfate and chloride of calcium and magnesium the total hardness in tested samples ranges from 20 to 430 mg l in winter and 20 450 mg l in summer according to the prescribed limit set by the bis the total hardness of 25 groundwater samples in winter and 27 groundwater samples in summer were found to be higher this indicates that the groundwater is soft or moderately hard in nature the calcium contents were found to be 4 112 mg l and 4 108 mg l during winter and summer respectively for 45 groundwater samples the calcium values were found within the permissible range in both seasons the magnesium content ranges between 2 4 mg l to 52 8 mg l and 2 4 mg l to 55 2 mg l in winter and summer respectively the alkalinity of groundwater is mainly due to the presence of carbonates and bicarbonates the total alkalinity in terms of bicarbonate in water samples during winter and summer ranges from 10 mg l to 315 mg l and 12 5 mg l to 260 mg l respectively for both the seasons the total alkalinity of about 10 water samples in the study region was found higher than the acceptable limits suggested by the bis 2012 the chloride and fluoride ions both are quite common in the water systems because they are added to potable water for numerous health and sanitary purposes however fertilizers road salts and industrial pollution as well as the human and animal wastes has also been considered as the major factors which are responsible for the risk of an increase in the chloride and fluoride contains in the groundwater the chloride concentration was noticed between 14 2 mg l to 163 3 mg l and 14 2 mg l to 156 2 mg l during winter and summer respectively the high concentration of sulfate in drinking water causes gastrointestinal irritation according to the bis guidelines the acceptable limit of sulfate in drinking water is 200 mg l the sulfate ion in the tested samples was observed from 1 6 mg l to 47 3 mg l in winter and from 1 5 mg l to 51 7 mg l in summer nitrate phosphate and potassium are the common fertilizers which when used in the agricultural lands there are potential pollutants in groundwater the observed nitrate level of samples ranges between 0 5 and 32 8 mg l and 0 5 34 4 mg l during winter and summer respectively due to the anthropogenic activities the tested samples showed a high amount of nitrates the observed fluoride content ranges from 0 05 mg l to 0 8 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 0 9 mg l whereas the amount of phosphate varies between 0 5 and 1 2 mg l and 0 4 1 2 mg l during winter and summer respectively the value of sodium content which was identified in the tested samples ranging from 6 1 to 26 4 mg l and 7 7 27 mg l whereas the level of potassium was ranging from 1 2 mg l to 5 mg l and 1 5 mg l to 5 1 mg l during winter and summer respectively in all the samples of the study area the sulfate nitrate chloride and fluoride concentration were observed under the acceptable limit recommended by the bureau of indian standard 2012 observed data indicates that no major changes in the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples were seen in both the seasons fig 5 shows the frequency distribution and cumulative percentage frequency of uranium present in the tested samples this indicates that at lower uranium concentrations the distribution frequency is becoming more the uranium distribution in groundwater of the study area was not normal due to the non linear cumulative percentage frequency 4 1 correlations coefficient fig 7 and fig 8 shows the correlation relationship with other parameters where r 0 5 with uranium for both winter and summer season a significant correlation of uranium and other physicochemical parameters was found in winter season correlation of tds mg2 and uranium have been clearly observed however in the summer season the parameters are more rather than tds mg2 and uranium there were ca2 cl so4 2 and no3 in this context we can conclude that the correlation of uranium with magnesium is clearly observed uranium shows a good positive correlation r 0 7 with magnesium in winter and summer these parameters play an important role in uranium contamination in the groundwater of the study area it is observed that there is no correlation of uranium with ph in both the seasons so a scientific study of the correlation of quality parameters not only helps in assessing the overall water quality but also determines the relative concentrations of different pollutants in water and provides the essential clues needed for the implementation of water quality management programs 4 2 piper diagram for classification of groundwater the groundwater types of the study area were classified by using piper diagrams for both seasons winter and summer during this graphical illustration the cations and anions are shown by separate ternary plots and their combinations create a diamond shape combined cations and anions proportion fig 6 shows trilinear piper plot of ionic compositions of the groundwater of kanker district throughout winter and summer respectively the piper diagram of the kanker district shows that the calcium and magnesium are the dominating cations bicarbonate and chloride are the dominating anions respectively in most of the samples overall we can say that groundwater is mixed type in nature apart from this in some areas groundwater was recorded cacl2 type in nature and in some of the areas it is ca hco3 2 type in nature besides nahco3 type in nature was also observed in few places 5 conclusion the measured level of uranium in one water samples during winter and two water samples taken in summer from the selected regions showed a slightly higher value than the safe limit prescribed by aerb and dae 2004 it has been observed that higher uranium concentrations have been recorded in the summer as compared to winter due to the recharge of rainwater the dilution takes place and uranium concentration getting low in winter the concentration of uranium is non uniformly distributed in groundwater of the study area in the correlation study all the parameters are less or more correlated with each other especially a good correlation of uranium with magnesium has been observed the correlation reflects the spatial variations in groundwater of the study area a higher value of physicochemical parameters is also due to the natural minerals dissolved in the tested samples a broad dispersion of the major ionic composition in the groundwater reflects the various hydrogeochemical processes involved in the studied area the piper diagram exhibits that the groundwater is mixed type cacl2 type ca hco3 2 type and nahco3 in nature for both the seasons the above study suggests the necessity for monitoring the nature of groundwater continuously which will further help to discuss the planning and development of water management schemes and pollution prevention measures funding sources this work was supported by board of research in nuclear science department of atomic energy government of

lands there are potential pollutants in groundwater the observed nitrate level of samples ranges between 0 5 and 32 8 mg l and 0 5 34 4 mg l during winter and summer respectively due to the anthropogenic activities the tested samples showed a high amount of nitrates the observed fluoride content ranges from 0 05 mg l to 0 8 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 0 9 mg l whereas the amount of phosphate varies between 0 5 and 1 2 mg l and 0 4 1 2 mg l during winter and summer respectively the value of sodium content which was identified in the tested samples ranging from 6 1 to 26 4 mg l and 7 7 27 mg l whereas the level of potassium was ranging from 1 2 mg l to 5 mg l and 1 5 mg l to 5 1 mg l during winter and summer respectively in all the samples of the study area the sulfate nitrate chloride and fluoride concentration were observed under the acceptable limit recommended by the bureau of indian standard 2012 observed data indicates that no major changes in the physicochemical properties of groundwater samples were seen in both the seasons fig 5 shows the frequency distribution and cumulative percentage frequency of uranium present in the tested samples this indicates that at lower uranium concentrations the distribution frequency is becoming more the uranium distribution in groundwater of the study area was not normal due to the non linear cumulative percentage frequency 4 1 correlations coefficient fig 7 and fig 8 shows the correlation relationship with other parameters where r 0 5 with uranium for both winter and summer season a significant correlation of uranium and other physicochemical parameters was found in winter season correlation of tds mg2 and uranium have been clearly observed however in the summer season the parameters are more rather than tds mg2 and uranium there were ca2 cl so4 2 and no3 in this context we can conclude that the correlation of uranium with magnesium is clearly observed uranium shows a good positive correlation r 0 7 with magnesium in winter and summer these parameters play an important role in uranium contamination in the groundwater of the study area it is observed that there is no correlation of uranium with ph in both the seasons so a scientific study of the correlation of quality parameters not only helps in assessing the overall water quality but also determines the relative concentrations of different pollutants in water and provides the essential clues needed for the implementation of water quality management programs 4 2 piper diagram for classification of groundwater the groundwater types of the study area were classified by using piper diagrams for both seasons winter and summer during this graphical illustration the cations and anions are shown by separate ternary plots and their combinations create a diamond shape combined cations and anions proportion fig 6 shows trilinear piper plot of ionic compositions of the groundwater of kanker district throughout winter and summer respectively the piper diagram of the kanker district shows that the calcium and magnesium are the dominating cations bicarbonate and chloride are the dominating anions respectively in most of the samples overall we can say that groundwater is mixed type in nature apart from this in some areas groundwater was recorded cacl2 type in nature and in some of the areas it is ca hco3 2 type in nature besides nahco3 type in nature was also observed in few places 5 conclusion the measured level of uranium in one water samples during winter and two water samples taken in summer from the selected regions showed a slightly higher value than the safe limit prescribed by aerb and dae 2004 it has been observed that higher uranium concentrations have been recorded in the summer as compared to winter due to the recharge of rainwater the dilution takes place and uranium concentration getting low in winter the concentration of uranium is non uniformly distributed in groundwater of the study area in the correlation study all the parameters are less or more correlated with each other especially a good correlation of uranium with magnesium has been observed the correlation reflects the spatial variations in groundwater of the study area a higher value of physicochemical parameters is also due to the natural minerals dissolved in the tested samples a broad dispersion of the major ionic composition in the groundwater reflects the various hydrogeochemical processes involved in the studied area the piper diagram exhibits that the groundwater is mixed type cacl2 type ca hco3 2 type and nahco3 in nature for both the seasons the above study suggests the necessity for monitoring the nature of groundwater continuously which will further help to discuss the planning and development of water management schemes and pollution prevention measures funding sources this work was supported by board of research in nuclear science department of atomic energy government of

12156,rice is a recognised hyperaccumulator of arsenic as and is a serious concern for rice varieties grown in as contaminated soil water systems in this regard groundwater soil and rice plant samples two varieties pr122 and pusa1121 collected from 10 sites of district bathinda were studied for their physicochemical characteristics and as concentration in vitro studies were carried out to study the role of antioxidant enzymes in as uptake and translocation mechanism the results showed that the as concentration in water and soil samples ranged from 54 to 132 μg l and 6 62 19 56 mg kg respectively the as in rice roots straw husk and grains of pr122 ranged from 1 89 to 8 56 0 20 5 3 0 12 1 42 0 0 12 mg kg respectively and 1 24 8 16 0 54 5 11 0 11 1 06 mg kg and below detection limit bdl respectively for pusa1121 although a moderate correlation r 0 37 was observed between as in groundwater and soil the higher as concentration found in both media in behman and teona areas indicates that we cannot ignore the role of groundwater in as contamination spearman correlation analysis indicates the positive impact of as from groundwater and soil in aerial parts of both rice varieties except grains in vitro studies showed an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities with the increase in as toxicity 15 60 μm which indicates as tolerant behaviour in both rice varieties the hazard quotient hq for both rice varieties is 1 which suggest no potential non cancer health risk however the cancer risk cr for pr122 variety exceeded 2 06 10 4 the acceptable limit of 1 10 4 usepa based on the present study it can be concluded that both the rice varieties are tolerant to as and their grains are safe for human consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic rice translocation antioxidants oxidative stress 1 introduction environmental contamination with as is a global issue due to its highly toxic nature and carcinogenic potential the exposure to as through the drinking of contaminated water is well documented the accumulation of as in staple foods can be another exposure route to humans arsenic enters into water bodies and agricultural soil via both natural such as weathering of rocks and minerals geothermal activities volcanic eruptions geomorphology and mining etc as well as anthropogenic sources such as phosphate fertilizers insecticides arsenical pesticides industrial waste sewage sludge incineration wood treatment and feed additives etc wang and mulligan 2006 kaur et al 2017 arsenic naturally occurs in soils and the worldwide average as concentration in the soils is around 5 mg kg heikens 2006 although this can vary depending on the origin and influence of other factors in soils the rice a staple food of south east asia population s is highly efficient in assimilating as into its grains than other crops and hence creates the risk of as toxicity sahoo et al 2013 meharg and meharg 2015 kumarathilaka et al 2019 arsenic mobility in soil and its uptake in rice plants is influenced by several factors like ph soil organic matter som soil texture silica phosphate po4 3 sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 as speciation inorganic and organic forms redox chemistry fe mn oxides fe plaque formation etc sahoo and kim 2013 kumar et al 2016 yu et al 2016 the mobile as is taken up by rice plants and impact negatively on their yield and quality chen et al 2016 some studies have reported the positive relationship between as in irrigation water soil and rice plants meharg and rahman 2003 dittmar et al 2010 however other studies have noticed poor relation between soil as and rice plants patel et al 2005 van geen et al 2006 also the irrigation condition is considered as one of the significant factors controlling soil as mobility the flooded conditions have been reported to increase the as mobility by reductive dissolution of fe hydroxides sahoo and kim 2013 therefore it is essential to study the soil physicochemical characteristics and its binding affinity for as along with other factors in the local environment several studies have been conducted with different rice varieties to study as presence in aerial parts especially grains as the permissible limit of as in grains is 1 0 mg kg and its maximum consumption limit through food for humans is 0 2 mg kg day food and agriculture organization world health organization jecfa 2014 some studies have shown the transfer of as from water soil to rice grains whereas in others as translocation was limited up to stem or husk vicky singh et al 2010 sandhi et al 2017 shrivastava et al 2017 this indicates that as transport from irrigation water soil to rice is not straightforward rather it is mainly influenced by soil rhizospheric biogeochemical factors and genetic properties of the plant kalita et al 2018 kumarathilaka et al 2019 the soil rhizospheric microorganisms affect as bioavailability and soil plant translocation by different transformation pathways like methylation oxidation reduction and volatilization ayangbenro and babalola 2017 further antioxidant defence and detoxification mechanism efflux complexation transformation and sequestration of the plant also influence the as uptake and translocation kumarathilaka et al 2019 the different rice varieties have different uptake mechanism which influences as translocation within the plant bhattacharya et al 2010a therefore it is important to study different rice varieties grown in as contaminated areas to understand their as uptake and translocation potential from soil to grains this will help in producing rice varieties with low as contents via physicochemical agronomical and breeding approaches in india around 394 rice varieties are grown in different agro climatic zones the popularly grown varieties are partheeksha rajlaxmi crhr 7 iet 13901 birsa dhan 108 br 2655 hpr 2143 vivek dhan 154 oonam pr118 indra sona corh 3 pau 201 csr 22 drrh 3 pusa basmati 6 cnr 2 arb 6 sava 127 basmati 564

μg kg and 1 01 13 95 μg kg respectively however these studies have not specified the rice varieties therefore more studies are required where the rice is grown in as contaminated regions the bathinda district of punjab india is one such area having as contamination in irrigation water and soil the high concentration of as in groundwater up to 688 μg l hundal et al 2007 vicky singh et al 2010 and soil 27 47 mg kg kumar et al 2016 have been reported the presence of alluvial sediments and sulphide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrites in the subsurface have been reported as the major geogenic sources of as in the region hundal et al 2007 2013 kaur et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 further the presence of as up to 0 22 mg kg in phosphate fertilizers used in the region are major anthropogenic source mittal et al 2014 kaur et al 2019 the area is epicenter of many human diseases such as skin lesions reproductive abnormalities and miscarriages circulatory disorders neurological and behavioural disorders premature hair greying respiratory complications etc the human exposure to high as levels via dermal drinking and ingestion may be one of the cause of these diseases mittal et al 2014 abdul et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 hence it is necessary to study the as levels in drinking water and foodstuffs especially rice varieties in the region though various improved rice varieties pr124 pr122 pr123 pr118 pr111 pr113 pr115 pusa basmati and pusa1121 etc are cultivated in punjab india pr122 and pusa1121 are the majorly grown varieties in the bathinda district of punjab however no studies are available on these varieties for as translocation keeping in view of the as contamination in the irrigation water soil of the region and wide cultivation of pr122 and pusa1121 rice varieties in the area it is imperative to study its translocation and accumulation behaviour in these varieties further determining the potential health risk for the consumers of these rice varieties is also essential the present study aims to characterize as concentration in irrigation water soil and different parts of two rice varieties non basmati pr122 and basmati pusa1121 collected from as contaminated sites of bathinda the main objectives were to understand i the geochemical relation between as in irrigation water soil and plant systems ii translocation behaviour of these two rice varieties and iii the role of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defence mechanism in as translocation through in vitro experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field studies study area bathinda

district is under rice cultivation agriculture of punjab statistics 2018 19 pr122 and pusa1121 are the major rice varieties grown in bathinda and talwandi sabo blocks of this district due to the advantage of their early maturing punjab agriculture university ludhiana india has developed pr122 whereas pusa1121 is the product of indian agricultural research institute new delhi the groundwater extracted using tubewells is one of the major sources of irrigation water most of the tubewells 88 are installed at shallow depth 20 70 m the study area has both confined and unconfined aquifers cgwb 2017 the conventional method of rice cultivation used in the area is flood irrigation 2 1 1 collection of soil water and plant samples twenty groundwater samples one from each grid of size 8 8 km were collected from bathinda and talwandi sabo block of bathinda district covering an area of 1262 km2 based on the as concentration in these samples ten sites having high concentration of as exceeding the maximum consumption limit for india 50 μg l unicef 2008 and common source of irrigation water for both rice varieties were selected for further study the soil and rice pr122 and pusa1121 plant samples were collected from these ten sites in triplicates within same field during october november 2016 rice harvesting period the sampling locations were mapped using arc gis 10 5 software fig 1 the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater was measured at the sampling sites using calibrated multi parameter pcstestr 35 further two water samples one for as estimation and another for physicochemical parameters were collected from each site the samples were collected in polypropylene pp bottles pre cleaned with 10 nitric acid v v followed by washing with double distilled water and oven dried at 40 c at sampling site before sample collection the pre cleaned pp bottles were first rinsed with tubewell water after flushing it for 3 5 min samples for as estimation were immediately acidified with 1 n hno3 shotyk et al 2006 after that all water samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c till further analysis rice plants along with their respective rhizospheric soil samples 3 plants and soil samples from each site were collected with the help of stainless steel auger in a double sealed plastic bag and transported to the laboratory the plant parts viz root stem husk and grains dehusked were separated and washed thoroughly with acidified and double distilled water to remove all the chemicals and dust particles these were further dried in hot air oven at 60 c and finely ground the ground samples were stored for as analysis similarly the soil samples were air dried at room temperature disaggregated with pestle and mortar and sieved through 2 mm mesh and stored in new polythene bags for chemical analysis vicky singh et al 2010 2 1 2 physicochemical analysis of groundwater and soil samples the ph and ec of collected samples were determined by is

in groundwater soil and plant samples arsenic concentration in groundwater soil and plant samples was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas model aa 7000 shimadzu kyoto japan all the water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filter to separate any precipitates if present and then subjected for aas analysis soil samples were digested with aqua regia 3 1 concentrated hcl hno3 mixture whereas plant parts were digested with a mixture of hno3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hcl in a microwave digester after digestion the solution was cooled by adding 25 ml double distilled water and filtered through whatman filter paper no 1 and further subjected to aas analysis by graphite furnace analyser gfa method the scarce amount of silicate residue was found after soil digestion so soil as is considered as pseudo total boim et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 quality control was examined using duplicate samples and replicated analyses of certified standard reference materials

light photoperiod and 50 relative humidity each experiment was repeated twice and three replicates were maintained for each treatment including control after seven days of growth root and shoot tissues were harvested for further studies kaur et al 2013 percent seed germination germinated seeds total seeds sown was calculated by manual counting 2 2 2 h2o2 content and lipid peroxidation assessment h2o2 content was determined using extinction coefficient of 0 28 μm 1cm 1 and expressed as nm g 1 f wt fresh weight velikova et al 2000 lipid peroxidation was determined in terms of malondialdehyde mda content using the extinction coefficient 155 mm 1 cm 1 and expressed as nm g 1 f wt by the method of heath and packer 1968 2 2 3 enzyme extraction and antioxidant enzyme assays plant material 100 mg homogenized in 5 ml of 0 1 m phosphate buffer ph 7 0 was centrifuged at 15 000 g for 20 min the supernatant was stored at 4 c for biochemical studies superoxide dismutase sod ec

acceptable or tolerable cr ranges from 10 6 to 10 4 in general cancer risks are considered to be negligible if cr 10 6 however if cr 10 4 cancer risks are considered as unacceptable by most international regulatory agencies usepa 2001 3 statistical analysis spearman correlation matrix scm was performed for evaluating the association between water and soil parameters as well as as concentration in plant parts using xlstat 19 the in vitro experiments were carried out in a completely randomized block design with three replicates and performed twice one way anova was employed to test differences in enzyme activities at different as levels post hoc multiple comparisons with tukey s test were applied using spss software to determine the differences among the treatments at significance level p 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical properties of groundwater and soil the ph of groundwater 7 09 8 12 and soil 7 94 8 73 indicated that the samples were predominantly alkaline the ec 1145 2496 μs cm of groundwater was comparatively higher than soil 360 543 μs cm the tds and salinity of groundwater samples were in the range of 765 1679 mg l and 554 1254 mg l respectively in soil samples om varied from 1 34 to 2 89 whereas total n available p and k was in the range of 0 017 0 098 69 5 145 mg kg and 173 452 mg kg respectively table 1 4 2 arsenic concentration and distribution in groundwater and soil arsenic concentration in groundwater and soil is listed in table 1 and its spatial distribution is illustrated in fig 1 the as concentration in groundwater varied from 54 to 132 μg l which exceeded the who 2011 drinking water limit previous studies in groundwater of bathinda region have also reported higher levels of as in the range of 5 688 μg l vicky singh et al 2010 hundal et al 2013 the concentration of as in the soil samples varied from 6 62 to 19 56 mg kg which is corroborated with the previous report of kumar et al 2016 who reported as concentration in the range of 2 28 27 47 mg kg the alkaline ph evaporative environment elevated level of dissolved salts competing ions po4 3 so4 2 are the likely factors influencing as distribution in the study area as supported by the study of hundal et al 2007 the spearman correlation matrix depicted a moderate association between soil ph and soil as r 0 52 table 3 a most of the soil samples were alkaline which facilitates the adsorption of as species in soils zhang and selim 2005 this possibly may have caused positive correlation between them previous studies from the bathinda and its adjoining regions by vicky singh et al 2010 and sidhu et al 2012 have reported that the elevated concentration of as in paddy soil is attributed by groundwater in the present study the moderate correlation r 0 37 between groundwater and soil as indicates that groundwater partially contributed to the as built up in the soils table 3a however the spatial distribution map shows the higher soil as concentration in behman and teona areas where groundwater contains higher concentrations of as it reflects that we cannot ignore the role of irrigation water in as contamination fig 1 furthermore since the soil samples were collected during harvesting so most probably the as from soil may have leached down due to its poor retention capacity similar observation has been made by kumar et al 2016 in the same study area further weak correlation r 0 10 was observed between soil as with som it may be due to the less immobilizing potential of as by fe oxides under the strong influence of humic substance competitive behaviour with as kar et al 2011 similarly the weak correlation r 0 24 of soil as with available p indicates that some part of the soil as may have been mobilized by po4 3 table 3a it is an established fact that higher po4 3 levels in soil enhance as release through competitive anion exchange peryea and kam mereck 1997 vithanage et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 a moderate correlation was observed between soil as and soil n nitrogen cycling i e nitrification denitrification and ammonification could affect the process of fe redox cycling high levels of no3 may decrease fe ii reduction and ultimately uptake and accumulation of as in paddy soil water systems yu et al 2016 furtheremore presence of mn oxides so4 2 reduction and formation of thiol rich peptides also influence mobilization of soil as the mn oxides work via oxidation of as iii into as v and then complexation of as v kumarathilaka et al 2018a the reduction of so4 2 to sulphide s2 by sulphate reducing bacteria under flooded conditions enhances as immobilization by precipitation of as iii kumarathilaka et al 2018b 4 3 arsenic concentration and translocation in plant parts in pr122 the majority of as deposited in roots 1 89 8 56 mg kg and thereafter a small fraction of as translocated to straw 0 2 5 3 mg kg followed by husk 0 12 1 42 mg kg and grains 0 0 12 mg kg irrespective of limited as translocation positive correlation existed soil as vs roots r2 0 59 roots vs shoots r2 0 86 shoots vs husk r2 0 84 husk vs grains r2 0 82 and soil as vs grains r2 0 47 table 2 and fig 2 a e similar trend w r t as accumulation translocation and correlation was observed in pusa1121 except for husk vs grains and soil as vs grains table 2 and fig 2f j the spearman correlation coefficient between soil as and pr122 and pusa1121 roots was 0 78 and 0 70 respectively table 3b similarly correlation coefficient values between soil as and pr122 and pusa1121 shoots were 0 71 and 0 67 respectively a moderate correlation was observed between groundwater as and roots of pr122 0 66 and pusa1121 0 67 spearman correlation coefficient between groundwater as and pr122 straw was 0 73 whereas between groundwater as and pusa1121 straw was 0 52 it indicates that as in both groundwater and soil has a positive impact on the roots of both varieties table 3b however there was a total change in scenario once as entered in the plant tissues the tf between soil root root straw and straw husk varied from 0 19 to 0 56 0 11 0 64 and 0 26 0 60 in pr122 and 0 19 0 56 0 22 0 69 and 0 20 0 66 in pusa1121 table 2 the tf 1 indicates poor as translocation from roots to the aerial parts the tf soil grain is the most crucial data to be considered while assessing the risk of rice consumption current findings reported tf soil grain in the range of 0 0 007 and bdl in pr122 and pusa1121 respectively the tf from soil to aerial parts of rice is influenced by several factors like soil as concentration the ability of plants to induce antioxidant enzymes phytochelatins production etc gupta and ahmad 2014 dubey et al 2016 paulelli et al 2019 further thiol rich peptides formed due to sulphur supplementation of paddy soils may also have reduced as translocation from roots to grains because of their high affinity for as iii zhang et al 2011 kumarathilaka et al 2018a the less as concentration in grain samples as compared to straw samples appears to be a natural system of plants to retain more as in straw inedible part vicky singh et al 2010 4 4 in vitro studies oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defence besides the physicochemical properties as uptake by plants is also controlled by tolerance mechanisms physiological biochemical taking place in different plant tissues these physiological and biochemical changes not only affect metal uptake but also affect its transfer from roots to shoots hence the present study extends to understand the translocation mechanism of arsenate to plants at laboratory scale arsenate treated seeds showed no significant effect on percent germination at a lower concentration of 15 μm in both pr122 and pusa1121 however the highest as treatment 60 μm significantly reduced the percent germination in both varieties this means the percent germination will be affected if the as concentration is very high in the fields this high concentration of as eventually accounts for the death of seed tissues and inhibition of seed germination because as is a metabolic inhibitor once as enters the cytoplasm it competes with phosphate in atp and disrupts the energy synthesis of the seeds gupta and ahmad 2014 the 15 60 μm of as treatment enhanced the h2o2 content by 1 14 1 84 and 1 25 2 29 folds in pr122 and pusa1121 respectively the increase in h2o2 content up to a certain level helps the plant in stress acclimation by providing tolerance against stress similarly the mda content also increased significantly in all arsenate treated seedlings table 4 the increased mda content indicates membrane damage due to the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa and lipids moller et al 2007 majumder et al 2019 significant variations were observed in the activities of different antioxidant enzymes w r t arsenate treatments the activities of sod apx gpx and gr enhanced continuously with an increase in as concentration 15 60 μm in roots and shoots of pr122 and pusa1121 table 5 cat activity in pr122 roots and shoots increased by 1 47 and 2 67 folds up to 30 μm as exposure and further declined at 60 μm however in pusa1121 cat activity continuously increased in roots and shoots and was highest at 60 μm treatment table 5 the activities of these enzymes were more in the roots as compared to shoots this is primarily because the roots are in direct contact with as source hence high stress is caused by the as entering into roots the roots combat as induced toxicity as by activating defence mechanism once the as enters the roots only a part of as available in roots is translocated to shoots since less as is available in shoots the stress level is less compared to roots hence the enhancement in the activities of antioxidant enzymes also decreases the elevated antioxidant enzyme production is responsible for the efficient scavenging of h2o2 sod provides the first line of defence against the cellular injury and this enzyme is the major superoxide scavenger sod catalyzes the dismutation of o2 to o2 and h2o2 the increased sod activity is correlated with efficient scavenging of superoxide radicals which provides tolerance to the plant against stress majumder et al 2019 the up regulation in apx and gpx in the present study indicates their role in h2o2 detoxification dave et al 2013 gr is indirectly involved in h2o2 detoxification by regenerating glutathione and assists apx in reducing h2o2 to h2o by ascorbate asa glutathione cycle ascorbic acid provides membrane protection by directly reacting with o2 h2o2 and regenerates α tocopherol from tocopheroxyl radical and preserves the activity of the enzymes that contain prosthetic transition metal ions noctor and foyer 1998 glutathione gsh functions as a free radical scavenger by reacting chemically with o2 h2o2 and oh it protects lipids protein and dna either by the formation of adducts directly with reactive electrophiles glutathiolation or by acting as a proton donor in the presence of ros reactive oxygen species or organic free radicals yielding glutathione disulfide it also participates in the regeneration of another potential antioxidant asa via asa gsh cycle in presence of dehydroascorbate reductase dhar gill and tuteja 2010 the decrease in cat may be caused by degradation by peroxisomal protease or due to enzyme photo inactivation some studies have already reported that the production and activity of antioxidant enzymes determine the as tolerant or sensitive behaviour of rice varieties rai et al 2011 suriyagoda et al 2018 majumder et al 2019 arsenic tolerant varieties show a significant increase in enzyme activities and can accumulate more as as compared to susceptible varieties rai et al 2011 majumder et al 2019 rai et al 2011 differentiated triguna ir 36 and pnr 519 as tolerant rice varieties and iet 4786 as sensitive varieties based on antioxidant enzyme activities which were increased significantly in tolerant varieties and decreased in susceptible varieties 4 5 health risk due to dietary intake of as contaminated rice grains determining as exposure level for humans is of great concern in health risk assessment studies the edi of as for pr122 rice variety is 1 37 10 4 mg kg day the hq 0 45 calculated for pr122 is 1 which suggests no potential non cancer health risk cancer risk cr posed by as uptake is 2 06 10 4 two cases of cancer occurrence out of 10 000 persons and exceeded the acceptable limit i e 1 10 4 usepa 2001 sharma et al 2017 also reported hq 1 and cr above the usepa limit in residents of ropar wetland india who consume as contaminated rice sharafi et al 2019 also found cr of as in indian iranian and pakistani rice samples to be 2 54 10 4 2 30 10 4 and 3 81 10 4 respectively higher than the acceptable limit and suggested that attention must be paid to reduce as in rice varieties through interventions the edi hq and cr could not be calculated for the pusa1121 variety as the as concentration in its grains was bdl furthermore the presence of high levels of as in the rice straw may also pose a potential threat to animals that consume the contaminated straw and thus indirectly can affect human beings via contaminated bovine meat and milk bhattacharya et al 2009 however rice straw intake cannot be a major route of as entry to animals in this region as it is not being used as major fodder due to very high amount of silica kaur 2017 5 conclusion the sources of as in soil and groundwater in the study area are both geogenic as well as anthropogenic spatial distribution shows that higher soil as concentration is directly related to the higher as contaminated groundwater samples the alkaline ph som and available p are responsible for poor retention and enhanced leaching of as from soil to groundwater in both the rice varieties the roots are the primary sites of as deposition and translocation decreases from roots to grains the less as translocation in aerial parts as may be due to enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities as revealed by in vitro studies the negligible bdl concentration in grains of pusa1121 makes it safer for human consumption compared to pr122 nevertheless both pr122 and pusa1121 are less as accumulator and may be suitable for cultivation in other as contaminated areas of punjab further early maturing behaviour of these varieties would also help the farmers economically acknowledgment this work was supported financially by a research grant 20 26 12 2012 bsr

12156,rice is a recognised hyperaccumulator of arsenic as and is a serious concern for rice varieties grown in as contaminated soil water systems in this regard groundwater soil and rice plant samples two varieties pr122 and pusa1121 collected from 10 sites of district bathinda were studied for their physicochemical characteristics and as concentration in vitro studies were carried out to study the role of antioxidant enzymes in as uptake and translocation mechanism the results showed that the as concentration in water and soil samples ranged from 54 to 132 μg l and 6 62 19 56 mg kg respectively the as in rice roots straw husk and grains of pr122 ranged from 1 89 to 8 56 0 20 5 3 0 12 1 42 0 0 12 mg kg respectively and 1 24 8 16 0 54 5 11 0 11 1 06 mg kg and below detection limit bdl respectively for pusa1121 although a moderate correlation r 0 37 was observed between as in groundwater and soil the higher as concentration found in both media in behman and teona areas indicates that we cannot ignore the role of groundwater in as contamination spearman correlation analysis indicates the positive impact of as from groundwater and soil in aerial parts of both rice varieties except grains in vitro studies showed an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities with the increase in as toxicity 15 60 μm which indicates as tolerant behaviour in both rice varieties the hazard quotient hq for both rice varieties is 1 which suggest no potential non cancer health risk however the cancer risk cr for pr122 variety exceeded 2 06 10 4 the acceptable limit of 1 10 4 usepa based on the present study it can be concluded that both the rice varieties are tolerant to as and their grains are safe for human consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic rice translocation antioxidants oxidative stress 1 introduction environmental contamination with as is a global issue due to its highly toxic nature and carcinogenic potential the exposure to as through the drinking of contaminated water is well documented the accumulation of as in staple foods can be another exposure route to humans arsenic enters into water bodies and agricultural soil via both natural such as weathering of rocks and minerals geothermal activities volcanic eruptions geomorphology and mining etc as well as anthropogenic sources such as phosphate fertilizers insecticides arsenical pesticides industrial waste sewage sludge incineration wood treatment and feed additives etc wang and mulligan 2006 kaur et al 2017 arsenic naturally occurs in soils and the worldwide average as concentration in the soils is around 5 mg kg heikens 2006 although this can vary depending on the origin and influence of other factors in soils the rice a staple food of south east asia population s is highly efficient in assimilating as into its grains than other crops and hence creates the risk of as toxicity sahoo et al 2013 meharg and meharg 2015 kumarathilaka et al 2019 arsenic mobility in soil and its uptake in rice plants is influenced by several factors like ph soil organic matter som soil texture silica phosphate po4 3 sulphate so4 2 nitrate no3 as speciation inorganic and organic forms redox chemistry fe mn oxides fe plaque formation etc sahoo and kim 2013 kumar et al 2016 yu et al 2016 the mobile as is taken up by rice plants and impact negatively on their yield and quality chen et al 2016 some studies have reported the positive relationship between as in irrigation water soil and rice plants meharg and rahman 2003 dittmar et al 2010 however other studies have noticed poor relation between soil as and rice plants patel et al 2005 van geen et al 2006 also the irrigation condition is considered as one of the significant factors controlling soil as mobility the flooded conditions have been reported to increase the as mobility by reductive dissolution of fe hydroxides sahoo and kim 2013 therefore it is essential to study the soil physicochemical characteristics and its binding affinity for as along with other factors in the local environment several studies have been conducted with different rice varieties to study as presence in aerial parts especially grains as the permissible limit of as in grains is 1 0 mg kg and its maximum consumption limit through food for humans is 0 2 mg kg day food and agriculture organization world health organization jecfa 2014 some studies have shown the transfer of as from water soil to rice grains whereas in others as translocation was limited up to stem or husk vicky singh et al 2010 sandhi et al 2017 shrivastava et al 2017 this indicates that as transport from irrigation water soil to rice is not straightforward rather it is mainly influenced by soil rhizospheric biogeochemical factors and genetic properties of the plant kalita et al 2018 kumarathilaka et al 2019 the soil rhizospheric microorganisms affect as bioavailability and soil plant translocation by different transformation pathways like methylation oxidation reduction and volatilization ayangbenro and babalola 2017 further antioxidant defence and detoxification mechanism efflux complexation transformation and sequestration of the plant also influence the as uptake and translocation kumarathilaka et al 2019 the different rice varieties have different uptake mechanism which influences as translocation within the plant bhattacharya et al 2010a therefore it is important to study different rice varieties grown in as contaminated areas to understand their as uptake and translocation potential from soil to grains this will help in producing rice varieties with low as contents via physicochemical agronomical and breeding approaches in india around 394 rice varieties are grown in different agro climatic zones the popularly grown varieties are partheeksha rajlaxmi crhr 7 iet 13901 birsa dhan 108 br 2655 hpr 2143 vivek dhan 154 oonam pr118 indra sona corh 3 pau 201 csr 22 drrh 3 pusa basmati 6 cnr 2 arb 6 sava 127 basmati 564

μg kg and 1 01 13 95 μg kg respectively however these studies have not specified the rice varieties therefore more studies are required where the rice is grown in as contaminated regions the bathinda district of punjab india is one such area having as contamination in irrigation water and soil the high concentration of as in groundwater up to 688 μg l hundal et al 2007 vicky singh et al 2010 and soil 27 47 mg kg kumar et al 2016 have been reported the presence of alluvial sediments and sulphide minerals such as pyrite and arsenopyrites in the subsurface have been reported as the major geogenic sources of as in the region hundal et al 2007 2013 kaur et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 further the presence of as up to 0 22 mg kg in phosphate fertilizers used in the region are major anthropogenic source mittal et al 2014 kaur et al 2019 the area is epicenter of many human diseases such as skin lesions reproductive abnormalities and miscarriages circulatory disorders neurological and behavioural disorders premature hair greying respiratory complications etc the human exposure to high as levels via dermal drinking and ingestion may be one of the cause of these diseases mittal et al 2014 abdul et al 2015 kaur et al 2019 hence it is necessary to study the as levels in drinking water and foodstuffs especially rice varieties in the region though various improved rice varieties pr124 pr122 pr123 pr118 pr111 pr113 pr115 pusa basmati and pusa1121 etc are cultivated in punjab india pr122 and pusa1121 are the majorly grown varieties in the bathinda district of punjab however no studies are available on these varieties for as translocation keeping in view of the as contamination in the irrigation water soil of the region and wide cultivation of pr122 and pusa1121 rice varieties in the area it is imperative to study its translocation and accumulation behaviour in these varieties further determining the potential health risk for the consumers of these rice varieties is also essential the present study aims to characterize as concentration in irrigation water soil and different parts of two rice varieties non basmati pr122 and basmati pusa1121 collected from as contaminated sites of bathinda the main objectives were to understand i the geochemical relation between as in irrigation water soil and plant systems ii translocation behaviour of these two rice varieties and iii the role of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defence mechanism in as translocation through in vitro experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 field studies study area bathinda

district is under rice cultivation agriculture of punjab statistics 2018 19 pr122 and pusa1121 are the major rice varieties grown in bathinda and talwandi sabo blocks of this district due to the advantage of their early maturing punjab agriculture university ludhiana india has developed pr122 whereas pusa1121 is the product of indian agricultural research institute new delhi the groundwater extracted using tubewells is one of the major sources of irrigation water most of the tubewells 88 are installed at shallow depth 20 70 m the study area has both confined and unconfined aquifers cgwb 2017 the conventional method of rice cultivation used in the area is flood irrigation 2 1 1 collection of soil water and plant samples twenty groundwater samples one from each grid of size 8 8 km were collected from bathinda and talwandi sabo block of bathinda district covering an area of 1262 km2 based on the as concentration in these samples ten sites having high concentration of as exceeding the maximum consumption limit for india 50 μg l unicef 2008 and common source of irrigation water for both rice varieties were selected for further study the soil and rice pr122 and pusa1121 plant samples were collected from these ten sites in triplicates within same field during october november 2016 rice harvesting period the sampling locations were mapped using arc gis 10 5 software fig 1 the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater was measured at the sampling sites using calibrated multi parameter pcstestr 35 further two water samples one for as estimation and another for physicochemical parameters were collected from each site the samples were collected in polypropylene pp bottles pre cleaned with 10 nitric acid v v followed by washing with double distilled water and oven dried at 40 c at sampling site before sample collection the pre cleaned pp bottles were first rinsed with tubewell water after flushing it for 3 5 min samples for as estimation were immediately acidified with 1 n hno3 shotyk et al 2006 after that all water samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c till further analysis rice plants along with their respective rhizospheric soil samples 3 plants and soil samples from each site were collected with the help of stainless steel auger in a double sealed plastic bag and transported to the laboratory the plant parts viz root stem husk and grains dehusked were separated and washed thoroughly with acidified and double distilled water to remove all the chemicals and dust particles these were further dried in hot air oven at 60 c and finely ground the ground samples were stored for as analysis similarly the soil samples were air dried at room temperature disaggregated with pestle and mortar and sieved through 2 mm mesh and stored in new polythene bags for chemical analysis vicky singh et al 2010 2 1 2 physicochemical analysis of groundwater and soil samples the ph and ec of collected samples were determined by is

water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane filter to separate any precipitates if present and then subjected for aas analysis soil samples were digested with aqua regia 3 1 concentrated hcl hno3 mixture whereas plant parts were digested with a mixture of hno3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and hcl in a microwave digester after digestion the solution was cooled by adding 25 ml double distilled water and filtered through whatman filter paper no 1 and further subjected to aas analysis by graphite furnace analyser gfa method the scarce amount of silicate residue was found after soil digestion so soil as is considered as pseudo total boim et al 2018 sahoo et al 2019 quality control was examined using duplicate samples and replicated analyses of certified standard reference materials

acceptable or tolerable cr ranges from 10 6 to 10 4 in general cancer risks are considered to be negligible if cr 10 6 however if cr 10 4 cancer risks are considered as unacceptable by most international regulatory agencies usepa 2001 3 statistical analysis spearman correlation matrix scm was performed for evaluating the association between water and soil parameters as well as as concentration in plant parts using xlstat 19 the in vitro experiments were carried out in a completely randomized block design with three replicates and performed twice one way anova was employed to test differences in enzyme activities at different as levels post hoc multiple comparisons with tukey s test were applied using spss software to determine the differences among the treatments at significance level p 0 05 4 results and discussion 4 1 physicochemical properties of groundwater and soil the ph of groundwater 7 09 8 12 and soil 7 94 8 73 indicated that the samples were predominantly alkaline the ec 1145 2496 μs cm of groundwater was comparatively higher than soil 360 543 μs cm the tds and salinity of groundwater samples were in the range of 765 1679 mg l and 554 1254 mg l respectively in soil samples om varied from 1 34 to 2 89 whereas total n available p and k was in the range of 0 017 0 098 69 5 145 mg kg and 173 452 mg kg respectively table 1 4 2 arsenic concentration and distribution in groundwater and soil arsenic concentration in groundwater and soil is listed in table 1 and its spatial distribution is illustrated in fig 1 the as concentration in groundwater varied from 54 to 132 μg l which exceeded the who 2011 drinking water limit previous studies in groundwater of bathinda region have also reported higher levels of as in the range of 5 688 μg l vicky singh et al 2010 hundal et al 2013 the concentration of as in the soil samples varied from 6 62 to 19 56 mg kg which is corroborated with the previous report of kumar et al 2016 who reported as concentration in the range of 2 28 27 47 mg kg the alkaline ph evaporative environment elevated level of dissolved salts competing ions po4 3 so4 2 are the likely factors influencing as distribution in the study area as supported by the study of hundal et al 2007 the spearman correlation matrix depicted a moderate association between soil ph and soil as r 0 52 table 3 a most of the soil samples were alkaline which facilitates the adsorption of as species in soils zhang and selim 2005 this possibly may have caused positive correlation between them previous studies from the bathinda and its adjoining regions by vicky singh et al 2010 and sidhu et al 2012 have reported that the elevated concentration of as in paddy soil is attributed by groundwater in the present study the moderate correlation r 0 37 between groundwater and soil as indicates that groundwater partially contributed to the as built up in the soils table 3a however the spatial distribution map shows the higher soil as concentration in behman and teona areas where groundwater contains higher concentrations of as it reflects that we cannot ignore the role of irrigation water in as contamination fig 1 furthermore since the soil samples were collected during harvesting so most probably the as from soil may have leached down due to its poor retention capacity similar observation has been made by kumar et al 2016 in the same study area further weak correlation r 0 10 was observed between soil as with som it may be due to the less immobilizing potential of as by fe oxides under the strong influence of humic substance competitive behaviour with as kar et al 2011 similarly the weak correlation r 0 24 of soil as with available p indicates that some part of the soil as may have been mobilized by po4 3 table 3a it is an established fact that higher po4 3 levels in soil enhance as release through competitive anion exchange peryea and kam mereck 1997 vithanage et al 2014 kumar et al 2016 a moderate correlation was observed between soil as and soil n nitrogen cycling i e nitrification denitrification and ammonification could affect the process of fe redox cycling high levels of no3 may decrease fe ii reduction and ultimately uptake and accumulation of as in paddy soil water systems yu et al 2016 furtheremore presence of mn oxides so4 2 reduction and formation of thiol rich peptides also influence mobilization of soil as the mn oxides work via oxidation of as iii into as v and then complexation of as v kumarathilaka et al 2018a the reduction of so4 2 to sulphide s2 by sulphate reducing bacteria under flooded conditions enhances as immobilization by precipitation of as iii kumarathilaka et al 2018b 4 3 arsenic concentration and translocation in plant parts in pr122 the majority of as deposited in roots 1 89 8 56 mg kg and thereafter a small fraction of as translocated to straw 0 2 5 3 mg kg followed by husk 0 12 1 42 mg kg and grains 0 0 12 mg kg irrespective of limited as translocation positive correlation existed soil as vs roots r2 0 59 roots vs shoots r2 0 86 shoots vs husk r2 0 84 husk vs grains r2 0 82 and soil as vs grains r2 0 47 table 2 and fig 2 a e similar trend w r t as accumulation translocation and correlation was observed in pusa1121 except for husk vs grains and soil as vs grains table 2 and fig 2f j the spearman correlation coefficient between soil as and pr122 and pusa1121 roots was 0 78 and 0 70 respectively table 3b similarly correlation coefficient values between soil as and pr122 and pusa1121 shoots were 0 71 and 0 67 respectively a moderate correlation was observed between groundwater as and roots of pr122 0 66 and pusa1121 0 67 spearman correlation coefficient between groundwater as and pr122 straw was 0 73 whereas between groundwater as and pusa1121 straw was 0 52 it indicates that as in both groundwater and soil has a positive impact on the roots of both varieties table 3b however there was a total change in scenario once as entered in the plant tissues the tf between soil root root straw and straw husk varied from 0 19 to 0 56 0 11 0 64 and 0 26 0 60 in pr122 and 0 19 0 56 0 22 0 69 and 0 20 0 66 in pusa1121 table 2 the tf 1 indicates poor as translocation from roots to the aerial parts the tf soil grain is the most crucial data to be considered while assessing the risk of rice consumption current findings reported tf soil grain in the range of 0 0 007 and bdl in pr122 and pusa1121 respectively the tf from soil to aerial parts of rice is influenced by several factors like soil as concentration the ability of plants to induce antioxidant enzymes phytochelatins production etc gupta and ahmad 2014 dubey et al 2016 paulelli et al 2019 further thiol rich peptides formed due to sulphur supplementation of paddy soils may also have reduced as translocation from roots to grains because of their high affinity for as iii zhang et al 2011 kumarathilaka et al 2018a the less as concentration in grain samples as compared to straw samples appears to be a natural system of plants to retain more as in straw inedible part vicky singh et al 2010 4 4 in vitro studies oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defence besides the physicochemical properties as uptake by plants is also controlled by tolerance mechanisms physiological biochemical taking place in different plant tissues these physiological and biochemical changes not only affect metal uptake but also affect its transfer from roots to shoots hence the present study extends to understand the translocation mechanism of arsenate to plants at laboratory scale arsenate treated seeds showed no significant effect on percent germination at a lower concentration of 15 μm in both pr122 and pusa1121 however the highest as treatment 60 μm significantly reduced the percent germination in both varieties this means the percent germination will be affected if the as concentration is very high in the fields this high concentration of as eventually accounts for the death of seed tissues and inhibition of seed germination because as is a metabolic inhibitor once as enters the cytoplasm it competes with phosphate in atp and disrupts the energy synthesis of the seeds gupta and ahmad 2014 the 15 60 μm of as treatment enhanced the h2o2 content by 1 14 1 84 and 1 25 2 29 folds in pr122 and pusa1121 respectively the increase in h2o2 content up to a certain level helps the plant in stress acclimation by providing tolerance against stress similarly the mda content also increased significantly in all arsenate treated seedlings table 4 the increased mda content indicates membrane damage due to the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa and lipids moller et al 2007 majumder et al 2019 significant variations were observed in the activities of different antioxidant enzymes w r t arsenate treatments the activities of sod apx gpx and gr enhanced continuously with an increase in as concentration 15 60 μm in roots and shoots of pr122 and pusa1121 table 5 cat activity in pr122 roots and shoots increased by 1 47 and 2 67 folds up to 30 μm as exposure and further declined at 60 μm however in pusa1121 cat activity continuously increased in roots and shoots and was highest at 60 μm treatment table 5 the activities of these enzymes were more in the roots as compared to shoots this is primarily because the roots are in direct contact with as source hence high stress is caused by the as entering into roots the roots combat as induced toxicity as by activating defence mechanism once the as enters the roots only a part of as available in roots is translocated to shoots since less as is available in shoots the stress level is less compared to roots hence the enhancement in the activities of antioxidant enzymes also decreases the elevated antioxidant enzyme production is responsible for the efficient scavenging of h2o2 sod provides the first line of defence against the cellular injury and this enzyme is the major superoxide scavenger sod catalyzes the dismutation of o2 to o2 and h2o2 the increased sod activity is correlated with efficient scavenging of superoxide radicals which provides tolerance to the plant against stress majumder et al 2019 the up regulation in apx and gpx in the present study indicates their role in h2o2 detoxification dave et al 2013 gr is indirectly involved in h2o2 detoxification by regenerating glutathione and assists apx in reducing h2o2 to h2o by ascorbate asa glutathione cycle ascorbic acid provides membrane protection by directly reacting with o2 h2o2 and regenerates α tocopherol from tocopheroxyl radical and preserves the activity of the enzymes that contain prosthetic transition metal ions noctor and foyer 1998 glutathione gsh functions as a free radical scavenger by reacting chemically with o2 h2o2 and oh it protects lipids protein and dna either by the formation of adducts directly with reactive electrophiles glutathiolation or by acting as a proton donor in the presence of ros reactive oxygen species or organic free radicals yielding glutathione disulfide it also participates in the regeneration of another potential antioxidant asa via asa gsh cycle in presence of dehydroascorbate reductase dhar gill and tuteja 2010 the decrease in cat may be caused by degradation by peroxisomal protease or due to enzyme photo inactivation some studies have already reported that the production and activity of antioxidant enzymes determine the as tolerant or sensitive behaviour of rice varieties rai et al 2011 suriyagoda et al 2018 majumder et al 2019 arsenic tolerant varieties show a significant increase in enzyme activities and can accumulate more as as compared to susceptible varieties rai et al 2011 majumder et al 2019 rai et al 2011 differentiated triguna ir 36 and pnr 519 as tolerant rice varieties and iet 4786 as sensitive varieties based on antioxidant enzyme activities which were increased significantly in tolerant varieties and decreased in susceptible varieties 4 5 health risk due to dietary intake of as contaminated rice grains determining as exposure level for humans is of great concern in health risk assessment studies the edi of as for pr122 rice variety is 1 37 10 4 mg kg day the hq 0 45 calculated for pr122 is 1 which suggests no potential non cancer health risk cancer risk cr posed by as uptake is 2 06 10 4 two cases of cancer occurrence out of 10 000 persons and exceeded the acceptable limit i e 1 10 4 usepa 2001 sharma et al 2017 also reported hq 1 and cr above the usepa limit in residents of ropar wetland india who consume as contaminated rice sharafi et al 2019 also found cr of as in indian iranian and pakistani rice samples to be 2 54 10 4 2 30 10 4 and 3 81 10 4 respectively higher than the acceptable limit and suggested that attention must be paid to reduce as in rice varieties through interventions the edi hq and cr could not be calculated for the pusa1121 variety as the as concentration in its grains was bdl furthermore the presence of high levels of as in the rice straw may also pose a potential threat to animals that consume the contaminated straw and thus indirectly can affect human beings via contaminated bovine meat and milk bhattacharya et al 2009 however rice straw intake cannot be a major route of as entry to animals in this region as it is not being used as major fodder due to very high amount of silica kaur 2017 5 conclusion the sources of as in soil and groundwater in the study area are both geogenic as well as anthropogenic spatial distribution shows that higher soil as concentration is directly related to the higher as contaminated groundwater samples the alkaline ph som and available p are responsible for poor retention and enhanced leaching of as from soil to groundwater in both the rice varieties the roots are the primary sites of as deposition and translocation decreases from roots to grains the less as translocation in aerial parts as may be due to enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities as revealed by in vitro studies the negligible bdl concentration in grains of pusa1121 makes it safer for human consumption compared to pr122 nevertheless both pr122 and pusa1121 are less as accumulator and may be suitable for cultivation in other as contaminated

12157,to explore the influence of radioactive heavy minerals on thorium th and uranium u contamination in groundwater we performed geochemical and mineralogical investigations of core samples from the ground surface to 18 9 m depth from a paleobeach area in cox s bazar southeastern bangladesh geochemical data document elevated levels of total th 6 3 202 3 mg kg average 32 9 mg kg and u 1 1 33 4 mg kg average 5 2 mg kg and lithological observations document monazite concentrations as great as 2 36 wt and zircon concentrations as great as 3 82 wt these minerals were found in organic rich fine to very fine sand in the uppermost meter of the sediment column down to 1 2 m depth rather than in coarser sandy sediment energy dispersive spectroscopy of several monazite and zircon grains indicated that alteration was greater in oxic sediment down to 3 m depth than reduced sediment deeper than 3 m monazite and zircon had relatively high concentrations of th 3395 9 3937 5 mg kg and 275 5 318 4 mg kg respectively and u 850 7 990 6 mg kg and 256 3 290 5 mg kg respectively chemical weathering dissolution and reprecipitation of detrital monazite and zircon grains which releases u and th into the groundwater may be a major and growing concern for drinking water in the study area shallow tubewells 20 m depth waters were enriched in u 0 09 9 57 μg l and th 0 02 127 09 µg l and that the enrichment mostly occurred in highly oxic environments eh 0 35 0 5 v we suggest that hydrological and biogeochemical conditions in the aquifer that follow land use changes influence the release of th and u into the groundwater of the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords monazite zircon contamination radioactivity 1 introduction radioactivity occurs naturally in the earth s crust and surface environments some natural radionuclides such as th and u are minor components of heavy minerals and are closely associated with beach deposits in many places beach deposits occasionally concentrate these heavy minerals to economic levels in placer deposits that potentiallypose environmental hazards due to their natural radiation radhakrishna et al 1993 van duong et al 1996 malanca et al 1998 kannan et al 2002 freitas and alencar 2004 alencar and freitas 2005 vassas et al 2006 schmidt and asad 1962 reported the presence of radioactivity in beaches in bangladesh heavy mineral placer deposits in these localities are lens shaped deposits that range from a few centimeters to a meter in thickness and from a few meters to over 100 m in length zaman et al 2012 the bangladesh atomic energy commission reported heavy mineral placer deposits at 17 locations in beach areas of the southeastern and northern coastal belts of the bay of bengal and estimated that they contain 1 76 million tons of eight reserved economic minerals bari and chowdhuryrahman 2003 the beach sand deposits at cox s bazar were reported to contain 60 wt heavy minerals including magnetite ilmenite garnet zircon rutile leucoxene kyanite and monazite chowdhury 2003 of those minerals monazite and zircon were enriched in u and th biswas 1977 mitra and ahmed 1990 mitra and ahmedmonn 1992 alam et al 1999 bari and chowdhuryrahman 2003 chowdhury 2003 m rahman et al 1994 j rahman et al 2008 chowdhury 2003 2004 also reported that beach areas of the town of cox s bazar contain about 26 000 tons of zircon and 2000 tons of monazite constituting about 8 9 and 5 5 respectively of the total heavy mineral deposits there no previous work has characterized the geochemistry of these naturally occurring radioactive materials in the aquifer sediments at cox s bazar nor their relationship to groundwater contamination therefore we studied zircon and monazite in a continuous sediment core from the coastal region of cox s bazar covering the hotel motel zone and its adjoining beach area an area of about 7 km2 between 21 22 and 21 30 n and between 91 58 and 92 2 e fig 1 the area is bordered to the north and east by the bakkhali river to the west by the bay of bengal and to the south by the mouth of the jhilwangja stream the studied core sediments contained proportions of heavy minerals similar to those previously described seddique and hoque 2015 due to the rapid expansion of tourism and increasing population numerous accommodations have been built on land overlying heavy mineral placer deposits in the cox s bazar paleobeach which extends from the coastal foothills to modern beach areas groundwater is extensively exploited in this area for general water supplies several recent studies have highlighted that metamictization degradation of crystallinity is effective in releasing radionuclides from detrital monazite and zircon grains into groundwater via either coupled dissolution reprecipitation or solid state reaction read et al 1987 poitrasson et al 2000 hecht and cuney 2000 papoulis et al 2004 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 and references therein metamict monazite and zircon are more soluble than crystalline grains and are highly reactive in near surface tropical weathering conditions in sedimentary environments and radiation damaged regions of these minerals are preferentially dissolved hay and dempster 2009 zircon and monazite are highly radioactive minerals that represent potential sources of radioactivity in groundwater in the study area via dissolution or diagenetic alteration in the upper part of the aquifers which would release heavy and trace elements into the groundwater among those elements th and u are of particular concern as groundwater contaminants however in cases where groundwater has been in contact with the rock over hundreds or thousands of years significant concentrations may build up in the water recent studies point to the fact that groundwater in many parts of world is contaminated with radiaoactive heavy metals i e u th from natural and industrial sources atsdr 1999 exposure to u from drinking water is growing rapidly as more people increasingly rely on groundwater as their primary source of water ess 2011 mongolia and cox s bazar is an example where exposure of a large number of people to radioactive heavy metals i e u th risk is linked to increased exploitation of groundwater resources who 2005 seddique et al 2013 2016 exposure to th and u from drinking water may cause damage to the human body via dna damage that leads to increased risk of cancer adverse effects on the brain developmental defects and diminished bone growth zamora et al 1998 brugge and buchner 2011 observing the effects of chronic exposure to u through drinking water zamora et al 1998 concluded that even low u concentrations in drinking water caused nephrotoxic effects associated with alteration of proximal tubular functions long term exposure to th increases the chances of developing lung diseases and cancer of the lung pancreas and bones brugge and buchner 2011 quantifying these effects would require epidemiological studies in combination with the screening of groundwater supplies for radioactivity to understand the possible mechanisms of contamination we sought to characterize these radioactive minerals by measuring the concentrations of th and u in monazite and zircon grains in a sediment core collected from paleobeach deposits underneath the accommodation zone of cox s bazar geochemical and mineralogical studies of the sediment core and the separated minerals enabled us to evaluate possible impacts on groundwater aquifers from excessive use of groundwater in the area 2 study area from lithological observations of sediments in 18 boreholesand an electrical resistivity survey using vertical electrical sounding ves we identified six hydrostratigraphic units within 165 m of the ground surface including three major aquifers consisting of fine to medium sand fig 2 the unconfined upper aquifer is 5 15 m thick and is underlain by 5 to 20 m thick clay layers that serve as an impermeable aquitard between it and the uppermost confined aquifer middle aquifer the middle aquifer is 15 50 m thick and is present between 30 and 80 m depth this aquifer overlies unevenly distributed lenticular bodies of impermeable silty clay with thicknesses of 5 12 m that separate it from the lower aquifer 44 m thick which lies below 80 m depth the area experiences tropical climatic conditions high temperature heavy rainfall generally excessive humidity and distinct seasonal variations the annual average temperature in cox s bazar remains at about a maximum of 34 8 c and a minimum of 16 1 c mean temperature ranges from a minimum of 11 c to a maximum of 29 c in the winter november february and from a minimum of 21 c to a maximum of 34 c in the summer april september evaporation rate ranges from 70 mm to 90 mm in the winter to 180 mm in the dry period average annual rainfall in this area is 42 857 mm most of which falls during the monsoon period june to september this rainfall together with runoff from streamlets originating in hilly areas recharges the aquifers groundwater levels show significant seasonal variation the water table of the upper aquifer lies within 5 m of the ground surface during the dry season and rises to 1 m depth during the rainy season groundwater levels of the middle and lower aquifers lie 5 m and within 10 m of their upper surfaces respectively during the dry season whereas during the rainy season they rise to 1 m and 5 m from their upper surfaces fig 3 sediments above the uppermost water table were oxidized to yellowish brown or yellowish gray colors whereas those below it were reduced to bluish gray 3 materials and methods 3 1 drilling and sample preparation based on groundwater chemistry described by seddique et al 2016 the drilling location was selected near laboni point where u concentrations are relatively high the drilling site is at the edge of the foothills several hundred meters from the modern beach fig 1 drilling proceeded to a depth of 18 9 m in march 2013 before the monsoon season continuous sediment cores were recovered in 60 cm long pvc tubes by a private drilling company eastern geotechnical dhaka using a 3 5 cm diameter split barrel sampler raymond sampler the cores were sampled at 0 3 m intervals from the surface to 10 m depth and at 1 5 m intervals from 10 to 18 9 m depth the l a b color code was determined at the drill site by using a soil color reader spad 503 konica minolta the color data have been reported by seddique and hoque 2015 samples were immediately vacuum packed in oxygen impermeable film bags escal film mitsubishi gas chemical co withdeoxidizer after transportation to the laboratory the samples were stored in a freezer at 18 c about 200 g of the frozen sediment was then separated and immediately transferred from the freezer to a vacuum drying oven vo 320 advantec and freeze dried to avoid oxidation of the reduced compounds the dried samples were kept in a glass tube until analysis prior to analysis the dried samples were gently disaggregated by hand with an agate mortar and pestle 3 2 grain size distribution the grain size distributions of the sediments were determined by laser diffraction and scattering spectroscopy sald 3000s shimadzu after dispersing the samples in a sodium hexametaphosphate solution the reproducibility of replicate analyses was within 5 3 3 heavy mineral separation about 40 g of dried sample material was sieved through a 60 astm 0 250 mm mesh to collect the 0 25 mm size fraction fine to medium sand because this size fraction yielded the greatest percentage of heavy mineral assemblages mange and maurer 1992 the 0 25 mm size fraction was washed with water to remove the silt and clay fractions then placed in an ultrasonic cleaner to remove adhering clays pervasive iron oxide coatingswere removed and carbonate minerals were decomposed by acid digestion in 20 concentrated hcl heated at 100 c for about 10 min the remaining fraction was then washed with ultrapure water to remove the hcl and dried about 10 g of processed sample material was used for gravitational heavy liquid separation targeted heavy minerals were separated using tetrabromomethane heavy liquid chbr2chbr2 density 2 96 g cm 3 at 20 4 c g 51786 m osaka then washed in ethanol to remove the heavy liquid and dried in an oven at 50 c mineral grains were identified from their optical properties under a meiji petrographic microscope ml9000 and a nikon stereomicroscope smz 800 modal compositions were determined by the point counting method based on about 100 grains in each slide mange and maurer 1992 a standard grain count formula was used to quantify the weight percentage of those minerals with respect to the total heavy mineral content and the total sand 3 4 monazite and zircon separation and th and u analysis monazite and zircon were separated from five samples of sandy sediments from depths of 0 6 1 2 1 8 3 7 and 8 2 m total th and u concentrations were also determined for the bulk sediment of these samples the samples were sieved successively through astm meshes of 60 0 250 mm 120 0 125 mm and 230 0 063 mm and the 0 063 mm fraction was collected in the pan at the bottom of the sieve column ferromagnetic minerals such as magnetite were separated using a hand held magnet then the sieved samples were run through a frantz isodynamic magnetic separator model l 1 s g frantz co inc with forward slopes of 30 and side slopes of 8 under current strengths increased stepwise to separate different heavy minerals in the following order after hutchison 1974 ilmenite 0 2 a garnet 0 2 0 35 a pyroxene 0 35 0 5 a rutile 0 5 a monazite 0 5 0 8 a and zircon 1 5 1 6 a the rutile garnet monazite and zircon fractions may contain some other minerals because of their overlapping behavior to the applied magnetic fields the monazite and zircon separates from the different size fractions of each sample were mixed together to purify these fractions extraneous minerals such as ilmenite rutile garnet quartz with magnetite inclusions epidote and amphibole were hand picked under a binocular microscope smz 800 nikon we performed point counts of about 100 grains on each slide to ensure that the separates consisted of 90 monazite or 95 zircon in addition to optical observations x ray diffraction xrd analysis using ni filtered cu k radiation operating at 30 kv and 10 ma rigaku geigerflex instrument rad ia system was performed to ensure the purity of the monazite and zircon fractions fig 4 th and u concentrations of the monazite and zircon fractions from 0 6 m to 1 2 m depth and total th and u concentrations of the bulk sediment from these depths were determined using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the geological survey of japan following the method described by kon et al 2011 quality control standard glass beads were prepared using reference rock materials jg3 and jr3 distributed by the geological survey of japan http www aist go jp riodb geostand according to the same procedure the analytical precision of replicate analyses was within 5 and the analytical error was 10 3 5 scanning electron microscopy analysis several monazite and zircon grains were observed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5500 jeol equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer cdu leap detector and genesis software edax inc housed at the department of geosciences osaka city university japan the accelerating voltage was 25 kv and the beam current was 500 pa x ray spectra were acquired for 60 s of live time data acquisition and reduction were performed using the zaf correction method with natural and synthetic oxides and silicate minerals for standards 4 results 4 1 sediment characteristics depth profiles of the lithology and grain size of the sediment core are shown in fig 5 other physical information from this core has been reported by seddique and hoque 2015 the sediments can be stratigraphically divided into an upper unit of sand ground surface to 5 5 m depth a middle unit of silty clay to very fine sand 5 5 6 8 m and a lower unit of sand 6 8 18 9 m the upper and lower sand units consisted primarily of moderately sorted fine to medium sand with a mean grain diameter of 270 2 μm deposited in horizontal beds and containing ripples fig 5a and b the mean grain diameter in the middle unit was 40 μm fine grained layers of comparable thickness 1 m are common in the ganges alluvial delta plain where they typically serve as an aquitard at the top of confined aquifers e g seddique et al 2008 however this layer is not well developed in the study area and the uppermost confined aquifer is in partial contact with the overlying unconfined aquifer in the upper sand layer above the groundwater table at 3 m depth in the dry season the colors of these sediments change from reddish brown to yellowish gray with increasing depth indicating changing redox conditions from strongly oxic to slightly anoxic 4 2 monazite and zircon in sediments heavy minerals range in abundance from 0 3 to 59 3 wt of the bulk sediment in the study area seddique and hoque 2015 and heavy minerals were abundant in core sediment above 2 m depth fig 4 shows xrd patterns of typical monazite and zircon fractions from the oxidized yellowish gray sediment at 0 6 m depth mean diameter 67 9 μm which contained high bulk concentrations of th 202 3 mg kg and u 33 5 mg kg fig 5 shows depth profiles of monazite and zircon concentrations and th and u concentrations in bulk sediment from the core the monazite and zircon abundances are minimum estimates because the identification of th u bearing oxides is complicated by their lack of homogeneity and the fact that they are usually metamict the monazite and zircon grains had slightly rounded shapes and displayed conchoidal fractures and most were completely covered with a yellowish brown coating most of the monazite and zircon grains had lost their fresh surfaces and sharp edges due to abrasion a few brownish yellow grains with nonmetallic luster probably monazite or thorite were recognized under the microscope the concentrations of monazite and zircon ranged from 0 to 2 4 wt and 0 to 3 8 wt respectively fig 5c and d high concentrations of these minerals were observed in the upper sand unit at depths of 0 3 4 9 m mean grain diameters of 45 8 270 2 μm with the concentrations reaching a maximum at 1 2 m depth the finer sediments in the upper sand unit contained greater amounts of monazite and zircon than the coarser sediments fig 5c and d it is also notable that the minerals were partly altered having a dark reddish brown golden yellow or greenish brown coating see supplementary figs 1a and b the evidence suggests that these resistant minerals were altered due to chemical weathering in the zone of oxic sand above the dry season groundwater table poitrasson et al 2000 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 in the lower sand unit from 8 2 to 18 9 m depth mean grain diameters of 49 0 96 2 μm the abundances of monazite and zircon were low and displayed little variation beyond a gradual decrease with depth other than one increase to 0 46 wt monazite and 1 76 wt zircon at 9 8 m the minerals were relatively fresh and pale yellow yellowish gray or colorless supplementary figs 1c and d 4 3 th and u in sediments concentrations of th and u in the bulk sediment were substantial 90 4 202 3 mg kg th and 2 6 33 4 mg kg u in the unsaturated oxic zone from the ground surface to 1 2 m depth where the concentrations of monazite and zircon were at their maximum fig 5e and f below that depth th displayed a relatively narrow range of low concentrations from 6 3 to 17 4 mg kg except for one sample 27 1 mg kg at 9 8 m depth where the sediment was enriched in monazite and zircon fig 5c and d it is notable that the average concentration of th in the 20 bulk sediment samples 32 9 mg kg was considerably higher than published concentration ranges of 3 4 10 5 mg kg in soils kabata pendias and pendias 1984 7 2 mg kg in the earth s crust and 1 2 12 mg kg in sedimentary rocks dill 2011 mason and moore 1982 the u content varied with th throughout the core and high concentrations of u 2 6 33 4 mg kg were found from the ground surface to 1 2 m depth fig 5e and f below that depth u concentrations were generally low 1 1 4 0 mg kg with most of the samples containing less than 2 mg kg u concentrations were particularly low 1 1 1 3 mg kg from 1 8 to 2 4 m depth where the sediment was mainly fine to medium sand mean grain diameter 185 8 270 2 μm the average u concentration in the 20 samples 5 2 mg kg is considerably higher than the average value of 3 98 mg kg reported for typical sands yasmin et al 2018 and the range of0 5 5 0 mg kg reported for the earth s crust ramola et al 2011 the th and u concentrations in the core were not a function of particle size fig 5b e f but were greatest in fine grained sediments at the shallowest depths where the sediments were most strongly oxidized supplementary fig 2 however the concordant variations in the concentrations of total th total u monazite and zircon indicate that concentrations of these two minerals govern the concentrations of these radiogenic elements ruling out adsorption as a major mechanism to concentrate th and u in these sediments monazite was by far the most concentrated source of u and th the monazite separate from 0 6 m depth contained much greater concentrations of th 3395 9 mg kg and u 850 7 mg kg than zircon from the same depth 318 4 and 290 5 mg kg respectively results were similar in the monazite and zircon separates from 1 2 m depth 3937 5 mg kg th and 990 6 mg kg u in monazite and 275 4 mg kg th and 256 3 mg kg u in zircon 4 4 sem studies the th and u concentrations of monazite and zircon crystals at different depths were compared by eds analyses the mineral grains were taken from the same fractions used for the total th and u analyses both th and u were depleted in pervasively altered grains from 0 6 m depth fig 6 a and b compared to the relatively fresh grains from 9 8 m fig 6c and d the maximum concentrations of th and u in grains from 9 8 m expressed as oxides were 16 5 wt and 5 2 wt respectively for monazite and 1 1 wt and 0 8 wt respectively for zircon by comparison the maximum th and u oxide concentrations in grains from 0 6 m were 11 8 wt and 2 7 wt respectively for monazite and 0 5 wt and 0 5 wt respectively for zircon these observations suggest that th and u are released more readily from the crystal grains at 0 6 m than therelatively fresh grains at 9 8 m depth 5 discussion the naturally occurring radionuclides th and u are found in all rock types at various concentrations and in different chemical forms radionuclides are potentially harmful environmental components as ionized radiation has carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on living organisms e g icrp 2007 like other trace elements th and u contaminate groundwater by several physical and chemical processes the physical processes include erosion of host rocks and the transportation and deposition of the source minerals the chemical processes include geochemical and biogeochemical interactions with water that decompose and dissolve the source minerals bricker and jones 1995 radionuclide concentrations in groundwater depend on the solubility and chemical composition of the source minerals the flow rate and residence time of water and similar factors also adsorption upon and desorption from aquifer sediments are crucial for leaching distributing and dispersing dissolved th and u gueniot et al 1988 allard et al 1999 although crystalline monazite and zircon are highly resistant to alteration metamict zircon can be dissolved at temperatures below 100 c hay and dempster 2009 and monazite is more soluble than zircon in hydrothermal solutions e g hecht and cuney 2000 chowdhury 2003 2004 estimated that the study area contained reserves of about 0 3 million tons of heavy minerals including as much as 8 9 26 000 t zircon and 5 5 2000 t monazite in surficial placer deposits although our studies documented lower abundances of monazite 2 36 wt and zircon 3 28 wt in the sediment core these minerals contained relatively high concentrations of th and u leaching of th and u from monazite and zircon into groundwater is affected by local aquifer conditions such as preferential flow sorption and desorption ion exchange complexation and biological uptake eyal and olander 1990 sen and khilar 2006 pontedeiro et al 2010 rachkova et al 2010 oxic groundwater can easily dissolve u and transport it far from its origin bucur et al 2006 our study documented higher th and u concentrations in core sediment from the strongly oxic zone coinciding with high concentrations of monazite and zircon fig 5 seddique et al 2016 documented the detailed geochemical characteristics of the u and th and trace elements enriched groundwater and its relation to major chemical features analytical results for 115 groundwaters taken from different types of tubewells during the pre monsoon season june 2013 in the study area showed that the higher values of u and th were observed in the shallow depth of tubewell waters 20 m depth with ranges of 0 01 9 70 μg l and 0 01 127 10 μg l respectively fig 7 and that the enrichment mostly occurred in highly oxic environments eh 0 35 0 5 v and slightly acidic to mildly alkaline conditions ph 6 5 8 0 in the paleobeach area seddique et al 2016 seddique et al 2016 also reported that u and th gave a weak positive correlation between its concentration to tds 135 4509 mg l and alkalinity as hco3 values 1 24 13 12 meq l and suggested that solubility of u bearing minerals by uranium carbonate complexation in association with the biodegradation of organic matter it was also stated that 5 of shallow tubewells 50 m depth were contaminated with radioactive heavy metals i e u th and 80 showed high trace element concentrations i e mn 0 01 29 mg l fe 0 01 89 mg l and b 0 01 0 97 mg l that exceed the who 2008 drinking water guidelines for certain tubewells seddique et al 2016 according to the previous by seddique et al 2019 reported that encroachment of seawater into the groundwater along the paleobeach migrating inland toward the heavily groundwater exploited areas from the coast line the evidence from the paleobeach area of cox s bazar documents high bulk concentrations of th average 32 9 mg kg maximum 202 3 mg kg and u average 5 2 mg kg maximum 33 4 mg kg due to high concentrations of monazite and zircon the th contents of both minerals were considerably greater than their u contents chemical weathering is an important process that releases elements into the hydrosphere from their host minerals although dissolution of monazite and zircon is very slow chemical weathering of these minerals renders their crystal structure amorphous via metamictization read et al 1987 hecht and cuney 2000 poitrasson et al 2000 papoulis et al 2004 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 this form of chemical weathering changing redox conditions in near surface sediments and complex interactions between metal organic complexes biodegradation groundwater flow and physico chemical changes such as eh ph and salinity in groundwater induced by overexploitation and land reclamation together appear to be responsible for metal mobility in the sediment groundwater system in the study area 6 concluding remarks the current mineralogical and chemical approaches on the core sediments from paleobeach of cox s bazar prove high total bulk concentrations of th average 32 9 mg kg with maximum 202 3 mg kg and u average 5 2 mg kg with maximum 33 4 mg kg due to high concentrations of monazite and zircon the th content of both minerals was considerably greater than the u therefore the deposit is classified primarily as th bearing placer the alteration i e chemical weathering via metamictization of these minerals in the oxic zone of aquifer is essential to release these elements into the groundwater of the area overexploitation of groundwater and land use changes that affect hydrological and biogeochemical conditions in the aquifers may potentially influence the processes that increase th and u concentrations further research is needed to trace the migration of th and u pollution and its association with changing uses of

12157,to explore the influence of radioactive heavy minerals on thorium th and uranium u contamination in groundwater we performed geochemical and mineralogical investigations of core samples from the ground surface to 18 9 m depth from a paleobeach area in cox s bazar southeastern bangladesh geochemical data document elevated levels of total th 6 3 202 3 mg kg average 32 9 mg kg and u 1 1 33 4 mg

very fine sand in the uppermost meter of the sediment column down to 1 2 m depth rather than in coarser sandy sediment energy dispersive spectroscopy of several monazite and zircon grains indicated that alteration was greater in oxic sediment down to 3 m depth than reduced sediment deeper than 3 m monazite and zircon had relatively high concentrations of th 3395 9 3937 5 mg kg and 275 5 318 4 mg kg respectively and u 850 7 990 6 mg kg and 256 3 290 5 mg kg respectively chemical weathering dissolution and reprecipitation of detrital monazite and zircon grains which releases u and th into the groundwater may be a major and growing concern for drinking water in the study area shallow tubewells 20 m depth waters were enriched in u 0 09 9 57 μg l and th 0 02 127 09 µg l and that the enrichment mostly occurred in highly oxic environments eh 0 35 0 5 v we suggest that hydrological and biogeochemical conditions in the aquifer that follow land use changes influence the release of th and u into the groundwater of the study area graphical abstract image 1 keywords monazite zircon contamination radioactivity 1 introduction radioactivity occurs naturally in the earth s crust and surface environments some natural radionuclides such as th and u are minor components of heavy minerals and are closely associated with beach deposits in many places beach deposits occasionally concentrate these heavy minerals to economic levels in placer deposits that potentiallypose environmental hazards due to their natural radiation radhakrishna et al 1993 van duong et al 1996 malanca et al 1998 kannan et al 2002 freitas and alencar 2004 alencar and freitas 2005 vassas et al 2006 schmidt and asad 1962 reported the presence of radioactivity in beaches in bangladesh heavy mineral placer deposits in these localities are lens shaped deposits that range from a few centimeters to a meter in thickness and from a few meters to over 100 m in length zaman et al 2012 the bangladesh atomic energy commission reported heavy mineral placer deposits at 17 locations in beach areas of the southeastern and northern coastal belts of the bay of bengal and estimated that they contain 1 76 million tons of eight reserved economic minerals bari and chowdhuryrahman 2003 the beach sand deposits at cox s bazar were reported to contain 60 wt heavy minerals including magnetite ilmenite garnet zircon rutile leucoxene kyanite and monazite chowdhury 2003 of those minerals monazite and zircon were enriched in u and th biswas 1977 mitra and ahmed 1990 mitra and ahmedmonn 1992 alam et al 1999 bari and chowdhuryrahman 2003 chowdhury 2003 m rahman et al 1994 j rahman et al 2008 chowdhury 2003 2004 also reported that beach areas of the town of cox s bazar contain about 26 000 tons of zircon and 2000 tons of monazite constituting about 8 9 and 5 5 respectively of the total heavy mineral deposits there no previous work has characterized the geochemistry of these naturally occurring radioactive materials in the aquifer sediments at cox s bazar nor their relationship to groundwater contamination therefore we studied zircon and monazite in a continuous sediment core from the coastal region of cox s bazar covering the hotel motel zone and its adjoining beach area an area of about 7 km2 between 21 22 and 21 30 n and between 91 58 and 92 2 e fig 1 the area is bordered to the north and east by the bakkhali river to the west by the bay of bengal and to the south by the mouth of the jhilwangja stream the studied core sediments contained proportions of heavy minerals similar to those previously described seddique and hoque 2015 due to the rapid expansion of tourism and increasing population numerous accommodations have been built on land overlying heavy mineral placer deposits in the cox s bazar paleobeach which extends from the coastal foothills to modern beach areas groundwater is extensively exploited in this area for general water supplies several recent studies have highlighted that metamictization degradation of crystallinity is effective in releasing radionuclides from detrital monazite and zircon grains into groundwater via either coupled dissolution reprecipitation or solid state reaction read et al 1987 poitrasson et al 2000 hecht and cuney 2000 papoulis et al 2004 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 and references therein metamict monazite and zircon are more soluble than crystalline grains and are highly reactive in near surface tropical weathering conditions in sedimentary environments and radiation damaged regions of these minerals are preferentially dissolved hay and dempster 2009 zircon and monazite are highly radioactive minerals that represent potential sources of radioactivity in groundwater in the study area via dissolution or diagenetic alteration in the upper part of the aquifers which would release heavy and trace elements into the groundwater among those elements th and u are of particular concern as groundwater contaminants however in cases where groundwater has been in contact with the rock over hundreds or thousands of years significant concentrations may build up in the water recent studies point to the fact that groundwater in many parts of world is contaminated with radiaoactive heavy metals i e u th from natural and industrial sources atsdr 1999 exposure to u from drinking water is growing rapidly as more people increasingly rely on groundwater as their primary source of water ess 2011 mongolia and cox s bazar is an example where exposure of a large number of people to radioactive heavy metals i e u th risk is linked to increased exploitation of groundwater resources who 2005 seddique et al 2013 2016 exposure to th and u from drinking water may cause damage to the human body via dna damage that leads to increased risk of cancer adverse effects on the brain developmental defects and diminished bone growth zamora et al 1998 brugge and buchner 2011 observing the effects of chronic exposure to u through drinking water zamora et al 1998 concluded that even low u concentrations in drinking water caused nephrotoxic effects associated with alteration of proximal tubular functions long term exposure to th increases the chances of developing lung diseases and cancer of the lung pancreas and bones brugge and buchner 2011 quantifying these effects would require epidemiological studies in combination with the screening of groundwater supplies for radioactivity to understand the possible mechanisms of contamination we sought to characterize these radioactive minerals by measuring the concentrations of th and u in monazite and zircon grains in a sediment core collected from paleobeach deposits underneath the accommodation zone of cox s bazar geochemical and mineralogical studies of the sediment core and the separated minerals enabled us to evaluate possible impacts on groundwater aquifers from excessive use of groundwater in the area 2 study area from lithological observations of sediments in 18 boreholesand an electrical resistivity survey using vertical electrical sounding ves we identified six hydrostratigraphic units within 165 m of the ground surface including three major aquifers consisting of fine to medium sand fig 2 the unconfined upper aquifer is 5 15 m thick and is underlain by 5 to 20 m thick clay layers that serve as an impermeable aquitard between it and the uppermost confined aquifer middle aquifer the middle aquifer is 15 50 m thick and is present between 30 and 80 m depth this aquifer overlies unevenly distributed lenticular bodies of impermeable silty clay with thicknesses of 5 12 m that separate it from the lower aquifer 44 m thick which lies below 80 m depth the area experiences tropical climatic conditions high temperature heavy rainfall generally excessive humidity and distinct seasonal variations the annual average temperature in cox s bazar remains at about a maximum of 34 8 c and a minimum of 16 1 c mean temperature ranges from a minimum of 11 c to a maximum of 29 c in the winter november february and from a minimum of 21 c to a maximum of 34 c in the summer april september evaporation rate ranges from 70 mm to 90 mm in the winter to 180 mm in the dry period average annual rainfall in this area is 42 857 mm most of which falls during the monsoon period june to september this rainfall together with runoff from streamlets originating in hilly areas recharges the aquifers groundwater levels show significant seasonal variation the water table of the upper aquifer lies within 5 m of the ground surface during the dry season and rises to 1 m depth during the rainy season groundwater levels of the middle and lower aquifers lie 5 m and within 10 m of their upper surfaces respectively during the dry season whereas during the rainy season they rise to 1 m and 5 m from their upper surfaces fig 3 sediments above the uppermost water table were oxidized to yellowish brown or yellowish gray colors whereas those below it were reduced to bluish gray 3 materials and methods 3 1 drilling and sample preparation based on groundwater chemistry described by seddique et al 2016 the drilling location was selected near laboni point where u concentrations are relatively high the drilling site is at the edge of the foothills several hundred meters from the modern beach fig 1 drilling proceeded to a depth of 18 9 m in march 2013 before the monsoon season continuous sediment cores were recovered in 60 cm long pvc tubes by a private drilling company eastern geotechnical dhaka using a 3 5 cm diameter split barrel sampler raymond sampler the cores were sampled at 0 3 m intervals from the surface to 10 m depth and at 1 5 m intervals from 10 to 18 9 m depth the l a b color code was determined at the drill site by using a soil color reader spad 503 konica minolta the color data have been reported by seddique and hoque 2015 samples were immediately vacuum packed in oxygen impermeable film bags escal film mitsubishi gas chemical co withdeoxidizer after transportation to the laboratory the samples were stored in a freezer at 18 c about 200 g of the frozen sediment was then separated and immediately transferred from the freezer to a vacuum drying oven vo 320 advantec and freeze dried to avoid oxidation of the reduced compounds the dried samples were kept in a glass tube until analysis prior to analysis the dried samples were gently disaggregated by hand with an agate mortar and pestle 3 2 grain size distribution the grain size distributions of the sediments were determined by laser diffraction and scattering spectroscopy sald 3000s shimadzu after dispersing the samples in a sodium hexametaphosphate solution the reproducibility of replicate analyses was within 5 3 3 heavy mineral separation about 40 g of dried sample material was sieved through a 60 astm 0 250 mm mesh to collect the 0 25 mm size fraction fine to medium sand because this size fraction yielded the greatest percentage of heavy mineral assemblages mange and maurer 1992 the 0 25 mm size fraction was washed with water to remove the silt and clay fractions then placed in an ultrasonic cleaner to remove adhering clays pervasive iron oxide coatingswere removed and carbonate minerals were decomposed by acid digestion in 20 concentrated hcl heated at 100 c for about 10 min the remaining fraction was then washed with ultrapure water to remove the hcl and dried about 10 g of processed sample material was used for gravitational heavy liquid separation targeted heavy minerals were separated using tetrabromomethane heavy liquid chbr2chbr2 density 2 96 g cm 3 at 20 4 c g 51786 m osaka then washed in ethanol to remove the heavy liquid and dried in an oven at 50 c mineral grains were identified from their optical properties under a meiji petrographic microscope ml9000 and a nikon stereomicroscope smz 800 modal compositions were determined by the point counting method based on about 100 grains in each slide mange and maurer 1992 a standard grain count formula was used to quantify the weight percentage of those minerals with respect to the total heavy mineral content and the total sand 3 4 monazite and zircon separation and th and u analysis monazite and zircon were separated from five samples of sandy sediments from depths of 0 6 1 2 1 8 3 7 and 8 2 m total th and u concentrations were also determined for the bulk sediment of these samples the samples were sieved successively through astm meshes of 60 0 250 mm 120 0 125 mm and 230 0 063 mm and the 0 063 mm fraction was collected in the pan at the bottom of the sieve column ferromagnetic minerals such as magnetite were separated using a hand held magnet then the sieved samples were run through a frantz isodynamic magnetic separator model l 1 s g frantz co inc with forward slopes of 30 and side slopes of 8 under current strengths increased stepwise to separate different heavy minerals in the following order after hutchison 1974 ilmenite 0 2 a garnet 0 2 0 35 a pyroxene 0 35 0 5 a rutile 0 5 a monazite 0 5 0 8 a and zircon 1 5 1 6 a the rutile garnet monazite and zircon fractions may contain some other minerals because of their overlapping behavior to the applied magnetic fields the monazite and zircon separates from the different size fractions of each sample were mixed together to purify these fractions extraneous minerals such as ilmenite rutile garnet quartz with magnetite inclusions epidote and amphibole were hand picked under a binocular microscope smz 800 nikon we performed point counts of about 100 grains on each slide to ensure that the separates consisted of 90 monazite or 95 zircon in addition to optical observations x ray diffraction xrd analysis using ni filtered cu k radiation operating at 30 kv and 10 ma rigaku geigerflex instrument rad ia system was performed to ensure the purity of the monazite and zircon fractions fig 4 th and u concentrations of the monazite and zircon fractions from 0 6 m to 1 2 m depth and total th and u concentrations of the bulk sediment from these depths were determined using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at the geological survey of japan following the method described by kon et al 2011 quality control standard glass beads were prepared using reference rock materials jg3 and jr3 distributed by the geological survey of japan http www aist go jp riodb geostand according to the same procedure the analytical precision of replicate analyses was within 5 and the analytical error was 10 3 5 scanning electron microscopy analysis several monazite and zircon grains were observed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5500 jeol equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer cdu leap detector and genesis software edax inc housed at the department of geosciences osaka city university japan the accelerating voltage was 25 kv and the beam current was 500 pa x ray spectra were acquired for 60 s of live time data acquisition and reduction were performed using the zaf correction method with natural and synthetic oxides and silicate minerals for standards 4 results 4 1 sediment characteristics depth profiles of the lithology and grain size of the sediment core are shown in fig 5 other physical information from this core has been reported by seddique and hoque 2015 the sediments can be stratigraphically divided into an upper unit of sand ground surface to 5 5 m depth a middle unit of silty clay to very fine sand 5 5 6 8 m and a lower unit of sand 6 8 18 9 m the upper and lower sand units consisted primarily of moderately sorted fine to medium sand with a mean grain diameter of 270 2 μm deposited in horizontal beds and containing ripples fig 5a and b the mean grain diameter in the middle unit was 40 μm fine grained layers of comparable thickness 1 m are common in the ganges alluvial delta plain where they typically serve as an aquitard at the top of confined aquifers e g seddique et al 2008 however this layer is not well developed in the study area and the uppermost confined aquifer is in partial contact with the overlying unconfined aquifer in the upper sand layer above the groundwater table at 3 m depth in the dry season the colors of these sediments change from reddish brown to yellowish gray with increasing depth indicating changing redox conditions from strongly oxic to slightly anoxic 4 2 monazite and zircon in sediments heavy minerals range in abundance from 0 3 to 59 3 wt of the bulk sediment in the study area seddique and hoque 2015 and heavy minerals were abundant in core sediment above 2 m depth fig 4 shows xrd patterns of typical monazite and zircon fractions from the oxidized yellowish gray sediment at 0 6 m depth mean diameter 67 9 μm which contained high bulk concentrations of th 202 3 mg kg and u 33 5 mg kg fig 5 shows depth profiles of monazite and zircon concentrations and th and u concentrations in bulk sediment from the core the monazite and zircon abundances are minimum estimates because the identification of th u bearing oxides is complicated by their lack of homogeneity and the fact that they are usually metamict the monazite and zircon grains had slightly rounded shapes and displayed conchoidal fractures and most were completely covered with a yellowish brown coating most of the monazite and zircon grains had lost their fresh surfaces and sharp edges due to abrasion a few brownish yellow grains with nonmetallic luster probably monazite or thorite were recognized under the microscope the concentrations of monazite and zircon ranged from 0 to 2 4 wt and 0 to 3 8 wt respectively fig 5c and d high concentrations of these minerals were observed in the upper sand unit at depths of 0 3 4 9 m mean grain diameters of 45 8 270 2 μm with the concentrations reaching a maximum at 1 2 m depth the finer sediments in the upper sand unit contained greater amounts of monazite and zircon than the coarser sediments fig 5c and d it is also notable that the minerals were partly altered having a dark reddish brown golden yellow or greenish brown coating see supplementary figs 1a and b the evidence suggests that these resistant minerals were altered due to chemical weathering in the zone of oxic sand above the dry season groundwater table poitrasson et al 2000 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 in the lower sand unit from 8 2 to 18 9 m depth mean grain diameters of 49 0 96 2 μm the abundances of monazite and zircon were low and displayed little variation beyond a gradual decrease with depth other than one increase to 0 46 wt monazite and 1 76 wt zircon at 9 8 m the minerals were relatively fresh and pale yellow yellowish gray or colorless supplementary figs 1c and d 4 3 th and u in sediments concentrations of th and u in the bulk sediment were substantial 90 4 202 3 mg kg th and 2 6 33 4 mg kg u in the unsaturated oxic zone from the ground surface to 1 2 m depth where the concentrations of monazite and zircon were at their maximum fig 5e and f below that depth th displayed a relatively narrow range of low concentrations from 6 3 to 17 4 mg kg except for one sample 27 1 mg kg at 9 8 m depth where the sediment was enriched in monazite and zircon fig 5c and d it is notable that the average concentration of th in the 20 bulk sediment samples 32 9 mg kg was considerably higher than published concentration ranges of 3 4 10 5 mg kg in soils kabata pendias and pendias 1984 7 2 mg kg in the earth s crust and 1 2 12 mg kg in sedimentary rocks dill 2011 mason and moore 1982 the u content varied with th throughout the core and high concentrations of u 2 6 33 4 mg kg were found from the ground surface to 1 2 m depth fig 5e and f below that depth u concentrations were generally low 1 1 4 0 mg kg with most of the samples containing less than 2 mg kg u concentrations were particularly low 1 1 1 3 mg kg from 1 8 to 2 4 m depth where the sediment was mainly fine to medium sand mean grain diameter 185 8 270 2 μm the average u concentration in the 20 samples 5 2 mg kg is considerably higher than the average value of 3 98 mg kg reported for typical sands yasmin et al 2018 and the range of0 5 5 0 mg kg reported for the earth s crust ramola et al 2011 the th and u concentrations in the core were not a function of particle size fig 5b e f but were greatest in fine grained sediments at the shallowest depths where the sediments were most strongly oxidized supplementary fig 2 however the concordant variations in the concentrations of total th total u monazite and zircon indicate that concentrations of these two minerals govern the concentrations of these radiogenic elements ruling out adsorption as a major mechanism to concentrate th and u in these sediments monazite was by far the most concentrated source of u and th the monazite separate from 0 6 m depth contained much greater concentrations of th 3395 9 mg kg and u 850 7 mg kg than zircon from the same depth 318 4 and 290 5 mg kg respectively results were similar in the monazite and zircon separates from 1 2 m depth 3937 5 mg kg th and 990 6 mg kg u in monazite and 275 4 mg kg th and 256 3 mg kg u in zircon 4 4 sem studies the th and u concentrations of monazite and zircon crystals at different depths were compared by eds analyses the mineral grains were taken from the same fractions used for the total th and u analyses both th and u were depleted in pervasively altered grains from 0 6 m depth fig 6 a and b compared to the relatively fresh grains from 9 8 m fig 6c and d the maximum concentrations of th and u in grains from 9 8 m expressed as oxides were 16 5 wt and 5 2 wt respectively for monazite and 1 1 wt and 0 8 wt respectively for zircon by comparison the maximum th and u oxide concentrations in grains from 0 6 m were 11 8 wt and 2 7 wt respectively for monazite and 0 5 wt and 0 5 wt respectively for zircon these observations suggest that th and u are released more readily from the crystal grains at 0 6 m than therelatively fresh grains at 9 8 m depth 5 discussion the naturally occurring radionuclides th and u are found in all rock types at various concentrations and in different chemical forms radionuclides are potentially harmful environmental components as ionized radiation has carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on living organisms e g icrp 2007 like other trace elements th and u contaminate groundwater by several physical and chemical processes the physical processes include erosion of host rocks and the transportation and deposition of the source minerals the chemical processes include geochemical and biogeochemical interactions with water that decompose and dissolve the source minerals bricker and jones 1995 radionuclide concentrations in groundwater depend on the solubility and chemical composition of the source minerals the flow rate and residence time of water and similar factors also adsorption upon and desorption from aquifer sediments are crucial for leaching distributing and dispersing dissolved th and u gueniot et al 1988 allard et al 1999 although crystalline monazite and zircon are highly resistant to alteration metamict zircon can be dissolved at temperatures below 100 c hay and dempster 2009 and monazite is more soluble than zircon in hydrothermal solutions e g hecht and cuney 2000 chowdhury 2003 2004 estimated that the study area contained reserves of about 0 3 million tons of heavy minerals including as much as 8 9 26 000 t zircon and 5 5 2000 t monazite in surficial placer deposits although our studies documented lower abundances of monazite 2 36 wt and zircon 3 28 wt in the sediment core these minerals contained relatively high concentrations of th and u leaching of th and u from monazite and zircon into groundwater is affected by local aquifer conditions such as preferential flow sorption and desorption ion exchange complexation and biological uptake eyal and olander 1990 sen and khilar 2006 pontedeiro et al 2010 rachkova et al 2010 oxic groundwater can easily dissolve u and transport it far from its origin bucur et al 2006 our study documented higher th and u concentrations in core sediment from the strongly oxic zone coinciding with high concentrations of monazite and zircon fig 5 seddique et al 2016 documented the detailed geochemical characteristics of the u and th and trace elements enriched groundwater and its relation to major chemical features analytical results for 115 groundwaters taken from different types of tubewells during the pre monsoon season june 2013 in the study area showed that the higher values of u and th were observed in the shallow depth of tubewell waters 20 m depth with ranges of 0 01 9 70 μg l and 0 01 127 10 μg l respectively fig 7 and that the enrichment mostly occurred in highly oxic environments eh 0 35 0 5 v and slightly acidic to mildly alkaline conditions ph 6 5 8 0 in the paleobeach area seddique et al 2016 seddique et al 2016 also reported that u and th gave a weak positive correlation between its concentration to tds 135 4509 mg l and alkalinity as hco3 values 1 24 13 12 meq l and suggested that solubility of u bearing minerals by uranium carbonate complexation in association with the biodegradation of organic matter it was also stated that 5 of shallow tubewells 50 m depth were contaminated with radioactive heavy metals i e u th and 80 showed high trace element concentrations i e mn 0 01 29 mg l fe 0 01 89 mg l and b 0 01 0 97 mg l that exceed the who 2008 drinking water guidelines for certain tubewells seddique et al 2016 according to the previous by seddique et al 2019 reported that encroachment of seawater into the groundwater along the paleobeach migrating inland toward the heavily groundwater exploited areas from the coast line the evidence from the paleobeach area of cox s bazar documents high bulk concentrations of th average 32 9 mg kg maximum 202 3 mg kg and u average 5 2 mg kg maximum 33 4 mg kg due to high concentrations of monazite and zircon the th contents of both minerals were considerably greater than their u contents chemical weathering is an important process that releases elements into the hydrosphere from their host minerals although dissolution of monazite and zircon is very slow chemical weathering of these minerals renders their crystal structure amorphous via metamictization read et al 1987 hecht and cuney 2000 poitrasson et al 2000 papoulis et al 2004 hay and dempster 2009 williams et al 2011 this form of chemical weathering changing redox conditions in near surface sediments and complex interactions between metal organic complexes biodegradation groundwater flow and physico chemical changes such as eh ph and salinity in groundwater induced by overexploitation and land reclamation together appear to be responsible for metal mobility in the sediment groundwater system in the study area 6 concluding remarks the current mineralogical and chemical approaches on the core sediments from paleobeach of cox s bazar prove high total bulk concentrations of th average 32 9 mg kg with maximum 202 3 mg kg and u average 5 2 mg kg with maximum 33 4 mg kg due to high concentrations of monazite and zircon the th content of both minerals was considerably greater than the u therefore the deposit is classified primarily as th bearing placer the alteration i e chemical weathering via metamictization of these minerals in the oxic zone of aquifer is essential to release these elements into the groundwater of the area overexploitation of groundwater and land use changes that affect hydrological and biogeochemical conditions in the aquifers may potentially influence the processes that increase th and u concentrations further research is needed to trace the migration of th and u pollution and its association with changing uses of

3 hadrm3 data for the hiranyakeshi watershed to measure the effects of climate change on the groundwater recharge based on the long term output analysis it is expected that there is an increase in the average annual temperature by 2 59 c precipitation by 81 50 and groundwater recharge by 24 91 keywords groundwater climate change modflow flex hiranyakeshi watershed parameter estimation 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital part in sustaining ecosystem and used for development activities to fulfill the localized demand taylor et al 2013 globally groundwater source is a one third of all freshwater withdrawals used for supplying 36 for domestic 42 for agricultural and 27 for industrial purposes respectively doll et al 2012 the quality and quantity availability of water resources is reduced due to several factors of which climate change plays a dynamic role kumar 2012 the global climate change is recognized as a threat to the water resources natural ecosystem and other several features erwin 2009 the cause of climate change and its variability which influence on groundwater availability taylor et al 2013 there has been scientific evidence that shows human activities and industrial revolution from several centuries recorded a rapid change in climate change miller 1990 ipcc 1996 woldeamlak et al 2007 climate changes expected to cause more changes in global temperature and precipitation leads to flooding which increases in rise of global mean sea level and damages increases on areas situated in coastal region ipcc 1997 woldeamlak et al 2007 hence concern increased on climate change for prediction of future climate conditions and their effects on water resources to increase water availability and mitigate future damages scientist and researchers worldwide looking climate change impacts on ecological and hydrological features erwin 2009 many studies have been conducted related to the effect of climate changes on surface water bodies for eg anandhi et al 2008 anandhi et al 2009 erwin 2009 rehana and mujumdar 2012 a few researches investigated on potential effect of climate change on groundwater since groundwater is a major source of the world and plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological value of an area woldeamlak et al 2007 ipcc 2001b batelaan et al 2003 some studies shows that the recharge and discharge of groundwater depends on due to precipitation climatic variables human impacts such as agricultural activities and construction of weirs for flow regulation allen et al 2004 de wit 2001 woldeamlak et al 2007 predicting the recharge and discharge for future climatic change conditions is great importance for integrated water management and it can be achieved by using several hydrological models of which woldeamlak et al 2007 used modflow to estimate discharge and annual groundwater levels in the grote nete catchment belgium scibek and allen 2006 used modflow to determine the spatio temporal distribution recharge abbotsford sumas aquifers located in southwest british columbia and northern washington state allen et al 2004 scibek and allen 2006 worked on the impact of climate change on groundwater for the two small aquifers in western canada and the united stated using modflow in summary assessment of future changes on groundwater recharge using hydrological models gives valuable information on the changes under different climate change scenarios as the groundwater recharge is closely related to projected changes in precipitation taylor et al 2013 this paper aims to present a climate change and its implications on precipitation and groundwater recharge over the hiranyakeshi watershed using climate model hadley regional model 3 hadrm3 under a1b climate change scenario from 2021 to 2050 and using

state geological society usgs modflow is used for simulating and prediction of groundwater conditions and groundwater surface water interactions modflow model can also be used to simulate solute transport variable density flow aquifer system compaction and land subsidence and groundwater management in this study visual modflow flex ver 2014 is used for estimation of groundwater recharge for the hiranyakeshi watershed andersen and matthews 1993 discussed about the model setup execution and data used are explained detailed in the next following section 2 2 2 data and its sources the initial step of the modelling process is to develop a conceptual model to develop a conceptual model for the hiranyakeshi watershed the data is prepared accordingly viz generation of watershed boundary and streams using digital elevation model dem cartosat 1 ver 3r1 having 32 m resolution obtained from bhuvan site it is used to create watershed boundary streams river and then the same dem is used to create to represent the different layers above and below ground level creating surface in terms of model inputs in situ testing results of resistivity shows a two layers of top layer found to be weathered zone and fractured zone underlying next to the top layer therefore from the resistivity results in this study a two layered modelling is considered to represent a surface layers to the model the top layer weathered zone ranges from 20 to 30 m typically designated as unconfined aquifer and second layer fractured zone semi confined to confined ranges from 30 to 40 m the model also requires well data such as observation wells pumping wells point data initial water level is obtained from central ground water board cgwb and central water commission water resource information system cwc wris the bore well locations used for this study are kamatanur dundage mugali lingasur kasabanool tanawadi shindewadi and chikkatur 2 2 3 development of conceptual model national institute of hydrology nih conducted various studies on discussing the groundwater resource and problem facing in the hard rock region ghataprabha sub basins through the modflow applications to find the actual reasons for drying out of wells reasons of water logging and well design strategies the study results shows that there are failures of wells in the hukkeri town waterlogging nearby gokak town therefore it is necessary to assess the improper development over the sub basin or localized problems of hukkeri and gokak towns of belagavi district since because of non availability of fine resolution data a small portion of the hiranyakeshi watershed covering hukkeri town is considered to assess the status of groundwater resource and to see the changes under climate scenario through the modelling approach the first step in the modelling is to build the conceptual model developing a good conceptual model requires compiling a detail information on the study domain its geological formations boundary conditions like river recharge and wells hydraulic properties etc in the creation of a new conceptual model need to provide the conceptual model area the model area should be a polygon data object the geological surfaces that will represent the top and bottom of the geological model the layers are assigned in the horizon type to eliminate the intersection of the layers once the layers generated these layers used in property zones to define the hydrogeological characteristics categorized into hydraulic conductivity kx ky kz storage ss sy peff ptot and initial heads based on the layer properties to simulate hydrogeological process once the conceptual model is developed the next step is to convert the conceptual model into numerical model this step converts the various data inputs feature object based to a grid based modflow numerical model the grid are created consisting of 120 rows into 120 columns covering the hiranyakeshi watershed the grid was developed depending upon the data availability the available data were adequate to represent the fluxes around the watershed as per the resistivity data nih 1996 a two layered modelling was considered such that these are the layers which are saturated after these steps the observation wells are defined and the model is translated and simulated to obtain the results 2 2 4 defining boundary conditions the boundary conditions are the important part in setting up of modflow model to represent the system s relationship with the surrounding system an appropriate set of boundary conditions are required in visual modflow the boundary conditions for the groundwater flow and mass transport models are assigned and edited in the boundaries module of the input section the boundaries menu items are divided into two sections flow boundary conditions and transport boundary conditions flow boundary conditions involves constant head chd river riv stream str general head ghb drain drn wall hfb recharge rch evapotranspiration and lake lak boundary conditions transport boundary consist of constant concentration recharge concentration evapotranspiration concentration and point source boundary conditions in this study mainly concerned on the groundwater recharge hence only the recharge and river information is given as input to the model the visual modflow supports the recharge package rch included with modflow is used to simulate surficially distributed recharge to groundwater system and can also simulate recharge from other sources than precipitation such as irrigation artificial recharge or seepage from pond calculation of recharge in detail discussed in below section river requires following information like river stage leakance river red thickness to represent river in the model because the surface water bodies such as rivers streams lakes and swamps contribute water to groundwater system and influence on the groundwater recharge or discharge whereas the study area has limited observed data hence only recharge and river discharge used as a boundary conditions as inputs to the model once the boundary conditions are defined the model should be translated and simulated 2 2 5 recharge calculations the visual modflow flex v2014 2 has a recharge package which incorporates the recharge values into the model domain the recharge values were assigned according to the town wise calculated using below eq 1 the shape files of the town were prepared using arcgis and was imported into the model the formula for the calculation of recharge was taken from the groundwater estimation committee 1981 the recharge was calculated town wise by using the formulae 1 r a wfluck sy 2 rain rch rch 100 rf where rch recharge a geographical area wfluct water table fluctuation sy specific yield rain rch percent rainfall converted to groundwater recharge rf rainfall form eq 1 the groundwater table fluctuation and the specific yield sy values for different formations were referred from cgwb bengaluru and nih reports gec 1997 nih 1996 2 3 calibration and validation the model simulated results shows the satisfactory results because of coarse resolution of data for modelling to represent the actual situation hence goal is to enhance the quality of the model results with some modification in this technique parameter change or balanced until the model estimate the close relation between observed and predicted hence the process is called calibration calibration is a fine tuning of the model results such that simulated values should correlate with observed values from the field in this study parameter estimation pest has been used for the calibration of model which is built in the modflow model 2 4 climate change scenarios the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is the international body developed various climate scenarios for assessing the plausible impacts and variations in natural climate in future due to anthropogenic activities the climate change scenario gives the plausible range of global warming scenarios which provides options for decision making for the world s governments institutions and other organizations global circulation models gcms has ability to simulate historical as well as future changes on climate to assess the impacts that increased loading of the atmosphere with greenhouse and other gases ipcc the evolution of gcms with resolution and the emission scenarios in detail discussed in the ipcc special report emission scenarios 2000 this study conducted by considering the special report on emission scenarios sres from fourth assessment report to assess changes in groundwater recharge the sres scenarios has four sets of emission scenarios a1 a2 b1 and b2 sres emission scenario 2017a b was formulated on the basis of storyline shown in below table 1 in this study hadley centre s regional climate model hadrm3 for the baseline bl and a1b scenario is used to study the changes in the groundwater recharge over the hiranyakeshi watershed as above defined emission scenarios the a1 scenarios family has 3gropus distinguished by their technological emphasis fossil intensive a1f1 non fossil energy a1t or a balance across all sources a1b means various energy sources without relying too heavily on one particular energy source the a1b scenario results shows this future is consistent with rapid growth in economic world population reaches 9 billion people in 2050 then decreases thereafter quick spreading of new and efficient technologies the per capita income and the way of life converge between regions etc apart from these scenarios are updated to regional concentration pathways rcps in fifth assessment report which represents a different combination of possible future concentrations of atmospheric aerosols and greenhouse gases 3 results 3 1 calibration of the model the model calibration carried out by using parameter estimation pest which is inbuilt module in modflow using observed well data the model parameters were keep changing to improve the model results finally maximum residual dropped down to 3 67 m at one of the observation contrasted with 8 64 m before alignment greatest remaining of 3 67 m still is high in any case the residuals for the other observation wells were inside of as far as possible so most extreme lingering of that well was overlooked observed and simulated head demonstrates a close correlation connection with r2 of 0 99 fig 3 shows the correlation between observed and simulated head after calibration 3 2 climate change scenarios table 1 shows the precipitation in the study region for baseline 1961 90 and a1b 2021 50 scenario the results were obtained by running calibrated swat model for the hiranyakeshi watershed

january fig 8 shows the projected groundwater heads for the a1b scenarios estimated after calibration of model which is shown below 3 3 discussion the sustainable management of groundwater resources is necessary to balance the over exploitation of a complex source many researches studies carried out on groundwater availability in the ghataprabha sub basin of which majumdar et al 1996 studied the groundwater availability in hukkeri town and stated that groundwater balance in the hukkeri town is at alarming stage because of over exploitation of groundwater as compared to the less annual average rainfall similar studies conducted by nih 2000 conducted study on assessment of groundwater flow in ghataprabha sub basin and on a basis of local scale modelling in hukkeri town through mathematical model modflow and found that study area experiencing the drying of open and bore wells and suggested maintaining a higher water level in the downstream of hidkal dam with this few exceptions patil et al 2016 used three dimensional model modflow to investigate changes in groundwater recharge at hukkeri town and found that there is a decrease in water table and suggested to reduce the pumping of groundwater in the locality comparing with past results study conducted on assessment of changes in groundwater recharge under a1b climate change scenario for the hiranyakeshi watershed 3 4 climate change impacts on groundwater with increasing concern on global climate change there has been growing interest in predicting changes in precipitation and temperature which alters the climates and hydrologic system a number of global climate models gcm are available for understanding climate and projecting climate change output of these coupled models helps to quantification of the groundwater recharge and will help in taking appropriate adaptation strategies due to the impact of climate change singh and kumar 2014 hence the study conducted in hukkeri town using three dimensional model

scenario and groundwater recharge by 24 91 the groundwater availability in the study area shows water table is increasing for the future projection and some of the adaptive measures are to be taken for analysis of climate variability its extreme events and their impacts on groundwater resources and groundwater availability mall et al 2006 examined the sustainable development of surface and groundwater resources under climate change and future research need in india and concluded that indian region is highly sensitive to climate change and the following measures recommended are to assess in changing in rainfall patterns i e spatial and temporal variation and its effects on runoff and aquifer recharge to study sea level rise due to runoff and intrusion of sear water in costal aquifers and to determine vulnerability of regional water resources to climate change and to identify risks and prioritize adaptive responses 4 conclusions the previous studies over the study area shows that there is decrease in the water table therefore it is necessary to ascertain the changes in water table under baseline and climate change scenario a1b using hadrm3 data in hiranyakeshi watershed using a three dimensional model modflow it is observed that changes in temperature results in uneven distribution of rainfall groundwater recharge flooding and severe droughts in the present study results shows the increase in temperature 2 59 c and precipitation 81 50 under a1b scenario shows rise in water table 24 91 based on the study results precipitation and temperature showing increasing trends

introduction groundwater plays a vital part in sustaining ecosystem and used for development activities to fulfill the localized demand taylor et al 2013 globally groundwater source is a one third of all freshwater withdrawals used for supplying 36 for domestic 42 for agricultural and 27 for industrial purposes respectively doll et al 2012 the quality and quantity availability of water resources is reduced due to several factors of which climate change plays a dynamic role kumar 2012 the global climate change is recognized as a threat to the water resources natural ecosystem and other several features erwin 2009 the cause of climate change and its variability which influence on groundwater availability taylor et al 2013 there has been scientific evidence that shows human activities and industrial revolution from several centuries recorded a rapid change in climate change miller 1990 ipcc 1996 woldeamlak et al 2007 climate changes expected to cause more changes in global temperature and precipitation leads to flooding which increases in rise of global mean sea level and damages increases on areas situated in coastal region ipcc 1997 woldeamlak et al 2007 hence concern increased on climate change for prediction of future climate conditions and their effects on water resources to increase water availability and mitigate future damages scientist and researchers worldwide looking climate change impacts on ecological and hydrological features erwin 2009 many studies have been conducted related to the effect of climate changes on surface water bodies for eg anandhi et al 2008 anandhi et al 2009 erwin 2009 rehana and mujumdar 2012 a few researches investigated on potential effect of climate change on groundwater since groundwater is a major source of the world and plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological value of an area woldeamlak et al 2007 ipcc 2001b batelaan et al 2003 some studies shows that the recharge and discharge of groundwater depends on due to precipitation climatic variables human impacts such as agricultural activities and construction of weirs for flow regulation allen et al 2004 de wit 2001 woldeamlak et al 2007 predicting the recharge and discharge for future climatic change conditions is great importance for integrated water management and it can be achieved by using several hydrological models of which woldeamlak et al

2 description of study area greater giyani municipality lies between 23ᴼ04 and 23ᴼ24 s latitude and 30ᴼ24 and 31ᴼ00 e longitude fig 1 the climate is characterized by hot summers and mild dry winters with average summer temperatures of 35 ᴼc frequently exceeding 40 ᴼc and winter average temperatures of 20 ᴼc rainfalls occur generally between november and march with an average precipitation of 750 mm per year billay et al 2014 geologically the area falls within the giyani greenstone belt ggb which is commonly known for its gold mineralization klein letaba louis moore new union and fumani are the well known gold mines which existed within the ggb between 1887 and 1995 ward and wilson 1998 the gold deposits in ggb can be divided into four broad geological associations lombaard 1965 namely 1 quartz veins with minor sulphide developments 2 banded iron formations bif which are associated with 3 quartz and sulphide replacement veins and 4 carbonate veins and rare dolomite carranza et al 2015 observed that ggb is mainly made up of supra crustal rocks which are consisted of mafic ultra mafic rocks with intercalation of metasedimentary rocks the metasedimentary rocks comprise quartzite silicates phyllites minor sulphides carbonate veins and rare dolomite sadeghi et al 2015 the sulphides minerals found within ggb includes pyrrhotite chalcopyrite pyrite and arsenopyrite arsenopyrite are known to be susceptible for oxidation in oxic environment where most of the shallow aquifers are situated moreover the reductive dissolution of as bearing fe3 oxides and oxidation of sulphides are the most significant geochemical processes that releases arsenic from the rocks into groundwater abiye and bhattacharya 2019 the hydrogeology of the area is generally characterized by fracture bound aquifer formed mainly within the rocks of giyani greenstone belt vegter 2003 the major rivers that transect the area are nsami letaba and shengwedzi which flow in the easterly direction towards indian ocean 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling technique a total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from spatially distributed boreholes within greater giyani municipality fig 1 the study area fall within arid to semi arid climatic conditions and there are few functional boreholes and thus only ten groundwater samples could be collected samples were collected in pairs using pre cleaned 500 ml polyethene plastic bottles filtration of the samples was carried out using 0 45 μm filter membrane using handled vacuum pump filter samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 using 3 m hno3 to prevent colloids formation prior to collection water was allowed to follow freely until a stable ph tds and ec were recorded the hydrochemical parameters such as ph tds and ec were measured in the field using portable crison mm40 multimeter the instrument was calibrated prior to ph ec and tds measurement after collection samples were then stored in a cooler box and transported to the laboratory where they were stored at temperature 4ᴼc until analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the anions such as cl no3 and so4 2 were determined using metrohm 850 ion chromatography the standard titrimetric method was employed to determine hco3 kouras et al 2007 the concentration of na ca2 mg2 k total arsenic and other metallic species were determined using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7900 icp ms us at the stellenbosch university for quality assurance all samples were analysed in duplicate and blanks were set for control all data were subjected to statistical evaluation employing microsoft office excel 2010 while some of the graphical plots were carried out using piper trilinear diagram was plotted with the aid of past version 3 14 4 results and discussion 4 1 major constituents of groundwater the hydrochemical constituents of groundwater samples collected from greater giyani municipality are given in table 1 the ph of the groundwater samples ranges between 5 39 and 8 11 with the average value of 7 43 indicating near neutral to weakly alkaline condition the electrical conductivity ec and the total dissolved solids tds were ranging between 296 and 3100 μs cm and 161 4 and 1862 32 mg l respectively table 1 the ph for all the tested samples is within the south african national standard guideline value for drinking water 5 9 7 sans 241 2015 four of the tested samples have the ec levels exceeding both who and sans guidelines of drinking water quality 1500 and 1700 μs cm respectively while the four tested samples have tds exceeding who guideline value for drinking purpose 1000 mg l according to world health organization who 2017 there are no health effects related to ph ec and tds however high levels of ph ec and tds in drinking water may be objectionable to consumers the concentration of hco3 cl so4 2 and no3 as the major anions constituents in the groundwater were found to be ranging between 54 9 and 902 8 12 8 and 26 40 3 41 and 21 18 and 0 10 and 3 25 mg l respectively table 1 the average anionic dominance pattern follows the increasing order of hco3 cl so4 2 no3 higher concentration of hco3 could be attributed to the dissolution of carbonate mineral via biodegradation of organic matter choundhury et al 2017 the concentration of cl so4 2 and no3 were found to be within the who guideline values in all the boreholes out of the sampled boreholes three 3 had hco3 concentrations beyond the who guideline 500 mg l the dominant cations are mg2 8 181 9 mg l na 15 91 173 mg l and ca2 16 22 146 80 mg l while k was the lowest ranging from 1 1 to 39 76 mg l on average the dominance of cations is in the order na mg2 ca2 k these cations are released from silicate and carbonate mineral weathering enhanced by respired co2 from oxic and anoxic organic matter degradation halim et al 2009 the concentrations of na mg2 ca2 and k are within the who safe limits for drinking water the piper diagram in fig 2 was used to evaluate the hydrological facies and the water type in the study area piper 1953 in the cation plot it is observed that majority of the samples 90 lies in the centre of the plot indicating the dominance of both ca2 mg2 and na ions while the anion plot showed the dominance of hco3 and cl the central diamond plot showed that groundwater samples in the study area are mainly ca hco3 and ca na hco3 type the principal water type depicts rock water interaction involving the dissolution of rock forming minerals by weathered zone above the underlying rocks the concentration of other trace elements such as as fe mn ba b and zn was found to be ranging from 0 1 to 172 0 35 33 9 0 14 12 58 0 22 270 23 2 486 7 and 1 12 42 07 μg l respectively table 1 in relation to who limit for drinking water the concentration of fe mn ba b and zn were found to be within the recommended limit for human consumption however out of 10 tested boreholes 6 contains as concentration beyond the permissible limit 10 μg l the maximum as concentration recorded is 172 53 μg l which was recorded in the borehole at klein letaba prolonged exposure to even 3 μg l arsenic contaminated water may lead to server health problems including cancer to human smith and smith 2004 4 2 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry gibbs diagrams are often used to give more insight on the mechanisms controlling the groundwater chemistry by plotting tds vs na na ca2 and tds vs cl cl hco3 marandi and shand 2018 the gibbs diagram for the studied water samples is depicted in fig 3 gibbs diagrams revealed the chemical nature of the studied water samples is influenced by the water rock interaction rather than evaporation crystallization and precipitation during water rock interaction chemical weathering and cation exchange processes within the aquifer control the concentration of cations in the water mushtaq et al 2018 the ionic ratios hco3 σanions ca mg hco3 so4 na cl so4 ca mg and na cl were examined to determine the probable source of major anions cations and process affecting water chemistry berhe et al 2017 taheri et al 2017 the ionic ratios of groundwater samples collected are shown in table 2 the na cl ratio in the groundwater from giyani was found to be ranging from 0 92 to 13 88 with the average value of 6 2 table 2 majority of the samples 9 has na cl greater than 1 which indicate excess na ions in groundwater various factors such as dissolution of halite minerals weathering of silicate minerals and anthropogenic activities controls the na cl ratio berhe et al 2017 taheri et al 2017 when na cl ratio is closer to 1 dissolution of halite may be the source of na in groundwater however the increasing na cl ration suggests that the source of na is weathering of silicate minerals redwan and moneim 2015 geology of giyani is also rich in silicate minerals as such weathering of silicates may be controlling the na concentration in groundwater the na cl so4 2 ratios in nine out of 10 studies samples are 1 implying that they are soda rich waters resulting from weathering of silicate rich minerals the ca2 mg2 ratio 1 indicates dolomites dissolution whereas a ratio 1 is indicative of calcite contribution while 2 indicates the dissolution of silicate minerals redwan and moneim 2015 amongst the tested samples 8 have a ca mg ratio below 1 revealing dissolution of dolomite while 2 has a ca mg ratio between 1 and 2 suggesting calcite contribution this may be supported by the fact that geology of giyani also contains carbonate veins which includes dolomites ad calcite minerals sadeghi et al 2015 the weathering of carbonates and silicate minerals is corroborated by the ratio of hco3 σanions which were found to be 0 8 in 7 of the tested samples table 2 taheri et al 2017 narany et al 2014 the decreasing ca mg hco3 so4 suggests the occurrence of ion exchange reactions redwan and moneim 2015 4 3 arsenic and other hydrogeochemical parameters to investigate the relationship between arsenic and other hydro geochemical parameters scatter plots of ph hco3 so4 2 fe mn against as were created and presented in fig 4 a e a weak to moderate correlation between arsenic and other hydrogeochemical parameters is observed the plot between ph and as showed that samples with a higher concentration of as have ph between 7 5 and 8 11 fig 4a fig 4b showed the relationship between hco3 and as it is observed that samples with higher as contains hco3 concentration 200 mg l furthermore samples with a higher concentration of as contains fe concentration below 5 μg l fig 4c very weak correlation is observed between so4 2 mn and as fig 4d and e the results from the scatter plots suggests that hco3 and ph are the main hydrogeochemical parameters that are influencing the concentration of arsenic in groundwater the same observation has also been noted by several authors sako et al 2006 smedley et al 2002 higher concentration of hco3 is associated with increasing ph which promotes the desorption of as from the host mineral taheri et al 2017 furthermore a higher concentration of hco3 inhibits the adsorption as by metal oxides this phenomenon explains higher as concentration in samples with elevated hco3 concentration in addition sracek et al 2004 indicated that elevated concentration of as can be caused by increasing ph after dissolution of silicates or dissolution of carbonates driven by cation exchange particularly in oxidizing environments where fe iii oxyhyroxides are stable in summary samples that contain arsenic concentration 10 μg l are accompanied by ph 7 5 higher hco3 and low fe and mn concentrations 5 conclusions the hydro geochemical characteristics of groundwater in greater giyani municipality and their relationship to arsenic concentration were successfully evaluated it was found that the ph of groundwater in ranges from neutral to weakly alkaline the abundance of major anions and cations were found to be the following order hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and na mg2 ca2 k si4 respectively the study found that the hydrochemisty of groundwater in giyani is mainly controlled by water rock interaction and carbonates and silicates minerals are the source of ions in groundwater arsenic concentration was found to be above 10 μg l prescribed by the who for drinking water the following recommendations were made from this
