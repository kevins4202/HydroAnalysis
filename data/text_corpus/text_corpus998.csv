resistance is related to velocity profile and momentum exchange which is directly related to turbulent fluctuation most of hydrologic and soil erosion models such as the limburg soil erosion model

shen and li 1973 reported that rdi increased flow resistance and obtained empirical equations li 2009 found that rdi significantly increased flow resistance by the combined effects of rainfall and surface roughness but the effects of rdi alone remained unclear engman 1986 emphasized that the resistance of sf could be doubled by the rdi in tilled land and natural roughness conditions tian et al 2017 found that rainfall increased f under conditions of rainfall and base flows and the effect of rainfall was weakened with larger base flow discharge li et al 2018 concluded that rdi reduced flow velocity by 80 92 and increased the n by 72 78 through the experiments of simulated rainfalls and base flows on the contrary wang et al 2019 reported that rdi reduced base flow resistance on rough and smooth surfaces the effects of rdi on sf remains unclear in almost all studies in the literature the effect of rdi was studied with base flows shen and li 1973 li 2009 li et al 2018 pan et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the water depth and discharge of base flows were then changed by rainfalls the applicability of these studies was limited because the base flows were not generated by rainfalls researches young and wiersma 1973 lu et al 2016 liu et al 2019 mugler et al 2019 have confirmed that a gauze screen on a sloped surface could dissipate the raindrop kinetic energy by 64 0 99 6 the energy reduction is determined by the rainfall intensity raindrop diameters and terminal velocity as well as the pore diameter and height of the gauze carmi et al 2018 mugler et al 2019 the gauze screen could filter and reduce raindrop diameters and kinetic energy while keeping the rainfall intensity unchanged it therefore has the potential to be used to study the effects of rdi on sf the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of rdi on the sf resistance characteristics based on observed experimental data rainfalls of multiple intensities were generated to form sheet runoffs in a flat flume with an adjustable slope the rdi effects were identified by comparing cases in two experimental scenarios with and without a gauze filter placed over the runoff flume the results of this study can provide insights into basic hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were conducted at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling china to reach the terminal velocity of raindrops the downward sprinkler nozzles of the rainfall simulator were set 18 m above the flume the uniformity of simulated rainfalls was 85 and the rainfall intensity could be accurately controlled in the range of 30 to 350 mm h 1 zhuang et al 2018 the simulated rainfalls were similar to natural rainfalls with respect to raindrop size distribution and rainfall kinetic energy lu et al 2016 the flume was 6 0 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 3 m deep the slope angle can be adjusted from 0 to 30 fig 1 to avoid infiltration and soil erosion processes the bed surface of the flume was covered by a smooth and uniform layer of mortar sand to cement mixing ratio 2 1 the flume surface was then sheltered with a nylon gauze sheet which was fixed at 0 4 m above the flume surface to reduce the rdi the gauze nylon has 1 mm grid size that minimizes the direct impact of the raindrop 2 2 experimental design flume tests with four rainfall intensities 40 60 100 and 120 mm h 1 and eight slope angles 2 5 9 12 16 19 23 27 were simulated for each scenario at the beginning of each test the rainfall intensity was calibrated by using three rain gauges along the flume the whole flume was equally divided into three segments downslope 0 2 m middle slope 2 4 m and upslope 4 6 m when the rainfall was stable and the flow in the flume reached a steady state the surface flow velocity and flow depth were measured in each segment the flow discharge was collected and measured at the outlet of the flume the measurement of flow discharge was to verify the stability and the consistency of cases with different experimental conditions an auxiliary flume identical to the main one shown in fig 1 was used side by side to double check the uniformity of the rainfall and other variables the surface flow velocity was measured in each segment by using a dye tracing method with kmno4 each segment velocity measurement was repeated six times the velocity of the whole flume was mean velocity of the three segments flow depth was measured in every 1 m by using a water level measuring needle accuracy 0 1 mm scm60 shandong hengmei electronic technology co ltd there were six observation points for measuring flow depth positioned at 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 m along the flume centerline the mean flow depth of three segments was obtained by averaging point values in each of them the mean flow depth of the whole flume was the average of all measured points since flow velocity and depth varies along flume the mean flow velocity and depth of the whole flume were used to study the effect of rdi one minute rainfall intensity and raindrop spectrum including the diameter and fall velocity of each raindrop were measured by using a laser precipitation monitor lpm thies clima germany the rainfall kinetic energy of the two gauze shelter scenarios was measured for every rainfall intensity case the measurement of each data took at least ten minutes 2 3 data analysis the rainfall kinetic energy was calculated by using the raindrop number size falling velocity and rainfall intensity raindrop parameters including drop diameter and velocity can be measured based on the lpm of an optical disdrometer liu et al 2019 the rainfall kinetic energy was computed using the integral function of the entire raindrop spectrum in a time interval liu et al 2019 1 ke c π 12 1 10 6 3600 t 1 a lpm n i d i 3 v di 2 i where ke c is rainfall kinetic energy content j m 2 mm 1 t is time interval 60 s a lpm is the area of the

calculated by the formula eq 3 3 n 1 v r 2 3 j 1 2 where r is the hydraulic radius m j is the hydraulic slope that is approximated as tan θ and θ is the slope angle since the sheet flow is a thin layer the hydraulic radius is approximately equal to water depth barros and colello 2001 wang et al 2019 darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f was calculated by using the following formulas zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2019 4 f 8 grj v 2 the flow reynolds number re can be expressed as zhang et al 2010 5 re v r ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid 1 141 10 6 m2 s 1 shen and li 1973 found the relationships between darcy weisbach resistance coefficient rainfall intensity i and reynolds number re using rainfall experiments with base flows 6 f 27 162 i 25 4 0 407 24 re re 900 7 f 0 0392 re 2000 1 252 ln 0 68 0 77 i 25 4 0 407 900 re 2000 these relations were applicable for runoff in laminar re 900 and turbulent re 900 regime 3 results 3 1 rainfall and raindrop characteristics as shown in table 1 the kinetic energy content of raindrops with and without a gauze screen ranged in 2 12 5 97 j m 2 mm 1 and 14 75 37 70 j m 2 mm 1 respectively the number of raindrops was 2 16 2 6 times greater when the gauze filter was applied the size diameters became smaller after the gauze filtering it indicated that the gauze filter broke down raindrops into smaller ones with lower kinetic energy and thus largely weakened the rdi the raindrop diameters increased with the rainfall intensity significantly the filtered raindrops had quite uniform diameters in addition to being smaller fig 2 shows that non filtered rainfall kinetic energy increased with the rainfall intensity and the gauze filtering can significantly reduce the rainfall kinetic energy the gauze filter also can break up large raindrops and block their falling speed and thus weakened the impact force it is noted the smaller rainfall intensity has greater rainfall kinetic energy after the gauze is applied this may be because the smaller rainfall intensity has smaller raindrop diameters which makes the gauze with a fixed aperture less effective in damping the kinetic energy 3 2 variable changes along the flume because the runoff in the flume was generated purely by rainfalls water depth and velocity were zero at the flume upstream side and they increase downstream therefore the measured darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f in the three flume segments should be varied fig 3 shows darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f for all flume slopes values in different segments and scenarios were indicated with color and texture it is observed in all cases of the rdi scenario the resistance is higher than those of the gauze screened scenario a few features were observed for small slopes j 12 1 f varied along the flume channel and 2 f in the upstream segment were significantly larger for j 12 f was less and has little change along the channel for each rainfall f was larger without gauze filtering this trend was strong particularly in the range j 12 this was because the flows in the upstream segment have little momentum and were in low reynolds number laminar regime the rdi played a much stronger role in disturbing the flow this effect was not as obvious in the middle and downstream segments to simplify the differences problem averaged values of the flow velocity water depth and associated darcy weisbach resistance and manning coefficients of the flume were analyzed in the following sections of this study 3 3 effects of rdi on sf velocity and depth table 2 shows p value results indicating the measured mean flow velocities and depths in the two gauze filter scenarios were significantly different the mean flow velocities of no gauze filter were found lower than that with the gauze filter fig 4 with the gauze filtering effect the mean flow velocities of all tested slopes were larger by 6 37 1 24 2 15 and 7 21 for rainfalls of 40 60 100 and 120 mm h 1 respectively in addition fig 4 shows that the measured mean flow velocities increase with the flume slope with good correlations r2 0 95 fig 5 shows that the gauze filtered flow depths were less than those of no filter for the same rainfall intensity and slope with a few exceptions the mean flow depth decreased with the flume slope in both scenarios more depth reductions were in the range of 2 12 flume slope 3 4 effects of rdi on n and f fig 6 shows the resistance coefficients n and f for the two scenarios the flow resistances with rdi were higher for the same rainfall and flume slope for rainfalls of 120 100 60 and 40 mm h 1 the gauze filter reduced n by 11 62 25 42 3 34 and 5 33 and reduced f by 21 161 42 94 6 68 and 11 73 respectively additionally both the resistance coefficients n and f decreased with the flume slope fig 6 the resistance coefficients decreased quickly in the flume slope range 2 12 and then kept almost constant for higher slopes fig 6 for all test cases reynolds number re was between 233 and 1031 fig 7 when re was 800 f decreased with re in good correlations if re was 800 approximately f has no obvious relationship with re re 800 appears to be a critical value transitioning from the laminar to turbulent flow regime under rainfall conditions similarly n also decreased with re in good correlations for re 800 fig 7 good correlations of f to re and rainfall intensity i in the range re 800 were identified for the two rain scenarios 8 f ngs 64 863 i 0 086 re 0 907 r 2 0 90 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 062 9 f gs 40 27 i 0 015 re 0 851 r 2 0 89 n 20 p 0 001 se 0 053 where f ngs is for raindrop impact scenario f gs is for gauze filtered cases because of the sheltering effect the influence of i on f gs is much less than that on f ngs in eq 8 these results agree with the general trend of fluid mechanics that the f was inversely proportional to re in laminar flows in addition f was revealed also increase by rdi when re 800 there was no obvious relationship between re and f but f was still affected by rdi similarly for re 800 the relationships between manning coefficient n to rainfall intensity i and reynolds number re were established for the two rain scenarios the effect of rainfall intensity i on the manning coefficient n in the gauze screened cases is almost negligible 10 n ngs 0 406 i 0 061 re 0 492 r 2 0 89 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 035 11 n gs 0 219 i 0 005 re 0 394 r 2 0 62 n 20 p 0 001 se 0 055 where n ngs is for raindrop impact scenario n gs is for gauze screened cases fig 8 shows the relation of the incremental darcy weisbach and manning coefficient to re and rainfall intensity δf r represents approximately the flow resistance added to the observed runoff due to rdi the trend that δf r decreased with re and increased with rainfall intensity was reasonable because re represents the status of existing water in the flume and i represent the impact when re 800 δf r still increased with rainfall intensity but its variation with re became un apparent the correlation in the laminar regime re 800 was found to be 12 δ f r 154 17 i 0 237 re 1 34 r 2 0 71 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 176 similarly when re 800 an equation relating n r n ngs n gs to re and i was found 13 n r 0 667 i 0 188 re 0 929 r 2 0 59 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 158 n r represents approximately the added resistance due to rdi 4 discussions 4 1 rdi increased resistance in this study an impervious solid and flat flume was used to simulate the roughness affected by rdi no infiltration and sedimentation processes were considered it was found that the kinetic energy of rainfall or rdi increased the flow resistance the flow velocity was reduced and the flow depth increased figs 4 5 and 6 when raindrops impacted the sheet flow they strongly mix the faster flow surface layer and the near bed flow slow layer increased the turbulent motion and therefore result in additional resistance shen and li 1973 benjamin 1957 gabet and dunne 2003 wang et al 2018 the results were consistent with the work reported in fraga et al 2013 which found similar effects that the resistance increase by rdi was significantly higher when the water depth was very small an et al 2012 reported that both the flow depth and velocity have been reduced by eliminating rdi effects however wang et al 2019 and sun et al 2018 found that the f decreased with the rainfall intensity and increased with the surface roughness by rainfall combined with base flow this inconsistency may be attributed to resistance changes caused by rainfall increased flow discharge li 2009 also reported that when rainfall was applied on base flow the composite resistance was different from the sum of the two individual resistances this might be caused by rainfall increased flow discharge in this study the effect of incremental flow discharge by rainfall on flow resistance was eliminated and the effect of rdi only 4 2 resistance of sf on different slope segments it was found that f on the upslope segment was greater than that on the downslope segment with the same slope and rainfall intensity fig 3 this is reasonable because the flow near the upstream was laminar its turbulent level increased downstream pan et al 2016 reported that f value on the upslope segment under rainfall conditions was larger than that of the downslope segment the flow discharge increased linearly downstream the relative impact of constant raindrop intensity should decrease downstream abrahams and parsons 1991 kim et al 2010 pan et al 2016 further detailed studies on the f distribution along hillslopes are necessary in addition the flows in the experiments were non uniform and n is computed inversely using eq 3 for each experiment its value is affected by spatial variations of measured v and r to minimize the effects of spatial variations of v and r on n the flume was divided into three segments with a length of 2 m and the mean flow velocity and water depth for each segment was measured finally the average n values for each segment and the channel were obtained 4 3 equations to predict f f r and n r this study shows that darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f was inversely related to reynolds number re in the laminar regime re 800 and f was independent of re when it was larger than 800 fig 7 this critical value was consistent with the results of chen and yao 1996 but higher than 500 or 580 of the sf laminar flow liu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 shen and li 1973 and yao 1996 suggested the criteria was 900 therefore more research is needed to distinguish the critical value of the sf flow regime shen and li 1973 found f 24 re for the lamina flow with no rainfall under rainfall conditions this relationship is modified to eqs 6 and 7 in this study an empirical equation relating f to re and i using experimental data was developed for re of 800 the equation has the same trend as that of shen and li s 1973 inversely proportional to re and positively proportional to i the shen and li s equation eqs 6 and 7 were developed with base laminar flows which result to under estimate the f observed in this study and therefore not applicable to problems with non base flows eq 12 nevertheless could approximate the additional flow resistance due to rdi and can be applied to estimate the flow resistance under real rainfall cases future research can further explore the flow resistance variation caused by rdi with a wider range of parameters normally the manning coefficient n is treated as a local constant in hydrology and hydraulics assuredly the n value has been considered as a function of sediment size bedform vegetation density and channel form etc moreover various hydrological studies have habitually used n as a constant which could result in over tuning parameters and misleading calculations in this study rdi were able to change the manning coefficient n therefore the effect of rainfall should be considered when the model parameter n value is selected eq 13 represents approximately the effect of rdi on the manning coefficient n of rainfall generated runoff although this equation was obtained by limited experimental data it helps in predicting the flow resistance for hydrologic and soil erosion models 5 conclusions in this study physical experiments of rainfall and runoff in an impermeable and smooth flume were performed the main objective is to study the flow resistance affected by the raindrops impact rdi raindrop kinetic energy rainfall intensity runoff velocity and water depth were measured a gauze nylon sheet was used to minimize the rdi in one half of the cases the objective is achieved by comparing the results of two scenario with the rdi and the gauze screen cases without the rdi because the flow discharge and momentum increase along the flume while the rainfalls were uniform the impact of raindrop kinetic energy on the flow became relatively weaker and weaker downstream to simplify the problem averaged velocities and flow depth etc were used in the analyses the comparisons showed that raindrop kinetic energy in all cases of the rdi scenarios increased the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f and the manning coefficient n the corresponding flow velocities were lower and depths were higher than those of the gauze filtered scenario the runoff flows were approximately 12 as sheet flow form and were in a transition from laminar to turbulent regime with reynolds number equal to 800 the experimental data shows that f and n are in high values and then decrease quickly in the lower slope j 12 and reynolds number re 800 ranges and they become almost constant in the larger slope j 12 and reynolds number re 800 ranges based on the experimental results the laminar regime re 800 empirical equations relating re and rainfall intensity to resistance of rdi scenario no gauze screen f ngs and gauze screen scenario f gs eqs 8 and 9 were developed an equation for incremental resistance f r f ngs f gs was established for re 800 as well eq 12 this study also demonstrated that rdi affects the manning coefficient n similarly the incremental manning s coefficient n r eq 13 caused by rdi was also established for re 800 these equations can help in setting up dynamic form of parameters for modeling hydrological processes and water flow under raindrop impact the effect of adding flow resistance by rdi decreased at downstream stage this trend is strong particularly in the range j 12 in the upstream segment in which the flows were in lower re laminar regime this study revealed some fundamental effect of raindrop impact on the runoff resistance experimentally the results will help to estimate the resistance coefficients in hillslope hydrology for both with or without rainfall conditions such as the interception of raindrops by vegetation or orchard hail net due to the range of the experimental conditions the results have limited implications and applications and can be

calibrated by using three rain gauges along the flume the whole flume was equally divided into three segments downslope 0 2 m middle slope 2 4 m and upslope 4 6 m when the rainfall was stable and the flow in the flume reached a steady state the surface flow velocity and flow depth were measured in each segment the flow discharge was collected and measured at the outlet of the flume the measurement of flow discharge was to verify the stability and the consistency of cases with different experimental conditions an auxiliary flume identical to the main one shown in fig 1 was used side by side to double check the uniformity of the rainfall and other variables the surface flow velocity was measured in each segment by using a dye tracing method with kmno4 each segment velocity measurement was repeated six times the velocity of the whole flume was mean velocity of the three segments flow depth was measured in every 1 m by using a water level measuring needle accuracy 0 1 mm scm60 shandong hengmei electronic technology co ltd there were six observation points for measuring flow depth positioned at 0 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 m along the flume centerline the mean flow depth of three segments was obtained by averaging point values in each of them the mean flow depth of the whole flume was the average of all measured points since flow velocity and depth varies along flume the mean flow velocity and depth of the whole flume were used to study the effect of rdi one minute rainfall intensity and raindrop spectrum including the diameter and fall velocity of each raindrop were measured by using a laser precipitation monitor lpm thies clima germany the rainfall kinetic energy of the two gauze shelter scenarios was measured for every rainfall intensity case the measurement of each data took at least ten minutes 2 3 data analysis the rainfall kinetic energy was calculated by using the raindrop number size falling velocity and rainfall intensity raindrop parameters including drop diameter and velocity can be measured based on the lpm of an optical disdrometer liu et al 2019 the rainfall kinetic energy was computed using the integral function of the entire raindrop spectrum in

calculated by the formula eq 3 3 n 1 v r 2 3 j 1 2 where r is the hydraulic radius m j is the hydraulic slope that is approximated as tan θ and θ is the slope angle since the sheet flow is a thin layer the hydraulic radius is approximately equal to water depth barros and colello 2001 wang et al 2019 darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f was calculated by using the following formulas zhang et al 2010 liu et al 2019 4 f 8 grj v 2 the flow reynolds number re can be expressed as zhang et al 2010 5 re v r ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid 1 141 10 6 m2 s 1 shen and li 1973 found the relationships between darcy weisbach resistance coefficient rainfall intensity i and reynolds number re using rainfall experiments with base flows 6 f 27 162 i 25 4 0 407 24 re re 900 7 f 0 0392 re 2000 1 252 ln 0 68 0 77 i 25 4 0 407 900 re 2000 these relations were applicable for runoff in laminar re 900 and turbulent re 900 regime 3 results 3 1 rainfall and raindrop characteristics as shown in table 1 the kinetic energy content of raindrops with and without a gauze screen ranged in 2 12 5 97 j m 2 mm 1 and 14 75 37 70 j m 2 mm 1 respectively the number of raindrops was 2 16 2 6 times greater when the gauze filter was applied the size diameters became smaller after the gauze filtering it indicated that the gauze filter broke down raindrops into smaller ones with lower kinetic energy and thus largely weakened the rdi the raindrop diameters increased with the rainfall intensity significantly the filtered raindrops had quite uniform diameters in addition to being smaller fig 2 shows that non filtered rainfall kinetic energy increased with the rainfall intensity and the gauze filtering can significantly reduce the rainfall kinetic energy the gauze filter also can break up large raindrops and block their falling speed and thus weakened the impact force it is noted the smaller rainfall intensity has greater rainfall kinetic energy after the gauze is applied this may be because the smaller rainfall intensity has smaller raindrop diameters which makes the gauze with a fixed aperture less effective in damping the kinetic energy 3 2 variable changes along the flume because the runoff in the flume was generated purely by rainfalls water depth and velocity were zero at the flume upstream side and they increase downstream therefore the measured darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f in the three flume segments should be varied fig 3 shows darcy weisbach resistance coefficients f for all flume slopes values in different segments and scenarios were indicated with color and texture it is observed in all cases of the rdi scenario the resistance is higher than those of the gauze screened scenario a few features were observed for small slopes j 12 1 f varied along the flume channel and 2 f in the upstream segment were significantly larger for j 12 f was less and has little change along the channel for each rainfall f was larger without gauze filtering this trend was strong particularly in the range j 12 this was because the flows in the upstream segment have little momentum and were in low reynolds number laminar regime the rdi played a much stronger role in disturbing the flow this effect was not as obvious in the middle and downstream segments to simplify the differences problem averaged values of the flow velocity water depth and associated darcy weisbach resistance and manning coefficients of the flume were analyzed in the following sections of this study 3 3 effects of rdi on sf velocity and depth table 2 shows p value results indicating the measured mean flow velocities and depths in the two gauze filter scenarios were significantly different the mean flow velocities of no gauze filter were found lower than that with the gauze filter fig 4 with the gauze filtering effect the mean flow velocities of all tested slopes were larger by 6 37 1 24 2 15 and 7 21 for rainfalls of 40 60 100 and 120 mm h 1 respectively in addition fig 4 shows that the measured mean flow velocities increase with the flume slope with good correlations r2 0 95 fig 5 shows that the gauze filtered flow depths were less than those of no filter for the same rainfall intensity and slope with a few exceptions the mean flow depth decreased with the flume slope in both scenarios more depth reductions were in the range of 2 12 flume slope 3 4 effects of rdi on n and f fig 6 shows the resistance coefficients n and f for the two scenarios the flow resistances with rdi were higher for the same rainfall and flume slope for rainfalls of 120 100 60 and 40 mm h 1 the gauze filter reduced n by 11 62 25 42 3 34 and 5 33 and reduced f by 21 161 42 94 6 68 and 11 73 respectively additionally both the resistance coefficients n and f decreased with the flume slope fig 6 the resistance coefficients decreased quickly in the flume slope range 2 12 and then kept almost constant for higher slopes fig 6 for all test cases reynolds number re was between 233 and 1031 fig 7 when re was 800 f decreased with re in good correlations if re was 800 approximately f has no obvious relationship with re re 800 appears to be a critical value transitioning from the laminar to turbulent flow regime under rainfall conditions similarly n also decreased with re in good correlations for re 800 fig 7 good correlations of f to re and rainfall intensity i in the range re 800 were identified for the two rain scenarios 8 f ngs 64 863 i 0 086 re 0 907 r 2 0 90 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 062 9 f gs 40 27 i 0 015 re 0 851 r 2 0 89 n 20 p 0 001 se 0 053 where f ngs is for raindrop impact scenario f gs is for gauze filtered cases because of the sheltering effect the influence of i on f gs is much less than that on f ngs in eq 8 these results agree with the general trend of fluid mechanics that the f was inversely proportional to re in laminar flows in addition f was revealed also increase by rdi when re 800 there was no obvious relationship between re and f but f was still affected by rdi similarly for re 800 the relationships between manning coefficient n to rainfall intensity i and reynolds number re were established for the two rain scenarios the effect of rainfall intensity i on the manning coefficient n in the gauze screened cases is almost negligible 10 n ngs 0 406 i 0 061 re 0 492 r 2 0 89 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 035 11 n gs 0 219 i 0 005 re 0 394 r 2 0 62 n 20 p 0 001 se 0 055 where n ngs is for raindrop impact scenario n gs is for gauze screened cases fig 8 shows the relation of the incremental darcy weisbach and manning coefficient to re and rainfall intensity δf r represents approximately the flow resistance added to the observed runoff due to rdi the trend that δf r decreased with re and increased with rainfall intensity was reasonable because re represents the status of existing water in the flume and i represent the impact when re 800 δf r still increased with rainfall intensity but its variation with re became un apparent the correlation in the laminar regime re 800 was found to be 12 δ f r 154 17 i 0 237 re 1 34 r 2 0 71 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 176 similarly when re 800 an equation relating n r n ngs n gs to re and i was found 13 n r 0 667 i 0 188 re 0 929 r 2 0 59 n 18 p 0 001 se 0 158 n r represents approximately the added resistance due to rdi 4 discussions 4 1 rdi increased resistance in this study an impervious solid and flat flume was used to simulate the roughness affected by rdi no infiltration and sedimentation processes were considered it was found that the kinetic energy of rainfall or rdi increased the flow resistance the flow velocity was reduced and the flow depth increased figs 4 5 and 6 when raindrops impacted the sheet flow they strongly mix the faster flow surface layer and the near bed flow slow layer increased the turbulent motion and therefore result in additional resistance shen and li 1973 benjamin 1957 gabet and dunne 2003 wang et al 2018 the results were consistent with the work reported in fraga et al 2013 which found similar effects that the resistance increase by rdi was significantly higher when the water depth was very small an et al 2012 reported that both the flow depth and velocity have been reduced by eliminating rdi effects however wang et al 2019 and sun et al 2018 found that the f decreased with the rainfall intensity and increased with the surface roughness by rainfall combined with base flow this inconsistency may be attributed to resistance changes caused by rainfall increased flow discharge li 2009 also reported that when rainfall was applied on base flow the composite resistance was different from the sum of the two individual resistances this might be caused by rainfall increased flow discharge in this study the effect of incremental flow discharge by rainfall on flow resistance was eliminated and the effect of rdi only 4 2 resistance of sf on different slope segments it was found that f on the upslope segment was greater than that on the downslope segment with the same slope and rainfall intensity fig 3 this is reasonable because the flow near the upstream was laminar its turbulent level increased downstream pan et al 2016 reported that f value on the upslope segment under rainfall conditions was larger than that of the downslope segment the flow discharge increased linearly downstream the relative impact of constant raindrop intensity should decrease downstream abrahams and parsons 1991 kim et al 2010 pan et al 2016 further detailed studies on the f distribution along hillslopes are necessary in addition the flows in the experiments were non uniform and n is computed inversely using eq 3 for each experiment its value is affected by spatial variations of measured v and r to minimize the effects of spatial variations of v and r on n the flume was divided into three segments with a length of 2 m and the mean flow velocity and water depth for each segment was measured finally the average n values for each segment and the channel were obtained 4 3 equations to predict f f r and n r this study shows that darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f was inversely related to reynolds number re in the laminar regime re 800 and f was independent of re when it was larger than 800 fig 7 this critical value was consistent with the results of chen and yao 1996 but higher than 500 or 580 of the sf laminar flow liu et al 2010 wang et al 2019 shen and li 1973 and yao 1996 suggested the criteria was 900 therefore more research is needed to distinguish the critical value of the sf flow regime shen and li 1973 found f 24 re for the lamina flow with no rainfall under rainfall conditions this relationship is modified to eqs 6 and 7 in this study an empirical equation relating f to re and i using experimental data was developed for re of 800 the equation has the same trend as that of shen and li s 1973 inversely proportional to re and positively proportional to i the shen and li s equation eqs 6 and 7 were developed with base laminar flows which result to under estimate the f observed in this study and therefore not applicable to problems with non base flows eq 12 nevertheless could approximate the additional flow resistance due to rdi and can be applied to estimate the flow resistance under real rainfall cases future research can further explore the flow resistance variation caused by rdi with a wider range of parameters normally the manning coefficient n is treated as a local constant in hydrology and hydraulics assuredly the n value has been considered as a function of sediment size bedform vegetation density and channel form etc moreover various hydrological studies have habitually used n as a constant which could result in over tuning parameters and misleading calculations in this study rdi were able to change the manning coefficient n therefore the effect of rainfall should be considered when the model parameter n value is selected eq 13 represents approximately the effect of rdi on the manning coefficient n of rainfall generated runoff although this equation was obtained by limited experimental data it helps in predicting the flow resistance for hydrologic and soil erosion models 5 conclusions in this study physical experiments of rainfall and runoff in an impermeable and smooth flume were performed the main objective is to study the flow resistance affected by the raindrops impact rdi raindrop kinetic energy rainfall intensity runoff velocity and water depth were measured a gauze nylon sheet was used to minimize the rdi in one half of the cases the objective is achieved by comparing the results of two scenario with the rdi and the gauze screen cases without the rdi because the flow discharge and momentum increase along the flume while the rainfalls were uniform the impact of raindrop kinetic energy on the flow became relatively weaker and weaker downstream to simplify the problem averaged velocities and flow depth etc were used in the analyses the comparisons showed that raindrop kinetic energy in all cases of the rdi scenarios increased the darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f and the manning coefficient n the corresponding flow velocities were lower and depths were higher than those of the gauze filtered scenario the runoff flows were approximately 12 as sheet flow form and were in a transition from laminar to turbulent regime with reynolds number equal to 800 the experimental data shows that f and n are in high values and then decrease quickly in the lower slope j 12 and reynolds number re 800 ranges and they become almost constant in the larger slope j 12 and reynolds number re 800 ranges based on the experimental results the laminar regime re 800 empirical equations relating re and rainfall intensity to resistance of rdi scenario no gauze screen f ngs and gauze screen scenario f gs eqs 8 and 9 were developed an equation for incremental resistance f r f ngs f gs was established for re 800 as well eq 12 this study also demonstrated that rdi affects the manning coefficient n similarly the incremental manning s coefficient n r eq 13 caused by rdi was also established for re 800 these equations can help in setting up dynamic form of parameters for modeling hydrological processes and water flow under raindrop impact the effect of adding flow resistance by rdi decreased at downstream stage this trend is strong particularly in the range j 12 in the upstream segment in which the flows were in lower re laminar regime this study revealed some fundamental effect of raindrop impact on the runoff resistance experimentally the results will help to estimate the resistance coefficients in hillslope hydrology for both with or without rainfall conditions such as the interception of raindrops by vegetation or orchard hail net due to the range of the experimental conditions the results have limited implications and applications and can be

4991,this paired watershed study investigated the hydrologic impacts of low impact development lid stormwater control measures scms receiving runoff from a highly impervious highly connected commercial parking area located in reynoldsburg ohio usa the site was retrofitted with a bioretention cell and permeable pavement treating 0 60 ha and 0 42 ha of the parking lot respectively following a 12 month monitoring period of the existing parking lot hydrology i e calibration period monitoring continued for an additional 20 months after construction i e treatment period the bioretention cell significantly reduced runoff depths and peak flow rates from the catchment reducing mean values by 83 and 86 respectively subsurface infrastructure i e a gravel trench enclosing an adjacent sewer pipe and a nearby curb drain was suspected to provide preferential pathways which resulted in substantial exfiltration from the cell despite poorly infiltrating underlying soils conversely no significant differences in catchment hydrology were observed following the installation of the permeable pavement the median surface infiltration rate decreased by 96 during the study indicating that surface clogging occurred in the upper layers of the permeable pavement clogging was attributed to concentrated sediment loading delivered from the impervious catchment along with lack of routine maintenance and snow plowing activities it was concluded the loading ratio 27 6 1 of the permeable pavement was much too high and this level of run on should be avoided in future retrofits despite this the combined effects of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement led to significant runoff mitigation from the parking lot reducing both runoff depths 47 and peak flow rates 56 results were similar to previous studies of lid implemented in commercial catchments with lower levels of directly connected impervious cover than those herein this study demonstrates the effectiveness of scms in

consequences of urban development on receiving water bodies these result primarily from shifts in the hydrologic behavior of a landscape and the conveyance of concentrated anthropogenic pollutants to surface water resources leopold 1968 booth and jackson 1997 critical to these impacts are the presence of impervious surfaces such as parking lots roadways and rooftops which are nearly ubiquitous in cities around the world shuster et al 2007 impervious surfaces eliminate the infiltration capacity of soils create increased volumes and velocities of surface water runoff during storm events and diminish the recharge of groundwater that regulates base flow in streams arnold and gibbons 1996 as a result a greater portion of rainfall is converted to surface runoff conveyed to streams at higher velocities via pipe networks leading to a variety of degraded stream conditions generally referred to as the urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 examples of these conditions include reduced base flow in streams increased flood events decreased time to peak flow rates diminished water quality straightening and incision of stream channels and reduced aquatic habitat and biodiversity walsh et al 2005 though increasing urbanization often leads to a greater proportion of impervious coverage the degree of connectedness of these surfaces to drainage networks is an important driver of their hydrologic impacts to surrounding water resources booth and jackson 1997 essentially all runoff generated from directly connected impervious areas dcia such as streets with curb and gutter systems parking lots draining to storm sewer catch basins etc will reach streams and other receiving water bodies brabec et al 2002 thus streams in watersheds with high levels of connected impervious cover will be subjected to greater impacts from stormwater runoff leading to the subsequent degradation of urban stream conditions however research has shown even low levels of dcia e g 10 can increase runoff volumes and peak discharge rates following development shuster et al 2007 to mitigate the detrimental effects of urban runoff stormwater management strategies increasingly are turning toward low impact development lid principles such techniques are implemented to restore the predevelopment hydrologic conditions of a site and rely on distributed stormwater control measures scms such as bioretention cells and permeable pavement to manage stormwater near its source nrc 2009 bioretention cells also referred to as bioinfiltration practices or rain gardens typically consist of an excavated depression backfilled with engineered soil media this soil is vegetated with turf grass or planted with shrubs forbs native grasses and or trees and mulched davis et al 2009 hunt et al 2012 runoff produced during a storm event is routed into the bioretention cell temporarily filling the surface storage zone referred to as the bowl and infiltrating into the soil media where numerous biogeochemical processes provide treatment of dissolved and particulate bound pollutants runoff that has percolated through the media profile exits the system via several pathways through exfiltration into native soils through evaporation and transpiration i e evapotranspiration et or through perforated underdrains which discharge treated effluent into existing storm sewer networks bioretention designs in ohio commonly include an internal water storage iws layer which creates a zone of saturation in the lower regions of the media these features have the dual benefit of providing the anerobic conditions needed for nitrogen removal via denitrification while enhancing runoff storage and volume reduction through exfiltration into the native soils between events hunt et al 2012 winston et al 2016a several studies have demonstrated the ability of bioretention cells to reduce runoff volumes often completely abstracting runoff volumes from smaller storms and mitigate peak flow rates if proper construction practices and maintenance techniques are implemented e g li et al 2009 brown and hunt 2011a winston et al 2016a permeable pavements which can be constructed from materials such as porous asphalt pervious concrete or permeable interlocking concrete pavement picp implemented herein are paved surfaces that permit infiltration of stormwater while supporting vehicular or pedestrian traffic line et al 2012 runoff produced during a storm event infiltrates through the porous surface of the pavement into an aggregate subbase before exiting the system through exfiltration into underlying soils and contributing to groundwater recharge or via a perforated underdrain feeding into a nearby storm sewer weiss et al 2017 in addition to providing temporary storage and mitigating flow rates during a rain event permeable pavements have been shown to improve the quality of runoff by providing opportunities for removal of sediment bound pollutants through sedimentation and filtration as water percolates through the various aggregate layers selbig et al 2019 research has shown the ability of permeable pavements to reduce runoff volumes and mitigate peak flow rates drake et al 2013 in some cases such as bean et al 2007a runoff volumes were eliminated in permeable pavements installed atop sandy underlying soils however lower rates of runoff reduction are more commonly reported in systems with clay soils e g fassman and blackbourn 2010 braswell et al 2018 winston et al 2018 despite their demonstrated benefits surface clogging due to sediment accumulation can limit the movement of water into the aggregate subbase reducing the effectiveness of permeable pavements to manage runoff bean et al 2007b thus regular maintenance activities including measures such as pressure washing mechanical and vacuum sweeping etc are required to maintain the hydraulic function of permeable pavements winston et al 2016b commercial developments are typically characterized by large parking areas designed to accommodate peak usage which occurs on an infrequent basis nrc 2009 because they frequently contain a series of storm drains their dcia contributes to the increased relative volumes and degraded nature of runoff produced from commercial land uses relative to other land uses as reported in the national stormwater quality database pitt et al 2004 while commercial developments may employ traditional stormwater infrastructure such as detention ponds limited research characterizing the effectiveness of lid scms to mitigate runoff hydrology in commercial watersheds has been produced to date in a study of a parking lot retrofitted with various lid measures including swales detention basins and permeable pavements rushton 2001 observed reduced area normalized annual runoff volumes peak flow rates and volumetric runoff coefficients i e the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall from catchments where lid retrofits were installed compared to traditional asphalt sections of the same parking lot line et al 2012 studied runoff and pollutant export from three commercial developments in north carolina receiving three different treatments compared to a commercial site retrofitted with lid systems including permeable pavement bioretention cells and a constructed stormwater wetland and a control site where no treatment was implemented the authors observed the highest volume reductions from a commercial site where a wet retention basin was installed line et al 2012 however several complications were observed that limited the effectiveness of the lid systems following their construction including bioretention media clogging a 70 reduction in as built surface storage volumes compared to design and the lack of a drawdown orifice in the stormwater wetland line et al 2012 despite this runoff volumes discharged from the lid site were lower than the control catchment further pollutants loads were exported from the lid retrofitted at significantly lower rates compared to the other two sites in the study line et al 2012 finally wilson et al 2014 compared the quantity and quality of runoff generated from a traditional commercial development to an adjacent site retrofitted with infiltration based lid systems including underground infiltration systems rainwater harvesting cisterns a bioretention cell and a grassed bioswale in raleigh north carolina exceptional hydrologic mitigation was provided by the lid retrofitted site the runoff coefficient from the lid site 0 02 was approximately 25 times lower than the adjacent conventionally managed site 0 49 treated by a dry detention pond median peak flow rates discharged from the conventional site 2 85 l s were approximately nine times higher than those observed at the lid site 0 33 l s wilson et al 2014 the authors attributed these results to overdesigned lid systems whose as built storage was approximately three fold higher than design guidance and high infiltration capacity and driving head of the moderately drained in situ soils at the site wilson et al 2014 though initial studies of lid implementation in commercial watersheds are promising relatively few studies have been conducted in these unique settings thus there is a need for additional research to demonstrate the effectiveness of lid systems in the highly impervious highly connected drainage areas surrounding these facilities this article presents results from a two year monitoring effort of a commercial parking lot retrofitted with a permeable pavement and a bioretention cell the objective of this research was to characterize the impact of the lid systems on the hydrology of the parking lot compared to an adjacent traditionally drained commercial site using a paired watershed approach given the increasing presence of large shopping plazas in urban areas worldwide findings from this research may be highly applicable to both new and existing commercial areas and help promote broader use of lid stormwater management strategies in these settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located in adjacent drainage areas of a commercial development in reynoldsburg ohio usa 39 9548 n 82 8121 w approximate elevation of 268 m approximately 16 km east of columbus ohio mean temperatures in reynoldsburg range from 28 7 c in the summer to 3 9 c in the winter the area receives approximately 973 mm of rainfall annually based on long term rainfall records collected at columbus international airport located approximately 8 km west of the site national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei the paired watershed study consisted of two treatment catchments where lid retrofits were installed midway through the monitoring period and a control catchment which received no treatment during the entirety of the study fig 1 clausen and spooner 1993 the treatment catchments referred to as permeable pavement and bioretention corresponding to the scm installed were made up of adjacent sections of a parking area servicing a commercial grocery store while the parking area and rooftop of a nearby restaurant comprised the control catchment the boundaries of the catchments were delineated using trimble r8 real time kinematic rtk gps survey units trimble inc sunnyvale california usa plots of runoff coefficients against rainfall characteristics i e depth and peak 5 minute rainfall intensity were prepared to identify any threshold values beyond which runoff coefficients dramatically changed which would indicate the potential for runoff to be conveyed to the monitoring points from areas outside of the catchment boundaries such thresholds were not observed thus along with the high accuracy of the rtk gps units i e 2 cm vertical accuracy it was concluded that the catchment boundaries were accurate and substantial runoff produced outside of these boundaries was not conveyed to the scms the permeable pavement catchment covered 0 42 ha of the commercial parking lot though this area included some pervious area i e small parking islands comprising approximately 6 of the catchment the catchment primarily consisted of dcia as such the hydrologic contributions of the pervious cover were considered minor and were excluded from analysis the catchment draining to the bioretention cell was approximately 0 60 ha 74 of which was comprised of dcia with the remainder including a nearby grassed area where the rain gauge was installed the control catchment was also approximately 0 60 ha and included both the building rooftop minor landscaped areas and parking islands approximately 0 06 ha and surrounding impervious parking lot like the permeable pavement catchment the effects of small pervious coverage in the control catchment were considered minor and excluded from the analysis the total effects of the scm retrofits were also investigated by combining their drainage areas 1 02 ha into a shared catchment lid which also was compared to the control to demonstrate the benefits of multiple scms at the catchment scale catch basins routed runoff from the catchments into 61 cm and 76 cm diameter pipes within a common storm sewer network fig 1 2 2 soil characterization soil borings were collected at the site to determine soil texture soil horizons and the elevation of the water table in march 2017 after removing vegetation turf grass the soil profile was evaluated by manually advancing a 6 cm diameter auger in the pervious area to the east of the parking lot fig 1 the auger was advanced in approximately 15 cm increments to a depth of 178 cm below ground surface bgs no o horizon was observed in the profile suggesting that sod seed had been established directly on the 43 cm deep clayey a horizon the b1 horizon characterized as silt loam or silty clay loam was present from 43 cm to 122 cm bgs signs of prolonged saturation of these layers were not evident the b2 horizon was encountered at a depth of 122 cm bgs which persisted for the remainder of the soil profile the soil texture was characterized in the upper portion of this horizon 122 cm to 152 cm bgs as silt loam gravel similar in size to american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto no 57 aggregate was observed in this layer between 152 cm and 178 cm bgs highly saturated conditions and redoximorphic features were observed in the soil therefore the elevation of the water table was estimated to be approximately 1 5 m bgs this was corroborated by the relative elevation of a small perennial stream located to the south of the control watershed approximately 110 m south of the soil boring location field assessments of the soil boring were confirmed by the nrcs web soil survey which categorized the underlying soil as bennington silt loam and cardington silt loam with saturated hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 1 5 to 5 1 mm hr hydrologic soils group hsg c d nrcs 2020 2 3 scm retrofits following a 12 month calibration period a permeable pavement and a bioretention cell were retrofitted into the treatment catchments in november 2017 table 1 fig 1 design cross sections of both scms are provided in the supplementary materials the permeable pavement was constructed using picp underlain by approximately 88 cm of layers of washed aggregate stone which included a 58 cm subbase layer of aashto no 2 nominal diameter 37 5 63 mm a 10 cm base layer of aashto no 57 aggregate nominal size 4 75 25 0 mm a 14 cm bedding course of aashto no 8 aggregate nominal size 2 36 9 5 mm and capped by the 6 cm thick pavers belgard aashto m43 05 aashto 2018 aastho no 8 aggregate was also used to fill the joints between the pavers the permeable pavement surrounded an existing catch basin in the parking lot which served as an overflow for surface runoff during storm events the permeable pavement was drained by a 10 cm perforated pvc underdrain the elevation of the underdrain was raised using an upturned elbow creating a 15 cm iws layer in the subbase the permeable pavement covered an area of 152 m2 provided a subsurface storage volume of 44 5 m3 and had a corresponding loading ratio lr defined as the ratio of dcia to scm surface area of 27 6 this aspect of design was intended to test the effectiveness of permeable pavements receiving drainage from proportionally larger areas and is substantially higher than the maximum lr 2 0 specified by the stormwater design guidance in ohio rainwater and land development oepa 2014 this lr is very high relative to other studies of permeable pavement applications in the literature e g page et al 2015 winston et al 2016c braswell et al 2018 tirpak et al 2020 which allowed for evaluation of system performance under extremely hydrologically taxed conditions aside from vacuum sweeping performed in april 2019 to test the efficacy of a new maintenance technique to restore surface infiltration rate sir no other maintenance was performed on the permeable pavement during the study during winter months snow was plowed from the surrounding parking area and piled atop the permeable pavement shown in the supplementary materials and inside the bowl of the bioretention cell the bioretention cell was constructed during november and december 2017 and was comprised of a 76 cm layer of bioretention media placed directly onto in situ soils which were raked with the teeth of the excavator bucket prior to media installation the media was classified as a loamy sand and met the bioretention media specifications for ohio of at least 80 sand no greater than 10 clay and 3 5 organic matter by weight per specifications provided by the manufacturer kurtz brothers inc oepa 2014 the cell was topped with approximately 9 cm of shredded hardwood mulch and planted with numerous plant species in december 2017 including red osier dogwood cornus sericea blue flag iris iris versicolor swamp milkweed asclepias incarnate pink turtlehead chelone lyonii dwarf joe pye weed eupatorium and wild bergamot monarda fistulosa the system was infill planted with wild petunia ruellia humilis and purple lovegrass eragrostis spectabilis plugs in may 2018 the surface of the cell had 5 1 side slopes and an average ponding depth of 13 cm resulting in a surface storage capacity of 12 7 m3 similar to the permeable pavement the bioretention cell was drained by a perforated 10 cm underdrain surrounded by aashto no 57 aggregate prior to discharging into the existing catch basin which served as a high flow bypass in the event of overflow the elevation of the underdrain was raised to create a 30 cm iws layer in the media runoff generated from the contributing catchment which was approximately 60 times larger than the surface area of the bioretention cell 100 m2 was routed into the cell through five curb cuts each curb cut had a dedicated rock apron aashto no 1 fig 1 2 4 experimental design and data collection monitoring was performed from october 2016 through december 2019 however activities were discontinued between january march 2017 december 2017 march 2018 and january march 2019 due to wintery conditions i e freezing temperatures snowfall further data for november 2017 were removed from the analysis that follows as the scms were under construction during this time following a paired watershed study design the monitoring spanned two periods of interest calibration and treatment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scm retrofits clausen and spooner 1993 hydrologic data collected during the calibration period october 2016 october 2017 where traditional stormwater management i e catch basins and sewers was employed in the catchments was used to develop a linear relationship between runoff depths and peak flow rates for the control and treatment catchments similarly a second linear relationship was developed during the treatment period march 2018 december 2019 between the catchments following scm installation advantages of the paired watershed approach include the ability to control for temporal changes in climate and hydrologic conditions and thus to attribute changes to a specific treatment clausen and spooner 1993 rainfall measurements were collected at two minute intervals using a 0 254 mm tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments and confirmed with a manual rain gauge installed within 100 m of the scms fig 1 in an open area free of overhead obstructions hydrologic monitoring was performed using a series of v notch weirs and hobo u20 water level loggers onset installed in the sewer network draining the catchments prior to commencing data collection during the calibration period 0 6 m tall 60 degree sharp crested v notch weirs were installed in the catch basins draining the control and bioretention catchments while a 0 9 m tall 90 degree sharp crested v notch weir was installed in the catch basin draining the permeable pavement catchment since flow over the bioretention and control weirs contributed to flow at the permeable pavement monitoring point these flows were subtracted from the measurements made at the permeable pavement weir this resulted in the flow rate discharging from the permeable pavement catchment perforated pvc monitoring wells were installed in both the permeable pavement and bioretention cells during construction hobo u20 water level loggers housed within these wells measured stage in the cross section of each installation at two minute increments all hobo u20 water level loggers were corrected to gauge pressure using on site atmospheric pressure measurements from a hobo u20 logger 2 5 data analysis individual rain events were separated by a minimum antecedent dry period adp of 6 h and minimum depth of 2 5 mm hydrologic data were analyzed using hoboware onset excel microsoft and the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 after adjusting for ambient pressure stage readings from water level loggers were converted to flow rates using standard equations for 60 degree and 90 degree weirs flow volumes were determined by integrating flow rates with time runoff depth was determined as the total flow volume on an event basis divided by the dcia in the contributing catchment for each event peak flow rate was taken as the instantaneous 2 minute maximum measured rate of flow water level data was used to calculate the drawdown rate in the bioretention cross section following a storm event water levels declined exponentially as water was discharged through the underdrain followed by an approximately linear decline at a rate proportional to the exfiltration rate of the surrounding soils indicating the cessation of drainage thus the drawdown rate was derived by determining the average slope of the linear portion of the decline in internal water level for storm events where runoff depth was greater than 1 25 times the rainfall depth or when equipment malfunctioned e g lack of recorded water levels data were excluded from analysis given the procedures used to delineate and verify the catchment boundaries see section 2 1 events exceeding this threshold were attributed to issues with the tipping bucket rain gauge as opposed to runoff contributions from areas outside the catchment boundaries inaccurate measurements were possible when the gauge became clogged with bird droppings leaves and other debris though effort was made to minimize the instances when this occurred as a result rainfall depths were erroneously underestimated during some events causing runoff depths to far exceed rainfall depths for a given storm event this threshold was selected after plotting rainfall versus runoff trends and identifying potentially erroneous readings that could not be explained by other factors which could have inflated runoff depths e g rainfall characteristics the threshold was set well above 1 0 to account for the effects of runoff retained within the catchment or scm cross section from a previous storm on subsequent rain events e g following a very short adp over the course of the monitoring period 22 events were identified that surpassed this threshold corresponding to approximately 16 of the total number of events recorded during the study tests for significant linear relationships between log transformed treatment and control catchment hydrologic data collected were performed using analysis of variance anova these tests were executed separately for the calibration and treatment periods assumptions of normality and constant variance of regression residuals were confirmed graphically using plots of residuals against fitted values and q q plots analysis of covariance ancova was used to test for significant differences in the slopes and intercepts of regression models between monitoring periods for both runoff depth and peak flow rate testing using full ancova models for all hydrologic metrics revealed regression slopes did not significantly differ between periods for any catchment therefore reduced ancova models were used to test for differences in regression model intercepts between periods statistically significant differences in model intercepts indicated the scm retrofit had a significant impact on catchment hydrology following installation and that the magnitude of change was constant across the rainfall events observed during the monitoring period changes in hydrologic performance were quantified using least square means lsm analysis after assessing normality using shapiro wilk goodness of fit tests significant differences in rainfall characteristics between periods were determined using wilcoxon rank sum tests the runoff threshold rot the rainfall depth at which incipient runoff is generated was determined during the calibration and treatment periods as the x intercept from plots relating runoff and rainfall depths for each catchment bootstrapping was performed to determine the 95 confidence interval ci around the rot to compare changes in rot between periods as precipitation cannot be negative a practical limit of zero on the lower bound of the ci was implemented when necessary all statistical analyses were performed using r and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 unless noted otherwise 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation thirty three rain events were recorded during the calibration period ranging from 2 5 to 44 2 mm while the 76 events recorded during the treatment period ranged from 2 5 to 51 1 mm fig 2 in total the events recorded during the calibration and treatment periods resulted in 424 4 mm and 810 8 mm of rainfall respectively based on 65 years of historic rainfall records approximately 973 mm of precipitation has been recorded annually at john glenn columbus international airport noaa ncei rainfall characteristics including average intensity peak 5 minute intensity and adp of storms recorded during the monitoring periods are summarized in table 2 though the monitoring period spanned 2018 the wettest year on record in columbus in which rainfall totaled 1401 mm national weather service generally drier conditions followed in 2019 correspondingly statistical testing revealed that rainfall depths peak and average rainfall intensities and adps were not significantly different between the calibration and treatment periods p 0 05 3 2 bioretention the installation of the bioretention cell significantly impacted the depths and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the contributing catchment as evidenced by the signficant differences in the intercepts of the regression lines in fig 3 p 0 001 differences in runoff depth and peak flow reductions were quantified using lsm analysis mean runoff depths and peak flow rates significantly decreased by 83 and 86 between the calibration and treatment periods respectively p 0 001 table 3 example hyetographs and hydrographs demonstrating the responses of the treatment catchments to a relatively small 12 2 mm and large 31 0 mm storm event are shown in fig 4 these events corresponded to the 68th and 97th percentile storms observed during the treatment period respectively in both instances runoff volumes and peak flow rates discharged from the bioretention cell were substantially smaller than the impervious control catchment the timing of peak flow from the bioretention cell compared to the control catchment for the two events was mixed as peak flows were delayed by approximately one hour for the smaller storm yet peak discharge from the bioretention cell occurred earlier in the larger storm compared to the control this may be attributable to differences in rainfall characteristics for each event for example temporary bowl storage may have attenuated the higher peak intensity yet reduced depth of the small event whereas the lower intensity longer duration of the large event in combination with the completely impervious catchment may have saturated the bioretention media within the first six hours of the event resulting in peak discharge occurring earlier in the storm nonetheless the magnitude of peak discharge from the bioretention cell was greatly diminished compared to the control catchment for both events demonstrating the effectiveness of this scm to attenuate peak flows from the impervious catchment the rot of the bioretention catchment decreased marginally from 2 8 mm in the calibration period to 1 7 mm in the treatment period similarly the rot in the control catchment decreased between the project periods dropping from 2 3 mm in the calibration period to 1 4 mm in the treatment period confidence intervals around the calibration and treatment rots overlapped for both the bioretention and control catchments indicating the changes observed between the project periods were not significant fig 5 the relatively low rot observed for the bioretention catchment was representative of the high proportion of dcia in the contributing catchment which rapidly conveyed runoff into the bioretention cell even during smaller storm events walsh et al 2005 page et al 2015 this resulted in a rapid rise in internal stage and subsequent outflow from the cell as shown in fig 6 as rots are determined from the x intercept of the regression models smaller storm depths that produced small though non zero outflow can influence results thus the effects of the bioretention cell on runoff discharged from the catchment are more evident for larger storm depths as illustrated by the decreased regression slope for storms in the treatment period relative to the calibration period compared to the change in regression lines for the control catchment fig 5 this suggests flows move quickly through the bioretention media contributing outflow to the sewer early in the rain event through the underdrain however the underdrain clearly serves to throttle outflow rates allowing time for runoff volume reduction to occur fig 3 these results suggest that significant volumes of runoff were diverted to exfiltration and or et while the infiltration rate of the bioretention media the surface area of the cell and the bowl volume provided significant mitigation of peak flow rates of influent runoff from the catchment though several studies have observed similar hydrologic performance e g hunt et al 2008 99 peak flow reduction brown and hunt 2011a 75 100 volume reduction debusk and wynn 2011 97 volume reduction 99 peak flow reduction and olszewski and davis 2013 79 volume reduction 83 peak flow reduction these results were somewhat surprising given the poorly draining underlying soils the high percentage of dcia in the catchment the high water table on the site and the relatively high lr of the cell table 1 relatively few studies have reported on the performance of bioretention systems in these settings luell 2011 studied two bioretention cells installed atop compacted soils that received runoff from an impervious bridge deck in knightdale north carolina the surface area of the cells ranged from 5 of the contributing catchment small to 10 of the catchment large and each included a 60 cm iws zone luell 2011 low exfiltration rates ranging between 1 6 and 4 0 mm hr hsg c soils into in situ soils were observed correspondingly runoff volumes were reduced by 20 and 30 for the large and small cell respectively luell 2011 winston et al 2016a observed the hydrologic and water quality performance of three bioretention cells installed atop clay soils hsg d in northeast ohio of the monitored installations the ursuline college cell which had a surface area representing 6 5 of the impervious cover in the contributing catchment most closely resembled the cell described herein winston et al 2016a the cell reduced runoff volumes by 59 which was attributed to iws depth 0 6 m and drawdown rate 4 3 mm hr that permitted inter event exfiltration winston et al 2016a the cell reduced peak flow rates for events exceeding the one year five minute rainfall intensity by 53 88 the authors attributed this result to the oversized bowl volume of the cell which provided storage for higher intensity peak inflow before overflow occurred winston et al 2016a selbig and balster 2009 documented the performance of two rain gardens with differing planting palettes i e turf grass and native prairie species located atop differing soil conditions i e sand and clay over a five year period compared to luell 2011 winston et al 2016a and the installation studied herein the cells studied by selbig and balster 2009 were larger relative to their contributing catchments which were comprised of sections of a nearby rooftop approximately five times larger than the surface area of the rain gardens hydrologic performance appeared to reflect this over the course of the monitoring period 96 of precipitation was infiltrated by the rain garden planted with turf grass atop clay soils compared to 100 infiltrated by the prairie rain garden installed atop sand selbig and balster 2009 rainfall intensity and adp were also attributed to rain garden performance selbig and balster 2009 given the poorly drained hsg c d soils underlying the cell section 2 2 and the higher lr relative to catchment imperviousness 44 4 compared to these studies these results were unexpected and warranted further investigation it was hypothesized an alternative hydrologic pathway may have been present in the cell that provided drainage that bypassed the underdrain to confirm the presence of a bypass the drawdown rate of water retained within the bioretention cell following a rain event was analyzed using internal stage data collected in the perforated well trends in internal stage in the cell following a large 26 2 mm and small 4 3 mm storm event are shown in fig 6 stage quickly rose in the cross section during both events and surpassed the iws depth 30 cm indicated by the red line in fig 6 in both events as continued runoff filled the pore space in the media above the level of the underdrain outlet water levels rapidly receded with the cessation of rainfall indicating the cell was dewatering as stage dropped below the top of the iws layer water levels would be expected to decrease over time due to the combined effects of et and exfiltration from the cells exfiltration should occur at a rate proportional to the infiltration rate of in situ soils instead water levels continued to rapidly decline by an average of 15 mm hr to a depth of approximately 9 cm above the bottom of the cell fig 6 water was discharged from the cells via exfiltration below this point as levels declined for the two storms at an average of 1 28 mm hr an expected result given the underlying soil type this analysis was repeated for an additional 20 storm events to confirm drawdown patterns from the bioretention cell trends consistent with those exhibited in fig 6 were observed for these events based on this data the mean drawdown rate and thus rate of exfiltration from the cell was determined to be 1 20 mm hr assuming the cell was dewatering at this rate for the duration of the monitoring period approximately 30 of the water balance of the bioretention cell was exfiltration as drainage accounted for 14 of inflow to the cell approximately 56 of the overall water balance was not accounted for through monitoring though a portion of losses from the cell can be attributed to et previous field scale studies of bioretention indicate that volumes reduced via et represent a minor component e g 3 5 5 of the water balance brown and hunt 2011b winston et al 2016a the authors hypothesize that the infrastructure surrounding the cell namely the adjacent parking lot island and 61 cm storm sewer line may have provided a preferential drainage pathway for water percolating through the bioretention media that accounts for the remainder of the unmonitored portion of the water balance a gravel trench which served as a footing for the concrete curb and gutter surrounding the parking lot island and which encased the storm sewer pipe was revealed during excavation fig 6 this aggregate may have provided an outlet for treated effluent to exit the bioretention cell at an elevation below the underdrain invert though a portion of this water may have exfiltrated into underlying soils it is possible that some water draining into the trench may have been conveyed downstream along the length of the pipe in addition to the preferential pathway provided by the sewer a curb drain entering the catch basin draining the bioretention cell was observed during construction curb drains are commonly utilized to prevent damage to surface infrastructure by providing additional drainage below the frost line which is specified at 81 cm in ohio building codes ord 733 06 22 considering the bowl storage depth 13 cm and depth of filter media 76 cm in the cell table 1 curb drains installed at this depth would be approximately 8 cm above the bottom of the bioretention cell roughly equivalent to the effective storage depth 9 cm observed in the water level data in fig 6 though flows discharged through the curb drain entered the catch basin upstream of the weir and contributed to monitored outflows this reduced the storage in the cell to approximately 30 of the iws depth 30 cm fig 6 the interactions with the surrounding infrastructure which provided preferential pathways for drainage from the cell are the likely source of the discrepancies between the runoff reduction performance observed herein compared to previously reported studies of bioretention under similar conditions luell 2011 winston et al 2016a the interactions with surrounding subsurface infrastructure are known as urban karst defined as disturbed areas in the soil characterized by high porosity and large void spaces associated with pipe trenches excavations foundations gravel trenches around utility lines etc that affect the flow of near surface groundwater and infiltrated stormwater in urban areas kaushal and belt 2012 bonneau et al 2017 the larger soil pores associated with urban karst permit water to move in the subsurface at rates that can exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surrounding soils by several orders of magnitude diminishing the effectiveness of infiltration based scms including bioretention cells to mitigate stormwater volumes through retention and drainage into underlying soils bonneau et al 2017 given the proximity to adjacent infrastructure the exceptional hydrologic mitigation by the bioretention cell is most likely explained by this phenomenon though the volume and fate of runoff diverted into these pathways may not be able to be quantified or defined abatement of flow rates and volumes would have occurred in these subsurface conduits compared to surface flows in the unmitigated control catchment further unless these subsurface interactions were prevented in design such as using impermeable membranes along the sides of the excavation for the bioretention cell similar volume reductions through these preferential pathways may be expected to occur in bioretention cells installed in similar settings thus the installation described herein demonstrates the effectiveness of bioretention cells to mitigate runoff even in highly impervious highly connected catchments and suggests the use of this scm as a viable stormwater management strategy in similar commercial developments it should be noted however that stormwater infiltrated into bioretention cells permeable pavements and other infiltration based scms in urban environments may interact with other subsurface drainage pathways this may limit the potential for groundwater recharge and contributions to baseflow while also introducing the potential for stormwater to enter sewer pipes through cracks and fissures i e infiltration and inflow and thus possibly contribute to sanitary sewer overflows bonneau et al 2017 3 3 permeable pavement unlike the bioretention cell the depths and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the permeable pavement catchment did not significantly change following the installation of the permeable pavement p 0 05 ancova analyses revealed the regression equations used to model the relationship between the control and permeable pavement catchments did not change between periods table 3 fig 3 this finding is evident in the example hydrographs shown in fig 4 for both the small and large rain events discharge from the permeable pavement trended closely with that of the control catchment indicating that the rainfall runoff response in the permeable pavement catchment was similar to that of an impervious catchment fig 4 similar to the bioretention cell the rot of the permeable pavement catchment declined from 3 0 mm in the calibration period to 2 2 mm in the treatment period however the 95 cis around the rots for both project periods overlapped indicating the rot did not significantly change following the installation of the permeable pavement fig 5 again unlike the bioretention cell the effects of the permeable pavement for larger storm events were not evident further the slopes of the regression models for the calibration and treatment periods for the permeable pavement were similar and more closely resembled trends in runoff generation observed from the control catchment fig 5 taken together these results suggest the permeable pavement was effectively functioning as a traditional impermeable pavement during the treatment period failure of permeable pavements to mitigate runoff is frequently tied to surface clogging which prevents movement of runoff into the subsurface as a result of sediment accumulation and can reduce sir by several orders of magnitude winston et al 2016a clogging of permeable pavements is typically observed by decreased sir or water ponding on the pavement surface oepa 2014 because ponding was frequently visible on the pavement layer during rain events along with the concentrated sediment loads delivered to the permeable pavement as a result of its large lr 27 6 and the lack of routine maintenance performed on the system it was determined the surface of the permeable pavement had clogged during the study the sir of the permeable pavement was measured at six locations see supplementary material across the permeable pavement using methods in astm c1781 astm 2013 measurements of surface infiltration rate were repeated five times at these six locations between august 2018 and october 2019 fig 7 median sir decreased by 96 during the 14 month period from 76 mm min in august 2018 to 3 mm min in october 2019 while some testing locations i e locations 2 and 6 exhibited sir over 100 mm min following the august 2018 measurements approximately nine months after the installation of the pavement sir at five of the six locations i e locations 1 3 4 5 and 6 fell below 7 mm min by october 2019 though sir varied spatially across the surface area of the permeable pavement a clear exponential decay can be observed in the data similar to that observed for two porous asphalt pavements in northern sweden in winston et al 2016b and a pervious concrete in sansalone et al 2008 however the exponential function fit to the median sirs sir mm min 310 5 e 2 99 a g e y r s r2 0 89 herein predicts a much more rapid decline in sir over time compared to data published in winston et al 2016b sir mm min 89 7 e 0 28 a g e y r s r2 0 89 unlike the permeable pavement described herein which operated under hydrologically taxed conditions i e lr of 27 6 the permeable pavements summarized in winston et al 2016b both of which were in operation for over 20 years only treated direct rainfall and did not receive run on from adjacent impervious areas i e lr equal to zero these results support the conclusion that sirs of permeable pavements decline exponentially as the pavement ages and a more rapid decline in sir and overall effectiveness of a permeable pavement can be expected in systems with higher lrs the lowest sirs were frequently observed at locations 1 and 3 ponding was commonly observed in the vicinity of location 1 which was adjacent to the catch basin and a point of lower elevation on the surface of the permeable pavement thus it was likely the location of concentrated sediment deposition conveyed from the catchment see supplementary material observations of snow piled on the permeable pavement near test location 3 following snow plowing activities in winter are likely the source of the diminished sir in the southern section of the pavement seasonal accumulation of solids due to snow plowing during the winter and subsequent release in spring snowmelt has been observed in permeable pavement research tirpak et al 2020 testing results suggest sir in these locations were severely diminished shortly after the installation of the pavement interestingly the location with the highest sir location 6 109 mm min during testing in august 2018 exhibited the lowest sir 1 mm min by october 2019 this location was the closest to the edge of the permeable pavement on the southeast corner of the system where fines generated from the asphalt were likely deposited due to abrasions and wear from vehicles essentially this location acted as a forebay and has been noted as an area of exceptionally higher maintenance needs winston et al 2016b finally it should be noted the increase in sir observed at location 2 between testing conducted in october 2018 and april 2019 performed one week prior to the regenerative air street sweeping conducted at the site may be attributable to testing inconsistencies such as an incomplete seal between the single ring infiltrometer and the pavement as well as timing of drainage into the surface which can occur very rapidly in unclogged areas of permeable pavements the median sir of the permeable pavement is within the range of previous studies that reported poor infiltration rate associated with surface clogging in a study of permeable pavement sirs bean et al 2007b reported the median sir of picp sites without obvious accumulation of fine particles on the surface was 2000 cm hr 333 mm min conversely the median sir of sites adjacent to disturbed soils that partially filled permeable pavement interstitial spaces with fine soil particles was 8 0 cm hr 1 3 mm min similar to the pavement described herein bean et al 2007b studies summarized in drake et al 2013 that observed minimal infiltration from picp systems frequently reported sir below 5 cm hr 0 8 mm min maintenance activities such as power washing mechanical street sweeping and regenerative air sweeping have been shown to restore the infiltration rate of clogged systems and are recommended to be performed two to four times annually to remove accumulated sediment oepa 2014 winston et al 2016a however if such activities are not regularly performed fines trapped in the picp joint spaces can be compacted in void spaces or migrate deeper in the cross section which may not be accessible with routine maintenance measures bean et al 2007b given that the maintenance regenerative air street sweeping performed on the pavement in late april 2019 did not have significant effects on improving the median sir of the system fig 7 it is suspected that fines captured in the pavement layer migrated deep into the cross section as a result more extensive restorative measures such as removal of picp and replacement of bedding stone may be required to restore the intended hydrologic function of the pavement danz et al 2020 furthermore the lr 27 6 for this permeable pavement is so high that the long term maintenance needs for this scm to ensure its hydraulic function may be unreasonable the surface clogging that rendered the permeable pavement ineffective is likely a result of a combination of the high lr of the system the lack of routine maintenance performed on the site and the snow management activities conducted in the parking lot because of the large impervious area and thus the higher sediment loads draining to the system routine maintenance may be needed on an even more frequent basis compared to the semiannual maintenance recommended for other permeable pavements oepa 2014 it is recommended maintenance regimes be developed based on lr and catchment characteristics rather than a one size fits all approach amending snow plowing procedures at the site to ensure operators do not pile snow on the permeable pavement may reduce the accumulation of sediment during snowmelt and prolong the effectiveness of the system between maintenance intervals 3 4 lid catchment the combined effects of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement led to signficant reductions in the depth and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the lid catchment similar to the bioretention cell the slopes of the regression models for both runoff depth and peak flow mitigation between the lid and control catchment remained unchanged between the project periods however simplified ancova models indicated that the intercepts were significantly reduced following the installation of the scms in the catchment p 0 01 fig 3 mean runoff depths were reduced by 47 in the lid catchment between the calibration and treatment periods while mean peak flow rates were reduced by 56 p 0 01 table 3 given the surface clogging that occurred in the permeable pavement the majority of these benefits are associated with volume and peak flow reductions provided by the bioretention cell like the bioretention and permeable pavements the rot in the lid catchment decreased from 2 9 mm in the calibration period to 2 1 mm in the treatment period illustrating the effects of the dcia in the catchment and lr on the scms on runoff generation fig 5 confidence intervals created around the rots for the calibration and treatment periods in the lid catchment overlapped indicating this reduction was not significant however as observed in the bioretention catchment fig 5 the effects of the scms on runoff discharged from the lid catchment are more evident for larger storm depths as illustrated by the decreased regression slope for storms in the treatment period relative to the calibration period fig 5 the mitigation of runoff depths and peak flow rates discharged from the lid catchment are within the range of results reported in previous performance studies of multiple scms in commercial catchments rushton 2001 reported runoff volume reductions of 40 45 from a parking lot retrofitted with swales and permeable pavement however lrs and dcia of contributing drainage areas were not reported line et al 2012 reported runoff volume reductions of 34 from a commercial site retrofitted with permeable pavement and bioretention systems receiving runoff from a catchment comprised of 76 impervious cover however discrepancies between design and as built conditions noted by the authors led to undersized installations which likely skewed the results of this study wilson et al 2014 reported runoff volumes and peak flow depths from a 2 53 ha commercial site comprised of 84 dcia were reduced by over 98 after being retrofitted with several lid systems though the authors note overdesigned scms in terms of runoff capture depth may have contributed to these results beyond the commercial setting the results herein are similar to previous studies investigating the effects of lid installed in residential catchments often characterized by lower proportions of dcia bedan and clausen 2007 reported weekly storm flows were reduced by 42 following construction of lid installations including a bioretention cell grassed swales and permeable pavement in a residential watershed 22 impervious cover while peak flow reductions were not observed page et al 2015 reported runoff depth and peak flow reductions of 52 and 28 respectively following scm retrofits i e bioretention cell permeable pavements and a tree filter device in a paired watershed study of a residential catchment in wilmington north carolina comprised of 24 dcia despite having the highest proportion of dcia in the contributing drainage area 85 among comparable studies the systems installed in the lid catchment demonstrate the ability of distributed scms to provide hydrologic mitigation in completely impervious highly connected parking lots characteristic of commercial areas when appropriately sized and maintained further additional reductions to runoff volumes and peak flow rates may have been realized had the sir of the permeable pavement not diminished over time due to surface clogging caused by an extremely high 27 6 lr findings from the lid catchment illustrate the importance of maintaining individual scms throughout a catchment for the full benefits of these systems to be realized 3 5 conclusions the hydrologic impacts of a bioretention cell and permeable pavement receiving runoff from a highly impervious highly connected commercial catchment were investigated using a paired watershed approach following the installation of the bioretention cell mean runoff depths and peak flow rates were significantly decreased by 83 and 86 respectively compared to the control catchment in which no scms were installed given the poorly infiltrating soils underlying the cell the authors suspect that surrounding subsurface infrastructure namely a gravel trench enclosing the adjacent sewer pipe and nearby curb drain provided preferential pathways providing for substantial exfiltration from the cell unaccounted for in monitoring efforts however despite the large area of impervious cover contributing runoff to the system the bioretention cell was able provide hydrologic mitigations at similar levels reported in previous research demonstrating the viability of this scm for use in stormwater management strategies in commercial settings conversely monitoring results revealed no signficant differences in the hydrology of the contributing catchment following the installation of the permeable pavement surface infiltration tests performed at various locations across the pavement surface area revealed that the median surface infiltration rate of the pavement declined by 96 over the course of the treatment period this indicates that severe surface clogging had occurred in the upper layers of the system which was attributed to concentrated sediment loading from the completely impervious catchment lack of routine maintenance performed on the pavement and snow plowing activities in the parking lot maintenance and restorative measures are needed at the site to restore surface infiltration rates after which regular maintenance such as regenerative air sweeping should be performed at the site on a sufficient basis to maintain the effectiveness of the permeable pavement the combined performance of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement significantly mitigated runoff generated from the 1 02 ha treatment parking lot catchment runoff depths produced from the catchment were reduced by 47 while peak flow rates were reduced by 56 these results were similar to previous studies of lid implemented in commercial catchments and were within the range of results published in previous studies of lid installed in residential catchments despite the surface clogging that occurred in the permeable pavement and the high proportion of directly connected imperviousness present in the contributing catchment the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed scms when appropriately sized and maintained to mitigate runoff in commercial settings future research should aim to

4991,this paired watershed study investigated the hydrologic impacts of low impact development lid stormwater control measures scms receiving runoff from a highly impervious highly connected commercial parking area located in reynoldsburg ohio usa the site was retrofitted with a bioretention cell and permeable pavement treating 0 60 ha and 0 42 ha of the parking lot respectively following a 12 month monitoring period of the existing parking lot hydrology i e calibration period monitoring continued for an additional 20 months after construction i e treatment period the bioretention cell significantly reduced runoff depths and peak flow rates from the catchment reducing mean values by 83 and 86 respectively subsurface infrastructure i e a gravel trench enclosing an adjacent sewer pipe and a nearby curb drain was suspected to provide preferential pathways which resulted in substantial exfiltration from the cell despite poorly infiltrating underlying soils conversely no significant differences in catchment hydrology were observed following the installation of the permeable pavement the median surface infiltration rate decreased by 96 during the study indicating that surface clogging occurred in the upper layers of the permeable pavement clogging was attributed to concentrated sediment loading delivered from the impervious catchment along with lack of routine maintenance and snow plowing activities it was concluded the loading ratio 27 6 1 of the permeable pavement was much too high and this level of run on should be avoided in future retrofits despite this the combined effects of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement led to significant runoff mitigation from the parking lot reducing both runoff depths 47 and peak flow rates 56 results were similar to previous studies of lid implemented in commercial catchments with lower levels of directly connected impervious cover than those herein this study demonstrates the effectiveness of scms in

consequences of urban development on receiving water bodies these result primarily from shifts in the hydrologic behavior of a landscape and the conveyance of concentrated anthropogenic pollutants to surface water resources leopold 1968 booth and jackson 1997 critical to these impacts are the presence of impervious surfaces such as parking lots roadways and rooftops which are nearly ubiquitous in cities around the world shuster et al 2007 impervious surfaces eliminate the infiltration capacity of soils create increased volumes and velocities of surface water runoff during storm events and diminish the recharge of groundwater that regulates base flow in streams arnold and gibbons 1996 as a result a greater portion of rainfall is converted to surface runoff conveyed to streams at higher velocities via pipe networks leading to a variety of degraded stream conditions generally referred to as the urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 examples of these conditions include reduced base flow in streams increased flood events decreased time to peak flow rates diminished water quality straightening and incision of stream channels and reduced aquatic habitat and biodiversity walsh et al 2005 though increasing urbanization often leads to a greater proportion of impervious coverage the degree of connectedness of these surfaces to drainage networks is an important driver of their hydrologic impacts to surrounding water resources booth and jackson 1997 essentially all runoff generated from directly connected impervious areas dcia such as streets with curb and gutter systems parking lots draining to storm sewer catch basins etc will reach streams and other receiving water bodies brabec et al 2002 thus streams in watersheds with high levels of connected impervious cover will be subjected to greater impacts from stormwater runoff leading to the subsequent degradation of urban stream conditions however research has shown even low levels of dcia e g 10 can increase runoff volumes and peak discharge rates following development shuster et al 2007 to mitigate the detrimental effects of urban runoff stormwater management strategies increasingly are turning toward low impact development lid principles such techniques are implemented to restore the predevelopment hydrologic conditions of a site and rely on distributed stormwater control measures scms such as bioretention cells and permeable pavement to manage stormwater near its source nrc 2009 bioretention cells also referred to as bioinfiltration practices or rain gardens typically consist of an excavated depression backfilled with engineered soil media this soil is vegetated with turf grass or planted with shrubs forbs native grasses and or trees and mulched davis et al 2009 hunt et al 2012 runoff produced during a storm event is routed into the bioretention cell temporarily filling the surface storage zone referred to as the bowl and infiltrating into the soil media where numerous biogeochemical processes provide treatment of dissolved and particulate bound pollutants runoff that has percolated through the media profile exits the system via several pathways through exfiltration into native soils through evaporation and transpiration i e evapotranspiration et or through perforated underdrains which discharge treated effluent into existing storm sewer networks bioretention designs in ohio commonly include an internal water storage iws layer which creates a zone of saturation in the lower regions of the media these features have the dual benefit of providing the anerobic conditions needed for nitrogen removal via denitrification while enhancing runoff storage and volume reduction through exfiltration into the native soils between events hunt et al 2012 winston et al 2016a several studies have demonstrated the ability of bioretention cells to reduce runoff volumes often completely abstracting runoff volumes from smaller storms and mitigate peak flow rates if proper construction practices and maintenance techniques are implemented e g li et al 2009 brown and hunt 2011a winston et al 2016a permeable pavements which can be constructed from materials such as porous asphalt pervious concrete or permeable interlocking concrete pavement picp implemented herein are paved surfaces that permit infiltration of stormwater while supporting vehicular or pedestrian traffic line et al 2012 runoff produced during a storm event infiltrates through the porous surface of the pavement into an aggregate subbase before exiting the system through exfiltration into underlying soils and contributing to groundwater recharge or via a perforated underdrain feeding into a nearby storm sewer weiss et al 2017 in addition to providing temporary storage and mitigating flow rates during a rain event permeable pavements have been shown to improve the quality of runoff by providing opportunities for removal of sediment bound pollutants through sedimentation and filtration as water percolates through the various aggregate layers selbig et al 2019 research has shown the ability of permeable pavements to reduce runoff volumes and mitigate peak flow rates drake et al 2013 in some cases such as bean et al 2007a runoff volumes were eliminated in permeable pavements installed atop sandy underlying soils however lower rates of runoff reduction are more commonly reported in systems with clay soils e g fassman and blackbourn 2010 braswell et al 2018 winston et al 2018 despite their demonstrated benefits surface clogging due to sediment accumulation can limit the movement of water into the aggregate subbase reducing the effectiveness of permeable pavements to manage runoff bean et al 2007b thus regular maintenance activities including measures such as pressure washing mechanical and vacuum sweeping etc are required to maintain the hydraulic function of permeable pavements winston et al 2016b commercial developments are typically characterized by large parking areas designed to accommodate peak usage which occurs on an infrequent basis nrc 2009 because they frequently contain a series of storm drains their dcia contributes to the increased relative volumes and degraded nature of runoff produced from commercial land uses relative to other land uses as reported in the national stormwater quality database pitt et al 2004 while commercial developments may employ traditional stormwater infrastructure such as detention ponds limited research characterizing the effectiveness of lid scms to mitigate runoff hydrology in commercial watersheds has been produced to date in a study of a parking lot retrofitted with various lid measures including swales detention basins and permeable pavements rushton 2001 observed reduced area normalized annual runoff volumes peak flow rates and volumetric runoff coefficients i e the ratio of runoff depth to rainfall from catchments where lid retrofits were installed compared to traditional asphalt sections of the same parking lot line et al 2012 studied runoff and pollutant export from three commercial developments in north carolina receiving three different treatments compared to a commercial site retrofitted with lid systems including permeable pavement bioretention cells and a constructed stormwater wetland and a control site where no treatment was implemented the authors observed the highest volume reductions from a commercial site where a wet retention basin was installed line et al 2012 however several complications were observed that limited the effectiveness of the lid systems following their construction including bioretention media clogging a 70 reduction in as built surface storage volumes compared to design and the lack of a drawdown orifice in the stormwater wetland line et al 2012 despite this runoff volumes discharged from the lid site were lower than the control catchment further pollutants loads were exported from the lid retrofitted at significantly lower rates compared to the other two sites in the study line et al 2012 finally wilson et al 2014 compared the quantity and quality of runoff generated from a traditional commercial development to an adjacent site retrofitted with infiltration based lid systems including underground infiltration systems rainwater harvesting cisterns a bioretention cell and a grassed bioswale in raleigh north carolina exceptional hydrologic mitigation was provided by the lid retrofitted site the runoff coefficient from the lid site 0 02 was approximately 25 times lower than the adjacent conventionally managed site 0 49 treated by a dry detention pond median peak flow rates discharged from the conventional site 2 85 l s were approximately nine times higher than those observed at the lid site 0 33 l s wilson et al 2014 the authors attributed these results to overdesigned lid systems whose as built storage was approximately three fold higher than design guidance and high infiltration capacity and driving head of the moderately drained in situ soils at the site wilson et al 2014 though initial studies of lid implementation in commercial watersheds are promising relatively few studies have been conducted in these unique settings thus there is a need for additional research to demonstrate the effectiveness of lid systems in the highly impervious highly connected drainage areas surrounding these facilities this article presents results from a two year monitoring effort of a commercial parking lot retrofitted with a permeable pavement and a bioretention cell the objective of this research was to characterize the impact of the lid systems on the hydrology of the parking lot compared to an adjacent traditionally drained commercial site using a paired watershed approach given the increasing presence of large shopping plazas in urban areas worldwide findings from this research may be highly applicable to both new and existing commercial areas and help promote broader use of lid stormwater management strategies in these settings 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located in adjacent drainage areas of a commercial development in reynoldsburg ohio usa 39 9548 n 82 8121 w approximate elevation of 268 m approximately 16 km east of columbus ohio mean temperatures in reynoldsburg range from 28 7 c in the summer to 3 9 c in the winter the area receives approximately 973 mm of rainfall annually based on long term rainfall records collected at columbus international airport located approximately 8 km west of the site national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national centers for environmental information ncei the paired watershed study consisted of two treatment catchments where lid retrofits were installed midway through the monitoring period and a control catchment which received no treatment during the entirety of the study fig 1 clausen and spooner 1993 the treatment catchments referred to as permeable pavement and bioretention corresponding to the scm installed were made up of adjacent sections of a parking area servicing a commercial grocery store while the parking area and rooftop of a nearby restaurant comprised the control catchment the boundaries of the catchments were delineated using trimble r8 real time kinematic rtk gps survey units trimble inc sunnyvale california usa plots of runoff coefficients against rainfall characteristics i e depth and peak 5 minute rainfall intensity were prepared to identify any threshold values beyond which runoff coefficients dramatically changed which would indicate the potential for runoff to be conveyed to the monitoring points from areas outside of the catchment boundaries such thresholds were not observed thus along with the high accuracy of the rtk gps units i e 2 cm vertical accuracy it was concluded that the catchment boundaries were accurate and substantial runoff produced outside of these boundaries was not conveyed to the scms the permeable pavement catchment covered 0 42 ha of the commercial parking lot though this area included some pervious area i e small parking islands comprising approximately 6 of the catchment the catchment primarily consisted of dcia as such the hydrologic contributions of the pervious cover were considered minor and were excluded from analysis the catchment draining to the bioretention cell was approximately 0 60 ha 74 of which was comprised of dcia with the remainder including a nearby grassed area where the rain gauge was installed the control catchment was also approximately 0 60 ha and included both the building rooftop minor landscaped areas and parking islands approximately 0 06 ha and surrounding impervious parking lot like the permeable pavement catchment the effects of small pervious coverage in the control catchment were considered minor and excluded from the analysis the total effects of the scm retrofits were also investigated by combining their drainage areas 1 02 ha into a shared catchment lid which also was compared to the control to demonstrate the benefits of multiple scms at the catchment scale catch basins routed runoff from the catchments into 61 cm and 76 cm diameter pipes within a common storm sewer network fig 1 2 2 soil characterization soil borings were collected at the site to determine soil texture soil horizons and the elevation of the water table in march 2017 after removing vegetation turf grass the soil profile was evaluated by manually advancing a 6 cm diameter auger in the pervious area to the east of the parking lot fig 1 the auger was advanced in approximately 15 cm increments to a depth of 178 cm below ground surface bgs no o horizon was observed in the profile suggesting that sod seed had been established directly on the 43 cm deep clayey a horizon the b1 horizon characterized as silt loam or silty clay loam was present from 43 cm to 122 cm bgs signs of prolonged saturation of these layers were not evident the b2 horizon was encountered at a depth of 122 cm bgs which persisted for the remainder of the soil profile the soil texture was characterized in the upper portion of this horizon 122 cm to 152 cm bgs as silt loam gravel similar in size to american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto no 57 aggregate was observed in this layer between 152 cm and 178 cm bgs highly saturated conditions and redoximorphic features were observed in the soil therefore the elevation of the water table was estimated to be approximately 1 5 m bgs this was corroborated by the relative elevation of a small perennial stream located to the south of the control watershed approximately 110 m south of the soil boring location field assessments of the soil boring were confirmed by the nrcs web soil survey which categorized the underlying soil as bennington silt loam and cardington silt loam with saturated hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 1 5 to 5 1 mm hr hydrologic soils group hsg c d nrcs 2020 2 3 scm retrofits following a 12 month calibration period a permeable pavement and a bioretention cell were retrofitted into the treatment catchments in november 2017 table 1 fig 1 design cross sections of both scms are provided in the supplementary materials the permeable pavement was constructed using picp underlain by approximately 88 cm of layers of washed aggregate stone which included a 58 cm subbase layer of aashto no 2 nominal diameter 37 5 63 mm a 10 cm base layer of aashto no 57 aggregate nominal size 4 75 25 0 mm a 14 cm bedding course of aashto no 8 aggregate nominal size 2 36 9 5 mm and capped by the 6 cm thick pavers belgard aashto m43 05 aashto 2018 aastho no 8 aggregate was also used to fill the joints between the pavers the permeable pavement surrounded an existing catch basin in the parking lot which served as an overflow for surface runoff during storm events the permeable pavement was drained by a 10 cm perforated pvc underdrain the elevation of the underdrain was raised using an upturned elbow creating a 15 cm iws layer in the subbase the permeable pavement covered an area of 152 m2 provided a subsurface storage volume of 44 5 m3 and had a corresponding loading ratio lr defined as the ratio of dcia to scm surface area of 27 6 this aspect of design was intended to test the effectiveness of permeable pavements receiving drainage from proportionally larger areas and is substantially higher than the maximum lr 2 0 specified by the stormwater design guidance in ohio rainwater and land development oepa 2014 this lr is very high relative to other studies of permeable pavement applications in the literature e g page et al 2015 winston et al 2016c braswell et al 2018 tirpak et al 2020 which allowed for evaluation of system performance under extremely hydrologically taxed conditions aside from vacuum sweeping performed in april 2019 to test the efficacy of a new maintenance technique to restore surface infiltration rate sir no other maintenance was performed on the permeable pavement during the study during winter months snow was plowed from the surrounding parking area and piled atop the permeable pavement shown in the supplementary materials and inside the bowl of the bioretention cell the bioretention cell was constructed during november and december 2017 and was comprised of a 76 cm layer of bioretention media placed directly onto in situ soils which were raked with the teeth of the excavator bucket prior to media installation the media was classified as a loamy sand and met the bioretention media specifications for ohio of at least 80 sand no greater than 10 clay and 3 5 organic matter by weight per specifications provided by the manufacturer kurtz brothers inc oepa 2014 the cell was topped with approximately 9 cm of shredded hardwood mulch and planted with numerous plant species in december 2017 including red osier dogwood cornus sericea blue flag iris iris versicolor swamp milkweed asclepias incarnate pink turtlehead chelone lyonii dwarf joe pye weed eupatorium and wild bergamot monarda fistulosa the system was infill planted with wild petunia ruellia humilis and purple lovegrass eragrostis spectabilis plugs in may 2018 the surface of the cell had 5 1 side slopes and an average ponding depth of 13 cm resulting in a surface storage capacity of 12 7 m3 similar to the permeable pavement the bioretention cell was drained by a perforated 10 cm underdrain surrounded by aashto no 57 aggregate prior to discharging into the existing catch basin which served as a high flow bypass in the event of overflow the elevation of the underdrain was raised to create a 30 cm iws layer in the media runoff generated from the contributing catchment which was approximately 60 times larger than the surface area of the bioretention cell 100 m2 was routed into the cell through five curb cuts each curb cut had a dedicated rock apron aashto no 1 fig 1 2 4 experimental design and data collection monitoring was performed from october 2016 through december 2019 however activities were discontinued between january march 2017 december 2017 march 2018 and january march 2019 due to wintery conditions i e freezing temperatures snowfall further data for november 2017 were removed from the analysis that follows as the scms were under construction during this time following a paired watershed study design the monitoring spanned two periods of interest calibration and treatment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scm retrofits clausen and spooner 1993 hydrologic data collected during the calibration period october 2016 october 2017 where traditional stormwater management i e catch basins and sewers was employed in the catchments was used to develop a linear relationship between runoff depths and peak flow rates for the control and treatment catchments similarly a second linear relationship was developed during the treatment period march 2018 december 2019 between the catchments following scm installation advantages of the paired watershed approach include the ability to control for temporal changes in climate and hydrologic conditions and thus to attribute changes to a specific treatment clausen and spooner 1993 rainfall measurements were collected at two minute intervals using a 0 254 mm tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments and confirmed with a manual rain gauge installed within 100 m of the scms fig 1 in an open area free of overhead obstructions hydrologic monitoring was performed using a series of v notch weirs and hobo u20 water level loggers onset installed in the sewer network draining the catchments prior to commencing data collection during the calibration period 0 6 m tall 60 degree sharp crested v notch weirs were installed in the catch basins draining the control and bioretention catchments while a 0 9 m tall 90 degree sharp crested v notch weir was installed in the catch basin draining the permeable pavement catchment since flow over the bioretention and control weirs contributed to flow at the permeable pavement monitoring point these flows were subtracted from the measurements made at the permeable pavement weir this resulted in the flow rate discharging from the permeable pavement catchment perforated pvc monitoring wells were installed in both the permeable pavement and bioretention cells during construction hobo u20 water level loggers housed within these wells measured stage in the cross section of each installation at two minute increments all hobo u20 water level loggers were corrected to gauge pressure using on site atmospheric pressure measurements from a hobo u20 logger 2 5 data analysis individual rain events were separated by a minimum antecedent dry period adp of 6 h and minimum depth of 2 5 mm hydrologic data were analyzed using hoboware onset excel microsoft and the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 after adjusting for ambient pressure stage readings from water level loggers were converted to flow rates using standard equations for 60 degree and 90 degree weirs flow volumes were determined by integrating flow rates with time runoff depth was determined as the total flow volume on an event basis divided by the dcia in the contributing catchment for each event peak flow rate was taken as the instantaneous 2 minute maximum measured rate of flow water level data was used to calculate the drawdown rate in the bioretention cross section following a storm event water levels declined exponentially as water was discharged through the underdrain followed by an approximately linear decline at a rate proportional to the exfiltration rate of the surrounding soils indicating the cessation of drainage thus the drawdown rate was derived by determining the average slope of the linear portion of the decline in internal water level for storm events where runoff depth was greater than 1 25 times the rainfall depth or when equipment malfunctioned e g lack of recorded water levels data were excluded from analysis given the procedures used to delineate and verify the catchment boundaries see section 2 1 events exceeding this threshold were attributed to issues with the tipping bucket rain gauge as opposed to runoff contributions from areas outside the catchment boundaries inaccurate measurements were possible when the gauge became clogged with bird droppings leaves and other debris though effort was made to minimize the instances when this occurred as a result rainfall depths were erroneously underestimated during some events causing runoff depths to far exceed rainfall depths for a given storm event this threshold was selected after plotting rainfall versus runoff trends and identifying potentially erroneous readings that could not be explained by other factors which could have inflated runoff depths e g rainfall characteristics the threshold was set well above 1 0 to account for the effects of runoff retained within the catchment or scm cross section from a previous storm on subsequent rain events e g following a very short adp over the course of the monitoring period 22 events were identified that surpassed this threshold corresponding to approximately 16 of the total number of events recorded during the study tests for significant linear relationships between log transformed treatment and control catchment hydrologic data collected were performed using analysis of variance anova these tests were executed separately for the calibration and treatment periods assumptions of normality and constant variance of regression residuals were confirmed graphically using plots of residuals against fitted values and q q plots analysis of covariance ancova was used to test for significant differences in the slopes and intercepts of regression models between monitoring periods for both runoff depth and peak flow rate testing using full ancova models for all hydrologic metrics revealed regression slopes did not significantly differ between periods for any catchment therefore reduced ancova models were used to test for differences in regression model intercepts between periods statistically significant differences in model intercepts indicated the scm retrofit had a significant impact on catchment hydrology following installation and that the magnitude of change was constant across the rainfall events observed during the monitoring period changes in hydrologic performance were quantified using least square means lsm analysis after assessing normality using shapiro wilk goodness of fit tests significant differences in rainfall characteristics between periods were determined using wilcoxon rank sum tests the runoff threshold rot the rainfall depth at which incipient runoff is generated was determined during the calibration and treatment periods as the x intercept from plots relating runoff and rainfall depths for each catchment bootstrapping was performed to determine the 95 confidence interval ci around the rot to compare changes in rot between periods as precipitation cannot be negative a practical limit of zero on the lower bound of the ci was implemented when necessary all statistical analyses were performed using r and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 unless noted otherwise 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation thirty three rain events were recorded during the calibration period ranging from 2 5 to 44 2 mm while the 76 events recorded during the treatment period ranged from 2 5 to 51 1 mm fig 2 in total the events recorded during the calibration and treatment periods resulted in 424 4 mm and 810 8 mm of rainfall respectively based on 65 years of historic rainfall records approximately 973 mm of precipitation has been recorded annually at john glenn columbus international airport noaa ncei rainfall characteristics including average intensity peak 5 minute intensity and adp of storms recorded during the monitoring periods are summarized in table 2 though the monitoring period spanned 2018 the wettest year on record in columbus in which rainfall totaled 1401 mm national weather service generally drier conditions followed in 2019 correspondingly statistical testing revealed that rainfall depths peak and average rainfall intensities and adps were not significantly different between the calibration and treatment periods p 0 05 3 2 bioretention the installation of the bioretention cell significantly impacted the depths and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the contributing catchment as evidenced by the signficant differences in the intercepts of the regression lines in fig 3 p 0 001 differences in runoff depth and peak flow reductions were quantified using lsm analysis mean runoff depths and peak flow rates significantly decreased by 83 and 86 between the calibration and treatment periods respectively p 0 001 table 3 example hyetographs and hydrographs demonstrating the responses of the treatment catchments to a relatively small 12 2 mm and large 31 0 mm storm event are shown in fig 4 these events corresponded to the 68th and 97th percentile storms observed during the treatment period respectively in both instances runoff volumes and peak flow rates discharged from the bioretention cell were substantially smaller than the impervious control catchment the timing of peak flow from the bioretention cell compared to the control catchment for the two events was mixed as peak flows were delayed by approximately one hour for the smaller storm yet peak discharge from the bioretention cell occurred earlier in the larger storm compared to the control this may be attributable to differences in rainfall characteristics for each event for example temporary bowl storage may have attenuated the higher peak intensity yet reduced depth of the small event whereas the lower intensity longer duration of the large event in combination with the completely impervious catchment may have saturated the bioretention media within the first six hours of the event resulting in peak discharge occurring earlier in the storm nonetheless the magnitude of peak discharge from the bioretention cell was greatly diminished compared to the control catchment for both events demonstrating the effectiveness of this scm to attenuate peak flows from the impervious catchment the rot of the bioretention catchment decreased marginally from 2 8 mm in the calibration period to 1 7 mm in the treatment period similarly the rot in the control catchment decreased between the project periods dropping from 2 3 mm in the calibration period to 1 4 mm in the treatment period confidence intervals around the calibration and treatment rots overlapped for both the bioretention and control catchments indicating the changes observed between the project periods were not significant fig 5 the relatively low rot observed for the bioretention catchment was representative of the high proportion of dcia in the contributing catchment which rapidly conveyed runoff into the bioretention cell even during smaller storm events walsh et al 2005 page et al 2015 this resulted in a rapid rise in internal stage and subsequent outflow from the cell as shown in fig 6 as rots are determined from the x intercept of the regression models smaller storm depths that produced small though non zero outflow can influence results thus the effects of the bioretention cell on runoff discharged from the catchment are more evident for larger storm depths as illustrated by the decreased regression slope for storms in the treatment period relative to the calibration period compared to the change in regression lines for the control catchment fig 5 this suggests flows move quickly through the bioretention media contributing outflow to the sewer early in the rain event through the underdrain however the underdrain clearly serves to throttle outflow rates allowing time for runoff volume reduction to occur fig 3 these results suggest that significant volumes of runoff were diverted to exfiltration and or et while the infiltration rate of the bioretention media the surface area of the cell and the bowl volume provided significant mitigation of peak flow rates of influent runoff from the catchment though several studies have observed similar hydrologic performance e g hunt et al 2008 99 peak flow reduction brown and hunt 2011a 75 100 volume reduction debusk and wynn 2011 97 volume reduction 99 peak flow reduction and olszewski and davis 2013 79 volume reduction 83 peak flow reduction these results were somewhat surprising given the poorly draining underlying soils the high percentage of dcia in the catchment the high water table on the site and the relatively high lr of the cell table 1 relatively few studies have reported on the performance of bioretention systems in these settings luell 2011 studied two bioretention cells installed atop compacted soils that received runoff from an impervious bridge deck in knightdale north carolina the surface area of the cells ranged from 5 of the contributing catchment small to 10 of the catchment large and each included a 60 cm iws zone luell 2011 low exfiltration rates ranging between 1 6 and 4 0 mm hr hsg c soils into in situ soils were observed correspondingly runoff volumes were reduced by 20 and 30 for the large and small cell respectively luell 2011 winston et al 2016a observed the hydrologic and water quality performance of three bioretention cells installed atop clay soils hsg d in northeast ohio of the monitored installations the ursuline college cell which had a surface area representing 6 5 of the impervious cover in the contributing catchment most closely resembled the cell described herein winston et al 2016a the cell reduced runoff volumes by 59 which was attributed to iws depth 0 6 m and drawdown rate 4 3 mm hr that permitted inter event exfiltration winston et al 2016a the cell reduced peak flow rates for events exceeding the one year five minute rainfall intensity by 53 88 the authors attributed this result to the oversized bowl volume of the cell which provided storage for higher intensity peak inflow before overflow occurred winston et al 2016a selbig and balster 2009 documented the performance of two rain gardens with differing planting palettes i e turf grass and native prairie species located atop differing soil conditions i e sand and clay over a five year period compared to luell 2011 winston et al 2016a and the installation studied herein the cells studied by selbig and balster 2009 were larger relative to their contributing catchments which were comprised of sections of a nearby rooftop approximately five times larger than the surface area of the rain gardens hydrologic performance appeared to reflect this over the course of the monitoring period 96 of precipitation was infiltrated by the rain garden planted with turf grass atop clay soils compared to 100 infiltrated by the prairie rain garden installed atop sand selbig and balster 2009 rainfall intensity and adp were also attributed to rain garden performance selbig and balster 2009 given the poorly drained hsg c d soils underlying the cell section 2 2 and the higher lr relative to catchment imperviousness 44 4 compared to these studies these results were unexpected and warranted further investigation it was hypothesized an alternative hydrologic pathway may have been present in the cell that provided drainage that bypassed the underdrain to confirm the presence of a bypass the drawdown rate of water retained within the bioretention cell following a rain event was analyzed using internal stage data collected in the perforated well trends in internal stage in the cell following a large 26 2 mm and small 4 3 mm storm event are shown in fig 6 stage quickly rose in the cross section during both events and surpassed the iws depth 30 cm indicated by the red line in fig 6 in both events as continued runoff filled the pore space in the media above the level of the underdrain outlet water levels rapidly receded with the cessation of rainfall indicating the cell was dewatering as stage dropped below the top of the iws layer water levels would be expected to decrease over time due to the combined effects of et and exfiltration from the cells exfiltration should occur at a rate proportional to the infiltration rate of in situ soils instead water levels continued to rapidly decline by an average of 15 mm hr to a depth of approximately 9 cm above the bottom of the cell fig 6 water was discharged from the cells via exfiltration below this point as levels declined for the two storms at an average of 1 28 mm hr an expected result given the underlying soil type this analysis was repeated for an additional 20 storm events to confirm drawdown patterns from the bioretention cell trends consistent with those exhibited in fig 6 were observed for these events based on this data the mean drawdown rate and thus rate of exfiltration from the cell was determined to be 1 20 mm hr assuming the cell was dewatering at this rate for the duration of the monitoring period approximately 30 of the water balance of the bioretention cell was exfiltration as drainage accounted for 14 of inflow to the cell approximately 56 of the overall water balance was not accounted for through monitoring though a portion of losses from the cell can be attributed to et previous field scale studies of bioretention indicate that volumes reduced via et represent a minor component e g 3 5 5 of the water balance brown and hunt 2011b winston et al 2016a the authors hypothesize that the infrastructure surrounding the cell namely the adjacent parking lot island and 61 cm storm sewer line may have provided a preferential drainage pathway for water percolating through the bioretention media that accounts for the remainder of the unmonitored portion of the water balance a gravel trench which served as a footing for the concrete curb and gutter surrounding the parking lot island and which encased the storm sewer pipe was revealed during excavation fig 6 this aggregate may have provided an outlet for treated effluent to exit the bioretention cell at an elevation below the underdrain invert though a portion of this water may have exfiltrated into underlying soils it is possible that some water draining into the trench may have been conveyed downstream along the length of the pipe in addition to the preferential pathway provided by the sewer a curb drain entering the catch basin draining the bioretention cell was observed during construction curb drains are commonly utilized to prevent damage to surface infrastructure by providing additional drainage below the frost line which is specified at 81 cm in ohio building codes ord 733 06 22 considering the bowl storage depth 13 cm and depth of filter media 76 cm in the cell table 1 curb drains installed at this depth would be approximately 8 cm above the bottom of the bioretention cell roughly equivalent to the effective storage depth 9 cm observed in the water level data in fig 6 though flows discharged through the curb drain entered the catch basin upstream of the weir and contributed to monitored outflows this reduced the storage in the cell to approximately 30 of the iws depth 30 cm fig 6 the interactions with the surrounding infrastructure which provided preferential pathways for drainage from the cell are the likely source of the discrepancies between the runoff reduction performance observed herein compared to previously reported studies of bioretention under similar conditions luell 2011 winston et al 2016a the interactions with surrounding subsurface infrastructure are known as urban karst defined as disturbed areas in the soil characterized by high porosity and large void spaces associated with pipe trenches excavations foundations gravel trenches around utility lines etc that affect the flow of near surface groundwater and infiltrated stormwater in urban areas kaushal and belt 2012 bonneau et al 2017 the larger soil pores associated with urban karst permit water to move in the subsurface at rates that can exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surrounding soils by several orders of magnitude diminishing the effectiveness of infiltration based scms including bioretention cells to mitigate stormwater volumes through retention and drainage into underlying soils bonneau et al 2017 given the proximity to adjacent infrastructure the exceptional hydrologic mitigation by the bioretention cell is most likely explained by this phenomenon though the volume and fate of runoff diverted into these pathways may not be able to be quantified or defined abatement of flow rates and volumes would have occurred in these subsurface conduits compared to surface flows in the unmitigated control catchment further unless these subsurface interactions were prevented in design such as using impermeable membranes along the sides of the excavation for the bioretention cell similar volume reductions through these preferential pathways may be expected to occur in bioretention cells installed in similar settings thus the installation described herein demonstrates the effectiveness of bioretention cells to mitigate runoff even in highly impervious highly connected catchments and suggests the use of this scm as a viable stormwater management strategy in similar commercial developments it should be noted however that stormwater infiltrated into bioretention cells permeable pavements and other infiltration based scms in urban environments may interact with other subsurface drainage pathways this may limit the potential for groundwater recharge and contributions to baseflow while also introducing the potential for stormwater to enter sewer pipes through cracks and fissures i e infiltration and inflow and thus possibly contribute to sanitary sewer overflows bonneau et al 2017 3 3 permeable pavement unlike the bioretention cell the depths and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the permeable pavement catchment did not significantly change following the installation of the permeable pavement p 0 05 ancova analyses revealed the regression equations used to model the relationship between the control and permeable pavement catchments did not change between periods table 3 fig 3 this finding is evident in the example hydrographs shown in fig 4 for both the small and large rain events discharge from the permeable pavement trended closely with that of the control catchment indicating that the rainfall runoff response in the permeable pavement catchment was similar to that of an impervious catchment fig 4 similar to the bioretention cell the rot of the permeable pavement catchment declined from 3 0 mm in the calibration period to 2 2 mm in the treatment period however the 95 cis around the rots for both project periods overlapped indicating the rot did not significantly change following the installation of the permeable pavement fig 5 again unlike the bioretention cell the effects of the permeable pavement for larger storm events were not evident further the slopes of the regression models for the calibration and treatment periods for the permeable pavement were similar and more closely resembled trends in runoff generation observed from the control catchment fig 5 taken together these results suggest the permeable pavement was effectively functioning as a traditional impermeable pavement during the treatment period failure of permeable pavements to mitigate runoff is frequently tied to surface clogging which prevents movement of runoff into the subsurface as a result of sediment accumulation and can reduce sir by several orders of magnitude winston et al 2016a clogging of permeable pavements is typically observed by decreased sir or water ponding on the pavement surface oepa 2014 because ponding was frequently visible on the pavement layer during rain events along with the concentrated sediment loads delivered to the permeable pavement as a result of its large lr 27 6 and the lack of routine maintenance performed on the system it was determined the surface of the permeable pavement had clogged during the study the sir of the permeable pavement was measured at six locations see supplementary material across the permeable pavement using methods in astm c1781 astm 2013 measurements of surface infiltration rate were repeated five times at these six locations between august 2018 and october 2019 fig 7 median sir decreased by 96 during the 14 month period from 76 mm min in august 2018 to 3 mm min in october 2019 while some testing locations i e locations 2 and 6 exhibited sir over 100 mm min following the august 2018 measurements approximately nine months after the installation of the pavement sir at five of the six locations i e locations 1 3 4 5 and 6 fell below 7 mm min by october 2019 though sir varied spatially across the surface area of the permeable pavement a clear exponential decay can be observed in the data similar to that observed for two porous asphalt pavements in northern sweden in winston et al 2016b and a pervious concrete in sansalone et al 2008 however the exponential function fit to the median sirs sir mm min 310 5 e 2 99 a g e y r s r2 0 89 herein predicts a much more rapid decline in sir over time compared to data published in winston et al 2016b sir mm min 89 7 e 0 28 a g e y r s r2 0 89 unlike the permeable pavement described herein which operated under hydrologically taxed conditions i e lr of 27 6 the permeable pavements summarized in winston et al 2016b both of which were in operation for over 20 years only treated direct rainfall and did not receive run on from adjacent impervious areas i e lr equal to zero these results support the conclusion that sirs of permeable pavements decline exponentially as the pavement ages and a more rapid decline in sir and overall effectiveness of a permeable pavement can be expected in systems with higher lrs the lowest sirs were frequently observed at locations 1 and 3 ponding was commonly observed in the vicinity of location 1 which was adjacent to the catch basin and a point of lower elevation on the surface of the permeable pavement thus it was likely the location of concentrated sediment deposition conveyed from the catchment see supplementary material observations of snow piled on the permeable pavement near test location 3 following snow plowing activities in winter are likely the source of the diminished sir in the southern section of the pavement seasonal accumulation of solids due to snow plowing during the winter and subsequent release in spring snowmelt has been observed in permeable pavement research tirpak et al 2020 testing results suggest sir in these locations were severely diminished shortly after the installation of the pavement interestingly the location with the highest sir location 6 109 mm min during testing in august 2018 exhibited the lowest sir 1 mm min by october 2019 this location was the closest to the edge of the permeable pavement on the southeast corner of the system where fines generated from the asphalt were likely deposited due to abrasions and wear from vehicles essentially this location acted as a forebay and has been noted as an area of exceptionally higher maintenance needs winston et al 2016b finally it should be noted the increase in sir observed at location 2 between testing conducted in october 2018 and april 2019 performed one week prior to the regenerative air street sweeping conducted at the site may be attributable to testing inconsistencies such as an incomplete seal between the single ring infiltrometer and the pavement as well as timing of drainage into the surface which can occur very rapidly in unclogged areas of permeable pavements the median sir of the permeable pavement is within the range of previous studies that reported poor infiltration rate associated with surface clogging in a study of permeable pavement sirs bean et al 2007b reported the median sir of picp sites without obvious accumulation of fine particles on the surface was 2000 cm hr 333 mm min conversely the median sir of sites adjacent to disturbed soils that partially filled permeable pavement interstitial spaces with fine soil particles was 8 0 cm hr 1 3 mm min similar to the pavement described herein bean et al 2007b studies summarized in drake et al 2013 that observed minimal infiltration from picp systems frequently reported sir below 5 cm hr 0 8 mm min maintenance activities such as power washing mechanical street sweeping and regenerative air sweeping have been shown to restore the infiltration rate of clogged systems and are recommended to be performed two to four times annually to remove accumulated sediment oepa 2014 winston et al 2016a however if such activities are not regularly performed fines trapped in the picp joint spaces can be compacted in void spaces or migrate deeper in the cross section which may not be accessible with routine maintenance measures bean et al 2007b given that the maintenance regenerative air street sweeping performed on the pavement in late april 2019 did not have significant effects on improving the median sir of the system fig 7 it is suspected that fines captured in the pavement layer migrated deep into the cross section as a result more extensive restorative measures such as removal of picp and replacement of bedding stone may be required to restore the intended hydrologic function of the pavement danz et al 2020 furthermore the lr 27 6 for this permeable pavement is so high that the long term maintenance needs for this scm to ensure its hydraulic function may be unreasonable the surface clogging that rendered the permeable pavement ineffective is likely a result of a combination of the high lr of the system the lack of routine maintenance performed on the site and the snow management activities conducted in the parking lot because of the large impervious area and thus the higher sediment loads draining to the system routine maintenance may be needed on an even more frequent basis compared to the semiannual maintenance recommended for other permeable pavements oepa 2014 it is recommended maintenance regimes be developed based on lr and catchment characteristics rather than a one size fits all approach amending snow plowing procedures at the site to ensure operators do not pile snow on the permeable pavement may reduce the accumulation of sediment during snowmelt and prolong the effectiveness of the system between maintenance intervals 3 4 lid catchment the combined effects of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement led to signficant reductions in the depth and peak flow rates of runoff discharged from the lid catchment similar to the bioretention cell the slopes of the regression models for both runoff depth and peak flow mitigation between the lid and control catchment remained unchanged between the project periods however simplified ancova models indicated that the intercepts were significantly reduced following the installation of the scms in the catchment p 0 01 fig 3 mean runoff depths were reduced by 47 in the lid catchment between the calibration and treatment periods while mean peak flow rates were reduced by 56 p 0 01 table 3 given the surface clogging that occurred in the permeable pavement the majority of these benefits are associated with volume and peak flow reductions provided by the bioretention cell like the bioretention and permeable pavements the rot in the lid catchment decreased from 2 9 mm in the calibration period to 2 1 mm in the treatment period illustrating the effects of the dcia in the catchment and lr on the scms on runoff generation fig 5 confidence intervals created around the rots for the calibration and treatment periods in the lid catchment overlapped indicating this reduction was not significant however as observed in the bioretention catchment fig 5 the effects of the scms on runoff discharged from the lid catchment are more evident for larger storm depths as illustrated by the decreased regression slope for storms in the treatment period relative to the calibration period fig 5 the mitigation of runoff depths and peak flow rates discharged from the lid catchment are within the range of results reported in previous performance studies of multiple scms in commercial catchments rushton 2001 reported runoff volume reductions of 40 45 from a parking lot retrofitted with swales and permeable pavement however lrs and dcia of contributing drainage areas were not reported line et al 2012 reported runoff volume reductions of 34 from a commercial site retrofitted with permeable pavement and bioretention systems receiving runoff from a catchment comprised of 76 impervious cover however discrepancies between design and as built conditions noted by the authors led to undersized installations which likely skewed the results of this study wilson et al 2014 reported runoff volumes and peak flow depths from a 2 53 ha commercial site comprised of 84 dcia were reduced by over 98 after being retrofitted with several lid systems though the authors note overdesigned scms in terms of runoff capture depth may have contributed to these results beyond the commercial setting the results herein are similar to previous studies investigating the effects of lid installed in residential catchments often characterized by lower proportions of dcia bedan and clausen 2007 reported weekly storm flows were reduced by 42 following construction of lid installations including a bioretention cell grassed swales and permeable pavement in a residential watershed 22 impervious cover while peak flow reductions were not observed page et al 2015 reported runoff depth and peak flow reductions of 52 and 28 respectively following scm retrofits i e bioretention cell permeable pavements and a tree filter device in a paired watershed study of a residential catchment in wilmington north carolina comprised of 24 dcia despite having the highest proportion of dcia in the contributing drainage area 85 among comparable studies the systems installed in the lid catchment demonstrate the ability of distributed scms to provide hydrologic mitigation in completely impervious highly connected parking lots characteristic of commercial areas when appropriately sized and maintained further additional reductions to runoff volumes and peak flow rates may have been realized had the sir of the permeable pavement not diminished over time due to surface clogging caused by an extremely high 27 6 lr findings from the lid catchment illustrate the importance of maintaining individual scms throughout a catchment for the full benefits of these systems to be realized 3 5 conclusions the hydrologic impacts of a bioretention cell and permeable pavement receiving runoff from a highly impervious highly connected commercial catchment were investigated using a paired watershed approach following the installation of the bioretention cell mean runoff depths and peak flow rates were significantly decreased by 83 and 86 respectively compared to the control catchment in which no scms were installed given the poorly infiltrating soils underlying the cell the authors suspect that surrounding subsurface infrastructure namely a gravel trench enclosing the adjacent sewer pipe and nearby curb drain provided preferential pathways providing for substantial exfiltration from the cell unaccounted for in monitoring efforts however despite the large area of impervious cover contributing runoff to the system the bioretention cell was able provide hydrologic mitigations at similar levels reported in previous research demonstrating the viability of this scm for use in stormwater management strategies in commercial settings conversely monitoring results revealed no signficant differences in the hydrology of the contributing catchment following the installation of the permeable pavement surface infiltration tests performed at various locations across the pavement surface area revealed that the median surface infiltration rate of the pavement declined by 96 over the course of the treatment period this indicates that severe surface clogging had occurred in the upper layers of the system which was attributed to concentrated sediment loading from the completely impervious catchment lack of routine maintenance performed on the pavement and snow plowing activities in the parking lot maintenance and restorative measures are needed at the site to restore surface infiltration rates after which regular maintenance such as regenerative air sweeping should be performed at the site on a sufficient basis to maintain the effectiveness of the permeable pavement the combined performance of the bioretention cell and the permeable pavement significantly mitigated runoff generated from the 1 02 ha treatment parking lot catchment runoff depths produced from the catchment were reduced by 47 while peak flow rates were reduced by 56 these results were similar to previous studies of lid implemented in commercial catchments and were within the range of results published in previous studies of lid installed in residential catchments despite the surface clogging that occurred in the permeable pavement and the high proportion of directly connected imperviousness present in the contributing catchment the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed scms when appropriately sized and maintained to mitigate runoff in commercial settings future research should aim to expand on this research by characterizing the water quality benefits of scms installed in commercial catchments further research should investigate the effects of subsurface infrastructure commonly present in commercial parking areas and the quantity and fate of runoff exfiltrating into these features of the urban karst by advancing the scientific understanding of these systems in the hydrologically taxed conditions commonly found in these settings results from such studies will promote the use of lid strategies to manage stormwater runoff in increasingly abundant commercial

4992,modis fractional fsc and binary bsc snow cover data are important for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal snow cover information for the tibetan plateau tp where rapid warming is closely related to snow cover changes however fsc and bsc data are no longer provided in the newly released version v6 of the modis snow cover product having been replaced with normalized difference snow index ndsi data recent studies have observed clearly lower accuracy of modis snow cover data on the tp than in other areas possibly implying that there are strong scaling effects due to the complex terrain and land cover which are not well understood a total of 353 landsat 8 scenes covering most parts of the tp are used to establish a new empirical relationship between fsc and modis ndsi for fsc estimation and a new ndsi threshold for bsc estimation the results indicate that the new regression model mean root mean squared deviation rmsd 0 22 has a better fsc estimation accuracy than the previously used global reference equation mean rmsd 0 24 and that the new ndsi threshold of 0 29 mean cohen s kappa ck 0 49 outperforms the global reference ndsi threshold of 0 4 mean ck 0 40 in bsc estimation the relatively low accuracy could be due to an enhanced scaling effect the 30 m landsat 8 ndsi data are upscaled to 500 m modis to analyze the scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi we find that the methods using modis ndsi have much lower estimation accuracy for both fsc and bsc compared with those using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi an analysis of variance anova test which considers 512 combinations of aspect slope and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi further demonstrates that the enhanced scaling effects are mainly caused by terrain factors i e aspect and slope the optimal ndsi threshold for estimating bsc generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from the southeast to northwest this study has important implications for the optimal use of modis ndsi snow cover data on the tp and highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods which take more factors into account keywords scaling effects modis fractional

is a key component of the cryosphere and has important effects on climate and water resources snow cover with its high albedo is closely linked to regional climate change via the snow albedo feedback mechanism ma et al 2020 thackeray et al 2019 in addition in high elevation areas such as the himalayas seasonal snow melt is an important source of water armstrong et al 2019 therefore accurate snow cover information is crucial for research on the tibetan plateau tp where snow cover changes play a key role in the elevation dependent warming pepin et al 2019 you et al 2019 and where snow melt makes relatively large contributions 20 to total runoff in the headwater catchments of several major asian rivers zhang et al 2013b in mountainous areas remote sensing is often the most efficient way to carry out large scale snow mapping due to the sparse coverage of ground based observations zhang and ma 2018 this is especially the case for the tp which has an average elevation greater than 4000 m a s l and no regular weather stations above 5000 m as snow has a relatively high reflectance in the visible wavelengths and a relatively low reflectance in the shortwave infrared band the normalized difference snow index ndsi is commonly used for snow detection for a wide range of sensors including modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer landsat tm thematic mapper etm enhanced thematic mapper plus oli operational land imager and sentinel 2 msi multispectral instrument crawford 2015 gascoin et al 2019 hall et al 1995 salomonson and appel 2004 yin et al 2013 out of these products the modis daily snow cover with its relatively high temporal frequency twice a day is probably the most popular although it does have a somewhat coarse spatial resolution of 500 m many studies have used modis fractional or binary snow cover data for the tp for a variety of applications such as analyzing the changes in snow cover area pu et al 2007 zhang et al 2013a snow line choubin et al 2019 tang et al 2014 snow covered days tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2012 and snow cover phenology wang et al 2017 and for providing important snow cover information for driving calibrating or verifying hydrological models immerzeel et al 2009 shrestha et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in addition most of the composite snow cover products use modis snow cover data as an important input chen et al 2018 huang et al 2017 yu et al 2016 however the modis fractional and binary snow cover data are no longer provided in the newest version v6 of the modis snow cover product riggs et al 2016b a good linear relationship between ndsi and snow cover fraction was the theoretical basis of modis fractional snow cover fsc data riggs et al 2006 the original regression equation was developed from 14 landsat scenes and subsequently implemented as a global reference equation for producing modis terra fsc data around the world with the validation root mean squared deviation rmsd and correlation coefficient r reported to be about 0 1 and 0 9 respectively salomonson and appel 2006 the modis binary i e snow or non snow snow cover data bsc uses the assumption that when the ndsi threshold 0 4 at least 50 of the pixel is covered by snow crawford 2015 however increasingly evidence suggests that either the globally applied equation or the spatially fixed ndsi threshold might not be optimal for local applications with variations in landscape and satellite viewing conditions härer et al 2018 mishra et al 2009 riggs et al 2017 thus both fsc and bsc have now been replaced by ndsi snow cover data containing only ndsi values for each pixel these data are expected to be suitable for a wider range of applications this change poses important questions about what regression equation between fsc and modis ndsi should be applied and which ndsi threshold should be used when using the new modis snow cover product on the tp some recent studies based on daily snow depth observations zhang et al 2020 2019b suggest that 0 1 is the optimal ndsi threshold for bsc estimation in china including the tp however their sparse snow depth observations may not represent actual fsc the value of fsc which corresponds to an ndsi threshold of 0 1 also remains unclear the scale issue is an important factor affecting the estimation accuracy of remotely sensed variables mccabe and wood 2006 land surface heterogeneity including different topography and land cover conditions has been demonstrated to greatly impact the prediction of various environmental parameters such as leaf area index garrigues et al 2006 liang 2000 surface energy flux kustas et al 2004 and evapotranspiration long et al 2011 sharma et al 2016 in these studies the aggregation of higher resolution satellite images e g 30 m landsat missions to larger pixel sizes such as 500 m and 1 km is a common way to mimic lower resolution sensors recent studies have also found that while the accuracy of modis snow cover data is generally good for stations outside the tp it is much worse for those within the tp zhang et al 2019b thus there could be strong scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates for the tp however to date few studies have investigated the scaling effects on fsc or bsc estimation using ndsi härer et al 2018 calibrate the ndsi threshold for a range of spatial resolutions from 30 m to 990 m using a camera based snow cover map but they do not test for modis snow cover data the effects of elevation or land cover types on the accuracy of modis snow cover data have been analyzed arsenault et al 2014 huang et al 2011 rittger et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b but the scale influence on fsc or bsc estimation from modis ndsi is poorly understood especially for the tp moderate resolution landsat images have been used for validating modis fractional snow cover data or developing new local relationships czyzowska wisniewski et al 2015 dobreva and klein 2011 hou et al 2020 kuter et al 2018 wang et al 2018 for example rittger et al 2013 assessed modis snow cover data based on 172 landsat images but only 25 of these were of the tp and these were clustered in the nepal himalayas the limited number and spatial coverage of reference images restricts our knowledge about snow mapping accuracy using modis ndsi and the factors influencing it obviously more reference scenes should be used to increase the spatial representativeness and to establish a more reliable ndsi threshold for bsc estimation and a more reliable fsc relationship for fsc estimation here our objectives are 1 re evaluate the ability of the global linear regression equation to estimate fsc from modis ndsi and establish a new more accurate equation for the tp 2 determine the optimal ndsi thresholds for detecting snow pixels with fsc 50 for the tp 3 investigate scaling effects on the accuracy of both modis bsc and fsc estimation for the first time as many as 353 landsat oli scenes from across the tp are used to examine fsc and bsc estimates based on modis ndsi to the best of our knowledge this is also the first study to investigate scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates from modis ndsi by making a comparison with upscaled landsat 8 ndsi data the paper is organized as follows the data used including modis ndsi snow cover data landsat 8 oli reference data and other auxiliary data are described in section 2 the methods used for fsc and bsc estimation based on modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi and scale influence are presented in section 3 results concerning the accuracy of the new regression model and also new optimal ndsi thresholds for fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi are presented in section 4 along with a discussion of the influence of scaling factors uncertainties and limitations 2 data 2 1 modis ndsi snow cover data we use the modis terra snow cover daily l3 global 500 m sin grid version 6 data sets because terra and landsat 8 have similar overpass times the data used are for the period 2013 2015 the modis ndsi data contains two layers ndsi snow cover and raw ndsi modis ndsi ndsimod is calculated following equation 1 1 ndsi mod m 4 m 6 m 4 m 6 where m4 is the modis visible light band 4 wavelength 0 545 0 565 μm and m6 is the shortwave infrared band 6 1 628 1 652 μm ndsi snow cover only contains ndsi values in the range 0 1 1 since values less than 0 1 are converted to 0 indicating non snow the raw ndsi data layer includes the entire range of ndsi values including negative values since the original empirical equation used in previous modis snow products was developed based on the entire range of ndsi salomonson and appel 2004 2006 the raw ndsi values are used here it should be noted that to reduce uncertainties we have excluded all ndsi pixels that did not pass the screening tests of the product due to low visible reflectance high surface temperature high shortwave infrared reflectance or low illumination conditions riggs et al 2016a 2 2 landsat 8 oli reference data landsat 8 oli data are used as the fsc truth following kuter et al 2018 and hou et al 2020 these data have a relatively high spatial resolution of about 30 m but also a relatively long revisit time of about 16 days initially all the available landsat 8 level 1 t scenes with cloud cover 10 during 2013 2015 were downloaded from the usgs earth resources observation and science eros center science processing architecture espa these are provided as top of atmosphere toa reflectance through the online service of espa they are then classified as snow or non snow pixels based on the snomap algorithm hall et al 1995 the ndsi for each 30 m landsat 8 pixel ndsil8 30m is initially calculated according to equation 2 2 n d s i l 8 30 m b 3 l 8 30 m b 6 l 8 30 m b 3 l 8 30 m b 6 l 8 30 m where b3l8 30m is landsat 8 oli band 3 green wavelength 0 525 0 600 μm and b6l8 30m is band 6 shortwave near infrared wavelength 1 560 1 660 μm it should be noted that the subscript 30m is used to distinguish the band or ndsi at the original resolution of 30 m from that at the upscaled resolution of 500 m the pixels with ndsi 0 4 band 3 0 1 and band 5 0 11 are classified as 30 m snow pixels the fsc truth is calculated for each 500 m modis ndsi pixel by counting the number of 30 m snow pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel the method used in the development of the modis fsc algorithm salomonson and appel 2004 2006 due to the difficulty inherent in distinguishing snow from clouds in landsat 8 oli data stillinger et al 2019 all the cloudy 500 m pixels those with 5 of the 30 m pixels flagged as cloud or cloud shadow are eliminated to reduce potential errors in total 353 scenes were selected 201 scenes from 2013 to 2014 used for training the empirical relationship and 152 scenes from 2015 used for validation fig 1 2 3 auxiliary data the land cover type data were obtained from the modis land cover product mcd12q1 collection 6 we use the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification schemes the spatial distribution of the major land cover types of the tp is shown in fig 2 at the pixel scale the spectral characteristics of snow may be weakened due to being mixed with the characteristics of other land cover types in particular the dense canopy of forests may obstruct snow signals and errors in fsc estimation have been found to be significantly correlated with vegetation fraction rittger et al 2013 since the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is closely related to vegetation fraction baret et al 1995 ndvi is also derived from the landsat 8 oli data to evaluate the effects of land cover types for each 30 m landsat 8 pixel ndvi is initially calculated from equation 3 3 n d v i l 8 30 m b 5 l 8 30 m b 4 l 8 30 m b 5 l 8 30 m b 4 l 8 30 m where b5l8 30m is landsat 8 oli band 5 near infrared and b4l8 30m is the band 4 red the ndvi at modis scale is then calculated by averaging all the ndvil8 30m pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel elevation information is obtained from version 3 of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem data which has a similar spatial resolution 30 m to landsat 8 oli the elevation at the modis scale is then calculated by aggregating the original 30 m dem pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel finally slope and aspect are calculated based on the aggregated elevation data at the modis scale 3 methodology fig 3 presents an overview of the input data the processes for using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi for establishing different fsc and bsc estimation methods and how the scale influence analysis is conducted firstly a total of 353 landsat 8 scenes with 30 m resolution are processed to 500 m fsc pixels and subsequently used as truth for training and validating the bsc and fsc estimates derived from modis ndsi the landsat 8 images are also converted to 500 m ndsi pixels for constructing the landsat 8 based bsc and fsc schemes which are then compared with the modis based schemes for analyzing the scaling effects the following sections describe these processes in detail 3 1 fsc estimation 3 1 1 using modis ndsi for fsc estimation constructing a linear regression between the 500 m ndsimod and the fsc derived from 30 m landsat pixels within the corresponding modis pixel is a popular way to estimate fsc which was also used for the modis snow cover product version 5 riggs et al 2006 according to salomonson and appel 2006 only modis pixels with a true fsc in the range of 10 95 are considered for building the regression relationship to reduce the negative effects of multiple samples clustering at very low or very high fsc all the 353 selected landsat 8 scenes have at least 500 corresponding 500 m modis pixels meeting the criteria more detailed information is shown in fig 1 according to salomonson and appel 2004 there are generally two ways of building such an empirical relationship model ma in which ndsimod is taken as the independent variable and fsc as the dependent variable and model mb where fsc is the independent variable and ndsimod is the response it is clear that the equation for mb has to be inverted algebraically to estimate fsc from ndsi but this approach is considered to be better than ma because of the larger variance and errors in ndsi compared to fsc salomonson and appel 2004 2006 for each landsat 8 training scene both models ma and mb are built both models have 201 sets of coefficients derived from the 201 training scenes using samples from all the 201 training scenes two average or universal linear relationships are established called model mau and model mbu the reference linear regression model which was used for producing the global modis fsc developed by salomonson and appel 2006 is also tested here for comparison and named model mr considering the meaningful ranges of ndsi and fsc all estimated fsc 0 or those with ndsi 0 are set to 0 fsc and those with values 1 are set to 100 fsc in total five types of model ma mb mau mbu and mr are built based on ndsimod of these models the one with the highest validation accuracy is considered to be the best model that can be achieved through a linear regression between ndsimod and fsc 3 1 2 upscaling landsat 8 ndsi to modis scale for fsc estimation to further explore the effects of scaling on the accuracy of the linear regression models based on ndsi two types of upscaled landsat 8 ndsi are constructed ndsil8m a mean ndsi calculated for each modis pixel by aggregating all the corresponding landsat 8 ndsi i e ndsil8 30m values and ndsil8i an ndsi calculation made using equation 4 4 n d s i l 8 i b 3 l 8 500 m b 6 l 8 500 m b 3 l 8 500 m b 6 l 8 500 m where the modis scale b3 b3l8 500m and b6 b6l8 500m are initially calculated by averaging the toa reflectance of the 30 m landsat b3l8 30m and b6l8 30m pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel respectively for ndsil8m four types of model model lam model lbm model lamu and model lbmu are constructed by replacing ndsimod with ndsil8m in models ma mb mau and mbu similarly the other four types of model model lai model lbi model laiu and model lbiu are constructed with ndsil8i as the input a comparison of the ndsil8m based and ndsil8i based models illustrates the effects of the different methods of ndsi calculation on the upscaling 3 1 3 evaluation of the accuracy of fsc estimation previous studies have shown that the unbalanced distribution of samples e g the huge number of 0 fsc pixels may inflate the evaluated accuracy zhang et al 2019b two validation conditions are thus considered in this study 1 the all snow condition in which all the samples covering the entire range of fsc between 0 and 1 are used for validation 2 the patchy snow condition in which only fsc samples between 0 1 and 0 95 are used for validation to evaluate the accuracy of the fsc estimates both rmsd and r are calculated by comparing the estimated and true fsc values in accordance with previous fsc estimates salomonson and appel 2004 shreve et al 2009 rmsd is selected as the primary evaluation metric for the deterministic comparison of the different models the model with the highest accuracy out of models ma mb mau mbu and mr is selected as the best linear regression model for estimating fsc based on modis ndsi the same comparison is conducted for the models based on upscaled landsat ndsi i e models la lb laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu 3 1 4 analysis of scaling effects on fsc estimation ndsil8m and ndsil8i cannot be directly compared with ndsimod because they involve different band locations and sensors but their performances in estimating fsc are comparable because they both make the same assumption of a strong linear relationship between fsc and ndsi the spectral radiance is generally linear when aggregated from relatively high 30 m to relatively low e g 1 km resolutions liang 2000 and ndsi is calculated using simple band mathematics therefore we can assume that if the scaling effects on the fsc estimation using modis ndsi are small the models using ndsimod should have a similar accuracy to those using ndsil8i or ndsil8m although as discussed below the upscaling processes for constructing ndsil8m or ndsil8i may also be affected to some degree by pixel heterogeneity in mountainous areas land surface radiance is dependent on topography and land cover meyer et al 1993 and so three factors aspect slope and ndvi have been selected to describe the varying topography and land cover conditions czyzowska wisniewski et al 2015 hou et al 2020 liang et al 2017 if there is a significant difference in accuracy between the models based on ndsimod and those based on ndsil8i or ndsil8m there may be strong scaling effects present such scale influence can be analyzed by investigating how the accuracy of the ndsimod based models and its differences compared to models using ndsil8i or ndsil8m are affected by these three factors the analysis of variance anova is a common technique used for calculating the contributions of different factors zhang et al 2019a and is used here to quantify the effects of the three scaling factors since aspect generally has eight classifications slopes and ndvi have also been classified into eight groups according to their respective histogram distributions the eight slope groups are 0 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 10 10 12 12 14 and 14 degrees the eight ndvi groups are 0 0 0 015 0 015 0 03 0 03 0 045 0 045 0 06 0 06 0 075 0 075 0 09 and 0 09 thus the samples are divided into a total of 512 8 8 8 groups representing different aspect slope and ndvi conditions for each group the r between the estimated and true fsc is calculated the variance of the estimation accuracy i e r can thus be partitioned into different components related to different factors the interactions between different factors are also considered in anova the contributions of individual factors or their interaction terms are calculated based on their sum of squares it should be noted that the use of r rather than rmsd as the accuracy measurement for anova is mainly because rmsd is very susceptible to the magnitude of fsc and as the differences in the fsc of different groups can be very large use of rmsd could lead to unreliable results 3 2 bsc estimation 3 2 1 using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi for bsc estimation modis binary snow cover data were previously produced using the ndsi threshold of 0 4 all the 500 m true fsc pixels are reclassified as either snow fsc 50 or non snow fsc 50 pixels previous studies have shown that 0 4 may not be the optimal ndsi threshold for many areas including the tp zhang et al 2020 2019b two types of ndsi threshold are considered here 1 a locally optimal ndsi threshold for which a sensitivity test of different ndsi thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 on bsc estimation accuracy is implemented to find an optimal ndsi threshold for each training scene following zhang et al 2019b 2 a region wide optimal ndsi threshold for which a similar sensitivity test but based on samples from all 201 training scenes is conducted with the ndsi threshold that achieves the highest average accuracy selected both types of ndsi threshold are calculated for ndsimod ndsil8i and ndsil8m respectively 3 2 2 evaluation of bsc estimation accuracy to evaluate bsc estimation accuracy firstly a confusion matrix is defined 1 true fsc 0 5 and satellite predicts snow covered i e ndsi ndsi threshold defined as tp true positive 2 true fsc 0 5 while satellite predicts snow free i e ndsi ndsi threshold defined as fn false negative 3 true fsc 0 5 while satellite predicts snow covered defined as fp false positive 4 true fsc 0 5 and satellite predicts snow free defined as tn true negative four types of evaluation metrics consisting of probability of detection pod precision pc f score fs and cohen s kappa ck are then calculated using equations 5 8 respectively 5 pod tp tp f n 6 pc tp tp f p 7 fs 2 p o d p c pod p c 8 ck ga p r e 1 p r e where ga and pr e are calculated from equations 9 11 9 pr e tp f p total tp f n total tn f p total tn f n total 10 ga tp t n total 11 total t p f n f p t n ck is selected as the primary evaluation metric in deterministic comparisons such as selecting the optimal ndsi thresholds following zhang et al 2019b fs pod and pc are calculated to enable better understanding of the error sources 3 2 3 analysis of scaling effects on bsc estimation the analysis of scaling effects on bsc estimation is similar to the procedure described in section 3 1 4 firstly the accuracy of the methods using modis ndsi i e ndsimod and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi i e ndsil8i and ndsil8m is compared if for example using ndsimod shows significantly lower accuracy than using ndsil8i or ndsil8m then there could be large scaling effects on the bsc estimates based on ndsimod the effects of the three scaling factors aspect slope and ndvi are then analyzed as follows the same 512 sample groups of different aspect slope and ndvi conditions as used for fsc estimation are used for each group the estimation accuracy ck is calculated based on the estimated and true bsc the effects of different scaling factors are further quantified based on anova of the estimation accuracy using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi or their accuracy differences 4 results and discussion 4 1 the performance of fsc estimation models based on modis ndsi for all the 201 training scenes the rmsd of model ma is always smaller than that of model mr as shown in fig 4 a the average rmsds of the model ma is 0 18 compared to 0 24 for model mr this result confirms that a local empirical relationship can be more suitable for a specific region than the global reference equation however an individual scene based model which has relatively good accuracy with the training data may not be suitable for the whole tp therefore the best performing of the 201 ma models referred to as model mat is determined by comparing their validation accuracy in conditions of both all snow and patchy snow similarly the best model mb is also selected and referred to as model mbt although model mb was expected to be better than ma both models ma and mat show generally better performance than models mb and mbt in the training and validation scenes respectively fig 4 models mat and mr show almost equal accuracy in the validation under all snow condition however the validation accuracy of mat is clearly better than that of mr under patchy snow conditions although models mau and mbu both consider all the training samples possibly making them more universal salomonson and appel 2004 their validation accuracy is significantly lower than mat under either all snow or patchy snow conditions fig 4b thus model mat is considered to be the best out of all the fsc estimation models based on ndsimod used here the validation accuracy of mat under all snow conditions is relatively good with an rmsd as low as 0 09 even lower than the values of 0 1 reported by salomonson and appel 2006 and salomonson and appel 2004 however this high validation accuracy may be mainly because of the very unbalanced distribution of validation data with snow free pixels i e fsc 0 accounting for 73 of the data mat shows much lower accuracy rmsd 0 22 under patchy snow conditions this finding may also explain why some local studies found modis fractional snow cover data was accurate in the heihe river basin of the northeastern tp with relatively low rmsd values of 0 09 0 11 hou and huang 2014 while others such as hou et al 2020 and tang et al 2013b reported large rmsd values greater than 0 2 as the validation results under patchy snow conditions are clearly more reliable the anova is conducted under these conditions 4 2 scaling effects on fsc estimation the comparison between models based on upscaled landsat 8 ndsi shows that the universal models that use all the training samples i e models laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu have slightly better accuracy than the models which use samples from individual scenes i e models lai lbi lam and lbm although the results are not shown here fig 5 a shows that for all the training landsat 8 scenes the rmsds of models lai mean rmsd 0 1 and lam mean rmsd 0 09 are clearly lower than that of model ma mean rmsd 0 18 the validation results for models laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu also show significantly better accuracy than model mat under both all snow and patchy snow conditions fig 5b the large difference in accuracy between models based on ndsimod and those based on ndsil8i and ndsil8m indicates there may be strong scaling effects on fsc estimation using modis ndsi although ndsil8i and ndsil8m are calculated from ndsil8 30m in two different ways their performances in the fsc estimation are quite similar with little difference in accuracy as shown in fig 5 as ndsil8i is constructed using a method closer to that used for ndsimod the anova is conducted based on results from mat and lbiu the anova test shows that although the single contribution of aspect slope or ndvi to the variances of the accuracy of model mat i e rmat is not very large their combined contributions including the interaction terms can be as large as 61 indicating a dominant scaling effect fig 6 a although it seems that the scale issue also has effects on fsc estimation using ndsil8i the combined effects of aspect slope ndvi and their interactions on the accuracy of model lbiu i e rlbiu are much smaller making a total contribution of 41 thus a comparison of fig 6a and 6b shows that there are enhanced scaling effects on fsc estimation based on ndsimod it is also interesting that ndvi is a major scaling factor of the variance of rlbiu fig 6b whereas aspect and slope are obviously more important factors of the variance of rmat thus the enhanced scaling effects on modis ndsi may be mainly caused by the complex topography rather than land cover heterogeneity the large difference in fsc estimations between ndsimod and ndsil8i also indicates that upscaling landsat 8 ndsi to 500 m cannot mimic the true modis ndsi well the linear aggregation process of landsat 8 ndsi may not be able to reflect the complex effects of terrains on the possibly non linearly scaling behavior of ndsi and the linear relationship between ndsi and fsc may be degraded for modis due to such scaling effects for example the illumination conditions within a moids pixel may be greatly affected by aspect and slope which could further influence the spectral radiance crawford et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 we further conduct an anova of the accuracy difference between the two models i e rlbiu minus rmat as mentioned before rlbiu is always better than rmat and the anova result shows that the superiority of rlbiu is strongly controlled by the two terrain factors of aspect and slope fig 6c this result further demonstrates that complex terrain is the main factor lowering the skill of modis ndsi for snow cover estimation on the tp 4 3 optimal ndsi threshold for binary snow cover fsc 50 estimation using locally optimal ndsi thresholds and the same training samples as those for fsc estimation both ndsil8i mean ck 0 89 and ndsil8m mean ck 0 91 show much higher accuracy than ndsimod mean ck 0 55 fig 7 a the accuracy of bsc estimation is also strongly affected by the unbalanced distribution of samples when all the samples 0 fsc 1 of the 201 training scenes are used the spatially averaged values of ck for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i are greatly increased to 0 88 0 98 and 0 98 respectively fig 7b illustrates the sensitivity tests of the averaged bsc estimation accuracy on a region wide ndsi threshold ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 the maximum accuracy corresponds to ndsi thresholds i e region wide optimal ndsi thresholds of 0 29 0 38 and 0 39 for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i respectively the region wide optimal thresholds are further used in validation and the results shown in fig 7c show that the spatially averaged values of ck for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i are 0 49 0 90 and 0 88 under patchy snow conditions and they are greatly increased to 0 85 0 98 0 98 under all snow conditions the spatially averaged values of fs for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i vary similarly with values of 0 63 0 93 and 0 91 respectively under patchy snow conditions and 0 87 0 98 0 98 under all snow conditions the much lower bsc estimation accuracy of ndsimod compared with that of ndsil8i or ndsil8m in both training and validation situations indicates that there are also possibly large scaling effects on the bsc estimates based on modis ndsi similarly to the case for fsc estimation the accuracy of bsc estimation using ndsil8i is very close to that achieved when using ndsil8m the results of ndsimod and ndsil8i are thus used in the anova for bsc estimation the anova of scaling effects is conducted for patchy snow conditions because of the negative effects of the unbalanced samples distribution under all snow conditions the results are highly consistent with those of the fsc estimation the total contribution of the three scaling factors aspect slope ndvi and their interaction terms to the variances of bsc estimation accuracy using ndsimod is 61 fig 8 a very close to the values for fsc estimation fig 6a although the effect of slope seems to be larger for bsc estimation the scaling effects on ndsil8i based bsc estimation are smaller than those on ndsil8i based fsc estimation with the total contribution of the three scaling factors being only 33 fig 8b aspect and slope are the two major factors of the enhanced scaling effects on bsc estimation using ndsimod with their combined contribution to the variances of the accuracy differences between the two methods i e ckl8i minus ckmod being 50 fig 8c 4 4 implications of the use of the modis ndsi snow cover product for fsc and bsc estimation on the tibetan plateau the unbalanced distribution of samples i e most samples having 0 fsc under all snow conditions means that the accuracy of fsc estimation is overestimated by using a linear regression model based on modis ndsi under patchy snow conditions i e 0 1 fsc 0 95 the accuracy is much lower even using local regression models the averaged rmsd across the 201 training scenes is still as high as 0 18 it should be noted that model mr which was used in the previous version of the modis snow cover product shows even lower accuracy under patchy snow conditions with an averaged rmsd of 0 24 our study proposes a new regression model i e model mat based on ndsimod selected from the candidate models derived from 201 landsat 8 scenes however the accuracy improvement when using this new model is very limited with the validation rmsd still as high as 0 22 in contrast the models using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi perform much better with an averaged validation rmsd of 0 11 0 12 thus the ability of modis ndsi to estimate fsc seems to be weakened and there could be larger uncertainties than expected when using fsc values estimated from modis ndsi on the tp the anova results indicate that more importance should be attached to terrain factors including aspect and slope in future fsc estimations considering that the linearity between fsc and modis ndsi may be greatly degraded by scaling effects more complicated methods that can incorporate more spectral bands and factors such as modscag modis snow covered area and grain size painter et al 2009 artificial neural networks hou and huang 2014 hou et al 2020 multivariate adaptive regression splines kuter et al 2018 and random forests liu et al 2020 should be used to create more accurate fsc products for the tp for bsc estimation we find that 0 29 could be the optimal ndsi threshold for bsc mapping on the tp using modis ndsi data a value which seems to be in conflict with some previous studies which suggest based on daily snow depth observations a ndsi threshold of 0 1 for use in china including the tp zhang et al 2020 2019b it should be noted that point observations of snow depth may not mean that the corresponding modis pixel has a value of fsc 50 in addition to the obviously different type of data used as observations another important reason for the discrepancy could be that the ndsi threshold of 0 1 may be more accurate for describing whether snow is present within a modis pixel as indicated by riggs et al 2017 rather than whether snow covers more than 50 of the pixel therefore we further tested more fsc situations of snow detection with the lower limit for the fsc of a snow covered pixel varying from 0 1 to 0 5 for each fsc situation the optimal ndsi threshold is selected as the one with the highest averaged ck to ensure that the results of these tests are comparable with previous studies all snow conditions are used the results shown in fig 9 show that the optimal ndsi threshold decreases from 0 29 to 0 1 as the lower limit of fsc decreases from 50 to 5 it is interesting to note that the bsc estimation accuracy also decreases as the lower limit of fsc decreases this result indicates that modis ndsi snow cover data are more accurate for detecting snow pixels with fsc 50 possibly because larger scaling effects may exist in pixels with relatively low fsc such enhanced scaling effects mainly caused by terrain factors are also observed when estimating bsc using modis ndsi under fragmented or patchy snow conditions both omission and commission errors of bsc detection using modis ndsi are large with the averaged pod and pc as low as 0 65 and 0 68 respectively resulting in relatively low values of ck 0 49 and fs 0 63 thus special attention is required when extracting the boundaries of snow covered areas such as the snow line or glacier extent based on modis snow cover data and more advanced methods that can better consider scaling factors should be developed for bsc estimation on the tp in addition previous studies which use 0 4 as the ndsi threshold for snow mapping may benefit from our finding about the new optimal ndsi threshold of 0 29 considering that under patchy snow conditions the accuracy of using 0 29 as the ndsi threshold mean ck 0 49 is clearly better than that of using 0 4 mean ck 0 40 when the pod as low as 0 46 indicates a lot of snow omission errors it should also be noted that one can easily calculate the new fsc and bsc data according to the new regression equation and new threshold using the original modis ndsi data this may be one reason why modis now only provides ndsi data riggs et al 2017 4 5 uncertainties and limitations the true fsc data are derived from landsat 8 oli scenes following the snomap algorithm hall et al 1995 that uses 0 4 as the ndsi threshold however härer et al 2018 found that in some cases a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 4 could result in relative errors of about 24 in fsc estimation they suggest considering seasonal variation of ndsi thresholds but the camera based calibration method they use will be hard to apply on the tp where regular observation stations are very sparse even though modis terra and landsat 8 have similar overpass times the differences in acquisition time between them could also affect the results because snow depths on the tp are relatively small and snow may melt or sublimate during the time interval zhang et al 2020 to solve this problem hou et al 2020 suggests using image pairs with the same acquisition time for training the fsc estimation model it is assumed that in a reliable pair of landsat modis scenes there should be a high degree of consistency between ndsil8i 500m and ndsimod we thus implemented relatively strict criteria for increasing the reliability of the reference scenes the only scenes selected for training or validation in this study are those with a correlation coefficient between ndsil8i 500m and ndsimod 0 7 due to the very unbalanced composition of land cover types fig 2 the land cover effects considered in anova are based on ndvi rather than land cover types it should be noted that ndvi may be more accurate in representing the effects of vegetation rather than those of land cover types this problem could be partially solved by collecting more samples from different land cover types in future the results of anova show that ndvi has limited effects on the accuracy of fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi however as shown in fig 10 there are truly significant accuracy differences between different land cover groups for both fsc and bsc estimation the accuracy for forest and savanna is significantly lower than for barren land and grassland it should be noted that forest and savanna account for only about 5 and 4 of the area of the whole plateau respectively and the samples we used generally have a composition of major land cover types which is consistent with the tp as a whole fig 2b it should also be noted that according to sulla menashe and friedl 2018 the pixels labeled here as savanna as determined from the modis land cover data are more likely to be sparse forest or unidentified grasslands as savanna is usually only found in tropical regions the relatively weak effects of ndvi are thus attributed to the much smaller portion of densely vegetated areas though a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 29 is recommended as the optimal one in the present study the optimal ndsi threshold may in fact vary with slope and aspect all the samples are thus divided into 64 8 8 groups by considering the eight slope conditions and eight types of aspect for each group a sensitivity test of different ndsi thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 on bsc estimation accuracy which is the same as that in section 3 2 1 is conducted to determine an optimal ndsi threshold in total 64 slope aspect specific optimal ndsi thresholds are obtained as shown in fig 10c ndvi is not considered here mainly because the anova tests show that ndvi is not a key factor for bsc estimation on the tp it is clear that the optimal ndsi threshold generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from southeast to northwest steeper slopes tend to produce larger commission errors of snow detection thus for pixels with a steep slope the ndsi threshold tends to be high for reducing the snow commission errors in general we also find fewer snow omission errors for the more southeastward aspects than for the more northwestward aspects possibly due to differences in illumination conditions thus a relatively low ndsi threshold is required to reduce the omission errors in the aspects that are more northwestward there are some limitations in this study first due to the high proportion of cloud cover there are no training or validation landsat 8 scenes in the southeastern part of the tp although the scenes used covered most parts of the tp fig 1 camera based snow cover maps härer et al 2018 or images from unmanned aerial vehicles liang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 are possible solutions for relieving this problem in future studies second the effects of forest canopy may not be sufficiently considered many studies have found that modis snow cover data may largely underestimate fsc for heavily forested areas klein et al 1998 liu et al 2020 masson et al 2018 rittger et al 2013 wang et al 2018 such a problem can be alleviated by spectral mixture analysis rittger et al 2013 considering view angle effects xin et al 2012 the multi index technique wang et al 2018 or by incorporating more bands and factors using machine learning liu et al 2020 third in some cases it can be difficult to distinguish cloud from snow when only using landsat 8 bands because of their similar multispectral signatures stillinger et al 2019 even if almost all the cloud and cloud shadow pixels have been removed there could still be errors existing in the landsat 8 cloud mask that can be corrected in the future in addition elevation is not included as an individual factor in anova but we find that elevation has relatively small effects on the accuracy of both fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi compared with aspect and slope because tp elevations are clustered in the range 3500 5500 m according to the histogram of distribution of elevations eight elevation groups can be defined as 4000 4000 4200 4200 4400 4400 4600 4600 4800 4800 5000 5000 5200 and 5200 m the correlation coefficients absolute value between the accuracy of the eight elevation groups and their group average elevations are 0 24 and 0 49 for fsc and bsc estimations respectively and both are insignificant in contrast the correlation coefficients between the accuracy of the eight slope groups and their group average slopes are 0 75 for both fsc and bsc estimates 5 conclusions this study investigates the ability of the recently released modis ndsi snow cover data to estimate fsc and bsc on the tibetan plateau by utilizing 353 landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2015 the images cover most parts of the plateau where snow cover plays an important role in both regional climate change and water security we conduct a more detailed analysis of the important scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi on the tp than any previous studies by using a much larger number of reference scenes and by including a comparison with upscaled landsat 8 ndsi from 30 m to 500 m the fsc ndsi empirical relationship and the ndsi threshold are re established for tibetan plateau fsc and bsc estimates respectively based on the modis ndsi snow cover product v6 a new regression equation between fsc and modis ndsi i e model mat is established from 201 training landsat 8 scenes and shows better accuracy in estimating fsc for the tibetan plateau than the previously used global reference equation i e model mr a region wide optimal ndsi threshold for bsc estimation on the tibetan plateau of 0 29 is found and this has better accuracy than the global reference ndsi threshold of 0 4 we find that there are enhanced scaling effects on both fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi as the accuracy of methods using modis ndsi are much lower than those using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi in both fsc and bsc estimates the anova results considering 512 different aspect slope and ndvi combinations show that terrain factors aspect and slope cause the enhanced scaling effects although the accuracy over forest and savanna is clearly lower than that over barren land and grassland in both fsc and bsc estimates aspect and slope are found to be the major scaling factors for the tibetan plateau where 87 of the total area is barren or grassland our study shows that the ability to estimate fsc and bsc from modis ndsi data is significantly weakened by the complex topography of the tibetan plateau and thus highlights the importance of developing more advanced models that can incorporate additional factors including at least aspect and slope in future studies given the limited improvement in the estimation accuracy of the newly established fsc relationship there is a particular requirement for a more efficient method for future fsc estimates in practical research related to hydrology or climate we also describe a framework for analyzing scaling effects on modis based fsc or bsc estimates which involves upscaling landsat 8 ndsi data for comparison and the use of anova to consider different topography and land cover conditions which is not limited to the tibetan plateau and may potentially be useful in other mountainous regions 6 data availability all the data used are publicly available the modis ndsi snow cover data can be

4992,modis fractional fsc and binary bsc snow cover data are important for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal snow cover information for the tibetan plateau tp where rapid warming is closely related to snow cover changes however fsc and bsc data are no longer provided in the newly released version v6 of the modis snow cover product having been replaced with normalized difference snow index ndsi data recent studies have observed clearly lower accuracy of modis snow cover data on the tp than in other areas possibly implying that there are strong scaling effects due to the complex terrain and land cover which are not well understood a total of 353 landsat 8 scenes covering most parts of the tp are used to establish a new empirical relationship between fsc and modis ndsi for fsc estimation and a new ndsi threshold for bsc estimation the results indicate that the new regression model mean root mean squared deviation rmsd 0 22 has a better fsc estimation accuracy than the previously used global reference equation mean rmsd 0 24 and that the new ndsi threshold of 0 29 mean cohen s kappa ck 0 49 outperforms the global reference ndsi threshold of 0 4 mean ck 0 40 in bsc estimation the relatively low accuracy could be due to an enhanced scaling effect the 30 m landsat 8 ndsi data are upscaled to 500 m modis to analyze the scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi we find that the methods using modis ndsi have much lower estimation accuracy for both fsc and bsc compared with those using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi an analysis of variance anova test which considers 512 combinations of aspect slope and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi further demonstrates that the enhanced scaling effects are mainly caused by terrain factors i e aspect and slope the optimal ndsi threshold for estimating bsc generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from the southeast to northwest this study has important implications for the optimal use of modis ndsi snow cover data on the tp and highlights the importance of developing more advanced methods which take more factors into account keywords scaling effects modis fractional

is a key component of the cryosphere and has important effects on climate and water resources snow cover with its high albedo is closely linked to regional climate change via the snow albedo feedback mechanism ma et al 2020 thackeray et al 2019 in addition in high elevation areas such as the himalayas seasonal snow melt is an important source of water armstrong et al 2019 therefore accurate snow cover information is crucial for research on the tibetan plateau tp where snow cover changes play a key role in the elevation dependent warming pepin et al 2019 you et al 2019 and where snow melt makes relatively large contributions 20 to total runoff in the headwater catchments of several major asian rivers zhang et al 2013b in mountainous areas remote sensing is often the most efficient way to carry out large scale snow mapping due to the sparse coverage of ground based observations zhang and ma 2018 this is especially the case for the tp which has an average elevation greater than 4000 m a s l and no regular weather stations above 5000 m as snow has a relatively high reflectance in the visible wavelengths and a relatively low reflectance in the shortwave infrared band the normalized difference snow index ndsi is commonly used for snow detection for a wide range of sensors including modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer landsat tm thematic mapper etm enhanced thematic mapper plus oli operational land imager and sentinel 2 msi multispectral instrument crawford 2015 gascoin et al 2019 hall et al 1995 salomonson and appel 2004 yin et al 2013 out of these products the modis daily snow cover with its relatively high temporal frequency twice a day is probably the most popular although it does have a somewhat coarse spatial resolution of 500 m many studies have used modis fractional or binary snow cover data for the tp for a variety of applications such as analyzing the changes in snow cover area pu et al 2007 zhang et al 2013a snow line choubin et al 2019 tang et al 2014 snow covered days tang et al 2013a zhang et al 2012 and snow cover phenology wang et al 2017 and for providing important snow cover information for driving calibrating or verifying hydrological models immerzeel et al 2009 shrestha et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 in addition most of the composite snow cover products use modis snow cover data as an important input chen et al 2018 huang et al 2017 yu et al 2016 however the modis fractional and binary snow cover data are no longer provided in the newest version v6 of the modis snow cover product riggs et al 2016b a good linear relationship between ndsi and snow cover fraction was the theoretical basis of modis fractional snow cover fsc data riggs et al 2006 the original regression equation was developed from 14 landsat scenes and subsequently implemented as a global reference equation for producing modis terra fsc data around the world with the validation root mean squared deviation rmsd and correlation coefficient r reported to be about 0 1 and 0 9 respectively salomonson and appel 2006 the modis binary i e snow or non snow snow cover data bsc uses the assumption that when the ndsi threshold 0 4 at least 50 of the pixel is covered by snow crawford 2015 however increasingly evidence suggests that either the globally applied equation or the spatially fixed ndsi threshold might not be optimal for local applications with variations in landscape and satellite viewing conditions härer et al 2018 mishra et al 2009 riggs et al 2017 thus both fsc and bsc have now been replaced by ndsi snow cover data containing only ndsi values for each pixel these data are expected to be suitable for a wider range of applications this change poses important questions about what regression equation between fsc and modis ndsi should be applied and which ndsi threshold should be used when using the new modis snow cover product on the tp some recent studies based on daily snow depth observations zhang et al 2020 2019b suggest that 0 1 is the optimal ndsi threshold for bsc estimation in china including the tp however their sparse snow depth observations may not represent actual fsc the value of fsc which corresponds to an ndsi threshold of 0 1 also remains unclear the scale issue is an important factor affecting the estimation accuracy of remotely sensed variables mccabe and wood 2006 land surface heterogeneity including different topography and land cover conditions has been demonstrated to greatly impact the prediction of various environmental parameters such as leaf area index garrigues et al 2006 liang 2000 surface energy flux kustas et al 2004 and evapotranspiration long et al 2011 sharma et al 2016 in these studies the aggregation of higher resolution satellite images e g 30 m landsat missions to larger pixel sizes such as 500 m and 1 km is a common way to mimic lower resolution sensors recent studies have also found that while the accuracy of modis snow cover data is generally good for stations outside the tp it is much worse for those within the tp zhang et al 2019b thus there could be strong scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates for the tp however to date few studies have investigated the scaling effects on fsc or bsc estimation using ndsi härer et al 2018 calibrate the ndsi threshold for a range of spatial resolutions from 30 m to 990 m using a camera based snow cover map but they do not test for modis snow cover data the effects of elevation or land cover types on the accuracy of modis snow cover data have been analyzed arsenault et al 2014 huang et al 2011 rittger et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b but the scale influence on fsc or bsc estimation from modis ndsi is poorly understood especially for the tp moderate resolution landsat images have been used for validating modis fractional snow cover data or developing new local relationships czyzowska wisniewski et al 2015 dobreva and klein 2011 hou et al 2020 kuter et al 2018 wang et al 2018 for example rittger et al 2013 assessed modis snow cover data based on 172 landsat images but only 25 of these were of the tp and these were clustered in the nepal himalayas the limited number and spatial coverage of reference images restricts our knowledge about snow mapping accuracy using modis ndsi and the factors influencing it obviously more reference scenes should be used to increase the spatial representativeness and to establish a more reliable ndsi threshold for bsc estimation and a more reliable fsc relationship for fsc estimation here our objectives are 1 re evaluate the ability of the global linear regression equation to estimate fsc from modis ndsi and establish a new more accurate equation for the tp 2 determine the optimal ndsi thresholds for detecting snow pixels with fsc 50 for the tp 3 investigate scaling effects on the accuracy of both modis bsc and fsc estimation for the first time as many as 353 landsat oli scenes from across the tp are used to examine fsc and bsc estimates based on modis ndsi to the best of our knowledge this is also the first study to investigate scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimates from modis ndsi by making a comparison with upscaled landsat 8 ndsi data the paper is organized as follows the data used including modis ndsi snow cover data landsat 8 oli reference data and other auxiliary data are described in section 2 the methods used for fsc and bsc estimation based on modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi and scale influence are presented in section 3 results concerning the accuracy of the new regression model and also new optimal ndsi thresholds for fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi are presented in section 4 along with a discussion of the influence of scaling factors uncertainties and limitations 2 data 2 1 modis ndsi snow cover data we use the modis terra snow cover daily l3 global 500 m sin grid version 6 data sets because terra and landsat 8 have similar overpass times the data used are for the period 2013 2015 the modis ndsi data contains two layers ndsi snow cover and raw ndsi modis ndsi ndsimod is calculated following equation 1 1 ndsi mod m 4 m 6 m 4 m 6 where m4 is the modis visible light band 4 wavelength 0 545 0 565 μm and m6 is the shortwave infrared band 6 1 628 1 652 μm ndsi snow cover only contains ndsi values in the range 0 1 1 since values less than 0 1 are converted to 0 indicating non snow the raw ndsi data layer includes the entire range of ndsi values including negative values since the original empirical equation used in previous modis snow products was developed based on the entire range of ndsi salomonson and appel 2004 2006 the raw ndsi values are used here it should be noted that to reduce uncertainties we have excluded all ndsi pixels that did not pass the screening tests of the product due to low visible reflectance high surface temperature high shortwave infrared reflectance or low illumination conditions riggs et al 2016a 2 2 landsat 8 oli reference data landsat 8 oli data are used as the fsc truth following kuter et al 2018 and hou et al 2020 these data have a relatively high spatial resolution of about 30 m but also a relatively long revisit time of about 16 days initially all the available landsat 8 level 1 t scenes with cloud cover 10 during 2013 2015 were downloaded from the usgs earth resources observation and science eros center science processing architecture espa these are provided as top of atmosphere toa reflectance through the online service of espa they are then classified as snow or non snow pixels based on the snomap algorithm hall et al 1995 the ndsi for each 30 m landsat 8 pixel ndsil8 30m is initially calculated according to equation 2 2 n d s i l 8 30 m b 3 l 8 30 m b 6 l 8 30 m b 3 l 8 30 m b 6 l 8 30 m where b3l8 30m is landsat 8 oli band 3 green wavelength 0 525 0 600 μm and b6l8 30m is band 6 shortwave near infrared wavelength 1 560 1 660 μm it should be noted that the subscript 30m is used to distinguish the band or ndsi at the original resolution of 30 m from that at the upscaled resolution of 500 m the pixels with ndsi 0 4 band 3 0 1 and band 5 0 11 are classified as 30 m snow pixels the fsc truth is calculated for each 500 m modis ndsi pixel by counting the number of 30 m snow pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel the method used in the development of the modis fsc algorithm salomonson and appel 2004 2006 due to the difficulty inherent in distinguishing snow from clouds in landsat 8 oli data stillinger et al 2019 all the cloudy 500 m pixels those with 5 of the 30 m pixels flagged as cloud or cloud shadow are eliminated to reduce potential errors in total 353 scenes were selected 201 scenes from 2013 to 2014 used for training the empirical relationship and 152 scenes from 2015 used for validation fig 1 2 3 auxiliary data the land cover type data were obtained from the modis land cover product mcd12q1 collection 6 we use the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification schemes the spatial distribution of the major land cover types of the tp is shown in fig 2 at the pixel scale the spectral characteristics of snow may be weakened due to being mixed with the characteristics of other land cover types in particular the dense canopy of forests may obstruct snow signals and errors in fsc estimation have been found to be significantly correlated with vegetation fraction rittger et al 2013 since the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is closely related to vegetation fraction baret et al 1995 ndvi is also derived from the landsat 8 oli data to evaluate the effects of land cover types for each 30 m landsat 8 pixel ndvi is initially calculated from equation 3 3 n d v i l 8 30 m b 5 l 8 30 m b 4 l 8 30 m b 5 l 8 30 m b 4 l 8 30 m where b5l8 30m is landsat 8 oli band 5 near infrared and b4l8 30m is the band 4 red the ndvi at modis scale is then calculated by averaging all the ndvil8 30m pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel elevation information is obtained from version 3 of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem data which has a similar spatial resolution 30 m to landsat 8 oli the elevation at the modis scale is then calculated by aggregating the original 30 m dem pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel finally slope and aspect are calculated based on the aggregated elevation data at the modis scale 3 methodology fig 3 presents an overview of the input data the processes for using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi for establishing different fsc and bsc estimation methods and how the scale influence analysis is conducted firstly a total of 353 landsat 8 scenes with 30 m resolution are processed to 500 m fsc pixels and subsequently used as truth for training and validating the bsc and fsc estimates derived from modis ndsi the landsat 8 images are also converted to 500 m ndsi pixels for constructing the landsat 8 based bsc and fsc schemes which are then compared with the modis based schemes for analyzing the scaling effects the following sections describe these processes in detail 3 1 fsc estimation 3 1 1 using modis ndsi for fsc estimation constructing a linear regression between the 500 m ndsimod and the fsc derived from 30 m landsat pixels within the corresponding modis pixel is a popular way to estimate fsc which was also used for the modis snow cover product version 5 riggs et al 2006 according to salomonson and appel 2006 only modis pixels with a true fsc in the range of 10 95 are considered for building the regression relationship to reduce the negative effects of multiple samples clustering at very low or very high fsc all the 353 selected landsat 8 scenes have at least 500 corresponding 500 m modis pixels meeting the criteria more detailed information is shown in fig 1 according to salomonson and appel 2004 there are generally two ways of building such an empirical relationship model ma in which ndsimod is taken as the independent variable and fsc as the dependent variable and model mb where fsc is the independent variable and ndsimod is the response it is clear that the equation for mb has to be inverted algebraically to estimate fsc from ndsi but this approach is considered to be better than ma because of the larger variance and errors in ndsi compared to fsc salomonson and appel 2004 2006 for each landsat 8 training scene both models ma and mb are built both models have 201 sets of coefficients derived from the 201 training scenes using samples from all the 201 training scenes two average or universal linear relationships are established called model mau and model mbu the reference linear regression model which was used for producing the global modis fsc developed by salomonson and appel 2006 is also tested here for comparison and named model mr considering the meaningful ranges of ndsi and fsc all estimated fsc 0 or those with ndsi 0 are set to 0 fsc and those with values 1 are set to 100 fsc in total five types of model ma mb mau mbu and mr are built based on ndsimod of these models the one with the highest validation accuracy is considered to be the best model that can be achieved through a linear regression between ndsimod and fsc 3 1 2 upscaling landsat 8 ndsi to modis scale for fsc estimation to further explore the effects of scaling on the accuracy of the linear regression models based on ndsi two types of upscaled landsat 8 ndsi are constructed ndsil8m a mean ndsi calculated for each modis pixel by aggregating all the corresponding landsat 8 ndsi i e ndsil8 30m values and ndsil8i an ndsi calculation made using equation 4 4 n d s i l 8 i b 3 l 8 500 m b 6 l 8 500 m b 3 l 8 500 m b 6 l 8 500 m where the modis scale b3 b3l8 500m and b6 b6l8 500m are initially calculated by averaging the toa reflectance of the 30 m landsat b3l8 30m and b6l8 30m pixels contained in the corresponding modis pixel respectively for ndsil8m four types of model model lam model lbm model lamu and model lbmu are constructed by replacing ndsimod with ndsil8m in models ma mb mau and mbu similarly the other four types of model model lai model lbi model laiu and model lbiu are constructed with ndsil8i as the input a comparison of the ndsil8m based and ndsil8i based models illustrates the effects of the different methods of ndsi calculation on the upscaling 3 1 3 evaluation of the accuracy of fsc estimation previous studies have shown that the unbalanced distribution of samples e g the huge number of 0 fsc pixels may inflate the evaluated accuracy zhang et al 2019b two validation conditions are thus considered in this study 1 the all snow condition in which all the samples covering the entire range of fsc between 0 and 1 are used for validation 2 the patchy snow condition in which only fsc samples between 0 1 and 0 95 are used for validation to evaluate the accuracy of the fsc estimates both rmsd and r are calculated by comparing the estimated and true fsc values in accordance with previous fsc estimates salomonson and appel 2004 shreve et al 2009 rmsd is selected as the primary evaluation metric for the deterministic comparison of the different models the model with the highest accuracy out of models ma mb mau mbu and mr is selected as the best linear regression model for estimating fsc based on modis ndsi the same comparison is conducted for the models based on upscaled landsat ndsi i e models la lb laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu 3 1 4 analysis of scaling effects on fsc estimation ndsil8m and ndsil8i cannot be directly compared with ndsimod because they involve different band locations and sensors but their performances in estimating fsc are comparable because they both make the same assumption of a strong linear relationship between fsc and ndsi the spectral radiance is generally linear when aggregated from relatively high 30 m to relatively low e g 1 km resolutions liang 2000 and ndsi is calculated using simple band mathematics therefore we can assume that if the scaling effects on the fsc estimation using modis ndsi are small the models using ndsimod should have a similar accuracy to those using ndsil8i or ndsil8m although as discussed below the upscaling processes for constructing ndsil8m or ndsil8i may also be affected to some degree by pixel heterogeneity in mountainous areas land surface radiance is dependent on topography and land cover meyer et al 1993 and so three factors aspect slope and ndvi have been selected to describe the varying topography and land cover conditions czyzowska wisniewski et al 2015 hou et al 2020 liang et al 2017 if there is a significant difference in accuracy between the models based on ndsimod and those based on ndsil8i or ndsil8m there may be strong scaling effects present such scale influence can be analyzed by investigating how the accuracy of the ndsimod based models and its differences compared to models using ndsil8i or ndsil8m are affected by these three factors the analysis of variance anova is a common technique used for calculating the contributions of different factors zhang et al 2019a and is used here to quantify the effects of the three scaling factors since aspect generally has eight classifications slopes and ndvi have also been classified into eight groups according to their respective histogram distributions the eight slope groups are 0 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 10 10 12 12 14 and 14 degrees the eight ndvi groups are 0 0 0 015 0 015 0 03 0 03 0 045 0 045 0 06 0 06 0 075 0 075 0 09 and 0 09 thus the samples are divided into a total of 512 8 8 8 groups representing different aspect slope and ndvi conditions for each group the r between the estimated and true fsc is calculated the variance of the estimation accuracy i e r can thus be partitioned into different components related to different factors the interactions between different factors are also considered in anova the contributions of individual factors or their interaction terms are calculated based on their sum of squares it should be noted that the use of r rather than rmsd as the accuracy measurement for anova is mainly because rmsd is very susceptible to the magnitude of fsc and as the differences in the fsc of different groups can be very large use of rmsd could lead to unreliable results 3 2 bsc estimation 3 2 1 using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi for bsc estimation modis binary snow cover data were previously produced using the ndsi threshold of 0 4 all the 500 m true fsc pixels are reclassified as either snow fsc 50 or non snow fsc 50 pixels previous studies have shown that 0 4 may not be the optimal ndsi threshold for many areas including the tp zhang et al 2020 2019b two types of ndsi threshold are considered here 1 a locally optimal ndsi threshold for which a sensitivity test of different ndsi thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 on bsc estimation accuracy is implemented to find an optimal ndsi threshold for each training scene following zhang et al 2019b 2 a region wide optimal ndsi threshold for which a similar sensitivity test but based on samples from all 201 training scenes is conducted with the ndsi threshold that achieves the highest average accuracy selected both types of ndsi threshold are calculated for ndsimod ndsil8i and ndsil8m respectively 3 2 2 evaluation of bsc estimation accuracy to evaluate bsc estimation accuracy firstly a confusion matrix is defined 1 true fsc 0 5 and satellite predicts snow covered i e ndsi ndsi threshold defined as tp true positive 2 true fsc 0 5 while satellite predicts snow free i e ndsi ndsi threshold defined as fn false negative 3 true fsc 0 5 while satellite predicts snow covered defined as fp false positive 4 true fsc 0 5 and satellite predicts snow free defined as tn true negative four types of evaluation metrics consisting of probability of detection pod precision pc f score fs and cohen s kappa ck are then calculated using equations 5 8 respectively 5 pod tp tp f n 6 pc tp tp f p 7 fs 2 p o d p c pod p c 8 ck ga p r e 1 p r e where ga and pr e are calculated from equations 9 11 9 pr e tp f p total tp f n total tn f p total tn f n total 10 ga tp t n total 11 total t p f n f p t n ck is selected as the primary evaluation metric in deterministic comparisons such as selecting the optimal ndsi thresholds following zhang et al 2019b fs pod and pc are calculated to enable better understanding of the error sources 3 2 3 analysis of scaling effects on bsc estimation the analysis of scaling effects on bsc estimation is similar to the procedure described in section 3 1 4 firstly the accuracy of the methods using modis ndsi i e ndsimod and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi i e ndsil8i and ndsil8m is compared if for example using ndsimod shows significantly lower accuracy than using ndsil8i or ndsil8m then there could be large scaling effects on the bsc estimates based on ndsimod the effects of the three scaling factors aspect slope and ndvi are then analyzed as follows the same 512 sample groups of different aspect slope and ndvi conditions as used for fsc estimation are used for each group the estimation accuracy ck is calculated based on the estimated and true bsc the effects of different scaling factors are further quantified based on anova of the estimation accuracy using modis ndsi and upscaled landsat 8 ndsi or their accuracy differences 4 results and discussion 4 1 the performance of fsc estimation models based on modis ndsi for all the 201 training scenes the rmsd of model ma is always smaller than that of model mr as shown in fig 4 a the average rmsds of the model ma is 0 18 compared to 0 24 for model mr this result confirms that a local empirical relationship can be more suitable for a specific region than the global reference equation however an individual scene based model which has relatively good accuracy with the training data may not be suitable for the whole tp therefore the best performing of the 201 ma models referred to as model mat is determined by comparing their validation accuracy in conditions of both all snow and patchy snow similarly the best model mb is also selected and referred to as model mbt although model mb was expected to be better than ma both models ma and mat show generally better performance than models mb and mbt in the training and validation scenes respectively fig 4 models mat and mr show almost equal accuracy in the validation under all snow condition however the validation accuracy of mat is clearly better than that of mr under patchy snow conditions although models mau and mbu both consider all the training samples possibly making them more universal salomonson and appel 2004 their validation accuracy is significantly lower than mat under either all snow or patchy snow conditions fig 4b thus model mat is considered to be the best out of all the fsc estimation models based on ndsimod used here the validation accuracy of mat under all snow conditions is relatively good with an rmsd as low as 0 09 even lower than the values of 0 1 reported by salomonson and appel 2006 and salomonson and appel 2004 however this high validation accuracy may be mainly because of the very unbalanced distribution of validation data with snow free pixels i e fsc 0 accounting for 73 of the data mat shows much lower accuracy rmsd 0 22 under patchy snow conditions this finding may also explain why some local studies found modis fractional snow cover data was accurate in the heihe river basin of the northeastern tp with relatively low rmsd values of 0 09 0 11 hou and huang 2014 while others such as hou et al 2020 and tang et al 2013b reported large rmsd values greater than 0 2 as the validation results under patchy snow conditions are clearly more reliable the anova is conducted under these conditions 4 2 scaling effects on fsc estimation the comparison between models based on upscaled landsat 8 ndsi shows that the universal models that use all the training samples i e models laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu have slightly better accuracy than the models which use samples from individual scenes i e models lai lbi lam and lbm although the results are not shown here fig 5 a shows that for all the training landsat 8 scenes the rmsds of models lai mean rmsd 0 1 and lam mean rmsd 0 09 are clearly lower than that of model ma mean rmsd 0 18 the validation results for models laiu lbiu lamu and lbmu also show significantly better accuracy than model mat under both all snow and patchy snow conditions fig 5b the large difference in accuracy between models based on ndsimod and those based on ndsil8i and ndsil8m indicates there may be strong scaling effects on fsc estimation using modis ndsi although ndsil8i and ndsil8m are calculated from ndsil8 30m in two different ways their performances in the fsc estimation are quite similar with little difference in accuracy as shown in fig 5 as ndsil8i is constructed using a method closer to that used for ndsimod the anova is conducted based on results from mat and lbiu the anova test shows that although the single contribution of aspect slope or ndvi to the variances of the accuracy of model mat i e rmat is not very large their combined contributions including the interaction terms can be as large as 61 indicating a dominant scaling effect fig 6 a although it seems that the scale issue also has effects on fsc estimation using ndsil8i the combined effects of aspect slope ndvi and their interactions on the accuracy of model lbiu i e rlbiu are much smaller making a total contribution of 41 thus a comparison of fig 6a and 6b shows that there are enhanced scaling effects on fsc estimation based on ndsimod it is also interesting that ndvi is a major scaling factor of the variance of rlbiu fig 6b whereas aspect and slope are obviously more important factors of the variance of rmat thus the enhanced scaling effects on modis ndsi may be mainly caused by the complex topography rather than land cover heterogeneity the large difference in fsc estimations between ndsimod and ndsil8i also indicates that upscaling landsat 8 ndsi to 500 m cannot mimic the true modis ndsi well the linear aggregation process of landsat 8 ndsi may not be able to reflect the complex effects of terrains on the possibly non linearly scaling behavior of ndsi and the linear relationship between ndsi and fsc may be degraded for modis due to such scaling effects for example the illumination conditions within a moids pixel may be greatly affected by aspect and slope which could further influence the spectral radiance crawford et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 we further conduct an anova of the accuracy difference between the two models i e rlbiu minus rmat as mentioned before rlbiu is always better than rmat and the anova result shows that the superiority of rlbiu is strongly controlled by the two terrain factors of aspect and slope fig 6c this result further demonstrates that complex terrain is the main factor lowering the skill of modis ndsi for snow cover estimation on the tp 4 3 optimal ndsi threshold for binary snow cover fsc 50 estimation using locally optimal ndsi thresholds and the same training samples as those for fsc estimation both ndsil8i mean ck 0 89 and ndsil8m mean ck 0 91 show much higher accuracy than ndsimod mean ck 0 55 fig 7 a the accuracy of bsc estimation is also strongly affected by the unbalanced distribution of samples when all the samples 0 fsc 1 of the 201 training scenes are used the spatially averaged values of ck for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i are greatly increased to 0 88 0 98 and 0 98 respectively fig 7b illustrates the sensitivity tests of the averaged bsc estimation accuracy on a region wide ndsi threshold ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 the maximum accuracy corresponds to ndsi thresholds i e region wide optimal ndsi thresholds of 0 29 0 38 and 0 39 for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i respectively the region wide optimal thresholds are further used in validation and the results shown in fig 7c show that the spatially averaged values of ck for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i are 0 49 0 90 and 0 88 under patchy snow conditions and they are greatly increased to 0 85 0 98 0 98 under all snow conditions the spatially averaged values of fs for ndsimod ndsil8m and ndsil8i vary similarly with values of 0 63 0 93 and 0 91 respectively under patchy snow conditions and 0 87 0 98 0 98 under all snow conditions the much lower bsc estimation accuracy of ndsimod compared with that of ndsil8i or ndsil8m in both training and validation situations indicates that there are also possibly large scaling effects on the bsc estimates based on modis ndsi similarly to the case for fsc estimation the accuracy of bsc estimation using ndsil8i is very close to that achieved when using ndsil8m the results of ndsimod and ndsil8i are thus used in the anova for bsc estimation the anova of scaling effects is conducted for patchy snow conditions because of the negative effects of the unbalanced samples distribution under all snow conditions the results are highly consistent with those of the fsc estimation the total contribution of the three scaling factors aspect slope ndvi and their interaction terms to the variances of bsc estimation accuracy using ndsimod is 61 fig 8 a very close to the values for fsc estimation fig 6a although the effect of slope seems to be larger for bsc estimation the scaling effects on ndsil8i based bsc estimation are smaller than those on ndsil8i based fsc estimation with the total contribution of the three scaling factors being only 33 fig 8b aspect and slope are the two major factors of the enhanced scaling effects on bsc estimation using ndsimod with their combined contribution to the variances of the accuracy differences between the two methods i e ckl8i minus ckmod being 50 fig 8c 4 4 implications of the use of the modis ndsi snow cover product for fsc and bsc estimation on the tibetan plateau the unbalanced distribution of samples i e most samples having 0 fsc under all snow conditions means that the accuracy of fsc estimation is overestimated by using a linear regression model based on modis ndsi under patchy snow conditions i e 0 1 fsc 0 95 the accuracy is much lower even using local regression models the averaged rmsd across the 201 training scenes is still as high as 0 18 it should be noted that model mr which was used in the previous version of the modis snow cover product shows even lower accuracy under patchy snow conditions with an averaged rmsd of 0 24 our study proposes a new regression model i e model mat based on ndsimod selected from the candidate models derived from 201 landsat 8 scenes however the accuracy improvement when using this new model is very limited with the validation rmsd still as high as 0 22 in contrast the models using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi perform much better with an averaged validation rmsd of 0 11 0 12 thus the ability of modis ndsi to estimate fsc seems to be weakened and there could be larger uncertainties than expected when using fsc values estimated from modis ndsi on the tp the anova results indicate that more importance should be attached to terrain factors including aspect and slope in future fsc estimations considering that the linearity between fsc and modis ndsi may be greatly degraded by scaling effects more complicated methods that can incorporate more spectral bands and factors such as modscag modis snow covered area and grain size painter et al 2009 artificial neural networks hou and huang 2014 hou et al 2020 multivariate adaptive regression splines kuter et al 2018 and random forests liu et al 2020 should be used to create more accurate fsc products for the tp for bsc estimation we find that 0 29 could be the optimal ndsi threshold for bsc mapping on the tp using modis ndsi data a value which seems to be in conflict with some previous studies which suggest based on daily snow depth observations a ndsi threshold of 0 1 for use in china including the tp zhang et al 2020 2019b it should be noted that point observations of snow depth may not mean that the corresponding modis pixel has a value of fsc 50 in addition to the obviously different type of data used as observations another important reason for the discrepancy could be that the ndsi threshold of 0 1 may be more accurate for describing whether snow is present within a modis pixel as indicated by riggs et al 2017 rather than whether snow covers more than 50 of the pixel therefore we further tested more fsc situations of snow detection with the lower limit for the fsc of a snow covered pixel varying from 0 1 to 0 5 for each fsc situation the optimal ndsi threshold is selected as the one with the highest averaged ck to ensure that the results of these tests are comparable with previous studies all snow conditions are used the results shown in fig 9 show that the optimal ndsi threshold decreases from 0 29 to 0 1 as the lower limit of fsc decreases from 50 to 5 it is interesting to note that the bsc estimation accuracy also decreases as the lower limit of fsc decreases this result indicates that modis ndsi snow cover data are more accurate for detecting snow pixels with fsc 50 possibly because larger scaling effects may exist in pixels with relatively low fsc such enhanced scaling effects mainly caused by terrain factors are also observed when estimating bsc using modis ndsi under fragmented or patchy snow conditions both omission and commission errors of bsc detection using modis ndsi are large with the averaged pod and pc as low as 0 65 and 0 68 respectively resulting in relatively low values of ck 0 49 and fs 0 63 thus special attention is required when extracting the boundaries of snow covered areas such as the snow line or glacier extent based on modis snow cover data and more advanced methods that can better consider scaling factors should be developed for bsc estimation on the tp in addition previous studies which use 0 4 as the ndsi threshold for snow mapping may benefit from our finding about the new optimal ndsi threshold of 0 29 considering that under patchy snow conditions the accuracy of using 0 29 as the ndsi threshold mean ck 0 49 is clearly better than that of using 0 4 mean ck 0 40 when the pod as low as 0 46 indicates a lot of snow omission errors it should also be noted that one can easily calculate the new fsc and bsc data according to the new regression equation and new threshold using the original modis ndsi data this may be one reason why modis now only provides ndsi data riggs et al 2017 4 5 uncertainties and limitations the true fsc data are derived from landsat 8 oli scenes following the snomap algorithm hall et al 1995 that uses 0 4 as the ndsi threshold however härer et al 2018 found that in some cases a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 4 could result in relative errors of about 24 in fsc estimation they suggest considering seasonal variation of ndsi thresholds but the camera based calibration method they use will be hard to apply on the tp where regular observation stations are very sparse even though modis terra and landsat 8 have similar overpass times the differences in acquisition time between them could also affect the results because snow depths on the tp are relatively small and snow may melt or sublimate during the time interval zhang et al 2020 to solve this problem hou et al 2020 suggests using image pairs with the same acquisition time for training the fsc estimation model it is assumed that in a reliable pair of landsat modis scenes there should be a high degree of consistency between ndsil8i 500m and ndsimod we thus implemented relatively strict criteria for increasing the reliability of the reference scenes the only scenes selected for training or validation in this study are those with a correlation coefficient between ndsil8i 500m and ndsimod 0 7 due to the very unbalanced composition of land cover types fig 2 the land cover effects considered in anova are based on ndvi rather than land cover types it should be noted that ndvi may be more accurate in representing the effects of vegetation rather than those of land cover types this problem could be partially solved by collecting more samples from different land cover types in future the results of anova show that ndvi has limited effects on the accuracy of fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi however as shown in fig 10 there are truly significant accuracy differences between different land cover groups for both fsc and bsc estimation the accuracy for forest and savanna is significantly lower than for barren land and grassland it should be noted that forest and savanna account for only about 5 and 4 of the area of the whole plateau respectively and the samples we used generally have a composition of major land cover types which is consistent with the tp as a whole fig 2b it should also be noted that according to sulla menashe and friedl 2018 the pixels labeled here as savanna as determined from the modis land cover data are more likely to be sparse forest or unidentified grasslands as savanna is usually only found in tropical regions the relatively weak effects of ndvi are thus attributed to the much smaller portion of densely vegetated areas though a fixed ndsi threshold of 0 29 is recommended as the optimal one in the present study the optimal ndsi threshold may in fact vary with slope and aspect all the samples are thus divided into 64 8 8 groups by considering the eight slope conditions and eight types of aspect for each group a sensitivity test of different ndsi thresholds ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 on bsc estimation accuracy which is the same as that in section 3 2 1 is conducted to determine an optimal ndsi threshold in total 64 slope aspect specific optimal ndsi thresholds are obtained as shown in fig 10c ndvi is not considered here mainly because the anova tests show that ndvi is not a key factor for bsc estimation on the tp it is clear that the optimal ndsi threshold generally increases with slope and decreases as the aspect varies from southeast to northwest steeper slopes tend to produce larger commission errors of snow detection thus for pixels with a steep slope the ndsi threshold tends to be high for reducing the snow commission errors in general we also find fewer snow omission errors for the more southeastward aspects than for the more northwestward aspects possibly due to differences in illumination conditions thus a relatively low ndsi threshold is required to reduce the omission errors in the aspects that are more northwestward there are some limitations in this study first due to the high proportion of cloud cover there are no training or validation landsat 8 scenes in the southeastern part of the tp although the scenes used covered most parts of the tp fig 1 camera based snow cover maps härer et al 2018 or images from unmanned aerial vehicles liang et al 2017 liu et al 2020 are possible solutions for relieving this problem in future studies second the effects of forest canopy may not be sufficiently considered many studies have found that modis snow cover data may largely underestimate fsc for heavily forested areas klein et al 1998 liu et al 2020 masson et al 2018 rittger et al 2013 wang et al 2018 such a problem can be alleviated by spectral mixture analysis rittger et al 2013 considering view angle effects xin et al 2012 the multi index technique wang et al 2018 or by incorporating more bands and factors using machine learning liu et al 2020 third in some cases it can be difficult to distinguish cloud from snow when only using landsat 8 bands because of their similar multispectral signatures stillinger et al 2019 even if almost all the cloud and cloud shadow pixels have been removed there could still be errors existing in the landsat 8 cloud mask that can be corrected in the future in addition elevation is not included as an individual factor in anova but we find that elevation has relatively small effects on the accuracy of both fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi compared with aspect and slope because tp elevations are clustered in the range 3500 5500 m according to the histogram of distribution of elevations eight elevation groups can be defined as 4000 4000 4200 4200 4400 4400 4600 4600 4800 4800 5000 5000 5200 and 5200 m the correlation coefficients absolute value between the accuracy of the eight elevation groups and their group average elevations are 0 24 and 0 49 for fsc and bsc estimations respectively and both are insignificant in contrast the correlation coefficients between the accuracy of the eight slope groups and their group average slopes are 0 75 for both fsc and bsc estimates 5 conclusions this study investigates the ability of the recently released modis ndsi snow cover data to estimate fsc and bsc on the tibetan plateau by utilizing 353 landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2015 the images cover most parts of the plateau where snow cover plays an important role in both regional climate change and water security we conduct a more detailed analysis of the important scaling effects on fsc and bsc estimation using modis ndsi on the tp than any previous studies by using a much larger number of reference scenes and by including a comparison with upscaled landsat 8 ndsi from 30 m to 500 m the fsc ndsi empirical relationship and the ndsi threshold are re established for tibetan plateau fsc and bsc estimates respectively based on the modis ndsi snow cover product v6 a new regression equation between fsc and modis ndsi i e model mat is established from 201 training landsat 8 scenes and shows better accuracy in estimating fsc for the tibetan plateau than the previously used global reference equation i e model mr a region wide optimal ndsi threshold for bsc estimation on the tibetan plateau of 0 29 is found and this has better accuracy than the global reference ndsi threshold of 0 4 we find that there are enhanced scaling effects on both fsc and bsc estimates made using modis ndsi as the accuracy of methods using modis ndsi are much lower than those using upscaled landsat 8 ndsi in both fsc and bsc estimates the anova results considering 512 different aspect slope and ndvi combinations show that terrain factors aspect and slope cause the enhanced scaling effects although the accuracy over forest and savanna is clearly lower than that over barren land and grassland in both fsc and bsc estimates aspect and slope are found to be the major scaling factors for the tibetan plateau where 87 of the total area is barren or grassland our study shows that the ability to estimate fsc and bsc from modis ndsi data is significantly weakened by the complex topography of the tibetan plateau and thus highlights the importance of developing more advanced models that can incorporate additional factors including at least aspect and slope in future studies given the limited improvement in the estimation accuracy of the newly established fsc relationship there is a particular requirement for a more efficient method for future fsc estimates in practical research related to hydrology or climate we also describe a framework for analyzing scaling effects on modis based fsc or bsc estimates which involves upscaling landsat 8 ndsi data for comparison and the use of anova to consider different topography and land cover conditions which is not limited to the tibetan plateau and may potentially be useful in other mountainous regions 6 data availability all the data used are publicly available the modis ndsi snow cover data can be

4993,appropriate investigation of soil erosion triggering controlling factors is of great importance for natural resources management usually soil erosion assessment is time consuming and impose high costs to researchers and managers therefore design of experiments methods can be good approaches to achieve the purpose to which adequate attention has not been paid yet this study was aimed to assess two response surface methods of box behnken bbm and face centered central composite fccm as well as a fractional factorial design of experiment taguchi method tm for modeling and optimization of soil loss process at plot scale so far no studyhas been conducted to evaluate and compare the ability of bbm fccm and tm in soil erosion modeling optimization and assessment rainfall simulations were performed in the conditions determined by bbm fccm experimental designs and tm orthogonal arrays and in situ soil loss measurements were performed at small plot scale although results showed that bbm outperformed fccm and tm the anova test indicated verified non significant difference p 0 921 at 0 01 significance level in performances of the modeling procedures it was further shown that tm had an acceptable performance with regard to the very limited number of required measurement tests results further showed that there was a good agreement r 0 97 between the results of tm with just 16 runs and bbm with 56 runs with respective rmses of 8 16 and 5 08 therefore tm can be suggested for soil erosion studies when there are limitations in time and expenses for simulations however if the limitations can be overcome bbm can be suggested as a better design of experiment in soil erosion studies keywords optimization techniques model performance hydrologic modeling soil erosion plots soil loss rainfall simulation 1 introduction soil erosion has become a global concern and is intensified with climate change and progressive impacts of human activities terranova et al 2009 this phenomenon causes several adverse effects on human life such as reduction in the productivity of soil worsening water quality lowering the effective reservoir water levels flooding and habitat destruction oh and jung 2005 accurate predictions calculating the risk and identifying ways to control the soil erosion are very difficult expensive and time consuming because this phenomenon is very complex and affected by a series of complicated factors therefore investigation of methods which can help managers assess and prioritize factors affecting soil erosion is very worthwhile rainfall simulation is an effective approach which has been extensively used for soil erosion and soil loss studies at different scales gan et al 2020 guo et al 2020 mhaske et al 2019 rodrigo comino et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2017 several studies have been conducted to assess the effect of important parameters such as vegetation cover chen et al 2019 descroix et al 2001 nouwakpo et al 2018 slope gradient slope aspect soil texture and rainfall intensity deng et al 2020 ramos et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2017 vahabi and nikkami 2008 on soil erosion using different methodologies based on various experimental designs several studies have also used different quantitative analytical and descriptive methods to analyze the results of their experiments cao et al 2020 han et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 2008 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 small soil erosion plots are very common in soil erosion studies because they can simplify the process and minimize the uncertainties related to spatial scale several researchers have used small plots to assess soil erosion process anache et al 2017 bagarello et al 2018 du et al 2020 gholami et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 nonexistence of a reliable design for determination of adequate replication of experimental runs always exhausted scholars so that the least number of three replications baumgartner 2007 has been often used for conducting studies providing high quality data in soil erosion studies is therefore a very important and at the same time very arduous work therefore choosing an effective design of experiment doe is of great importance in these studies doe can be defined as a systematic approach to determine the relationship between triggering controlling factors and the output of that process in this case the output of the process is soil loss a full factorial design of experiment refers to testing all possible combinations of existing factors usually in this design researchers have to run a huge number of tests in order to provide required data for the next analyses this procedure is regularly difficult to apply in soil erosion studies because it is very time consuming expensive labor intensive and sometime impossible particularly when dealing with high number of factors fractional factorial designs can be good ways to deal with this problem response surface designs rsds are a set of robust design of experiments which can be used in modeling and optimization studies rsds can model the changes in variables that affect a response of interest which is soil loss in this study rsd is a combination of statistical and mathematical methods to analyze data obtained from specifically designed experiments several studies have been conducted using rsds in different fields such as industry varghese et al 2017 chemistry prabu et al 2015 yirsaw et al 2016 materials banerjee and sutradhar 2018 energy yesilyurt et al 2019 etc bbm and fccm are two important rsds these two methods can be used to determine the situations in which simulations should be implemented bbm is a fractional factorial design in which factor combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the process space and at the center fccm can also be used to determine the number of experiments needed for modeling and optimizing the process these methods of experiment design can be used in response surface methodology for optimization and modeling purposes tm is also one of the most important design of experiment methods that can considerably reduce the needed time and computational costs these methods provide the opportunity to achieve the desired results by performing minimum number of simulations to the best of our knowledge no research has been implemented to evaluate and compare the ability of rsds and tm in soil erosion modeling and optimization the main objective of this study is to assess and compare the performance of bbm fccm and tm in modeling and optimization of factors affecting soil erosion at plot scale the findings of this study may assist experts and decision makers to efficiently use experimental designs as a necessary prerequisite for soil erosion modeling and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in lar county south of fars province iran it extends between 53 45 to 54 10 e longitude and 27 20 to 27 40 n latitude and covers 60 km2 fig 1 geological formations in the study area include asmari gachsaran mishan aghajari and quaternary deposits the average annual precipitation is 228 5 mm and the climate is dry maximum and minimum elevation of the region are 1190 m and 810 m respectively the weighted average of elevation is 870 4 m above sea level the slope of the region ranges from 1 to 65 agriculture and poor rangeland are of the main land uses in the study area the thermal regime of the study area is hyperthermic and its moisture regime is aridic based on the annual erosivity factor map of iran sadeghi et al 2011 this region has a relatively high capability for soil loss 2 2 experimental designs experimental design is a procedure in which specific factors can be chosen and purposefully changed in a pre defined way to assess their effects on a specific response the independent variables of slope vegetation cover silt content as an indicator of soil texture and geological formation were used for all methods variability of soil organic matter and structure is non significant and the most variable factor affecting soil erodibility in the study area is silt content therefore silt content was considered as an indicator of soil texture two main experimental designs i e response surface and taguchi methods were performed in this study following are brief explanations about these two methods 2 2 1 response surface methods two major response surface methods i e bbm and fccm were used for modeling and optimizing soil loss at plot scale bbm can be defined as a three level factorial design it is in fact an incomplete block design which can show a rotatable or nearly rotatable design fig 2 demonstrates the bbm design as shown in this figure factor combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the cubic space as well as the center point box and behnken 1960 in this design each factor should be located at one of the three similarly spaced values these designs require 3 levels of each factor here levels refer to different values of a factor between a lower and upper limit for example for soil silt content for which the lower and upper limits are 10 and 40 respectively the code 1 corresponds to 10 code 1 corresponds to 40 and code 0 corresponds to 25 which lies in the middle of the range fig 3 demonstrates the fccm this method has three collections of design points including two level factorial design points axial points and center points the two level factorial points show all possible combinations of the 1 and 1 levels of the factors in this study the alpha is supposed equal to 0 15 of the data range i e 0 15 30 4 5 5 in center points all levels are set to coded level 0 in this case for soil silt content for which the lower and upper limits are 10 and 40 like bbm the code 1 corresponds to 10 code 1 corresponds to 40 and code 0 corresponds to 25 which lies at the middle of the range in addition to the above mentioned values 40 alpha and 10 alpha is also considered in fccm which corresponds to 15 and 35 the upper and lower values of the variables were identified according to the study area properties table 1 shows the factors and their ranges for response surface designs in this study response of interest is soil erosion and corresponding soil loss it is affected by some variables such as vegetation cover slope steepness soil properties etc the parameters that affect the process are independent variables while the responses are dependent variables here soil loss is dependent and vegetation cover slope steepness soil silt content and geological formation are independent variables the combinations of factors that should be considered in rainfall simulation tests were obtained using design expert 11 software and design matrices were provided design expert software provided a list of requisite test conditions based on the number of factors variables and levels different values of the variables for each method after setting the design matrices the rainfall simulation were conducted section 2 3 accordingly then different models i e linear two factor interaction model 2fi quadratic and cubic were tested in order to determine the best model based on performance assessment criteria analysis of variance anova was then performed to assess the significance of the model the modeling results underwent the anova test to find the statistically significant variables and interactions between them 2 2 2 taguchi method as mentioned before the taguchi fractional factorial design was used to model obtain the weights and to prioritize the factors affecting soil erosion aber et al 2010 al darrab et al 2009 the same factors as rsd methods were selected in this step table 2 shows factors and levels used in tm taguchi creates a standard orthogonal array to analyze the experimental results according to the number of factors and levels a l16 orthogonal array was selected levels refer to different values or categories of a factor for example geological formation is defined in four levels i e gurpi gachsaran aghajari and quaternary which are the main geological formations in the study area in conventional full factorial experiment design this case would require 44 256 rainfall simulations to completely evaluate the effects of four aforementioned factors on soil erosion in the study case however tm reduces the necessary number of experiments to only 16 tests l16 orthogonal array offering a great advantage in terms of experimental time and cost the 16 orthogonal array is shown in table 3 in the next step an analysis of variance anova was performed to investigate the impact of each factor weight on the process of soil loss taguchi et al 1989 the weight of each factor wf was calculated as 1 w f s s f d o f f v er s s t 100 the factorial sum of squares ssf was computed as 2 s s f mn l k 1 l y k f y t 2 where m represents the number of experiments performed in this study and n represents the number of repetitions under the same experimental conditions y k f is the average value of the measurement results of a certain factor in the kth level doff denotes freedom degree of factors it can be calculated as the number of level of factors minus one in addition the variance of error ver was calculated using eq 3 3 v er s s t f a d s s f m n 1 the total sum of squares sst was also calculated using following equation 4 s s t j 1 m i 1 n y i 2 j m n y t 2 in which yt obtained as 5 y t j 1 m i 1 n y i j m n consequently the weights of sub factors wsf were calculated using eq 6 which is an analysis of the mean anom 6 w sf y k f factor i level i j 1 n ii y k f factor i level i j this method provides a main effect plot which gives the optimal combination of factors to maximize soil loss this plot shows that how each factor affects the response characteristic if the line is not horizontal in the main effects plot there is a main effect it shows that different levels of the factor affect the characteristic in different ways large differences in the vertical position shows that the degree of the main effect is greater in this regard a signal to noise ratio was calculated using eq 7 7 s n s 10 l o g 10 1 n 1 y i 2 where n is the number of repetitions under the same experimental conditions and y represents the measured results soil loss g m 2 2 3 rainfall simulation rainfall simulation tests were performed at 1 m 2 plots sadeghi et al 2012 according to the design matrices of rsd and taguchi orthogonal array l16 rainfall simulation was implemented using a spray nozzles attached to manual compressors miyata et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2013 rainfall intensity was set to 1 2 mm min 1 with a duration of 15 min according to the range of rainfall intensity in the study area the plots had a runoff apron that allowed a safe sampling of generated overland flow and eroded soil by attaching wide neck bottles to the outlet in order to determine the rainfall simulation initial sites different ancillary data were used for example 1 25 000 topography map was used to produce slope gradient map geological maps of the study area were also used to specify the location of the different geological formations landsat 8 satellite image was used to produce vegetation cover maps a detailed soil map was used to identify soil texture fars natural resources administration filed survey examines were implemented to enhance the precision of initial site selections for example if in a test rainfall simulation in a slope of 15 was required a slope map was used to determine initial sites and then in the field a clinometerwas used to find the exact required slope it was also considered that the measured values of parameters to be at the middle of their selected range in tm sediments produced in all plots tests with three replications were collected desiccated and weighted in the laboratory vahabi and nikkami 2008 2 4 performance comparison of the models block designs are in conjunction with modeling approaches in this study they were used to determine the required tests and design the experimental measurements and then regression models and statistical analysis were used to find the relations between soil loss and triggering controlling factors to compare the ability of the three aforementioned modeling approaches 20 additional rainfall simulations were performed these additional tests were completely different from those used in the process of model calibration in all three modeling approaches i e bbm fccm and tm different performance assessment criteria such as correlation coefficient r mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square error rmse were calculated to assess and compare the performance of the models 3 results 3 1 results of response surface methods tables 4 and 5 show the design matrices and the corresponding soil loss for prearranged tests for bbm and fccm respectively these tables show different simulation tests in each test slope ss vegetation cover vc soil silt content sc and geological formation gf and corresponding soil loss are noted for example the first run in table 4 shows that a rainfall simulation test with the slope of 35 with 5 vegetation cover and 40 silt content in gachsaran formation had a 73 3 g m 2 soil loss several different models were fitted and the best models were determined for both bbm and fccm table 6 shows the statistics for the best fitted model for both designs p value was used to determine the accuracy of the fitting of the models in this regard the significance level of 0 05 was considered the p values for the models denote that both models are statistically significant and meaningful for lack of fit p value the values 0 05 show that the model does not fit the data and the values 0 05 show that there is no evidence that the model does not fit the data for both models the value of lack of fit p value are 0 05 therefore it can be concluded that both models are accurately fitted fccm has a greater r2 and adjusted r2 comparing with bbm but it s predicted r2 is lower than bbm adjusted r2 is usually used for comparing the goodness of fit for models that have different numbers of independent variables predicted r2 shows the ability of the models for prediction it is useful to determine over fitting in models in this case both of the above mentioned models have the same number of independent variables however the higher value for predicted r2 for bbm model shows that this model may be more reliable for estimating soil erosion in different conditions the difference between predicted and adjusted r2 is relatively high in fccm which can show some degree of over fitting in this model it means that this model has an acceptable performance only for data that are used for developing the model and it does not have a great ability for generalization tables 7 and 8 show the equations obtained from bbm and fccm respectively these methods provide a separate equation for each categorical variable the response surface methods can be used to determine the overall behavior of the dependent variable based on the variations of the independent variables fig 4 shows the soil loss behavior in response to the changes in the vegetation cover slope and silt content part a of the figure belongs to the bbm and part b belongs to the fccm the overall behavior shown by both methods are similar as determining the situation in which maximum soil erosion occurs can help managers take appropriate measures for mitigating soil loss in the region the yi variable was maximized using both bbm and fccm fig 5 shows the optimized situation using these two models both methods showed similar results in both methods quaternary formation with minimum vegetation cover maximum silt content and a moderate slope produces maximum soil loss 3 2 results of taguchi method the soil loss for all 16 plots were listed in the table 9 the y k f the average value of the soil loss for a certain factor in the kth level are listed in table 10 factorial sum of squares ssf was calculated replacing y k f and yt into eq 4 by substituting ssf and sst in the eq 5 the variance of error ver was obtained in conclusion the factor weights wf were calculated using eq 6 table 11 shows the weight of each factor as it is shown in this table the most effective factor among mentioned factors is geological formation the next important factor in the study area is soil texture represented by quantitative variable of silt content the third one is vegetation cover and the last one is slope steepness it shows that geological formation plays an important role in soil erosion it may be related to variability of geological formations in the study area and the importance of this factor in soil erosion process for example gurpi formation consists of thin limestone shale and clay limestone clay limestone with chert nodules while gachsaran consists of red marls and gypsum layers these differences in geological formations affect soil minerals and characteristics therefore soil loss is strongly influenced by geological formation in this area fig 6 shows the main effects plot for signal to noise ratio this figure shows the behavior of each sub factor and the way soil loss differ from each sub factor to other ones for example it shows that the slope of declination of soil loss in respect to vegetation cover increase decreases from level one to level 4 it also shows that the soil loss increases from level one to level two and then decreases from level two to level four in response to increasing slope steepness it shows that in lower slopes soil loss is not high because of low amount of produced runoff areas with steeper slopes are mainly covered by the gorpi formation in which the soil is very shallow permeability is moderate and erodibility is low 3 3 comparison of the results of response surface and taguchi methods the results figs 5 and 6 showed that there is a good agreement between the results of rsd and tm especially in optimization process this is very important because tm produces the same results by performing a limited number of experiments in comparison to rsd methods it can significantly save time effort and expenditure it is extremely valuable to assess and optimize a very complex process by just performing a restricted number of tests this method is straightforward and can be easily performed in soil erosion studies it can be used to identify the behavior of different factors in soil erosion process tm can also prioritize the factors affecting a specific phenomenon it is very valuable to recognize the most important factors affecting soil erosion in a region it can help managers make more efficient decisions to deal with soil erosion problems this was also confirmed in our previous study for a region near this study area sadeghi et al 2012 in order to compare the ability of mentioned methods in soil erosion estimation 20 additional rainfall simulation tests were performed these tests were designed to be completely different with those used in the model calibration process fig 7 shows the observed and estimated values by bbm fccm and tm bbm has the best performance in comparison with the two other models with mare and rmse of 6 16 and 5 08 respectively the results confirm the over fitting in fccm fccm was robust in estimating soil loss for tests that are used for model calibration however its performance is worse for other tests mare of 10 94 and rmse of 8 9 it shows that this model does not have acceptable power for generalization and applicability in other areas tm has also a moderate performance with mare and rmse of 11 02 and 8 16 respectively the results of this method are in a good accordance with bbm however tm produces these results with just running 16 tests the correlation between the tm and bbm results is about 97 anova test indicates that there is no significant difference between the results of these three methods with a p value of 0 921 at 0 01 significance level the results showed that bbm and taguchi methods can be good design of experiments for sediment studies especially in similar conditions nevertheless the results should be assessed from different viewpoints from the aspect of optimization all three aforementioned methods had similar performances all of them could determine the optimum condition for soil loss optimization in terms of accuracy bbm was the best design with highest modeling performance it could predict soil loss with lowest error however concerning computational cost and needed labor and expenses taguchi method is more efficient taguchi can produce acceptable results in both modeling and optimization by performing a limited number of experiments 4 conclusion the main goal of this study was to assess the ability of response surface and taguchi methods in optimization and modeling the soil erosion process as data gathering is usually time consuming and expensive in soil studies it is very important to choose a robust design of experiment which can provide acceptable results and at the same time minimize the number of experiments bbm provided the best results by performing a limited number of experiments this method can be efficiently used for assessing the behavior of different triggering controlling factors in soil erosion process it can assess categorical in this case geological formations as well as numerical variables in this case vegetation cover slope and silt content bbm provides a distinct equation for each categorical variable if only numerical variables are used in this method fewer runs are required the other point is that tm can be suitably used for optimizing and modeling soil erosion process it is a fractional factorial design of experiment which can optimize the process by a very limited number of experiments it was shown that the results of this model have a great correlation with the results of bbm it is very important that a model with only 16 tests can provide results similar to a model with 56 tests although the rmse and mare of this model are more than bbm this model can be a robust alternative for response surface models especially when there are limitations in time and expenses for simulations because tm can produce relatively similar results using just a limited number of tests however if the limitation are not serious bbm can be suggested because it can produce more reliable and accurate results the results of optimization of this method is completely in accordance with those of bbm and fccm in addition this method can be used to prioritize soil erosion triggering controlling factors assessing other design of experiments such as augmented factorial v optimal latin hypercubes doehlert matrix and plackett burman designs can be suggested for future studies credit authorship contribution statement vahid moosavi conceptualization

4993,appropriate investigation of soil erosion triggering controlling factors is of great importance for natural resources management usually soil erosion assessment is time consuming and impose high costs to researchers and managers therefore design of experiments methods can be good approaches to achieve the purpose to which adequate attention has not been paid yet this study was aimed to assess two response surface methods of box behnken bbm and face centered central composite fccm as well as a fractional factorial design of experiment taguchi method tm for modeling and optimization of soil loss process at plot scale so far no studyhas been conducted to evaluate and compare the ability of bbm fccm and tm in soil erosion modeling optimization and assessment rainfall simulations were performed in the conditions determined by bbm fccm experimental designs and tm orthogonal arrays and in situ soil loss measurements were performed at small plot scale although results showed that bbm outperformed fccm and tm the anova test indicated verified non significant difference p 0 921 at 0 01 significance level in performances of the modeling procedures it was further shown that tm had an acceptable performance with regard to the very limited number of required measurement tests results further showed that there was a good agreement r 0 97 between the results of tm with just 16 runs and bbm with 56 runs with respective rmses of 8 16 and 5 08 therefore tm can be suggested for soil erosion studies when there are limitations in time and expenses for simulations however if the limitations can be overcome bbm can be suggested as a better design of experiment in soil erosion studies keywords optimization techniques model performance hydrologic modeling soil erosion plots soil loss rainfall simulation 1 introduction soil erosion has become a global concern and is intensified with climate change and progressive impacts of human activities terranova et al 2009 this phenomenon causes several adverse effects on human life such as reduction in the productivity of soil worsening water quality lowering the effective reservoir water levels flooding and habitat destruction oh and jung 2005 accurate predictions calculating the risk and identifying ways to control the soil erosion are very difficult expensive and time consuming because this phenomenon is very complex and affected by a series of complicated factors therefore investigation of methods which can help managers assess and prioritize factors affecting soil erosion is very worthwhile rainfall simulation is an effective approach which has been extensively used for soil erosion and soil loss studies at different scales gan et al 2020 guo et al 2020 mhaske et al 2019 rodrigo comino et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2017 several studies have been conducted to assess the effect of important parameters such as vegetation cover chen et al 2019 descroix et al 2001 nouwakpo et al 2018 slope gradient slope aspect soil texture and rainfall intensity deng et al 2020 ramos et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2017 vahabi and nikkami 2008 on soil erosion using different methodologies based on various experimental designs several studies have also used different quantitative analytical and descriptive methods to analyze the results of their experiments cao et al 2020 han et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 2008 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 small soil erosion plots are very common in soil erosion studies because they can simplify the process and minimize the uncertainties related to spatial scale several researchers have used small plots to assess soil erosion process anache et al 2017 bagarello et al 2018 du et al 2020 gholami et al 2018 sadeghi et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 nonexistence of a reliable design for determination of adequate replication of experimental runs always exhausted scholars so that the least number of three replications baumgartner 2007 has been often used for conducting studies providing high quality data in soil erosion studies is therefore a very important and at the same time very arduous work therefore choosing an effective design of experiment doe is of great importance in these studies doe can be defined as a systematic approach to determine the relationship between triggering controlling factors and the output of that process in this case the output of the process is soil loss a full factorial design of experiment refers to testing all possible combinations of existing factors usually in this design researchers have to run a huge number of tests in order to provide required data for the next analyses this procedure is regularly difficult to apply in soil erosion studies because it is very time consuming expensive labor intensive and sometime impossible particularly when dealing with high number of factors fractional factorial designs can be good ways to deal with this problem response surface designs rsds are a set of robust design of experiments which can be used in modeling and optimization studies rsds can model the changes in variables that affect a response of interest which is soil loss in this study rsd is a combination of statistical and mathematical methods to analyze data obtained from specifically designed experiments several studies have been conducted using rsds in different fields such as industry varghese et al 2017 chemistry prabu et al 2015 yirsaw et al 2016 materials banerjee and sutradhar 2018 energy yesilyurt et al 2019 etc bbm and fccm are two important rsds these two methods can be used to determine the situations in which simulations should be implemented bbm is a fractional factorial design in which factor combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the process space and at the center fccm can also be used to determine the number of experiments needed for modeling and optimizing the process these methods of experiment design can be used in response surface methodology for optimization and modeling purposes tm is also one of the most important design of experiment methods that can considerably reduce the needed time and computational costs these methods provide the opportunity to achieve the desired results by performing minimum number of simulations to the best of our knowledge no research has been implemented to evaluate and compare the ability of rsds and tm in soil erosion modeling and optimization the main objective of this study is to assess and compare the performance of bbm fccm and tm in modeling and optimization of factors affecting soil erosion at plot scale the findings of this study may assist experts and decision makers to efficiently use experimental designs as a necessary prerequisite for soil erosion modeling and optimization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in lar county south of fars province iran it extends between 53 45 to 54 10 e longitude and 27 20 to 27 40 n latitude and covers 60 km2 fig 1 geological formations in the study area include asmari gachsaran mishan aghajari and quaternary deposits the average annual precipitation is 228 5 mm and the climate is dry maximum and minimum elevation of the region are 1190 m and 810 m respectively the weighted average of elevation is 870 4 m above sea level the slope of the region ranges from 1 to 65 agriculture and poor rangeland are of the main land uses in the study area the thermal regime of the study area is hyperthermic and its moisture regime is aridic based on the annual erosivity factor map of iran sadeghi et al 2011 this region has a relatively high capability for soil loss 2 2 experimental designs experimental design is a procedure in which specific factors can be chosen and purposefully changed in a pre defined way to assess their effects on a specific response the independent variables of slope vegetation cover silt content as an indicator of soil texture and geological formation were used for all methods variability of soil organic matter and structure is non significant and the most variable factor affecting soil erodibility in the study area is silt content therefore silt content was considered as an indicator of soil texture two main experimental designs i e response surface and taguchi methods were performed in this study following are brief explanations about these two methods 2 2 1 response surface methods two major response surface methods i e bbm and fccm were used for modeling and optimizing soil loss at plot scale bbm can be defined as a three level factorial design it is in fact an incomplete block design which can show a rotatable or nearly rotatable design fig 2 demonstrates the bbm design as shown in this figure factor combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the cubic space as well as the center point box and behnken 1960 in this design each factor should be located at one of the three similarly spaced values these designs require 3 levels of each factor here levels refer to different values of a factor between a lower and upper limit for example for soil silt content for which the lower and upper limits are 10 and 40 respectively the code 1 corresponds to 10 code 1 corresponds to 40 and code 0 corresponds to 25 which lies in the middle of the range fig 3 demonstrates the fccm this method has three collections of design points including two level factorial design points axial points and center points the two level factorial points show all possible combinations of the 1 and 1 levels of the factors in this study the alpha is supposed equal to 0 15 of the data range i e 0 15 30 4 5 5 in center points all levels are set to coded level 0 in this case for soil silt content for which the lower and upper limits are 10 and 40 like bbm the code 1 corresponds to 10 code 1 corresponds to 40 and code 0 corresponds to 25 which lies at the middle of the range in addition to the above mentioned values 40 alpha and 10 alpha is also considered in fccm which corresponds to 15 and 35 the upper and lower values of the variables were identified according to the study area properties table 1 shows the factors and their ranges for response surface designs in this study response of interest is soil erosion and corresponding soil loss it is affected by some variables such as vegetation cover slope steepness soil properties etc the parameters that affect the process are independent variables while the responses are dependent variables here soil loss is dependent and vegetation cover slope steepness soil silt content and geological formation are independent variables the combinations of factors that should be considered in rainfall simulation tests were obtained using design expert 11 software and design matrices were provided design expert software provided a list of requisite test conditions based on the number of factors variables and levels different values of the variables for each method after setting the design matrices the rainfall simulation were conducted section 2 3 accordingly then different models i e linear two factor interaction model 2fi quadratic and cubic were tested in order to determine the best model based on performance assessment criteria analysis of variance anova was then performed to assess the significance of the model the modeling results underwent the anova test to find the statistically significant variables and interactions between them 2 2 2 taguchi method as mentioned before the taguchi fractional factorial design was used to model obtain the weights and to prioritize the factors affecting soil erosion aber et al 2010 al darrab et al 2009 the same factors as rsd methods were selected in this step table 2 shows factors and levels used in tm taguchi creates a standard orthogonal array to analyze the experimental results according to the number of factors and levels a l16 orthogonal array was selected levels refer to different values or categories of a factor for example geological formation is defined in four levels i e gurpi gachsaran aghajari and quaternary which are the main geological formations in the study area in conventional full factorial experiment design this case would require 44 256 rainfall simulations to completely evaluate the effects of four aforementioned factors on soil erosion in the study case however tm reduces the necessary number of experiments to only 16 tests l16 orthogonal array offering a great advantage in terms of experimental time and cost the 16 orthogonal array is shown in table 3 in the next step an analysis of variance anova was performed to investigate the impact of each factor weight on the process of soil loss taguchi et al 1989 the weight of each factor wf was calculated as 1 w f s s f d o f f v er s s t 100 the factorial sum of squares ssf was computed as 2 s s f mn l k 1 l y k f y t 2 where m represents the number of experiments performed in this study and n represents the number of repetitions under the same experimental conditions y k f is the average value of the measurement results of a certain factor in the kth level doff denotes freedom degree of factors it can be calculated as the number of level of factors minus one in addition the variance of error ver was calculated using eq 3 3 v er s s t f a d s s f m n 1 the total sum of squares sst was also calculated using following equation 4 s s t j 1 m i 1 n y i 2 j m n y t 2 in which yt obtained as 5 y t j 1 m i 1 n y i j m n consequently the weights of sub factors wsf were calculated using eq 6 which is an analysis of the mean anom 6 w sf y k f factor i level i j 1 n ii y k f factor i level i j this method provides a main effect plot which gives the optimal combination of factors to maximize soil loss this plot shows that how each factor affects the response characteristic if the line is not horizontal in the main effects plot there is a main effect it shows that different levels of the factor affect the characteristic in different ways large differences in the vertical position shows that the degree of the main effect is greater in this regard a signal to noise ratio was calculated using eq 7 7 s n s 10 l o g 10 1 n 1 y i 2 where n is the number of repetitions under the same experimental conditions and y represents the measured results soil loss g m 2 2 3 rainfall simulation rainfall simulation tests were performed at 1 m 2 plots sadeghi et al 2012 according to the design matrices of rsd and taguchi orthogonal array l16 rainfall simulation was implemented using a spray nozzles attached to manual compressors miyata et al 2007 sadeghi et al 2013 rainfall intensity was set to 1 2 mm min 1 with a duration of 15 min according to the range of rainfall intensity in the study area the plots had a runoff apron that allowed a safe sampling of generated overland flow and eroded soil by attaching wide neck bottles to the outlet in order to determine the rainfall simulation initial sites different ancillary data were used for example 1 25 000 topography map was used to produce slope gradient map geological maps of the study area were also used to specify the location of the different geological formations landsat 8 satellite image was used to produce vegetation cover maps a detailed soil map was used to identify soil texture fars natural resources administration filed survey examines were implemented to enhance the precision of initial site selections for example if in a test rainfall simulation in a slope of 15 was required a slope map was used to determine initial sites and then in the field a clinometerwas used to find the exact required slope it was also considered that the measured values of parameters to be at the middle of their selected range in tm sediments produced in all plots tests with three replications were collected desiccated and weighted in the laboratory vahabi and nikkami 2008 2 4 performance comparison of the models block designs are in conjunction with modeling approaches in this study they were used to determine the required tests and design the experimental measurements and then regression models and statistical analysis were used to find the relations between soil loss and triggering controlling factors to compare the ability of the three aforementioned modeling approaches 20 additional rainfall simulations were performed these additional tests were completely different from those used in the process of model calibration in all three modeling approaches i e bbm fccm and tm different performance assessment criteria such as correlation coefficient r mean absolute relative error mare and root mean square error rmse were calculated to assess and compare the performance of the models 3 results 3 1 results of response surface methods tables 4 and 5 show the design matrices and the corresponding soil loss for prearranged tests for bbm and fccm respectively these tables show different simulation tests in each test slope ss vegetation cover vc soil silt content sc and geological formation gf and corresponding soil loss are noted for example the first run in table 4 shows that a rainfall simulation test with the slope of 35 with 5 vegetation cover and 40 silt content in gachsaran formation had a 73 3 g m 2 soil loss several different models were fitted and the best models were determined for both bbm and fccm table 6 shows the statistics for the best fitted model for both designs p value was used to determine the accuracy of the fitting of the models in this regard the significance level of 0 05 was considered the p values for the models denote that both models are statistically significant and meaningful for lack of fit p value the values 0 05 show that the model does not fit the data and the values 0 05 show that there is no evidence that the model does not fit the data for both models the value of lack of fit p value are 0 05 therefore it can be concluded that both models are accurately fitted fccm has a greater r2 and adjusted r2 comparing with bbm but it s predicted r2 is lower than bbm adjusted r2 is usually used for comparing the goodness of fit for models that have different numbers of independent variables predicted r2 shows the ability of the models for prediction it is useful to determine over fitting in models in this case both of the above mentioned models have the same number of independent variables however the higher value for predicted r2 for bbm model shows that this model may be more reliable for estimating soil erosion in different conditions the difference between predicted and adjusted r2 is relatively high in fccm which can show some degree of over fitting in this model it means that this model has an acceptable performance only for data that are used for developing the model and it does not have a great ability for generalization tables 7 and 8 show the equations obtained from bbm and fccm respectively these methods provide a separate equation for each categorical variable the response surface methods can be used to determine the overall behavior of the dependent variable based on the variations of the independent variables fig 4 shows the soil loss behavior in response to the changes in the vegetation cover slope and silt content part a of the figure belongs to the bbm and part b belongs to the fccm the overall behavior shown by both methods are similar as determining the situation in which maximum soil erosion occurs can help managers take appropriate measures for mitigating soil loss in the region the yi variable was maximized using both bbm and fccm fig 5 shows the optimized situation using these two models both methods showed similar results in both methods quaternary formation with minimum vegetation cover maximum silt content and a moderate slope produces maximum soil loss 3 2 results of taguchi method the soil loss for all 16 plots were listed in the table 9 the y k f the average value of the soil loss for a certain factor in the kth level are listed in table 10 factorial sum of squares ssf was calculated replacing y k f and yt into eq 4 by substituting ssf and sst in the eq 5 the variance of error ver was obtained in conclusion the factor weights wf were calculated using eq 6 table 11 shows the weight of each factor as it is shown in this table the most effective factor among mentioned factors is geological formation the next important factor in the study area is soil texture represented by quantitative variable of silt content the third one is vegetation cover and the last one is slope

response to increasing slope steepness it shows that in lower slopes soil loss is not high because of low amount of produced runoff areas with steeper slopes are mainly covered by the gorpi formation in which the soil is very shallow permeability is moderate and erodibility is low 3 3 comparison of the results of response surface and taguchi methods the results figs 5 and 6 showed that there is a good agreement between the results of rsd and tm especially in optimization process this is very important because tm produces the same results by performing a limited number of experiments in comparison to rsd methods it can significantly save time effort and expenditure it is extremely valuable to assess and optimize a very complex process by just performing a restricted number of tests

4994,the cycling of carbon c and nitrogen n in karst aquatic systems has been shown to be closely related with coupled control of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations through the metabolic pathways of subaquatic communities however the coupled cn cycling involving in the transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic into doc has not been well explored in this study we chose the lijiang river a typical karst aquatic system in southwest china as our study area and documented its diurnal and seasonal variations in terms of several hydrochemical and isotopic parameters to identify how to couple cycling for c and n the results of the bayesian stable isotope mixing model showed that approximately 50 and 72 of the total doc formed in summer and winter respectively represented autochthonous organic carbon in the lijiang river diurnal monitoring results revealed that dic and no3 transformations were primarily controlled by metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of subaquatic communities accompanying doc formation in the lijiang river the consumption of dic and no3 by aquatic photosynthesis was in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol to produce autochthonous doc accompanying the enriched δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with a daily variation of 7 9 10 6 and 11 2 respectively on the diurnal scale 6 2 of the total dic and 7 1 of the total no3 were consumed by metabolic processes of subaquatic communities and these values were consistent with their corresponding values on the interannual scale however the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season approximately 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 were converted into organic matter by the aquatic photosynthesis with 80 and 79 of the total dic and no3 consumption respectively occurring in the wet season furthermore the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 can promote the production of autochthonous doc constituting a relatively long term natural c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems keywords coupled carbon nitrogen cycling dissolved inorganic carbon nitrate dissolved organic carbon karst aquatic system lijiang river 1 introduction imbalances in global carbon c and nitrogen n budgets have become important environmental issues because of their inherent connection with contemporary climate change melnikov and o neill 2006 schlesinger 2009 zeng et al 2019 c and n loading of aquatic systems is increasing worldwide due to intense human activities during the past decades peterson et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 xuan et al 2019 in the 20th century alone human activities have increased the delivery of n to rivers and streams from 34 to 64 tg n yr beusen et al 2015 of all n species nitrate no3 is the most dominant component beusen et al 2015 the no3 contamination of water is possibly the most widespread environmental problem in the world kendall et al 2008 xue et al 2009 especially in karst water karstic aquifers are particularly sensitive and fragile to chemical contamination from anthropogenic activities due to their developed conduit networks and sinkholes jiang 2013 a growing number of studies have found that the n from human activities has caused the coupled cn cycling to be involved in the process of carbonate weathering leading to an increased dissolved inorganic carbon dic flux in karst aquatic systems jiang 2013 raymond et al 2008 zhao et al 2020a the higher dic half of which originates from soil atm from carbonate weathering and increased no3 from human activities could fuel the growth of aquatic communities which in turn could enhance the uptake of dic and no3 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 thus the cycling of c and n in karst aquatic systems is closely related with a coupled control of organic carbon oc concentrations via assimilation process gruber and galloway 2008 seitzinger et al 2007 trimmer et al 2012 zeng et al 2019 however little is known about the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems in the coupled cn cycling process aquatic photosynthesis can consume dic and no3 implying that dic can be preserved in a relatively stable form by converting dic into oc while water quality can be enhanced by consuming no3 liu et al 2018 nõges et al 2016 pedersen et al 2013 furthermore the coupled cn cycling could cause carbonate precipitation in karst aquatic systems in this process dic and no3 are transformed into organic matter and o2 is released which is in contrast with the traditional viewpoint of co2 release during carbonate precipitation jiang et al 2013 the oc can be divided into particulate organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc in aquatic systems and the latter accounts for 60 of the total oc spitzy and ittekkot 1991 moreover the doc is a key source of energy for driving functioning of the aquatic systems wen et al 2020 hence it is important to obtain more insights into the coupled cn cycling and the transformation of dic into doc in karst aquatic systems which will shed more light on the stability of carbon sink associated with carbonate weathering and the improvement of water quality in these systems dic evolution in karst aquatic systems includes co2 outgassing and doc transformation accompanied by the precipitation or dissolution of calcium carbonate jiang et al 2020 no3 evolution in aquatic systems includes n uptake by photosynthesis of subaquatic communities organic nitrogen decomposition by respiration and transformation of no3 into n2 by denitrification kendall et al 2008 thus the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems involves the recognition of these processes the respiration of subaquatic communities produces δ13c depleted co2 with a δ13c value close to that of organic matter whereas photosynthetic uptake of dic preferentially removes 12c leading to an enrichment of 13c in the remaining dic in water sun et al 2015 yang et al 1996 moreover the elevated δ13cdic by photosynthesis can be enhanced by co2 outgassing due to preferential loss of 12c relative to 13c jiang et al 2013 telmer and veizer 1999 the denitrification of bacteria and photosynthesis of subaquatic communities generally preferentially uses lighter isotopes which would lead to the enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining no3 the denitrification results in δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining no3 increasing with a relationship of 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 lee et al 2008 xue et al 2009 whereas the assimilation of no3 during photosynthesis results in δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining no3 increasing with a relationship of 1 1 granger et al 2004 meanwhile autochthonous doc produced by aquatic photosynthesis has significant differences in the δ13c and c n values with allochthonous doc generally the δ13c and c n values for phytoplankton pp and macrophytes mp are 42 to 24 and 5 to 8 kendall et al 2001 and 28 to 18 and 10 to 30 kendall et al 2001 respectively whereas the δ13c and c n values for soil organic matter som c3 plants and c4 plants are 25 to 22 and 10 to13 goñi et al 2003 32 to 22 and 15 kendall et al 2001 and 16 to 9 and 15 to 50 kendall et al 2001 respectively therefore hydrochemical parameters e g ca2 dic no3 do doc poc and c n and isotopes e g δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are powerful tools to study the coupled cn cycling and the transformation of dic into doc in karst aquatic systems in this study a typical karst aquatic system the lijiang river in southwest china was chosen as the study area and seasonal and diurnal variations in c and n were investigated the hydrogeochemical and isotopic data dic no3 nh4 don doc poc do δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed to better understand the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems thus the new aspect addressed here is to identify how to couple cycling for c and n in the typical karst aquatic system 2 study area the study was conducted in the lijiang river which is located in the northeast of guangxi province the center of the well known karst regions of southwest china the river basin is situated between the coordinates of 24 16 26 21 n and 109 45 111 02 e with a drainage area of 5039 7 km2 and a length of 164 km in a region of mid subtropical monsoon climate fig s1 this area is strongly affected by east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon with 80 of annual precipitation occurring between march and august the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 19 c and 2000 mm respectively the vegetation in the drainage basin is characterized by tropical evergreen forests dominated by subtropical coniferous forest broadleaf forest bamboo forest and grassland the aquatic vegetation in the lijiang river is characterized by submerged c3 macrophytes dominated by vallisneria spiralis ceratophyllum demersum and hydrilla verticillate phytoplankton in the lijiang river mainly includes chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cyanophyta the lithology of the upper part of the catchment is chiefly silurian granites ordovician cambrian shales and mud rocks intercalated with carbonate rocks zhao et al 2020a in contrast the lithology of the mid lower parts is dominated by devonian carbonate rocks zhao et al 2020a thus karst landscape is well developed in the mid lower reaches of the lijiang river 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis 3 1 1 seasonal sampling and analysis twelve sampling sites m1 m3 in the upper reaches m4 m6 in the middle reaches m7 and m8 in the lower reaches and t1 t4 of four main tributaries were selected along the lijiang river fig s1 to capture the influence of storm water runoff and discharge in the river two sampling campaigns were conducted in the wet season august 2017 and in the dry season december 2017 in addition monthly monitoring of hydrochemistry was performed at site m8 during january december 2017 all water samples were filtered through glass fiber filters precombusted gf f filters 0 7 μm pore size into polyethylene bottles poc samples were extracted by filtering river water through the baked 0 7 um glass fiber filters samples of the potential doc sources were also collected including ten samples of representative aquatic plant samples hydrilla verticillate vallisineria spiralis ceratophyllum demersum and spirogyra and five phytoplankton samples from the lijiang river we collected phytoplankton using 1 m vertical tows through the water column using a 64 μm plankton net and used the protocol developed by hamilton et al 2005 to partition fine particulate matter into predominantly phytoplankton and detrital components by centrifugation in colloidal silica ludox tm 50 density 1 40 g cm3 in addition six soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 30 cm under the corresponding dominant plants castanopsis fargesii loropetalum chinense pinus massoniana pinus elliottii eucalypt and bamboo soil samples were dried in the oven at 45 c for two days then ground to pass a sieve mesh 200 plant samples were rinsed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 50 c for two days after drying the plant samples were ground into a powder form with diameters 150 μm to ensure homogeneity all samples were stored at a temperature 4 c in the laboratory before measurement water temperature t ph and do were measured on site using a portable water quality analyzer ysi 6920 usa hco3 co3 2 concentrations were determined in situ by titration with an alkalinity test kit with resolution of 0 1 mmol l concentrations of major cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions no3 cl and so4 2 were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes resolution of 0 01 mg l and ion chromatography ic resolution of 0 01 mg l respectively ammonium nh4

multi3100 instrument with resolution of 0 01 mg l dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations were calculated using the difference between dn and no3 concentrations poc concentrations were determined using an elemental analyzer vario isotope cube isoprime elementar company with resolution of 0 01 mg l δ13cdoc values were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso toc cube isoprime 100 elementar company while δ13cdic values were analyzed using a gasbench ii irms system thermo fisher scientific usa for soil and plant samples the elemental analyzer vario isotope cube isoprime elementar company was used to determine the stable c isotope compositions and c n ratios all c n values reported were atomic at ratios the results of δ13c analysis were reported relative to the v pdb standard and the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 2 the δ18o h2o values were determined with a liquid water stable isotope analyzer lwia 24 d los gatos research usa δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were measured using an elemental analyzer interfaced with a mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the results of

h2o the pco2 of water were calculated based on hydrochemical data including water temperature ph and concentrations of seven major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 by using the modified program watspec wigley 1977 eq 1 1 p co 2 hco 3 h k h k 1 where kh and k1 represent the temperature dependent henry s law constant for co2 and dissociation constant for h2co3 in water respectively 3 1 2 diurnal sampling and analysis a 48 h sampling campaign was conducted during sunny days from october 30 to november 1 2017 at 2 h intervals to evaluate the existence and magnitude of in river diel variations at site m6 fig s2 in the middle reaches of the lijiang river in which there are a large number of aquatic plants including hydrilla verticillate vallisineria spiralis and spirogyra the water temperature ph and do at this site were measured in situ at 15 min intervals using the multi parameter meter ysi 6920 usa resolutions of t ph and do were 0 01 c 0 1 ph units and 0 01 mg l respectively discrete river water samples dic no3 doc δ13cdic δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were collected every two hours from october 30 through november 1 2017 all water samples collection and analysis were completely consistent with the above described procedure 3 2 seasonal data calculations and statistical analysis 3 2 1 quantification of the contributions of doc sources in the lijiang river to quantify the contributions of different doc sources in the lijiang river the bayesian stable isotope mixing model was used this model has been implemented using a siar stable isotope analysis in r software package and can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of water sample i pk is the proportional contribution of source k which is estimated using the bayesian model sjk is the source value k of isotope j cjk is the fractionation factor of isotope j on source k and εij is the residual error representing additional unquantified variations between individual samples to estimate the proportional contribution of doc sources only one isotope j 1 δ13c and three major potential doc sources soil organic matter phytoplankton and macrophytes were considered in this study 11 samples of plant leaves and stems collected in the lijiang river basin had c n ratios from 24 7 to 107 7 table s1 which were significantly different from the doc don ratios of the river water as mentioned in section 4 2 and other potential doc sources as mentioned in section 4 1 therefore terrestrial plants were not considered as the potential doc sources in this study the values of three major potential doc sources were 23 1 1 7 25 0 1 5 and 30 5 2 1 for som mp and pp respectively as mentioned in section 4 1 for δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp we used the δ13c of mp and pp biomass as we did not have direct measurement of the δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp we acknowledge that this is only a first order approximation of the δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp in this study and look forward to further refining this model endpoint when better data become available the corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors are out of the scope of this study thus we assumed cjk 0 in eq 2 3 2 2 estimation of autochthonous doc concentrations in the lijiang river autochthonous doc concentrations cadoc were estimated using eq 3 3 c adoc c doc a m where am based on the discussion in section 5 1 representing the contribution of autochthonous doc is the sum of the contributions of macrophytes and phytoplankton to doc cdoc is the concentration of doc 3 2 3 estimation of annual dic and no3 loss during metabolism of subaquatic communities the annual dic f adic kg c yr and no3 f ano3 kg n yr loss by metabolism of subaquatic communities were calculated using the monthly doc concentration cdoc the contributions of macrophytes amp and phytoplankton app and the monthly average discharge qm at the mouth of the lijiang river and the c n ratios of macrophytes rmp and phytoplankton rpp as follows 4 f adic m c doc 12 a mp a pp q m 12 5 f ano 3 m c doc 12 a mp r mp a pp r pp q m 14 where f adic and f ano3 are given by the sum of monthly losses of dic and no3 due to metabolism of subaquatic communities in one hydrological year qm is the monthly average discharge at the river mouth table s2 where m 1 2 3 12 cdoc denotes the monthly doc concentration at the river mouth table s2 amp and app are the contributions of macrophytes and phytoplankton to doc respectively amp and app were set as 23 and 27 during the wet season march to august respectively and as 35 and 37 during the dry season september to february respectively these values were obtained based on the discussion in section 5 1 rmp mean 11 and rpp mean 6 4 represent the c n ratios of macrophytes and phytoplankton respectively as mentioned in section 4 1 however this approach of estimation of annual dic and no3 loss during metabolism of subaquatic communities did not consider that i both doc and poc are produced by the photosynthetic use of dic by subaquatic communities ii only a fraction of dic is converted into doc and most of it is incorporated into biomass 3 3 diurnal data processing and analysis 3 3 1 determining dic losses by co2 evasion carbon dioxide fluxes across the water air interface can be calculated using a molecular diffusion model raymond et al 2012 6 fa k p co 2 water p co 2 air where fa is the co2 evasion flux mg m2 h between water and air k is the gas transfer velocity cm h and pco2water pco2air is the co2 concentration gradient between water and air ppmv atmospheric co2 concentration was found to be 445 ppmv at a location 1 5 m above the stream surface pu et al 2016 we calculated k using the temperature dependent schmidt number sct for fresh water raymond et al 2012 3 3 2 determining changes in dic concentrations due to calcite precipitation or dissolution as described by jiang et al 2020 carbonate precipitation reduces ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol mol and simultaneously releases 1 mol of co2 aq into solution and conversely carbonate dissolution increases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol mol and removes 1 mol of co2 aq from the solution thus the dic loss by calcite precipitation or gain by calcite dissolution were calculated from the changes in ca2 concentrations and the molar ratio of ca2 and hco3 3 3 3 determining changes in dic concentrations due to metabolism of subaquatic communities biologically generated dic was quantified using the gross primary productivity gpp and respiration rates er with respect to do concentrations the net ecosystem production nep represents the difference between gpp and er demars et al 2015 odum 1956 pu et al 2016 7 nep dt do t do t 1 dt kr do g where dt represents a time step dot dot 1 mg l is the change in oxygen concentration between recording intervals δdo is the excess oxygen δdo 100 saturation do measured do value kr is the reaeration coefficient which is the rate of exchange of oxygen with the ambient atmosphere and g is the river water groundwater exchange that affects do concentration at the sampling site marcarelli et al 2010 pu et al 2016 we assume that g is negligible because the monitoring point m6 is mainly supplied by surface water the concentration of completely 100 saturated do mg l at a given water temperature was calculated as described elsewhere rice and association 2012 the dic affected by the metabolism of subaquatic communities can be estimated based on the dic o2 molar stoichiometry 1 1 del giorgio and williams 2015 3 3 4 estimation of magnitudes of δ13cdic variations the contributions of different processes to variations in δ13cdic were calculated using a time stepping chemical isotope 12c and 13c mass balance model jiang et al 2020 tobias and bohlke 2011 based on the dic loss gain the model requires i the initial δ13c values of the dic from the lijiang river 9 4 the minimum value of δ13cdic before sunrise pp 30 5 mp 25 0 and atmospheric co2 9 9 obtaining from jiang et al 2020 and ii fractionation factors 0 9989 and 1 002 at 20 c for air water exchange for co2 aq co2 gas equilibrium and gas dissolution respectively tobias and bohlke 2011 1 0007 for carbonate precipitation hco3 caco3 tobias and bohlke 2011 0 9830 and 1 0000 assuming no fractionation during the respiration of oc to co2 for photosynthesis and respiration by both pp and mp respectively mook 2006 previous studies have found that the aqueous dic species came to chemical and isotopic equilibrium within each time step caco3 precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with dic and transfer of co2 between air and water had a small kinetic fractionation associated with diffusion near the interface tobias and bohlke 2011 zhang et al 1995 a detailed description of this model can be found in tobias and bohlke 2011 and jiang et al 2020 3 3 5 determining changes in no3 concentrations due to metabolism in subaquatic communities no3 loss f no3 mol due to metabolism of subaquatic communities can be calculated using eq 8 8 f no 3 no 3 max 0 no 3 t 62 q where no3 max 0 8 68 mg l is the maximum concentration of no3 before sunrise no3 t is the concentration of no3 at time t and q is discharge at site m6 3 3 6 estimation of magnitudes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 variations the changes in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values during the assimilation process can be described with a rayleigh distillation model mariotti et al 1981 this process is expressed by 9 δ t δ 0 ε ln no 3 t no 3 0 where δt is the δ15n or δ18o value of the residual no3 at time t δ0 is the initial δ15n or δ18o value of the no3 and ε is the enrichment factor no3 t and no3 0 represent the no3 concentrations of residual no3 and initial no3 during the assimilation respectively δ0 and no3 0 were assigned to be the minimum δ15n no3 value 3 9 and the maximum no3 concentration 8 68 mg l before sunrise at m6 respectively the enrichment factors for δ15n 7 67 and δ18o 7 55 were obtained from fig s3 4 results 4 1 δ13c and c n of macrophytes phytoplankton and soil organic matter as shown in table 1 compared to the soil organic matter macrophytes and phytoplankton in the lijiang river showed depleted δ13c values and lower c n values the δ13c and c n values of macrophytes and phytoplankton ranged from 27 5 to 23 2 with an average value of 25 0 1 5 and 9 8 to 12 7 with an average value of 11 0 1 0 and 33 9 to 28 8 with an average value of 30 5 2 1 and 5 3 to 7 6 with a mean value of 6 4 0 9 respectively in contrast the δ13c and c n values of the soil organic matter varied from 25 2 to 21 2 and 12 5 to 13 7 with a mean value of 23 1 1 7 and 13 2 0 4 respectively 4 2 seasonal and spatial variations of hydrogeochemical parameters and isotopes of the water in the lijiang river during the seasonal sampling periods the nh4 concentrations of the river water at most sampling sites were lower than the detection limit 0 02 mg l and the detectable nh4 concentrations accounted for 5 of the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen din there were insignificant seasonal variations p 0 05 in no3 concentrations of the water samples collected from the main river and tributaries ranging from 1 10 to 12 20 and 2 52 to 15 72 mg l in summer and winter respectively however obvious spatial variations of no3 concentrations p 0 01 were observed increasing significantly from the upper to the lower reaches in both seasons fig 1 especially in summer the dic concentrations varied from 3 6 to 42 0 mg l with a mean value of 20 6 mg l and showed significant seasonal variations with higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations in summer p 0 01 which is possibly affected by both rainwater dilution and water rock interactions zhao et al 2020b during summer the dissolution of carbonate rocks is accelerated due to the high temperature high humidity and strong hydrodynamic conditions however the abundant rainfall also causes strong dilution of dic during summer river discharge was higher during summer in comparison to winter in all stations the increase was between 700 and 1000 higher in summer in most stations table s3 compared with the several orders of magnitude variations of river discharge changes the seasonal variations of rock weathering rate are insignificant therefore the river discharge plays a dominant role in the variations of riverine ionic concentrations zhao et al 2020b although the river discharge increased by 159 and 228 going downstream in summer and winter respectively and 78 and 130 of which were from tributaries the dic concentrations increased gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches this variation is related to the spatial distribution of carbonate rocks in the lijiang river basin fig s1 the poc concentrations ranged from 0 09 to 0 75 mg l table s4 on average poc concentrations only accounted for 15 and 7 of oc in summer and winter respectively suggesting that doc is the main constituent of oc in the lijiang river although the doc concentrations did not show different seasonal variations p 0 05 significant spatial variations p 0 05 of the doc concentrations could be found increasing significantly from the upper to the mid lower reaches in the lijiang river the downstream increase in doc concentrations may be related to the dic fertilization yang et al 2016 the higher dic concentrations in the mid lower reaches can promote the aquatic photosynthesis the overall don concentrations varied from 0 19 to 0 56 mg l with a lower average in summer 0 31 0 07 mg l than in winter 0 41 0 10 mg l and spatially the don concentrations exhibited a similar variation to the doc in the lijiang river the doc don ratios in the lijiang river ranged from 8 29 to 11 47 with a higher average value in summer 10 48 0 59 than in winter 9 35 0 78 and decreased in a fluctuating manner along the river in both seasons fig 1 the δ13cdic values showed significant seasonal p 0 01 and spatial variations p 0 01 in the lijiang river fig 1 the δ13cdic values in summer were obviously lighter than that in winter ranging from 11 8 to 9 0 in summer and 10 3 to 7 2 in winter respectively the higher δ13cdic values were observed in the middle reaches in summer whereas in winter the δ13cdic values increased along the river the δ13cdoc values varied from 29 6 to 23 4 with a higher average in summer 25 8 1 5 and a lower average in winter 26 9 1 7 spatially the δ13cdoc values in the lijiang river generally decreased along the river with slight fluctuating at downstream in both seasons the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values exhibited significantly seasonal variations p 0 01 showing higher values in winter and lower values in summer in the lijiang river fig 1 also the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values exhibited significant spatial variations p 0 01 in the lijiang river fig 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were higher in the middle reaches than that in the upper and lower reaches in summer while in winter these values increased along the river 4 3 diurnal variations in hydrochemistry and δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the water at site m6 of the lijiang river as shown in fig 2 pronounced cyclic diel variations in hydrochemistry and isotopes of water were observed in the middle reaches site m6 of the lijiang river two significant differences of variational patterns with different amplitudes for the river water could be found on the diurnal timescale of which water temperature ph do doc δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 increased during the day and decreased at night while pco2 dic and no3 had the opposite trend water temperature varied from 17 66 to 21 49 c mean 19 62 c with the highest temperature occurring in the afternoon 15 00 16 00 and the lowest temperature at dawn 05 00 06 00 ph varied from 9 08 during the day to 7 06 at night which was consistent with do variations 5 77 mg l at night to 25 17 mg l at daytime the maximum values corresponding to both of these parameters occurred in the early afternoon 14 00 16 00 the curves of ph and do flattened in the evening and remained constant until the next morning the peak values were maintained for 2 3 h pco2 dic and no3 showed synchronous but opposite diel patterns with respect to ph and do with their lowest values occurring in the afternoon and highest values at night and in the early morning fig 2 the values of these parameters increased from low values in the evening to peak values at sunrise the maxima of pco2 dic and no3 viz 2500 3000 ppmv 20 23 mg l and 8 82 9 21 mg l respectively occurred at 04 00 06 00 while their respective minima of 47 98 ppmv 14 15 mg l and 6 34 6 89 mg l occurred at around 14 00 16 00 the mean doc concentration was 3 63 mg l with a diel range of 3 26 just prior to sunrise to 3 98 in the afternoon mg l the δ13cdic values showed diel variations with a minimum of 9 4 at 04 00 06 00 and a maximum of 8 1 at 14 00 16 00 fig 2 the δ13cdic maxima corresponded to no3 dic and pco2 minima while the δ13cdic minima corresponded to ph do water temperature and doc minima the δ15n no3 values varied from 3 8 to 5 7 with a mean of 4 7 and δ18o no3 values varied from 6 1 to 8 4 with a mean of 7 2 meanwhile both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values displayed minima values at nighttime and maxima values at afternoon during a day 5 discussion 5 1 source apportionment of doc in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river as shown in fig 3 the proportional contributions of doc from three potential sources exhibited seasonal and spatial variations in the lijiang river in summer doc of the water in the lijiang river was primarily derived from the soil organic matter about 50 and then from phytoplankton around 27 and macrophytes around 23 in winter doc of the water in the lijiang river was primarily derived from the phytoplankton about 37 and macrophytes around 35 and then from soil organic matter about 28 these results indicate that autochthonous organic sources act as the dominant inputs in both seasons in the lijiang river fig 3 this is similar to the result of waterson and canuel 2008 their study showed that the contribution of autochthonous oc was about 62 in the mississippi river soil organic matter input increased by 12 in summer compared with that in winter which might be attributed to more flushing of soil organic matter from hill slopes to rivers under the intense rainfall conditions li et al 2019 the contributions of phytoplankton and macrophytes sources were approximately 10 higher in winter than that in summer moreover the doc don ratios in the lijiang river were higher in summer than that in winter suggesting that the ratios of autochthonous allochthonous doc were different in both seasons due to higher c n ratios of terrestrial plants and lower c n ratios of phytoplankton in winter the riverine primary production plays an important role because of longer residence time and improved light intensity for river water under lower flow discharge both of which favor aquatic photosynthesis cao et al 2003 sun et al 2015 in summer the aquatic photosynthesis is restricted by shorter residence time weaker incident light and higher turbidity of river water huang et al 2004 sun et al 2015 insignificant differences in the contribution of macrophytes between the upper and the mid lower reaches in both seasons suggest that the doc derived from macrophytes is a stable autochthonous source of doc for the water along the lijiang river meanwhile the contribution of phytoplankton in the mid lower reaches was higher than that in the upper reaches in both seasons suggesting that the doc derived from phytoplankton is an increasing autochthonous source of doc for the water along the lijiang river the contribution of soil organic matter showed an opposite spatial change to that of the phytoplankton the doc don ratios of the water in the lijiang river showed a downstream decreasing trend in both seasons which also indicates a downstream increase of autochthonous fraction in the riverine doc sun et al 2015 higher autochthonous doc contribution derived from phytoplankton and lower contribution from soil organic matter in the mid lower reaches related to the high concentrations of dic and no3 and slow river flow in the mid lower reaches suggesting that higher dic and no3 concentrations could promote the growth of phytoplankton in karst aquatic systems wang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 and a condition of slow flow is also favorable for in situ phytoplankton production sun et al 2015 according to eq 3 the autochthonous doc concentrations derived from phytoplankton and macrophytes varied from 1 09 to 2 43 and 1 70 to 3 44 mg l in summer and winter respectively as shown in fig 4 there were positive correlations between autochthonous doc and dic no3 δ13cdic and δ15n no3 in both seasons fig 4 indicating that dic and no3 variations could be closely related to the formation of autochthonous doc in the lijiang river this is supported by the positive correlation of dic and no3 fig 5 moreover it is worth noting that these correlations were consistently weaker in summer due to weaker aquatic photosynthesis thus we could conclude that the transformation of dic and no3 and the formation of autochthonous doc are coupled in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river however high resolution monitoring is required for a better understanding of the coupled dic and no3 cycling and the formation of autochthonous doc 5 2 coupled dic and no3 cycling controls the formation of autochthonous doc in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river 5 2 1 evidence from hydrogeochemistry as shown in table 2 as expected there was an apparent positive relationship r2 0 48 between water temperature and do table 2 and do exhibited an inverse relationship with pco2 r2 0 52 and dic r2 0 81 over a given diel cycle at site m6 of the lijiang river however there was a positive correlation between doc and do of the river water during the diurnal monitoring period these suggest that in stream metabolism rather than air temperature and degassing controls the daily variations of dic concentrations heffernan and cohen 2010 and cohen et al 2012 have found that denitrification can decrease no3 concentrations due to the consumption of o2 and the production of co2 at night however the increased no3 concentrations at night and negative correlation between no3 and do r2 0 41 table 2 suggest that the denitrification is not the main factor controlling the concentrations of no3 in the lijiang river as shown in table 2 dic and no3 were negatively correlated with doc and do respectively but exhibited positive correlations with pco2 indicating that the diurnal variations in dic no3 and doc can be attributed primarily to the metabolic activities of subaquatic communities in the lijiang river according to the calculation the total dic loss due to subaquatic communities during the diurnal period was estimated to be 320 165 mol accounting for 70 of the total dic loss implying that the dic consumption by subaquatic communities was 160 082 mol day fig 6 the total no3 consumption due to the metabolism of subaquatic communities during the monitoring period was 36 276 mol i e 18 138 mol day fig 6 furthermore during photosynthesis dic and no3 were consumed in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol fig 6 which lies between the c n ratios of aquatic plants mean 11 and phytoplankton mean 6 4 this ratio fits well with the doc don ratios of the water in the lijiang river ranging from 8 29 to 11 47 as shown in fig 7 dic and no3 will be consumed by the metabolism of subaquatic communities resulting in an increase in doc concentrations in the river water if nep is positive gpp er dic and no3 will be produced if nep is negative gpp er resulting in a decline in doc concentrations in the river water during the diurnal monitoring period assimilation was estimated to be 6 2 and 7 1 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively the proportions of dic and no3 utilized on the diurnal scale were comparable with the values estimated on the interannual scale assimilation of dic and no3 were estimated to be 6 1 and 7 4 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively however there were seasonal differences in the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the lijiang river which are higher in the dry season 7 3 and 7 9 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively than those in the wet season 5 2 and 6 4 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively this is resulted from different residence time turbidity and light of river water in both seasons the longer residence time lower turbidity and improved light for river water in winter could promote the aquatic photosynthesis cao et al 2003 sun et al 2015 while the shorter residence time higher turbidity and weaker light caused by high precipitation in summer could restrict the aquatic photosynthesis huang et al 2004 sun et al 2015 5 2 2 evidence from isotopes δ13cdic can be affected by the combined effects of gas exchange with the atmosphere metabolism of subaquatic communities and carbonate mineral dissolution and precipitation in karst aquatic systems de montety et al 2011 jiang et al 2013 such processes controlling dic cycling may thus be reflected in diel variations in the δ13cdic of river water de montety et al 2011 the isotopic compositions of no3 are governed by isotopic fractionation during biogeochemical processes such as assimilation nitrification and denitrification the nitrification is a multi step process of oxidizing organic nitrogen to no3 xu et al 2016 in theory δ18o values of no3 produced by microbial nitrification would have approximately one third of the oxygen derived from oxygen in the air δ18o o2 while two thirds should be derived from ambient water oxygen δ18o h2o andersson and hooper 1983 the δ18o value of oxygen in the air is about 23 9 barkan and luz 2005 and the δ18o h2o values ranged from 5 6 to 5 0 fig s4 in the lijiang river therefore the calculated δ18o no3 values produced from the nitrification ranged from 4 3 to 4 7 in the water of the lijiang river however as stated in previous section the δ18o no3 values varied from 6 1 to 8 4 in the water of the lijiang river which were higher than the theoretical δ18o no3 values these shifts of the measured values from the calculated δ18o no3 values in the water of lijiang river could be resulted from other biological processes mayer et al 2001 δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were positively correlated with do and doc and negatively correlated with dic and no3 respectively table 2 moreover in isotopic coupling the slope of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 curve was calculated to be 0 98 fig s5 the linear relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 can also provide an evidence for the denitrification lee et al 2008 xue et al 2009 i e the slope of δ18o no3 relative to δ15n no3 ranges from 0 48 to 0 76 however the slope of the line relating δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was not in this range while the do concentrations ranged from 5 77 to 25 17 mg l as revealed by some studies the removal of no3 via the denitrification is insignificant for well oxygenated rivers ribot et al 2017 soto et al 2018 these results suggest that the denitrification is insignificant in the lijiang river meanwhile the amounts of no3 produced and doc consumed by the nitrification process could be very small because the values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were dominantly affected by the aquatic photosynthesis thus we can also conclude that the metabolism of subaquatic communities controls the dic and no3 transformations in the lijiang river as well as the doc concentrations as shown in fig 8 the δ13cdic was enriched by 7 9 3 9 day during photosynthesis and depleted by 2 2 1 1 day during respiration of which 4 0 and 3 9 of δ13cdic were enriched by phytoplankton and macrophytes respectively while 1 2 and 1 0 of δ13cdic were depleted by phytoplankton and macrophytes respectively calcite carbonate precipitation and dissolution and co2 outgassing showed negligible effects on the δ13cdic transformation the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by 10 6 5 3 day and 11 2 5 6 day during photosynthesis and depleted by 0 8 0 4 day and 0 9 0 5 day during respiration respectively these results confirmed that the dic and no3 transformations in the water of the lijiang river were primarily controlled by the metabolism of subaquatic communities 5 3 contributions of the coupled cn cycling to the c and n sinks in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river our results demonstrate that the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 leads to the variations in doc concentrations via the metabolism of subaquatic communities in the lijiang river annually about 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic eq 4 and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 eq 5 were converted into organic matter by the aquatic photosynthesis in the lijiang river with 80 and 79 of the dic and no3 consumption produced in the wet season respectively the higher dic and no3 concentrations in karst aquatic systems could fuel the growth of subaquatic communities which in turn could enhance the uptake of dic and no3 and result in the doc accumulation in the river water this implies that the coupling cycle of dic and no3 can promote the formation of autochthonous doc and thus produce significant net c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems 6 conclusions in this study seasonal and diurnal monitoring data of dic doc and no3 concentrations δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and other hydrochemical parameters of the water were used to quantify the consumption of dic and no3 and the doc formation in the coupled cn cycling in the lijiang river a typical karst aquatic system in southwest china the results of the siar model indicated that 50 and 72 of the total doc formed in summer and winter respectively corresponded to autochthonous oc formed in the coupled cn cycling in addition the contribution of autochthonous oc in the mid lower reaches was higher than that in the upper reaches the results of diurnal monitoring indicated that the dic and no3 transformations in the water of the lijiang river were mainly controlled by the metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of subaquatic communities accompanied by doc generation the dic and no3 were consumed during aquatic photosynthesis in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol to produce autochthonous doc at the same time δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by 7 9 10 6 and 11 2 daily respectively during the aquatic photosynthesis on the diurnal scale 6 2 of the total dic and 7 1 of the total no3 were consumed by metabolic processes these values were comparable with the corresponding values on the interannual scale of the lijiang river however the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 were converted by the aquatic photosynthesis into organic matter in the coupled cn cycling most of the dic and no3 consumption produced in the wet season finally our study illustrates that the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 promotes the formation of autochthonous doc and produces significant net c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems credit authorship contribution statement haijuan zhao

4994,the cycling of carbon c and nitrogen n in karst aquatic systems has been shown to be closely related with coupled control of dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations through the metabolic pathways of subaquatic communities however the coupled cn cycling involving in the transformation of dissolved inorganic carbon dic into doc has not been well explored in this study we chose the lijiang river a typical karst aquatic system in southwest china as our study area and documented its diurnal and seasonal variations in terms of several hydrochemical and isotopic parameters to identify how to couple cycling for c and n the results of the bayesian stable isotope mixing model showed that approximately 50 and 72 of the total doc formed in summer and winter respectively represented autochthonous organic carbon in the lijiang river diurnal monitoring results revealed that dic and no3 transformations were primarily controlled by metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of subaquatic communities accompanying doc formation in the lijiang river the consumption of dic and no3 by aquatic photosynthesis was in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol to produce autochthonous doc accompanying the enriched δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 with a daily variation of 7 9 10 6 and 11 2 respectively on the diurnal scale 6 2 of the total dic and 7 1 of the total no3 were consumed by metabolic processes of subaquatic communities and these values were consistent with their corresponding values on the interannual scale however the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season approximately 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 were converted into organic matter by the aquatic photosynthesis with 80 and 79 of the total dic and no3 consumption respectively occurring in the wet season furthermore the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 can promote the production of autochthonous doc constituting a relatively long term natural c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems keywords coupled carbon nitrogen cycling dissolved inorganic carbon nitrate dissolved organic carbon karst aquatic system lijiang river 1 introduction imbalances in global carbon c and nitrogen n budgets have become important environmental issues because of their inherent connection with contemporary climate change melnikov and o neill 2006 schlesinger 2009 zeng et al 2019 c and n loading of aquatic systems is increasing worldwide due to intense human activities during the past decades peterson et al 2001 seitzinger et al 2005 xuan et al 2019 in the 20th century alone human activities have increased the delivery of n to rivers and streams from 34 to 64 tg n yr beusen et al 2015 of all n species nitrate no3 is the most dominant component beusen et al 2015 the no3 contamination of water is possibly the most widespread environmental problem in the world kendall et al 2008 xue et al 2009 especially in karst water karstic aquifers are particularly sensitive and fragile to chemical contamination from anthropogenic activities due to their developed conduit networks and sinkholes jiang 2013 a growing number of studies have found that the n from human activities has caused the coupled cn cycling to be involved in the process of carbonate weathering leading to an increased dissolved inorganic carbon dic flux in karst aquatic systems jiang 2013 raymond et al 2008 zhao et al 2020a the higher dic half of which originates from soil atm from carbonate weathering and increased no3 from human activities could fuel the growth of aquatic communities which in turn could enhance the uptake of dic and no3 liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2019 thus the cycling of c and n in karst aquatic systems is closely related with a coupled control of organic carbon oc concentrations via assimilation process gruber and galloway 2008 seitzinger et al 2007 trimmer et al 2012 zeng et al 2019 however little is known about the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems in the coupled cn cycling process aquatic photosynthesis can consume dic and no3 implying that dic can be preserved in a relatively stable form by converting dic into oc while water quality can be enhanced by consuming no3 liu et al 2018 nõges et al 2016 pedersen et al 2013 furthermore the coupled cn cycling could cause carbonate precipitation in karst aquatic systems in this process dic and no3 are transformed into organic matter and o2 is released which is in contrast with the traditional viewpoint of co2 release during carbonate precipitation jiang et al 2013 the oc can be divided into particulate organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc in aquatic systems and the latter accounts for 60 of the total oc spitzy and ittekkot 1991 moreover the doc is a key source of energy for driving functioning of the aquatic systems wen et al 2020 hence it is important to obtain more insights into the coupled cn cycling and the transformation of dic into doc in karst aquatic systems which will shed more light on the stability of carbon sink associated with carbonate weathering and the improvement of water quality in these systems dic evolution in karst aquatic systems includes co2 outgassing and doc transformation accompanied by the precipitation or dissolution of calcium carbonate jiang et al 2020 no3 evolution in aquatic systems includes n uptake by photosynthesis of subaquatic communities organic nitrogen decomposition by respiration and transformation of no3 into n2 by denitrification kendall et al 2008 thus the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems involves the recognition of these processes the respiration of subaquatic communities produces δ13c depleted co2 with a δ13c value close to that of organic matter whereas photosynthetic uptake of dic preferentially removes 12c leading to an enrichment of 13c in the remaining dic in water sun et al 2015 yang et al 1996 moreover the elevated δ13cdic by photosynthesis can be enhanced by co2 outgassing due to preferential loss of 12c relative to 13c jiang et al 2013 telmer and veizer 1999 the denitrification of bacteria and photosynthesis of subaquatic communities generally preferentially uses lighter isotopes which would lead to the enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining no3 the denitrification results in δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining no3 increasing with a relationship of 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 lee et al 2008 xue et al 2009 whereas the assimilation of no3 during photosynthesis results in δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining no3 increasing with a relationship of 1 1 granger et al 2004 meanwhile autochthonous doc produced by aquatic photosynthesis has significant differences in the δ13c and c n values with allochthonous doc generally the δ13c and c n values for phytoplankton pp and macrophytes mp are 42 to 24 and 5 to 8 kendall et al 2001 and 28 to 18 and 10 to 30 kendall et al 2001 respectively whereas the δ13c and c n values for soil organic matter som c3 plants and c4 plants are 25 to 22 and 10 to13 goñi et al 2003 32 to 22 and 15 kendall et al 2001 and 16 to 9 and 15 to 50 kendall et al 2001 respectively therefore hydrochemical parameters e g ca2 dic no3 do doc poc and c n and isotopes e g δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are powerful tools to study the coupled cn cycling and the transformation of dic into doc in karst aquatic systems in this study a typical karst aquatic system the lijiang river in southwest china was chosen as the study area and seasonal and diurnal variations in c and n were investigated the hydrogeochemical and isotopic data dic no3 nh4 don doc poc do δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed to better understand the coupled cn cycling in karst aquatic systems thus the new aspect addressed here is to identify how to couple cycling for c and n in the typical karst aquatic system 2 study area the study was conducted in the lijiang river which is located in the northeast of guangxi province the center of the well known karst regions of southwest china the river basin is situated between the coordinates of 24 16 26 21 n and 109 45 111 02 e with a drainage area of 5039 7 km2 and a length of 164 km in a region of mid subtropical monsoon climate fig s1 this area is strongly affected by east asian monsoon and south asian monsoon with 80 of annual precipitation occurring between march and august the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 19 c and 2000 mm respectively the vegetation in the drainage basin is characterized by tropical evergreen forests dominated by subtropical coniferous forest broadleaf forest bamboo forest and grassland the aquatic vegetation in the lijiang river is characterized by submerged c3 macrophytes dominated by vallisneria spiralis ceratophyllum demersum and hydrilla verticillate phytoplankton in the lijiang river mainly includes chlorophyta bacillariophyta and cyanophyta the lithology of the upper part of the catchment is chiefly silurian granites ordovician cambrian shales and mud rocks intercalated with carbonate rocks zhao et al 2020a in contrast the lithology of the mid lower parts is dominated by devonian carbonate rocks zhao et al 2020a thus karst landscape is well developed in the mid lower reaches of the lijiang river 3 methods 3 1 sampling

selected along the lijiang river fig s1 to capture the influence of storm water runoff and discharge in the river two sampling campaigns were conducted in the wet season august 2017 and in the dry season december 2017 in addition monthly monitoring of hydrochemistry was performed at site m8 during january december 2017 all water samples were filtered through glass fiber filters precombusted gf f filters 0 7 μm pore size into polyethylene bottles poc samples were extracted by filtering river water through the baked 0 7 um glass fiber filters samples of the potential doc sources were also collected including ten samples of representative aquatic plant samples hydrilla verticillate vallisineria spiralis ceratophyllum demersum and spirogyra and five phytoplankton samples from the lijiang river we collected phytoplankton using 1 m vertical tows through the water column using a 64 μm plankton net and used the protocol developed by hamilton et al 2005 to partition fine particulate matter into predominantly phytoplankton and detrital components by centrifugation in colloidal silica ludox tm 50 density 1 40 g cm3 in addition six soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 30 cm under the corresponding dominant plants castanopsis fargesii loropetalum chinense pinus massoniana pinus elliottii eucalypt and bamboo soil samples were dried in the oven at 45 c for two days then ground to pass a sieve mesh 200 plant samples were rinsed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 50 c for two days after drying the plant samples were ground into a powder form with diameters 150 μm to ensure homogeneity all samples were stored at a temperature 4 c in the laboratory before measurement water temperature t ph and do were measured on site using a portable water quality analyzer ysi

so4 2 were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes resolution of 0 01 mg l and ion chromatography ic resolution of 0 01 mg l respectively ammonium nh4 concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the berthelot reaction with a detection limit of 0 02 mg l doc and dissolved nitrogen dn concentrations were analyzed on an analytik jena n c multi3100 instrument with resolution of 0 01 mg l dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations were calculated using the difference between dn and no3 concentrations poc concentrations were determined using an elemental analyzer vario isotope cube isoprime elementar company with resolution of 0 01 mg l δ13cdoc values were determined using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer iso toc cube isoprime 100 elementar company while δ13cdic values were analyzed using a gasbench ii irms system thermo fisher scientific usa for soil and plant samples the elemental analyzer vario isotope cube isoprime elementar company was used to determine the stable c isotope compositions and c n ratios all c n values reported were atomic at ratios the results of δ13c analysis were reported relative to the v pdb standard and the overall experimental accuracy for δ13c measurements was 0 2 the δ18o h2o values were determined with a liquid water stable isotope analyzer lwia 24 d los gatos research usa δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were measured using an elemental analyzer interfaced with a mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa the results of δ15n were reported relative to n2 in the atmosphere and δ18o were reported to the vienna standard mean ocean water the analytical error was typically 0 2 for δ15n no3 0 3 for δ18o no3 and 0 2 for δ18o h2o the pco2 of water were calculated based on hydrochemical data including water temperature ph and concentrations of seven major ions k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 by using the modified program watspec wigley 1977 eq 1 1 p co 2 hco 3 h k h k 1 where kh and k1 represent the temperature dependent henry s law constant for co2 and dissociation constant for h2co3 in water respectively 3 1 2 diurnal sampling and analysis a 48 h sampling campaign was conducted during sunny days from october 30 to november 1 2017 at 2 h intervals to evaluate the existence and magnitude of in river diel variations at site m6 fig s2 in the middle reaches of the lijiang river in which there are a large number of aquatic plants including hydrilla verticillate vallisineria spiralis and spirogyra the water temperature ph and do at this site were measured in situ at 15 min intervals using the multi parameter meter ysi 6920 usa resolutions of t ph and do were 0 01 c 0 1 ph units and 0 01 mg l respectively discrete river water samples dic no3 doc δ13cdic δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o were collected every two hours from october 30 through november 1 2017 all water samples collection and analysis were completely consistent with the above described procedure 3 2 seasonal data calculations and statistical analysis 3 2 1 quantification of the contributions of doc sources in the lijiang river to quantify the contributions of different doc sources in the lijiang river the bayesian stable isotope mixing model was used this model has been implemented using a siar stable isotope analysis in r software package and can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2010 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of water sample i pk is the proportional contribution of source k which is estimated using the bayesian model sjk is the source value k of isotope j cjk is the fractionation factor of isotope j on source k and εij is the residual error representing additional unquantified variations between individual samples to estimate the proportional contribution of doc sources only one isotope j 1 δ13c and three major potential doc sources soil organic matter phytoplankton and macrophytes were considered in this study 11 samples of plant leaves and stems collected in the lijiang river basin had c n ratios from 24 7 to 107 7 table s1 which were significantly different from the doc don ratios of the river water as mentioned in section 4 2 and other potential doc sources as mentioned in section 4 1 therefore terrestrial plants were not considered as the potential doc sources in this study the values of three major potential doc sources were 23 1 1 7 25 0 1 5 and 30 5 2 1 for som mp and pp respectively as mentioned in section 4 1 for δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp we used the δ13c of mp and pp biomass as we did not have direct measurement of the δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp we acknowledge that this is only a first order approximation of the δ13c values of doc leachates from mp and pp in this study and look forward to further refining this model endpoint when better data become available the corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors are out of the scope of this study thus we assumed cjk 0 in eq 2 3 2 2 estimation of autochthonous doc concentrations in the lijiang river autochthonous doc concentrations cadoc were estimated using eq 3 3 c adoc c doc a m where am based on the discussion in section 5 1 representing the contribution of autochthonous doc is the sum of the contributions of macrophytes and phytoplankton to doc cdoc is the concentration of doc 3 2 3 estimation of annual dic and no3 loss during metabolism of subaquatic communities the annual dic f adic kg c yr and no3 f ano3 kg n yr loss by metabolism of subaquatic communities were calculated using the monthly doc concentration cdoc the contributions of macrophytes amp and phytoplankton app and the monthly average discharge qm at the mouth of the lijiang river and the c n ratios of macrophytes rmp and phytoplankton rpp as follows 4 f adic m c doc 12 a mp a pp q m 12 5 f ano 3 m c doc 12 a mp r mp a pp r pp q m 14 where f adic and f ano3 are given by the sum of monthly losses of dic and no3 due to metabolism of subaquatic communities in one hydrological year qm is the monthly average discharge at the river mouth table s2 where m 1 2 3 12 cdoc denotes the monthly doc concentration at the river mouth table s2 amp and app are the contributions of macrophytes and phytoplankton to doc respectively amp and app were set as 23 and 27 during the wet season march to august respectively and as 35 and 37 during the dry season september to february respectively these values were obtained based on the discussion in section 5 1 rmp mean 11 and rpp mean 6 4 represent the c n ratios of macrophytes and phytoplankton respectively as mentioned in section 4 1 however this approach of estimation of annual dic and no3 loss during metabolism of subaquatic communities did not consider that i both doc and poc are produced by the photosynthetic use of dic by subaquatic communities ii only a fraction of dic is converted into doc and most of it is incorporated into biomass 3 3 diurnal data processing and analysis 3 3 1 determining dic losses by co2 evasion carbon dioxide fluxes across the water air interface can be calculated using a molecular diffusion model raymond et al 2012 6 fa k p co 2 water p co 2 air where fa is the co2 evasion flux mg m2 h between water and air k is the gas transfer velocity cm h and pco2water pco2air is the co2 concentration gradient between water and air ppmv atmospheric co2 concentration was found to be 445 ppmv at a location 1 5 m above the stream surface pu et al 2016 we calculated k using the temperature dependent schmidt number sct for fresh water raymond et al 2012 3 3 2 determining changes in dic concentrations due to calcite precipitation or dissolution as described by jiang et al 2020 carbonate precipitation reduces ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol mol and simultaneously releases 1 mol of co2 aq into solution and conversely carbonate dissolution increases ca2 and hco3 concentrations by a ratio of 1 2 mol mol and removes 1 mol of co2 aq from the solution thus the dic loss by calcite precipitation or gain by calcite dissolution were calculated from the changes in ca2 concentrations and the molar ratio of ca2 and hco3 3 3 3 determining changes in dic concentrations due to metabolism of subaquatic communities biologically generated dic was quantified using the gross primary productivity gpp and respiration rates er with respect to do concentrations the net

the monitoring point m6 is mainly supplied by surface water the concentration of completely 100 saturated do mg l at a given water temperature was calculated as described elsewhere rice and association 2012 the dic affected by the metabolism of subaquatic communities can be estimated based on the dic o2 molar stoichiometry 1 1 del giorgio and williams 2015 3 3 4 estimation of magnitudes of δ13cdic variations the contributions of different processes to variations in δ13cdic were calculated using a time stepping chemical isotope 12c and 13c mass balance model jiang et al 2020 tobias and bohlke 2011 based on the dic loss gain the model requires i the initial δ13c values of the dic from the lijiang river 9 4 the minimum value of δ13cdic before sunrise pp 30 5 mp 25 0 and atmospheric co2 9 9 obtaining from jiang et al 2020 and ii fractionation factors 0 9989 and 1 002 at 20 c for air water exchange for co2 aq co2 gas equilibrium and gas dissolution respectively tobias and bohlke 2011 1 0007 for carbonate precipitation hco3 caco3 tobias and bohlke 2011 0 9830 and 1 0000 assuming no fractionation during the respiration of oc to co2 for photosynthesis and respiration by both pp and mp respectively mook 2006 previous studies have found that the aqueous dic species came to chemical and isotopic equilibrium within each time step caco3 precipitated in isotopic equilibrium with dic and transfer of co2 between air and water had a small kinetic fractionation associated with diffusion near the interface tobias and bohlke 2011 zhang et al 1995 a detailed description of this model can be found in tobias and bohlke 2011 and jiang et al 2020 3 3 5 determining changes in no3 concentrations due to metabolism in subaquatic communities no3 loss f no3 mol due to metabolism of subaquatic communities can be calculated using eq 8 8 f no 3 no 3 max 0 no 3 t 62 q where no3 max 0 8 68 mg l is the maximum concentration of no3 before sunrise no3 t is the concentration of no3 at time t and q is discharge at site m6 3 3 6 estimation of magnitudes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 variations the changes in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values during the assimilation process can be described with a rayleigh distillation model mariotti et al 1981 this process is expressed by 9 δ t δ 0 ε ln no 3 t no 3 0 where δt is the δ15n or δ18o value of the residual no3 at time t δ0 is the initial δ15n or δ18o value of the no3 and ε is the enrichment factor no3 t and no3 0 represent the no3 concentrations of residual no3 and initial no3 during the assimilation respectively δ0 and no3 0 were assigned to be the minimum δ15n no3 value 3 9 and the maximum no3 concentration 8 68 mg l before sunrise at m6 respectively the enrichment factors for δ15n 7 67 and δ18o 7 55 were obtained from fig s3 4 results 4 1 δ13c and c n of macrophytes phytoplankton and soil organic matter as shown in table 1 compared to the soil organic matter macrophytes and phytoplankton in the lijiang river showed depleted δ13c values and lower c n values the δ13c and c n values of macrophytes and phytoplankton ranged from 27 5 to 23 2 with an average value of 25 0 1 5 and 9 8 to 12 7 with an average value of 11 0 1 0 and 33 9 to 28 8 with an average value of 30 5 2 1 and 5 3 to 7 6 with a mean value of 6 4 0 9 respectively in contrast the δ13c and c n values of the soil organic matter varied from 25 2 to 21 2 and 12 5 to 13 7 with a mean value of 23 1 1 7 and 13 2 0 4 respectively 4 2 seasonal and spatial variations of hydrogeochemical parameters and isotopes of the water in the lijiang river during the seasonal sampling periods the nh4 concentrations of the river water at most sampling sites were lower than the detection limit 0 02 mg l and the detectable nh4 concentrations accounted for 5 of the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen din there were insignificant seasonal variations p 0 05 in no3 concentrations of the water samples collected from the main river and tributaries ranging from 1 10 to 12 20 and 2 52 to 15 72 mg l in summer and winter respectively however obvious spatial variations of no3 concentrations p 0 01 were observed increasing significantly from the upper to the lower reaches in both seasons fig 1 especially in summer the dic concentrations varied from 3 6 to 42 0 mg l with a mean value of 20 6 mg l and showed significant seasonal variations with higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations in summer p 0 01 which is possibly affected by both rainwater dilution and water rock interactions zhao et al 2020b during summer the dissolution of carbonate rocks is accelerated due to the high temperature high humidity and strong hydrodynamic conditions however the abundant rainfall also causes strong dilution of dic during summer river discharge was higher during summer in comparison to winter in all stations the increase was between 700 and 1000 higher in summer in most stations table s3 compared with the several orders of magnitude variations of river discharge changes the seasonal variations of rock weathering rate are insignificant therefore the river discharge plays a dominant role in the variations of riverine ionic concentrations zhao et al 2020b although the river discharge increased by 159 and 228 going downstream in summer and winter respectively and 78 and 130 of which were from tributaries the dic concentrations increased gradually from the upper reaches to the lower reaches this variation is related to the spatial distribution of carbonate rocks in the lijiang river basin fig s1 the poc concentrations ranged from 0 09 to 0 75 mg l table s4 on average poc concentrations only accounted for 15 and 7 of oc in summer and winter respectively suggesting that doc is the main constituent of oc in the lijiang river although the doc concentrations did not show different seasonal variations p 0 05 significant spatial variations p 0 05 of the doc concentrations could be found increasing significantly from the upper to the mid lower reaches in the lijiang river the downstream increase in doc concentrations may be related to the dic fertilization yang et al 2016 the higher dic concentrations in the mid lower reaches can promote the aquatic photosynthesis the overall don concentrations varied from 0 19 to 0 56 mg l with a lower average in summer 0 31 0 07 mg l than in winter 0 41 0 10 mg l and spatially the don concentrations exhibited a similar variation to the doc in the lijiang river the doc don ratios in the lijiang river ranged from 8 29 to 11 47 with a higher average value in summer 10 48 0 59 than in winter 9 35 0 78 and decreased in a fluctuating manner along the river in both seasons fig 1 the δ13cdic values showed significant seasonal p 0 01 and spatial variations p 0 01 in the lijiang river fig 1 the δ13cdic values in summer were obviously lighter than that in winter ranging from 11 8 to 9 0 in summer and 10 3 to 7 2 in winter respectively the higher δ13cdic values were observed in the middle reaches in summer whereas in winter the δ13cdic values increased along the river the δ13cdoc values varied from 29 6 to 23 4 with a higher average in summer 25 8 1 5 and a lower average in winter 26 9 1 7 spatially the δ13cdoc values in the lijiang river generally decreased along the river with slight fluctuating at downstream in both seasons the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values exhibited significantly seasonal variations p 0 01 showing higher values in winter and lower values in summer in the lijiang river fig 1 also the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values exhibited significant spatial variations p 0 01 in the lijiang river fig 1 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were higher in the middle reaches than that in the upper and lower reaches in summer while in winter these values increased along the river 4 3 diurnal variations in hydrochemistry and δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 of the water at site m6 of the lijiang river as shown in fig 2 pronounced cyclic diel variations in hydrochemistry and isotopes of water were observed in the middle reaches site m6 of the lijiang river two significant differences of variational patterns with different amplitudes for the river water could be found on the diurnal timescale of which water temperature ph do doc δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 increased during the day and decreased at night while pco2 dic and no3 had the opposite trend water temperature varied from 17 66 to 21 49 c mean 19 62 c with the highest temperature occurring in the afternoon 15 00 16 00 and the lowest temperature at dawn 05 00 06 00 ph varied from 9 08 during the day to 7 06 at night which was consistent with do variations 5 77 mg l at night to 25 17 mg l at daytime the maximum values corresponding to both of these parameters occurred in the early afternoon 14 00 16 00 the curves of ph and do flattened in the evening and remained constant until the next morning the peak values were maintained for 2 3 h pco2 dic and no3 showed synchronous but opposite diel patterns with respect to ph and do with their lowest values occurring in the afternoon and highest values at night and in the early morning fig 2 the values of these parameters increased from low values in the evening to peak values at sunrise the maxima of pco2 dic and no3 viz 2500 3000 ppmv 20 23 mg l and 8 82 9 21 mg l respectively occurred at 04 00 06 00 while their respective minima of 47 98 ppmv 14 15 mg l and 6 34 6 89 mg l occurred at around 14 00 16 00 the mean doc concentration was 3 63 mg l with a diel range of 3 26 just prior to sunrise to 3 98 in the afternoon mg l the δ13cdic values showed diel variations with a minimum of 9 4 at 04 00 06 00 and a maximum of 8 1 at 14 00 16 00 fig 2 the δ13cdic maxima corresponded to no3 dic and pco2 minima while the δ13cdic minima corresponded to ph do water temperature and doc minima the δ15n no3 values varied from 3 8 to 5 7 with a mean of 4 7 and δ18o no3 values varied from 6 1 to 8 4 with a mean of 7 2 meanwhile both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values displayed minima values at nighttime and maxima values at afternoon during a day 5 discussion 5 1 source apportionment of doc in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river as shown in fig 3 the proportional contributions of doc from three potential sources exhibited seasonal and spatial variations in the lijiang river in summer doc of the water in the lijiang river was primarily derived from the soil organic matter about 50 and then from phytoplankton around 27 and macrophytes around 23 in winter doc of the water in the lijiang river was primarily derived from the phytoplankton about 37 and macrophytes around 35 and then from soil organic matter about 28 these results indicate that autochthonous organic sources act as the dominant inputs in both seasons in the lijiang river fig 3 this is similar to the result of waterson and canuel 2008 their study showed that the contribution of autochthonous oc was about 62 in the mississippi river soil organic matter input increased by 12 in summer compared with that in winter which might be attributed to more flushing of soil organic matter from hill slopes to rivers under the intense rainfall conditions li et al 2019 the contributions of phytoplankton and macrophytes sources were approximately 10 higher in winter than that in summer moreover the doc don ratios in the lijiang river were higher in summer than that in winter suggesting that the ratios of autochthonous allochthonous doc were different in both seasons due to higher c n ratios of terrestrial plants and lower c n ratios of phytoplankton in winter the riverine primary production plays an important role because of longer residence time and improved light intensity for river water under lower flow discharge both of which favor aquatic photosynthesis cao et al 2003 sun et al 2015 in summer the aquatic photosynthesis is restricted by shorter residence time weaker incident light and higher turbidity of river water huang et al 2004 sun et al 2015 insignificant differences in the contribution of macrophytes between the upper and the mid lower reaches in both seasons suggest that the doc derived from macrophytes is a stable autochthonous source of doc for the water along the lijiang river meanwhile the contribution of phytoplankton in the mid lower reaches was higher than that in the upper reaches in both seasons suggesting that the doc derived from phytoplankton is an increasing autochthonous source of doc for the water along the lijiang river the contribution of soil organic matter showed an opposite spatial change to that of the phytoplankton the doc don ratios of the water in the lijiang river showed a downstream decreasing trend in both seasons which also indicates a downstream increase of autochthonous fraction in the riverine doc sun et al 2015 higher autochthonous doc contribution derived from phytoplankton and lower contribution from soil organic matter in the mid lower reaches related to the high concentrations of dic and no3 and slow river flow in the mid lower reaches suggesting that higher dic and no3 concentrations could promote the growth of phytoplankton in karst aquatic systems wang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 zeng et al 2019 and a condition of slow flow is also favorable for in situ phytoplankton production sun et al 2015 according to eq 3 the autochthonous doc concentrations derived from phytoplankton and macrophytes varied from 1 09 to 2 43 and 1 70 to 3 44 mg l in summer and winter respectively as shown in fig 4 there were positive correlations between autochthonous doc and dic no3 δ13cdic and δ15n no3 in both seasons fig 4 indicating that dic and no3 variations could be closely related to the formation of autochthonous doc in the lijiang river this is supported by the positive correlation of dic and no3 fig 5 moreover it is worth noting that these correlations were consistently weaker in summer due to weaker aquatic photosynthesis thus we could conclude that the transformation of dic and no3 and the formation of autochthonous doc are coupled in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river however high resolution monitoring is required for a better understanding of the coupled dic and no3 cycling and the formation of autochthonous doc 5 2 coupled dic and no3 cycling controls the formation of autochthonous doc in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river 5 2 1 evidence from hydrogeochemistry as shown in table 2 as expected there was an apparent positive relationship r2 0 48 between water temperature and do table 2 and do exhibited an inverse relationship with pco2 r2 0 52 and dic r2 0 81 over a given diel cycle at site m6 of the lijiang river however there was a positive correlation between doc and do of the river water during the diurnal monitoring period these suggest that in stream metabolism rather than air temperature and degassing controls the daily variations of dic concentrations heffernan and cohen 2010 and cohen et al 2012 have found that denitrification can decrease no3 concentrations due to the consumption of o2 and the production of co2 at night however the increased no3 concentrations at night and negative correlation between no3 and do r2 0 41 table 2 suggest that the denitrification is not the main factor controlling the concentrations of no3 in the lijiang river as shown in table 2 dic and no3 were negatively correlated with doc and do respectively but exhibited positive correlations with pco2 indicating that the diurnal variations in dic no3 and doc can be attributed primarily to the metabolic activities of subaquatic communities in the lijiang river according to the calculation the total dic loss due to subaquatic communities during the diurnal period was estimated to be 320 165 mol accounting for 70 of the total dic loss implying that the dic consumption by subaquatic communities was 160 082 mol day fig 6 the total no3 consumption due to the metabolism of subaquatic communities during the monitoring period was 36 276 mol i e 18 138 mol day fig 6 furthermore during photosynthesis dic and no3 were consumed in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol fig 6 which lies between the c n ratios of aquatic plants mean 11 and phytoplankton mean 6 4 this ratio fits well with the doc don ratios of the water in the lijiang river ranging from 8 29 to 11 47 as shown in fig 7 dic and no3 will be consumed by the metabolism of subaquatic communities resulting in an increase in doc concentrations in the river water if nep is positive gpp er dic and no3 will be produced if nep is negative gpp er resulting in a decline in doc concentrations in the river water during the diurnal monitoring period assimilation was estimated to be 6 2 and 7 1 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively the proportions of dic and no3 utilized on the diurnal scale were comparable with the values estimated on the interannual scale assimilation of dic and no3 were estimated to be 6 1 and 7 4 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively however there were seasonal differences in the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the lijiang river which are higher in the dry season 7 3 and 7 9 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively than those in the wet season 5 2 and 6 4 of the total dic and no3 flux respectively this is resulted from different residence time turbidity and light of river water in both seasons the longer residence time lower turbidity and improved light for river water in winter could promote the aquatic photosynthesis cao et al 2003 sun et al 2015 while the shorter residence time higher turbidity and weaker light caused by high precipitation in summer could restrict the aquatic photosynthesis huang et al 2004 sun et al 2015 5 2 2 evidence from isotopes δ13cdic can be affected by the combined effects of gas exchange with the atmosphere metabolism of subaquatic communities and carbonate mineral dissolution and precipitation in karst aquatic systems de montety et al 2011 jiang et al 2013 such processes controlling dic cycling may thus be reflected in diel variations in the δ13cdic of river water de montety et al 2011 the isotopic compositions of no3 are governed by isotopic fractionation during biogeochemical processes such as assimilation nitrification and denitrification the nitrification is a multi step process of oxidizing organic nitrogen to no3 xu et al 2016 in theory δ18o values of no3 produced by microbial nitrification would have approximately one third of the oxygen derived from oxygen in the air δ18o o2 while two thirds should be derived from ambient water oxygen δ18o h2o andersson and hooper 1983 the δ18o value of oxygen in the air is about 23 9 barkan and luz 2005 and the δ18o h2o values ranged from 5 6 to 5 0 fig s4 in the lijiang river therefore the calculated δ18o no3 values produced from the nitrification ranged from 4 3 to 4 7 in the water of the lijiang river however as stated in previous section the δ18o no3 values varied from 6 1 to 8 4 in the water of the lijiang river which were higher than the theoretical δ18o no3 values these shifts of the measured values from the calculated δ18o no3 values in the water of lijiang river could be resulted from other biological processes mayer et al 2001 δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were positively correlated with do and doc and negatively correlated with dic and no3 respectively table 2 moreover in isotopic coupling the slope of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 curve was calculated to be 0 98 fig s5 the linear relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 1 3 1 to 2 1 1 can also provide an evidence for the denitrification lee et al 2008 xue et al 2009 i e the slope of δ18o no3 relative to δ15n no3 ranges from 0 48 to 0 76 however the slope of the line relating δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was not in this range while the do concentrations ranged from 5 77 to 25 17 mg l as revealed by some studies the removal of no3 via the denitrification is insignificant for well oxygenated rivers ribot et al 2017 soto et al 2018 these results suggest that the denitrification is insignificant in the lijiang river meanwhile the amounts of no3 produced and doc consumed by the nitrification process could be very small because the values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were dominantly affected by the aquatic photosynthesis thus we can also conclude that the metabolism of subaquatic communities controls the dic and no3 transformations in the lijiang river as well as the doc concentrations as shown in fig 8 the δ13cdic was enriched by 7 9 3 9 day during photosynthesis and depleted by 2 2 1 1 day during respiration of which 4 0 and 3 9 of δ13cdic were enriched by phytoplankton and macrophytes respectively while 1 2 and 1 0 of δ13cdic were depleted by phytoplankton and macrophytes respectively calcite carbonate precipitation and dissolution and co2 outgassing showed negligible effects on the δ13cdic transformation the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by 10 6 5 3 day and 11 2 5 6 day during photosynthesis and depleted by 0 8 0 4 day and 0 9 0 5 day during respiration respectively these results confirmed that the dic and no3 transformations in the water of the lijiang river were primarily controlled by the metabolism of subaquatic communities 5 3 contributions of the coupled cn cycling to the c and n sinks in the karst aquatic system of the lijiang river our results demonstrate that the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 leads to the variations in doc concentrations via the metabolism of subaquatic communities in the lijiang river annually about 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic eq 4 and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 eq 5 were converted into organic matter by the aquatic photosynthesis in the lijiang river with 80 and 79 of the dic and no3 consumption produced in the wet season respectively the higher dic and no3 concentrations in karst aquatic systems could fuel the growth of subaquatic communities which in turn could enhance the uptake of dic and no3 and result in the doc accumulation in the river water this implies that the coupling cycle of dic and no3 can promote the formation of autochthonous doc and thus produce significant net c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems 6 conclusions in this study seasonal and diurnal monitoring data of dic doc and no3 concentrations δ13cdic δ13cdoc δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and other hydrochemical parameters of the water were used to quantify the consumption of dic and no3 and the doc formation in the coupled cn cycling in the lijiang river a typical karst aquatic system in southwest china the results of the siar model indicated that 50 and 72 of the total doc formed in summer and winter respectively corresponded to autochthonous oc formed in the coupled cn cycling in addition the contribution of autochthonous oc in the mid lower reaches was higher than that in the upper reaches the results of diurnal monitoring indicated that the dic and no3 transformations in the water of the lijiang river were mainly controlled by the metabolic processes photosynthesis and respiration of subaquatic communities accompanied by doc generation the dic and no3 were consumed during aquatic photosynthesis in the ratio of 9 1 mol mol to produce autochthonous doc at the same time δ13cdic δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched by 7 9 10 6 and 11 2 daily respectively during the aquatic photosynthesis on the diurnal scale 6 2 of the total dic and 7 1 of the total no3 were consumed by metabolic processes these values were comparable with the corresponding values on the interannual scale of the lijiang river however the proportions of dic and no3 utilized in the dry season were higher than those in the wet season 1 18 107 kg c yr of dic and 1 64 106 kg n yr of no3 were converted by the aquatic photosynthesis into organic matter in the coupled cn cycling most of the dic and no3 consumption produced in the wet season finally our study illustrates that the coupled cn cycling involving dic and no3 promotes the formation of autochthonous doc and produces significant net c and n sinks in karst aquatic systems credit authorship contribution statement haijuan zhao
