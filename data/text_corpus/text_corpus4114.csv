20570,rudder added thrust fins have gained popularity as an energy saving device esd by virtue of simple design easy installation and its effectiveness the current work seeks to investigate the influence of geometric parameters and mounting orientation on the energy saving effect of rudder attached thrust fins based on numerical analysis open water bare hull resistance and self propulsion simulations were carried out by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse using a computational fluid dynamics cfd code in the case of geometrical parameters hydrofoil camber and fin span were varied the fin orientation was then studied by varying the mounting direction in relation to the angle of attack and the location of pressure and suction sides a validation study carried out showed good agreement between cfd and model tests it was noted that the rudder thrust fin is sensitive to the hydrofoil orientation also with the right hydrofoil orientation the fin performance is optimum at an angle of attack of about 2 this study presents a design guideline for rudder thrust fins to ensure optimum energy gains keywords rudder thrust fins energy saving devices energy saving effect rans equations 1 introduction the recent past has witnessed a rise in the need to find ways of reducing power requirements for ships this has been necessitated by the ever increasing cost of fossil fuels imo regulations and or desire to conserve the environment by reducing emissions to the atmosphere in order to reduce energy requirement for ships a number of measures and methods including energy saving devices esds have been proposed these devices are mounted on the propeller upstream slipstream or downstream in order to enhance the ship hydrodynamic performance devices placed at the propeller upstream are commonly referred to as pre swirl whereas those placed downstream are called post swirl devices it is evident that many energy saving devices have been proposed to further improve ship performance it is therefore necessary to consider a combination of two or more devices carlton carlton 2019 presented the compatibility list for various devices it is noted that the combinations fall in four categories compatible in principle partially compatible those that should be incorporated in the design and non compatible although most of these devices are compatible it is not clear if the energy saving effect is the sum of the individual devices the current work explores the option of energy improvement by parametric considerations during the design of rudder attached thrust fins during the design stage of energy saving devices it is of great significance to understand their working principle and how they interact with the hull and propeller in practice this requires adjustment of a number of parameters and conducting model test experiments for each the cost implication time and skill requirements however restrict the number of model tests carried out as a result the application of viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd during design of esds has become popular sakamoto et al 2019 used cfd to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of pre swirl and post swirl devices song et al 2020 based on unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations uranse investigated the effect of bio fouling on the self propulsion characteristics of full scale kcs ship with the aid of cfd lee et al 2014 presented a new concept of a turbine devised to utilize propeller slip stream energy more studies where esds are investigated based on cfd are presented in literatures huang et al 2007 kim et al 2015 gaggero et al 2017 mizzi et al 2017 nowruzi and najafi 2019 the spiral propeller slip stream forms the incidence flow from which rudder thrust fins generate a lift force a component of the lift acts in the forward direction to produce additional thrust it is believed that the fins can also improve the far wake by minimizing the effects of non uniformity there have been a number of researches on rudder thrust fins based on numerical methods falkenhorst et al 2015 using lifting surfaces and panel methods investigated rudder thrust fins with a special focus on treatment of vortex using a similar method guo and huang 2006 investigated the principle parameters span and chord in their other research huang et al 2007 used cfd to analyze possible ways of improving ship performance as a function of the number of thrust fins and angle of attack the study reveals that the fin can give better results when installed at some angle of attack however there is little information in public domain in relation to the design guidelines for rudder thrust fins this work therefore seeks to establish how the foil parameters and mounting orientation influences the hydrodynamic performance of rudder thrust fins the data reliability is assessed by comparing cfd data with the experimental data from shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri the cfd data was in close agreement with model test data it was noted that the rudder thrust fin is sensitive to the hydrofoil orientation also with the right hydrofoil orientation the fin performance is optimum at an angle of attack of about 2 the study results will hopefully provide more insight on the design parameter consideration during the design of rudder attached fins 2 cfd methodology 2 1 hull propeller rudder parameters the hull propeller and rudder used in the current work are for the 3500dwt bulk carrier the simulations were performed at model scale with λ 29 197 the principle dimensions for ship and propeller are presented in table 1 naca 0012 hydrofoil profile was used for the rudder and the attached rudder thrust fin 2 2 computation domain and boundary conditions the geometries were exported to starccm where computation domains were modeled and grid generated three computation domains were used for the three main simulations open water prediction bare hull resistance prediction and ship self propulsion the computation domain in the rans solver for open water case was represented by two cylindrical blocks the outer cylinder was set as a static background region where a velocity inlet boundary condition was imposed on the upstream boundary pressure outlet condition on the down stream boundary a symmetry plane on the far field and a no slip on the wall condition on the upstream shaft the outlet was set at 5d aft of the rotating region the inlet 3d forward of the rotating region while the symmetry plane at 6d about the propeller rotation axis the inner cylinder was used to specify the rotating motion of the propeller a no slip on the wall boundary condition was set on the propeller blades and hub whereas an in place interface condition was imposed on the surfaces of the cylinder self propulsion simulations were performed without the free surface this was due to paradox in selection of time step where it is required to set the time step such that the ship advances 0 01 dimensional flow time lpp u0 per physical time advancement if the free surface is taken into account on the other hand the time step should be set such that the propeller rotates 10 30 per physical time step if the latter case is considered the computation cost would increase significantly this is because solution convergence for a small time step requires more iterations and more physical time compared to a large time step in order to account for the wave making resistance two computational set ups were used for resistance prediction i without the free surface and ii considering the free surface the difference in resistance from the two set ups was taken as wave making resistance rw assuming the action of the propeller does not influence the free surface waves then the total resistance is the sum of the total drag without free surface and the wave making resistance it should be highlighted that resistance and self propulsion simulations were performed at the design ship draft and design speed and the free surface was modeled using the volume of fraction vof method for resistance and self propulsion simulations the origin was set at the still water surface ship center line and aft perpendicular respective positive directions for x y and z axes are aft to fore starboard to port and keel to deck the computation domain in the rans solver was represented by a rectangular block extending 2l upstream from the ship fore perpendicular 3 5l downstream from the aft perpendicular 3l from the ship c l to the port and starboard sides 3l below the still water line and on the still water surface 1 5l in the positive z direction for resistance case with the free surface as shown in fig 1 a these dimensions are more than those recommended by international towing tank conference ittc ittc 2011 especially for the sides and bottom boundaries where ittc recommends 1 lpp from the plane of symmetry and a bottom boundary of 1lpp from the keel this was done to minimize boundary effect on the solution in the case of resistance prediction half domain was used due to symmetry and in order to reduce the computation cost in the case of self propulsion two regions were used a rotating region around the propeller where the rotating motion is defined and a static background region for the rest of the domain where a stationary motion is applied see fig 1 b the following boundary conditions were adopted for the self propulsion set up the inlet was set as a velocity inlet the outlet as the pressure outlet and the bottom sides and top as symmetry plane tezdogan et al 2015 noted that the selection of boundary conditions from any appropriate combination would not have significant effect if placed far away from the ship hull this is because the flow remains undisturbed by the presence of the boundary 2 3 grid generation the grid generation scheme applied was similar to the one we used in our previous work hai long et al 2016 resistance prediction was performed for two cases taking into consideration the free surface and without the free surface as shown in fig 2 fig 2a puts emphasis on mesh refinement around the hull and on the free surface while fig 2b shows the grid used without the free surface the grid size increased progressively from refined mesh size in the area immediately around the hull rudder propeller free surface as well as the region within the wake produced by the ship this was to ensure that complex flow features were adequately resolved volumetric controls surface controls and feature curves were used to achieve the required mesh densities in these regions various grids obtained through mesh refinement were studied first to ensure reliability of the numerical method the overset mesh also known as overlapping mesh adopted in this work is popular in simulating problems involving moving bodies having complicated motions tezdogan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 closely related to our subject sakamoto et al 2019 applied overset mesh to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of pre swirl and post swirl esds for merchant ships application of overset mesh requires one closed surface solution domain referred herein as the background region and one or more overset regions containing the physical bodies the overset mesh was applied on the cylindrical region around the propeller whereas the background region contains the ship hull rudder rudder bulb and rudder fin it should be noted that the simulation for combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins was conducted for data validation purpose an overset mesh interface was used to couple the static background and the dynamic overset region this was to ensure both regions use the same physics continuum overset interface is advantageous as it eliminates the need to generate conformal cells on either sides of the interface it should be noted that the overset mesh is compatible with either a rigid body motion or a moving reference frame fig 3 shows a typical grid assembly adopted in the current study hole cutting process is also very critical and was keenly observed the overset region was set as region 0 while the static background region was set as region 1 here priority controls hole cutting process where region 0 is treated as a higher priority while region 1 as a lower priority 2 4 numerical model the flow around a ship is governed by the navier stokes equations these equations can be solved directly for a given turbulent flow however the cost implication in terms of time spatial discretization and computer technology limits the possibilities reynolds averaged navier stokes rans formulations are commonly used instead the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be expressed in cartesian tensor form as 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i where p is the mean pressure u i is the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector ρ u i u j is the reynolds stresses ρ is the fluid density and μ is the dynamic viscosity the solver employed in the current work uses finite volume discretization to provide closure to the navier stokes equations in which the predictor corrector approach links the continuity and momentum equations in the current work k ω sst turbulence model was selected this model has been widely used in related researches presented in references sakamoto et al 2019 nowruzi and najafi 2019 zhao et al 2015 bakica et al 2019 jasak et al 2019 rezaeiha et al 2019 since the overset mesh interface consists of cell faces that separate the interpolation cells from the discretization cells interface fluxes contribute only to one cell the non conservative nature of the inter grid interpolation leads to a mass imbalance cd adapco 2017 3 δ m i m i where m i is the mass flux through the interface cell face i this mass imbalance appears as a net mass source in the pressure correction equation and must be eliminated by adjusting the interface fluxes such that the sum in equation 3 is zero this can be achieved by subtracting a part of mass source δ m from each mass flux 4 m c o r r m i β i δ m where the factor β i is proportional to the share of the mass flux m i in the total mass flux through the overset interface m i m i the proportionality factor is given by 5 β i m i m because there is no contribution from the overset interfaces equation 4 ensures that the sum of equation 3 is zero mass conservation condition the continuity equation is satisfied for each cell and a divergence free flow field is obtained 3 rudder thrust fin design method the geometrical design of the rudder thrust fins is proposed in this section the installation position in relation to the rudder is fixed the fin chord line is slightly offset below the propeller shaft axis the center of fin chord 0 5cf coincides with the center of the rudder chord 0 5cr on the surface passing through the shaft axis and normal to the z axis see fig 4 3 1 thrust fin hydrofoil design consideration an illustration of a typical hydrofoil is shown in fig 5 the initial design was based on literature and experience the chord length cf distance between leading and trailing edges ox was taken as 0 3d with a span of 0 6d the maximum thickness t was equivalent to 12 of cf located at 0 3cf from the leading edge naca series hydrofoil was used in the current work where simple geometrical definitions are utilized the design method is based on the right hand screw propeller as illustrated in fig 6 thrust is produced as propeller axial components of lift ll and lu acting on the rudder with additional thrust produced as propeller axial components of lift ls and lp acting on the fin with this in mind it could be presumed that a hydrofoil with a slight camber could possibly have higher ls and lp as opposed to a symmetrical hydrofoil this however is expected to come with an additional drag component and it is not clear if the net effect would be better than that of a symmetrical one also the extent to which the camber no longer gives desirable saving effect is of great importance to study this aspect naca four digit hydrofoils controlled by camber m position of maximum camber p and maximum foil thickness t were selected the hydrofoil profile was determined in accordance with cummings et al 2015 as follows 6 for 0 x p p x 1 y c m p 2 2 p x x 2 y c m 1 p 2 1 2 p 2 p x x 2 d y c d x 2 m p 2 p x d y c d x 2 m 1 p 2 p x where m is the maximum value of the mean line in hundredths of chord length yc is the mean camber line typically split into two parts on either side of the location of maximum camber and d y c d x is the gradient of the camber line the distribution of foil thickness yt above positive and below negative the mean camber line is given as 7 y t t 0 2 0 2969 x 0 126 x 0 3516 x 2 0 2843 x 3 0 1015 x 4 the final coordinates for the upper surface x u y u and lower hydrofoil surface x l y l are calculated using the expressions in equation 8 8 x u x y t sin θ y u y c y t cos θ x l x y t sin θ y l y c y t cos θ where θ arctan d y c d x the hydrofoil camber was first varied with an arbitrary mounting orientation where suction side was towards the negative z direction on both starboard and port sides one of the camber profiles naca 2412 was used to investigate the influence of the mounting orientation on the fin performance apparently the propeller induced flow is in opposite direction and asymmetrical due to the body of the ship it is therefore believed that fin orientation has significant effect on rudder fins either positively or negatively this was followed by application asymmetrical fin span for the port and starboard sides lastly sensitively of the fin to the angle of attack was studied and its dependence on the mounting orientation 3 2 computation procedure open water performance characteristics of propeller model pm35k used in self propulsion test were computed by rans method at advance coefficients j 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 the purpose of open water simulation was to determine thrust coefficient kt the torque coefficient kq and propeller open water efficiency ƞ0 expressed as 9 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 k t j 2 π k q resistance simulations were carried out for ship moving at uniform velocity vm 1 333 m s two simulations were conducted the first one taking into consideration the free surface and the second without the free surface the difference between the obtained resistances was treated as the wave making resistance estimated as 10 r w r t r h where rw is the wave making resistance rt is the resistance with the free surface and rh is the hull resistance without the free surface self propulsion simulations were conducted at uniform ship velocity vm 1 333 m s the self propulsion point point when hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hull balances with propeller generated thrust was obtained by varying the rate of revolution n until equation 11 is satisfied 11 t r t b f d where t is the propeller generated thrust rtb is the total ship resistance with propeller behind the hull and fd is the scale effect correlation on viscous resistance the value of fd was measured during self propulsion towing tank model test as mentioned in section 2 2 self propulsion simulations were carried out without the free surface the total ship resistance rtb therefore is the sum of the calculated ship resistance rtc and the wave making resistance rw as shown in equation 12 12 r t b r t c r w from equations 10 and 11 the self propulsion point could be obtained as follows 13 t f d r t c r w simulation was then conducted at the self propulsion point from which propeller thrust t required torque q and total ship resistance rtb were obtained the obtained data was the used to evaluate the thrust coefficient ktb torque coefficient kqb thrust deduction factor t and taylor wake fraction wt as shown in equation 14 14 k t b t b ρ n 2 d 4 k q b q b ρ n 2 d 5 1 t r t f d t 1 w t v a v m thrust identity method was used to obtain the corresponding open water efficiency η0 open water torque coefficient kqo and the advance ratio j from open water

denote propeller behind hull propeller open water and model scale ship respectively ηh ηr ηd are the hull efficiency the relative rotative efficiency and the quasi propulsive efficiency respectively va is the product of propeller diameter d advance ratio j and propeller rate of revolution n in order to calculate the energy saving effect for each thrust fin design parameter using the ship self propulsion point four simulations are required one to determine the hull fin resistance and three to determine the self propulsion point for the hull propeller rudder fin interaction considering four fin parameters that is foil profile fin orientation span and angle of attack about 52 simulations are required the workload and computation time becomes enormous and is unacceptable assuming that change in propeller advance velocity upon installation of the rudder thrust fins is small and can be neglected a method for calculating propeller efficiency and the percentage increase in propeller

these expressions ƞ kq kt j n va δη represent the propeller efficiency torque coefficient thrust coefficient advance coefficient shaft speed advance velocity and the increase in propeller efficiency respectively the subscript b0 denotes ship without esds whereas subscript b1 denotes ship with esds note that tb1 is the sum of propeller and fin thrust according to the method presented in equation 17 only one simulation is required for each parameter which forms only a quarter of the work load and computation time with cfd method it is possible to study the influence of thrust fins on resistance here the percentage change in ship resistance due the additional rudder thrust fins was estimated as follows 18 δ r t b r t b 1 r t b 0 r t b 0 100 in this equation rtb0 and rtb1 is the total drag on the hull and rudder for ship without and with thrust fins respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 grid sensitivity study verification study was done to assess simulation uncertainty it is well known that grid generation is one of the major sources of numerical uncertainties in the current work grid sensitivity was assessed through refinements on region around the free surface and uniform grid refinement the set up with free surface which is considered as the worst case of the two set ups was used in this study in order to assess free surface related uncertainty anisotropic refinement was done to ensure cell refinement was achieved in z direction only the cell size was progressively halved in the z direction from coarse to medium and medium to fine the coarse medium and fine grid are denoted as grid 3 grid 2 and grid 1 respectively as shown in fig 7 a uniform refinement ratio rk of 2 was assumed for uniform grid refinement systematic refinement was carried out by varying the base grid size using a ratio rk equal to 2 the ratio provides a fairly large refinement to enable adequate prolongation of the coarse parameter solution the obtained grids from this refinement are denoted as grid 3 grid 4 and grid 5 corresponding to coarse medium and fine grids respectively note that grid 3 was common for both free surface and uniform grid refinements table 2 presents the mesh densities for each grid configuration selection of simulation time step is generally controlled by courant number cfl defined by c u δ t δ x where u is the velocity magnitude δt is the time step and δx is the grid spacing according to starccm cd adapco 2017 free surface flow problems require courant number less than 0 5 when second order scheme for time integration is applied in the current work the correlation factor cf and grid convergence index gci methods are used to evaluate grid convergence these methods have been widely used and are extensively discussed in references tezdogan et al 2015 stern et al 2006 wang et al 2009 eça and hoekstra 2014 long et al 2017 the gci approach defines uncertainty u k as the product of absolute error estimate obtained from richardson extrapolation δ r e k 1 and a factor of safety fs with equal grid refinement ratios between coarse medium and medium fine grids a grid triplet suffices if changes between medium coarse and fine medium solutions are given as ε m f φ m φ f and ε c m φ c φ m respectively then the convergence ratio r is as shown in equation 19 19 r ε m f ε c m where φ f φ m and φ c are solutions for fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively from equation 19 four convergence conditions are expected i monotonic convergence 0 r 1 ii oscillatory convergence r 0 and r 1 iii monotonic divergence r 1 and iv oscillatory divergence r 0 and r 1 for condition i the generalized richardson extrapolation method is used to predict the numerical error δ k and order of convergence p k for condition ii the uncertainty is predicted by 20 u k 1 2 s u s l where s u and s l are the maximum and minimum of the solutions the corrected simulation value ɸc is calculated by φ c φ f δ g where ɸ is the simulation solution as noted from tables 3 and 4 reasonably low levels of uncertainty were estimated for the resistance coefficient ctm respective free surface and uniform refinements uncertainty levels were estimated to be 4 427 and 4 642 when calculated using the cf method when the gci method is used these uncertainties dropped to 0 246 and 0 81 respectively 4 2 validation study a validation study was done by comparing model test data with those obtained from cfd simulations the validation study in the current work was done using open water characteristics and the effect of rudder bulb fins system on ship performance 4 2 1 open water performance prediction to reduce the computation time advance coefficients were chosen at the operation conditions of the propeller j 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 the comparison between experimental and cfd propeller open water characteristics is presented in table 5 from the presented data the cfd method shows good agreement with experimental data however the cfd method under predicts the thrust coefficient and its ripple effect is manifested in estimation of open water efficiency 4 2 2 influence of ruder bulb fins system on ship performance in order to ascertain the suitability of the current cfd method a comparison between cfd data for ship without esd and ship equipped with combination rudder bulb and rudder thrust fin and model tests data is presented experimental tests were conducted at the shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri the ship hull was appended with a rudder bulb with maximum diameter of 0 3d and naca 0012 thrust fins with a chord length of 0 3d and a span of 0 6d where d is the propeller diameter fig 8 shows a typical rudder bulb fins system as mentioned earlier the simulations were carried out at the ship design speed vs 14kn the self propulsion point was obtained by varying the rate of revolution n until equation 13 is satisfied it should be highlighted that the thrust identity method was used to evaluate the self propulsion characteristics the simulation convergence was controlled by residuals drag on ship hull propeller generated thrust and required torque fig 9 shows a typical convergence monitor for hull resistance and propeller generated thrust from fig 9 the oscillations for both the hull resistance and propeller thrust appear to stabilize from 3 2 s physical time the values of consecutive peaks or consecutive troughs as seen from the expanded view fluctuate by about 0 02 which could be interpreted as an indication of convergence this was achieved at around the 35th and 36th propeller revolutions time average was then done for the last two propeller revolution to obtain the values of rtc t and q the obtained data was then used to calculate self propulsion characteristics as presented in table 6 from the presented data the cfd method shows good agreement with experimental test for both ship with and without rudder bulb fins system in both cases highest deviations are recorded in prediction of ηo at 7 93 and 6 41 these errors could be attributed to underestimation of thrust and overestimation of torque in open water simulations the experimental test shows energy gains of 2 20 while cfd indicates gains of 2 68 although the comparison of raw data shows some deviations of more than 5 in the case of ship without esd except for prediction of open water efficiency the propulsion characteristics registered minimal deviations for the ship appended with esd an error of 5 21 is noted in the prediction of kt this could also be the reason for the overestimation of 1 t by 4 31 and inevitably ηh which is a function of 1 t and 1 w 4 3 performance of rudder thrust fins without rudder bulb this section seeks to investigate the effect of rudder thrust fins on propulsive efficiency the set up was similar to that of self propulsion prediction for ship without esd except that the rudder was appended with rudder thrust fins from the simulation energy gains of 0 908 in terms of propulsive efficiency were realized from section 4 2 2 combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins shows an energy saving effect of 2 68 assuming that 2 68 is the sum of gains by rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins then the rudder thrust accounts for about 30 of total energy gains an implication that the rudder bulb accounts for most of the energy saving effect hence the need to find possible ways to heighten the gains from rudder thrust fins subsequent sections seek to address some of the factors consider during design of rudder thrust fins to reduce on computation cost and time only one simulation was conducted for each thrust fin configuration the effect on propulsive efficiency was estimated using equation 17 it should be noted that the propeller rate of revolution should be kept constant for all simulations for this equation to hold 4 4 influence of hydrofoil profile on rudder thrust fin as mentioned earlier rudder fins are devised to generate a lift force from the propeller induced spiral flow and to minimize propeller induced vortices the thrust fin proposed in the initial design is a naca 0012 foil with a zero 0 camber in order to increase the lift force generated by the fins some amount of foil camber is proposed in this section three cambers 2 4 and 5 are considered as mentioned earlier the camber m is expressed as the maximum value of the mean line in hundredths of chord length other fin geometrical parameters such as chord length maximum thickness position of maximum thickness position of maximum camber and fin span were kept constant the modeled fin geometries are as illustrated in fig 10 the fin was mounted such that the hydrofoil suction side was towards the negative z direction for both port and starboard sides simulations were then performed at a constant propeller revolutions and uniform ship velocity table 7 presents the summary of the predicted energy gains deviations in hull resistance and the net forward fin thrust it is clear that thrust fins are sensitive to camber the changes in propulsive efficiency are consistent with the net forward thrust generated by the thrust fins when a camber of 2 is applied the gains drops by about 19 from 0 908 to 0 738 doubling the camber to 4 translates to even a much higher drop of about 48 and a camber of 5 produces a substantial 70 drop it is also noted that hull resistance drops with increase in hydrofoil camber somehow counterweighing the drop in energy gains it is evident that camber sensitivity increases with the increase in camber in order to gain more insight on the influence of the thrust fins on the angular acceleration vorticity was considered the change in vorticity may infer unsteadiness in the flow or translation of the fluid particle the flow on the boundary layer is fairly uniform all the way from the leading edge to the trailing edge for the initial fin design naca 0012 as shown in fig 11 a for the camber profiles the flow remains fairly attached on the starboard side detached boundary flow is manifested towards the trailing edge on the port side see fig 11 b c the onset of the detached flow for device 3 is earlier than device 2 was expected 4 5 influence of mounting orientation on rudder thrust fin in this section the mounting direction positive or negative z axis of the suction or pressure side is varied this aspect was considered for cambered foil profile where unlike symmetrical foils for instance the naca 0012 the suction and pressure side are geometrically different in this study the naca 2412 foil profile was selected with a zero 0 angle of attack four 4 cases were investigated as shown in fig 12 case 1 pressure side is towards the positive z direction on both port and starboard sides case 2 pressure side is towards the negative z direction on both port and starboard sides case 3 pressure side is towards the negative z direction on port side and positive z direction on starboard side lastly case 4 pressure side is towards the positive z direction on port side and negative z direction on starboard side table 8 present the energy gains for different foil orientation profiles it should be noted that case 1 is the orientation used for device 1 in section 4 4 from the presented data it is apparent that hydrofoil orientation is critical in thrust fin performance it is noted that case three presents energy saving effect of 0 907 which is the same as those realized by the initial thrust fin design naca 0012 cases 1 and 4 gives least saving effect and should be avoided in order to study the sensitivity of the hydrofoil profiles simulation was performed for naca 4412 profile with case 3 orientation the best hydrofoil orientation a comparison between case 1 and case 3 for the naca 2412 shows a rise of about 23 from 0 738 to 0 907 in terms of energy saving effect on the other hand a rise of about 60 from 0 477 to 0 765 is recorded between cases 1 and 3 for naca 4412 net forward fin thrust is congruous with change in propulsive efficiency in terms of hull resistance cases 2 and 4 have higher rise of 0 184 and 0 164 compared to case 3 with 0 073 on the other hand case 1 shows a drop in hull resistance by 0 002 this could be taken to imply that if a proper hydrofoil is used then the sensitivity of the hydrofoil due to camber is considerably reduced to gain more insight on the flow around the rudder thrust fins flow features such as pressure distribution vortices velocity vectors among others are required in principle the lift generated is a function of pressure difference between the suction and pressure side in this regard stream lines and pressure distribution on the surface of the thrust fins are shown in fig 13 from the stream lines the asymmetrical flow past the propeller is evident the hub vortices appear to interact with the port thrust fin than the starboard thrust fin it is noted that the port side hydrofoil orientation for cases 1 and 4 pressure side is towards the positive z direction has little influence on the hub vortices this could explain the lower saving effects for this orientation from the stream lines it appears that the port side thrust fin has higher influence on energy saving effect compared to the starboard side thrust fin also the port side fin could give better saving effect if it is offset slightly above the propeller axis rather than the current position slightly below the propeller axis in order to shed light on the influence of orientation on camber sensitivity stream lines and surface pressure distribution for naca 2412 and naca 4412 with case 3 orientation pressure side is towards the negative z direction on port side and positive z direction on starboard side are present in fig 14 the stream lines for the naca 2412 profile are evenly distributed on both the pressure and suction sides for both port and starboard sides however for naca 4412 profile stream lines are much more on the suction side than on the pressure side it is believed that installing the thrust fin at an angle of attack may improve the flow especially on the pressure side 4 6 asymmetrical rudder thrust fin due to the propeller action the flow at the stern becomes asymmetrical typically the propeller induced rotational flow in starboard side is in an opposite direction to that on the port side suppose a thrust fin has an asymmetric span then optimum thrust is generated for the port and starboard fins in this section different span length are studied as shown in fig 15 table 9 presents the summary of improvements in terms of propulsive efficiency for three 3 different starboard side fin span the data is in good agreement with the findings by liu ye bao et al liu et al 2012 that the fin span is optimum at 0 3d at 0 275d the fin has a smaller lift surface than at 0 3d hence the drop in energy saving effect at 0 35d part of the fin acts outside the region of propeller induced flow resulting to additional viscous drag which cancels out some of the generated lift future work should consider varying the port side span to check if the span is optimum or not 4 7 angle of attack θ according to carlton carlton 2019 the magnitude of the lift force generated by the thrust fins can be made sufficiently great by adjusting the incidence of the fin with respect to the hydrodynamic pitch angle of the propeller slipstream it is therefore recommended that having a small a positive and negative angle of attack can maximize the energy saving effect in this section different angles of attack are considered as shown in fig 16 the angle of attack was set such that the lift force is more inclined to the ship forward direction simulations were performed at three different angles 10 20 and 30 first investigation was conducted to determine the effect of angle of attack using the recommended orientation case 3 after which the undesirable mounting orientation case 1 was used see fig 11 a the summary of the obtained data from these simulations is presented in table 10 from the presented data the energy saving effect rises from 0 907 to 1 108 as the angle of attack increases from 0 to 2 after which it begins to fall moreover hull resistance increases with increase in angle of attack for all the considered angles of attack on the other hand when the undesired thrust fin orientation is applied device 13 the drop in energy saving effect from 0 907 to 0 701 was obvious as noted by carlton 2019 adjusting the incidence of the fin can increase its lift but from the presented data this can only hold if the fin orientation is correct otherwise it would have negative effect it is also noted that despite the improvement in propulsive efficiency the net fin thrust deteriorates with increase in angle of attack this implies that the fin performance maybe enhanced by improvement of the far wake through minimizing the effects of non uniformity fig 17 presents the comparison of stream lines and pressure distribution between device 5 angle of attack ɵ 00 and device 10 angle of attack ɵ 10 both with case 3 fin orientation it is evident that the angle of attack plays a role in improving distribution of stream lines on both suction and pressure sides this could be attributed to the improvement in energy saving since a better distributed flow increases fin thrust 5 conclusions in this paper an unsteady rans method with dynamic overset rotor was found to be adequate and accurate for analysis of hull propeller rudder interaction a validation study was carried out and cfd data showed good agreement with experimental data the experimental test shows energy gains of 2 20 while cfd indicates gains by 2 68 although the comparison of raw data shows some deviations of more than 5 the energy improvement by the thrust fins forms about 30 of total energy gains obtained from the combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins in the current work the influence of hydrofoil camber mounting orientation angle of attack and asymmetrical span on rudder thrust fins were investigated the following conclusions are then drawn from the studies firstly it was observed that rudder thrust fins are sensitive to hydrofoil camber the sensitivity appears to increase with hydrofoil camber where energy gains drops from 0 908 to 0 738 0 477 and 0 283 for cambers of 2 4 and 5 respectively secondly it is noted that the foil orientation significantly enhances performance of cambered thrust fins this can be justified by the fact that energy saving effect improved from 0 738 to 0 907 and from 0 477 to 0 765 for naca 2412 and naca 4412 hydrofoils respectively thirdly adjusting the fin angle of attack increases the energy saving effect this is evident from the rise in energy saving effect from 0 907 to 1 108 as the angle of attack increases from 0 to 2 after which it begins to fall however these gains are realized when the correct fin orientation is used else negative effect is obvious fourthly the net fin thrust is consistent with recorded improvements in terms of propulsive efficiency except in the case of angle of attack lastly the fin span on the starboard side was found to optimum at 0 3d the current work was conducted at model scale however various literatures have shown existence of scale effects for various energy saving devices it is therefore recommended that an extensive study be carried out in full scale to provide more insight on the subject also the current work studies rudder thrust fin parameters through manual variations an automatic optimization tool is therefore necessary not only for the thrust fin but also other esds credit authorship contribution statement obwogi enock omweri conceptualization

20570,rudder added thrust fins have gained popularity as an energy saving device esd by virtue of simple design easy installation and its effectiveness the current work seeks to investigate the influence of geometric parameters and mounting orientation on the energy saving effect of rudder attached thrust fins based on numerical analysis open water bare hull resistance and self propulsion simulations were carried out by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse using a computational fluid dynamics cfd code in the case of geometrical parameters hydrofoil camber and fin span were varied the fin orientation was then studied by varying the mounting direction in relation to the angle of attack and the location of pressure and suction sides a validation study carried out showed good agreement between cfd and model tests it was noted that the rudder thrust fin is sensitive to the hydrofoil orientation also with the right hydrofoil orientation the fin performance is optimum at an angle of attack of about 2 this study presents a design guideline for rudder thrust fins to ensure optimum energy gains keywords rudder thrust fins energy saving devices energy saving effect rans equations 1 introduction the recent past has witnessed a rise in the need to find ways of reducing power requirements for ships this has been necessitated by the ever increasing cost of fossil fuels imo regulations and or desire to conserve the environment by reducing emissions to the atmosphere in order to reduce energy requirement for ships a number of measures and methods including energy saving devices esds have been proposed these devices are mounted on the propeller upstream slipstream or downstream in order to enhance the ship hydrodynamic performance devices placed at the propeller upstream are commonly referred to as pre swirl whereas those placed downstream are called post swirl devices it is evident that many energy saving devices have been proposed to further improve ship performance it is therefore necessary to consider a combination of two or more devices carlton carlton 2019 presented the compatibility list for various devices it is noted that the combinations fall in four categories compatible in principle partially compatible those that should be incorporated in the design and non compatible although most of these devices are compatible it is not clear if the energy saving effect is the sum of the individual devices the current work explores the option of energy improvement by parametric considerations during the design of rudder attached thrust fins during the design stage of energy saving devices it is of great significance to understand their working principle and how they interact with the hull and propeller in practice this requires adjustment of a number of parameters and conducting model test experiments for each the cost implication time and skill requirements however restrict the number of model tests carried out as a result the application of viscous computational fluid dynamics cfd during design of esds has become popular sakamoto et al 2019 used cfd to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of pre swirl and post swirl devices song et al 2020 based on unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations uranse investigated the effect of bio fouling on the self propulsion characteristics of full scale kcs ship with the aid of cfd lee et al 2014 presented a new concept of a turbine devised to utilize propeller slip stream energy more studies where esds are investigated based on cfd are presented in literatures huang et al 2007 kim et al 2015 gaggero et al 2017 mizzi et al 2017 nowruzi and najafi 2019 the spiral propeller slip stream forms the incidence flow from which rudder thrust fins generate a lift force a component of the lift acts in the forward direction to produce additional thrust it is believed that the fins can also improve the far wake by minimizing the effects of non uniformity there have been a number of researches on rudder thrust fins based on numerical methods falkenhorst et al 2015 using lifting surfaces and panel methods investigated rudder thrust fins with a special focus on treatment of vortex using a similar method guo and huang 2006 investigated the principle parameters span and chord in their other research huang et al 2007 used cfd to analyze possible ways of improving ship performance as a function of the number of thrust fins and angle of attack the study reveals that the fin can give better results when installed at some angle of attack however there is little information in public domain in relation to the design guidelines for rudder thrust fins this work therefore seeks to establish how the foil parameters and mounting orientation influences the hydrodynamic performance of rudder thrust fins the data reliability is assessed by comparing cfd data with the experimental data from shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri the cfd data was in close agreement with model test data it was noted that the rudder thrust fin is sensitive to the hydrofoil orientation also with the right hydrofoil orientation the fin performance is optimum at an angle of attack of about 2 the study results will hopefully provide more insight on the design parameter consideration during the design of rudder attached fins 2 cfd methodology 2 1 hull propeller rudder parameters the hull propeller and rudder used in the current work are for the 3500dwt bulk carrier the simulations were performed at model scale with λ 29 197 the principle dimensions for ship and propeller are presented in table 1 naca 0012 hydrofoil profile was used for the rudder and the attached rudder thrust fin 2 2 computation domain and boundary conditions the geometries were exported to starccm where computation domains were modeled and grid generated three computation domains were used for the three main simulations open water prediction bare hull resistance prediction and ship self propulsion the computation domain in the rans solver for open water case was represented by two cylindrical blocks the outer cylinder was set as a static background region where a velocity inlet boundary condition was imposed on the upstream boundary pressure outlet condition on the down stream boundary a symmetry plane on the far field and a no slip on the wall condition on the upstream shaft the outlet was set at 5d aft of the rotating region the inlet 3d forward of the rotating region while the symmetry plane at 6d about the propeller rotation axis the inner cylinder was used to specify the rotating motion of the propeller a no slip on the wall boundary condition was set on the propeller blades and hub whereas an in place interface condition was imposed on the surfaces of the cylinder self propulsion simulations were performed without the free surface this was due to paradox in selection of time step where it is required to set the time step such that the ship advances 0 01 dimensional flow time lpp u0 per physical time advancement if the free surface is taken into account on the other hand the time step should be set such that the propeller rotates 10 30 per physical time step if the latter case is considered the computation cost would increase significantly this is because solution convergence for a small time step requires more iterations and more physical time compared to a large time step in order to account for the wave making resistance two computational set ups were used for resistance prediction i without the free surface and ii considering the free surface the difference in resistance from the two set ups was taken as wave making resistance rw assuming the action of the propeller does not influence the free surface waves then the total resistance is the sum of the total drag without free surface and the wave making resistance it should be highlighted that resistance and self propulsion simulations were performed at the design ship draft and design speed and the free surface was modeled using the volume of fraction vof method for resistance and self propulsion simulations the origin was set at the still water surface ship center line and aft perpendicular respective positive directions for x y and z axes are aft to fore starboard to port and keel to deck the computation domain in the rans solver was represented by a rectangular block extending 2l upstream from the ship fore perpendicular 3 5l downstream from the aft perpendicular 3l from the ship c l to the port and starboard sides 3l below the still water line and on the still water surface 1 5l in the positive z direction for resistance case with the free surface as shown in fig 1 a these dimensions are more than those recommended by international towing tank conference ittc ittc 2011 especially for the sides and bottom boundaries where ittc recommends 1 lpp from the plane of symmetry and a bottom boundary of 1lpp from the keel this was done to minimize boundary effect on the solution in the case of resistance prediction half domain was used due to symmetry and in order to reduce the computation cost in the case of self propulsion two regions were used a rotating region around the propeller where the rotating motion is defined and a static background region for the rest of the domain where a stationary motion is applied see fig 1 b the following boundary conditions were adopted for the self propulsion set up the inlet was set as a velocity inlet the outlet as the pressure outlet and the bottom sides and top as symmetry plane tezdogan et al 2015 noted that the selection of boundary conditions from any appropriate combination would not have significant effect if placed far away from the ship hull this is because the flow remains undisturbed by the presence of the boundary 2 3 grid generation the grid generation scheme applied was similar to the one we used in our previous work hai long et al 2016 resistance prediction was performed for two cases taking into consideration the free surface and without the free surface as shown in fig 2 fig 2a puts emphasis on mesh refinement around the hull and on the free surface while fig 2b shows the grid used without the free surface the grid size increased progressively from refined mesh size in the area immediately around the hull rudder propeller free surface as well as the region within the wake produced by the ship this was to ensure that complex flow features were adequately resolved volumetric controls surface controls and feature curves were used to achieve the required mesh densities in these regions various grids obtained through mesh refinement were studied first to ensure reliability of the numerical method the overset mesh also known as overlapping mesh adopted in this work is popular in simulating problems involving moving bodies having complicated motions tezdogan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 closely related to our subject sakamoto et al 2019 applied overset mesh to evaluate hydrodynamic performance of pre swirl and post swirl esds for merchant ships application of overset mesh requires one closed surface solution domain referred herein as the background region and one or more overset regions containing the physical bodies the overset mesh was applied on the cylindrical region around the propeller whereas the background region contains the ship hull rudder rudder bulb and rudder fin it should be noted that the simulation for combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins was conducted for data validation purpose an overset mesh interface was used to couple the static background and the dynamic overset region this was to ensure both regions use the same physics continuum overset interface is advantageous as it eliminates the need to generate conformal cells on either sides of the interface it should be noted that the overset mesh is compatible with either a rigid body motion or a moving reference frame fig 3 shows a typical grid assembly adopted in the current study hole cutting process is also very critical and was keenly observed the overset region was set as region 0 while the static background region was set as region 1 here priority controls hole cutting process where region 0 is treated as a higher priority while region 1 as a lower priority 2 4 numerical model the flow around a ship is governed by the navier stokes equations these equations can be solved directly for a given turbulent flow however the cost implication in terms of time spatial discretization and computer technology limits the possibilities reynolds averaged navier stokes rans formulations are commonly used instead the averaged continuity and momentum equations can be expressed in cartesian tensor form as 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i where p is the mean pressure u i is the averaged cartesian components of the velocity vector ρ u i u j is the reynolds stresses ρ is the fluid density and μ is the dynamic viscosity the solver employed in the current work uses finite volume discretization to provide closure to the navier stokes equations in which the predictor corrector approach links the continuity and momentum equations in the current work k ω sst turbulence model was selected this model has been widely used in related researches presented in references sakamoto et al 2019 nowruzi and najafi 2019 zhao et al 2015 bakica et al 2019 jasak et al 2019 rezaeiha et al 2019 since the overset mesh interface consists of cell faces that separate the interpolation cells from the discretization cells interface fluxes contribute only to one cell the non conservative nature of the inter grid interpolation leads to a mass imbalance cd adapco 2017 3 δ m i m i where m i is the mass flux through the interface cell face i this mass imbalance appears as a net mass source in the pressure correction equation and must be eliminated by adjusting the interface fluxes such that the sum in equation 3 is zero this can be achieved by subtracting a part of mass source δ m from each mass flux 4 m c o r r m i β i δ m where the factor β i is proportional to the share of the mass flux m i in the total mass flux through the overset interface m i m i the proportionality factor is given by 5 β i m i m because there is no contribution from the overset interfaces equation 4 ensures that the sum of equation 3 is zero mass conservation condition the continuity equation is satisfied for each cell and a divergence free flow field is obtained 3 rudder thrust fin design method the geometrical design of the rudder thrust fins is proposed in this section the installation position in relation to the rudder is fixed the fin chord line is slightly offset below the propeller shaft axis the center of fin chord 0 5cf coincides with the center of the rudder chord 0 5cr on the surface passing through the shaft axis and normal to the z axis see fig 4 3 1 thrust fin hydrofoil design consideration an illustration of a typical hydrofoil is shown in fig 5 the initial design was based on literature and experience the chord length cf distance between leading and trailing edges ox was taken as 0 3d with a span of 0 6d the maximum thickness t was equivalent to 12 of cf located at 0 3cf from the leading edge naca series hydrofoil was used in the current work where simple geometrical definitions are utilized the design method is based on the right hand screw propeller as illustrated in fig 6 thrust is produced as propeller axial components of lift ll and lu acting on the rudder with additional thrust produced as propeller axial components of lift ls and lp acting on the fin with this in mind it could be presumed that a hydrofoil with a slight camber could possibly have higher ls and lp as opposed to a symmetrical hydrofoil this however is expected to come with an additional drag component and it is not clear if the net effect would be better than that of a symmetrical one also the extent to which the camber no longer gives desirable saving effect is of great importance to study this aspect naca four digit hydrofoils controlled by camber m position of maximum camber p and maximum foil thickness t were selected the hydrofoil profile was determined in accordance with cummings et al 2015 as follows 6 for 0 x p p x 1 y c m p 2 2 p x x 2 y c m 1 p 2 1 2 p 2 p x x 2 d y c d x 2 m p 2 p x d y c d x 2 m 1 p 2 p x where m is the maximum value of the mean line in hundredths of chord length yc is the mean camber line typically split into two parts on either side of the location of maximum camber and d y c d x is the gradient of the camber line the distribution of foil thickness yt above positive and below negative the mean camber line is given as 7 y t t 0 2 0 2969 x 0 126 x 0 3516 x 2 0 2843 x 3 0 1015 x 4 the final coordinates for the upper surface x u y u and lower hydrofoil surface x l y l are calculated using the expressions in equation 8 8 x u x y t sin θ y u y c y t cos θ x l x y t sin θ y l y c y t cos θ where θ arctan d y c d x the hydrofoil camber was first varied with an arbitrary mounting orientation where suction side was towards the negative z direction on both starboard and port sides one of the camber profiles naca 2412 was used to investigate the influence of the mounting orientation on the fin performance apparently the propeller induced flow is in opposite direction and asymmetrical due to the body of the ship it is therefore believed that fin orientation has significant effect on rudder fins either positively or negatively this was followed by application asymmetrical fin span for the port and starboard sides lastly sensitively of the fin to the angle of attack was studied and its dependence on the mounting orientation 3 2 computation procedure open water performance characteristics of propeller model pm35k used in self propulsion test were computed by rans method at advance coefficients j 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 the purpose of open water simulation was to determine thrust coefficient kt the torque coefficient kq and propeller open water efficiency ƞ0 expressed as 9 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 η 0 k t j 2 π k q resistance simulations were carried out for ship moving at uniform velocity vm 1 333 m s two simulations were conducted the first one taking into consideration the free surface and the second without the free surface the difference between the obtained resistances was treated as the wave making resistance estimated as 10 r w r t r h where rw is the wave making resistance rt is the resistance with the free surface and rh is the hull resistance without the free surface self propulsion simulations were conducted at uniform ship velocity vm 1 333 m s the self propulsion point point when hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hull balances with propeller generated thrust was obtained by varying the rate of revolution n until equation 11 is satisfied 11 t r t b f d where t is the propeller generated thrust rtb is the total ship resistance with propeller behind the hull and fd is the scale effect correlation on viscous resistance the value of fd was measured during self propulsion towing tank model test as mentioned in section 2 2 self propulsion simulations were carried out without the free surface the total ship resistance rtb therefore is the sum of the calculated ship resistance rtc and the wave making resistance rw as shown in equation 12 12 r t b r t c r w from equations 10 and 11 the self propulsion point could be obtained as follows 13 t f d r t c r w simulation was then conducted at the self propulsion point from which propeller thrust t required torque q and total ship resistance rtb were obtained the obtained data was the used to evaluate the thrust coefficient ktb torque coefficient kqb thrust deduction factor t and taylor wake fraction wt as shown in equation 14 14 k t b t b ρ n 2 d 4 k q b q b ρ n 2 d 5 1 t r t f d t 1 w t v a v m thrust identity method was used to obtain the corresponding open water efficiency η0 open water torque coefficient kqo and the advance ratio j from open water

denote propeller behind hull propeller open water and model scale ship respectively ηh ηr ηd are the hull efficiency the relative rotative efficiency and the quasi propulsive efficiency respectively va is the product of propeller diameter d advance ratio j and propeller rate of revolution n in order to calculate the energy saving effect for each thrust fin design parameter using the ship self propulsion point four simulations are required one to determine the hull fin resistance and three to determine the self propulsion point for the hull propeller rudder fin interaction considering four fin parameters that is foil profile fin orientation span and angle of attack about 52 simulations are required the workload and computation time becomes enormous and is unacceptable assuming that change in propeller advance velocity upon installation of the rudder thrust fins is small and can be neglected a method for calculating propeller efficiency and the percentage increase in propeller

these expressions ƞ kq kt j n va δη represent the propeller efficiency torque coefficient thrust coefficient advance coefficient shaft speed advance velocity and the increase in propeller efficiency respectively the subscript b0 denotes ship without esds whereas subscript b1 denotes ship with esds note that tb1 is the sum of propeller and fin thrust according to the method presented in equation 17 only one simulation is required for each parameter which forms only a quarter of the work load and computation time with cfd method it is possible to study the influence of thrust fins on resistance here the percentage change in ship resistance due the additional rudder thrust fins was estimated as follows 18 δ r t b r t b 1 r t b 0 r t b 0 100 in this equation rtb0 and rtb1 is the total drag on the hull and rudder for ship without and with thrust fins respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 grid sensitivity study verification study was done to assess simulation uncertainty it is well known that grid generation is one of the major sources of numerical uncertainties in the current work grid sensitivity was assessed through refinements on region around the free surface and uniform grid refinement the set up with free surface which is considered as the worst case of the two set ups was used in this study in order to assess free surface related uncertainty anisotropic refinement was done to ensure cell refinement was achieved in z direction only the cell size was progressively halved in the z direction from coarse to medium and medium to fine the coarse medium and fine grid are denoted as grid 3 grid 2 and grid 1 respectively as shown in fig 7 a uniform refinement ratio rk of 2 was assumed for uniform grid refinement systematic refinement was carried out by varying the base grid size using a ratio rk equal to 2 the ratio provides a fairly large refinement to enable adequate prolongation of the coarse parameter solution the obtained grids from this refinement are denoted as grid 3 grid 4 and grid 5 corresponding to coarse medium and fine grids respectively note that grid 3 was common for both free surface and uniform grid refinements table 2 presents the mesh densities for each grid configuration selection of simulation time step is generally controlled by courant number cfl defined by c u δ t δ x where u is the velocity magnitude δt is the time step and δx is the grid spacing according to starccm cd adapco 2017 free surface flow problems require courant number less than 0 5 when second order scheme for time integration is applied in the current work the correlation factor cf and grid convergence index gci methods are used to evaluate grid convergence these methods have been widely used and are extensively discussed in references tezdogan et al 2015 stern et al 2006 wang et al 2009 eça and hoekstra 2014 long et al 2017 the gci approach defines uncertainty u k as the product of absolute error estimate obtained from richardson extrapolation δ r e k 1 and a factor of safety fs with equal grid refinement ratios between coarse medium and medium fine grids a grid triplet suffices if changes between medium coarse and fine medium solutions are given as ε m f φ m φ f and ε c m φ c φ m respectively then the convergence ratio r is as shown in equation 19 19 r ε m f ε c m where φ f φ m and φ c are solutions for fine medium and coarse input parameter respectively from equation 19 four convergence conditions are expected i monotonic convergence 0 r 1 ii oscillatory convergence r 0 and r 1 iii monotonic divergence r 1 and iv oscillatory divergence r 0 and r 1 for condition i the generalized richardson extrapolation method is used to predict the numerical error δ k and order of convergence p k for condition ii the uncertainty is predicted by 20 u k 1 2 s u s l where s u and s l are the maximum and minimum of the solutions the corrected simulation value ɸc is calculated by φ c φ f δ g where ɸ is the simulation solution as noted from tables 3 and 4 reasonably low levels of uncertainty were estimated for the resistance coefficient ctm respective free surface and uniform refinements uncertainty levels were estimated to be 4 427 and 4 642 when calculated using the cf method when the gci method is used these uncertainties dropped to 0 246 and 0 81 respectively 4 2 validation study a validation study was done by comparing model test data with those obtained from cfd simulations the validation study in the current work was done using open water characteristics and the effect of rudder bulb fins system on ship performance 4 2 1 open water performance prediction to reduce the computation time advance coefficients were chosen at the operation conditions of the propeller j 0 4 0 45 and 0 5 the comparison between experimental and cfd propeller open water characteristics is presented in table 5 from the presented data the cfd method shows good agreement with experimental data however the cfd method under predicts the thrust coefficient and its ripple effect is manifested in estimation of open water efficiency 4 2 2 influence of ruder bulb fins system on ship performance in order to ascertain the suitability of the current cfd method a comparison between cfd data for ship without esd and ship equipped with combination rudder bulb and rudder thrust fin and model tests data is presented experimental tests were conducted at the shanghai ship and shipping research institute sssri the ship hull was appended with a rudder bulb with maximum diameter of 0 3d and naca 0012 thrust fins with a chord length of 0 3d and a span of 0 6d where d is the propeller diameter fig 8 shows a typical rudder bulb fins system as mentioned earlier the simulations were carried out at the ship design speed vs 14kn the self propulsion point was obtained by varying the rate of revolution n until equation 13 is satisfied it should be highlighted that the thrust identity method was used to evaluate the self propulsion characteristics the simulation convergence was controlled by residuals drag on ship hull propeller generated thrust and required torque fig 9 shows a typical convergence monitor for hull resistance and propeller generated thrust from fig 9 the oscillations for both the hull resistance and propeller thrust appear to stabilize from 3 2 s physical time the values of consecutive peaks or consecutive troughs as seen from the expanded view fluctuate by about 0 02 which could be interpreted as an indication of convergence this was achieved at around the 35th and 36th propeller revolutions time average was then done for the last two propeller revolution to obtain the values of rtc t and q the obtained data was then used to calculate self propulsion characteristics as presented in table 6 from the presented data the cfd method shows good agreement with experimental test for both ship with and without rudder bulb fins system in both cases highest deviations are recorded in prediction of ηo at 7 93 and 6 41 these errors could be attributed to underestimation of thrust and overestimation of torque in open water simulations the experimental test shows energy gains of 2 20 while cfd indicates gains of 2 68 although the comparison of raw data shows some deviations of more than 5 in the case of ship without esd except for prediction of open water efficiency the propulsion characteristics registered minimal deviations for the ship appended with esd an error of 5 21 is noted in the prediction of kt this could also be the reason for the overestimation of 1 t by 4 31 and inevitably ηh which is a function of 1 t and 1 w 4 3 performance of rudder thrust fins without rudder bulb this section seeks to investigate the effect of rudder thrust fins on propulsive efficiency the set up was similar to that of self propulsion prediction for ship without esd except that the rudder was appended with rudder thrust fins from the simulation energy gains of 0 908 in terms of propulsive efficiency were realized from section 4 2 2 combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins shows an energy saving effect of 2 68 assuming that 2 68 is the sum of gains by rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins then the rudder thrust accounts for about 30 of total energy gains an implication that the rudder bulb accounts for most of the energy saving effect hence the need to find possible ways to heighten the gains from rudder thrust fins subsequent sections seek to address some of the factors consider during design of rudder thrust fins to reduce on computation cost and time only one simulation was conducted for each thrust fin configuration the effect on propulsive efficiency was estimated using equation 17 it should be noted that the propeller rate of revolution should be kept constant for all simulations for this equation to hold 4 4 influence of hydrofoil profile on rudder thrust fin as mentioned earlier rudder fins are devised to generate a lift force from the propeller induced spiral flow and to minimize propeller induced vortices the thrust fin proposed in the initial design is a naca 0012 foil with a zero 0 camber in order to increase the lift force generated by the fins some amount of foil camber is proposed in this section three cambers 2 4 and 5 are considered as mentioned earlier the camber m is expressed as the maximum value of the mean line in hundredths of chord length other fin geometrical parameters such as chord length maximum thickness position of maximum thickness position of maximum camber and fin span were kept constant the modeled fin geometries are as illustrated in fig 10 the fin was mounted such that the hydrofoil suction side was towards the negative z direction for both port and starboard sides simulations were then performed at a constant propeller revolutions and uniform ship velocity table 7 presents the summary of the predicted energy gains deviations in hull resistance and the net forward fin thrust it is clear that thrust fins are sensitive to camber the changes in propulsive efficiency are consistent with the net forward thrust generated by the thrust fins when a camber of 2 is applied the gains drops by about 19 from 0 908 to 0 738 doubling the camber to 4 translates to even a much higher drop of about 48 and a camber of 5 produces a substantial 70 drop it is also noted that hull resistance drops with increase in hydrofoil camber somehow counterweighing the drop in energy gains it is evident that camber sensitivity increases with the increase in camber in order to gain more insight on the influence of the thrust fins on the angular acceleration vorticity was considered the change in vorticity may infer unsteadiness in the flow or translation of the fluid particle the flow on the boundary layer is fairly uniform all the way from the leading edge to the trailing edge for the initial fin design naca 0012 as shown in fig 11 a for the camber profiles the flow remains fairly attached on the starboard side detached boundary flow is manifested towards the trailing edge on the port side see fig 11 b c the onset of the detached flow for device 3 is earlier than device 2 was expected 4 5 influence of mounting orientation on rudder thrust fin in this section the mounting direction positive or negative z axis of the suction or pressure side is varied this aspect was considered for cambered foil profile where unlike symmetrical foils for instance the naca 0012 the suction and pressure side are geometrically different in this study the naca 2412 foil profile was selected with a zero 0 angle of attack four 4 cases were investigated as shown in fig 12 case 1 pressure side is towards the positive z direction on both port and starboard sides case 2 pressure side is towards the negative z direction on both port and starboard sides case 3 pressure side is towards the negative z direction on port side and positive z direction on starboard side lastly case 4 pressure side is towards the positive z direction on port side and negative z direction on starboard side table 8 present the energy gains for different foil orientation profiles it should be noted that case 1 is the orientation used for device 1 in section 4 4 from the presented data it is apparent that hydrofoil orientation is critical in thrust fin performance it is noted that case three presents energy saving effect of 0 907 which is the same as those realized by the initial thrust fin design naca 0012 cases 1 and 4 gives least saving effect and should be avoided in order to study the sensitivity of the hydrofoil profiles simulation was performed for naca 4412 profile with case 3 orientation the best hydrofoil orientation a comparison between case 1 and case 3 for the naca 2412 shows a rise of about 23 from 0 738 to 0 907 in terms of energy saving effect on the other hand a rise of about 60 from 0 477 to 0 765 is recorded between cases 1 and 3 for naca 4412 net forward fin thrust is congruous with change in propulsive efficiency in terms of hull resistance cases 2 and 4 have higher rise of 0 184 and 0 164 compared to case 3 with 0 073 on the other hand case 1 shows a drop in hull resistance by 0 002 this could be taken to imply that if a proper hydrofoil is used then the sensitivity of the hydrofoil due to camber is considerably reduced to gain more insight on the flow around the rudder thrust fins flow features such as pressure distribution vortices velocity vectors among others are required in principle the lift generated is a function of pressure difference between the suction and pressure side in this regard stream lines and pressure distribution on the surface of the thrust fins are shown in fig 13 from the stream lines the asymmetrical flow past the propeller is evident the hub vortices appear to interact with the port thrust fin than the starboard thrust fin it is noted that the port side hydrofoil orientation for cases 1 and 4 pressure side is towards the positive z direction has little influence on the hub vortices this could explain the lower saving effects for this orientation from the stream lines it appears that the port side thrust fin has higher influence on energy saving effect compared to the starboard side thrust fin also the port side fin could give better saving effect if it is offset slightly above the propeller axis rather than the current position slightly below the propeller axis in order to shed light on the influence of orientation on camber sensitivity stream lines and surface pressure distribution for naca 2412 and naca 4412 with case 3 orientation pressure side is towards the negative z direction on port side and positive z direction on starboard side are present in fig 14 the stream lines for the naca 2412 profile are evenly distributed on both the pressure and suction sides for both port and starboard sides however for naca 4412 profile stream lines are much more on the suction side than on the pressure side it is believed that installing the thrust fin at an angle of attack may improve the flow especially on the pressure side 4 6 asymmetrical rudder thrust fin due to the propeller action the flow at the stern becomes asymmetrical typically the propeller induced rotational flow in starboard side is in an opposite direction to that on the port side suppose a thrust fin has an asymmetric span then optimum thrust is generated for the port and starboard fins in this section different span length are studied as shown in fig 15 table 9 presents the summary of improvements in terms of propulsive efficiency for three 3 different starboard side fin span the data is in good agreement with the findings by liu ye bao et al liu et al 2012 that the fin span is optimum at 0 3d at 0 275d the fin has a smaller lift surface than at 0 3d hence the drop in energy saving effect at 0 35d part of the fin acts outside the region of propeller induced flow resulting to additional viscous drag which cancels out some of the generated lift future work should consider varying the port side span to check if the span is optimum or not 4 7 angle of attack θ according to carlton carlton 2019 the magnitude of the lift force generated by the thrust fins can be made sufficiently great by adjusting the incidence of the fin with respect to the hydrodynamic pitch angle of the propeller slipstream it is therefore recommended that having a small a positive and negative angle of attack can maximize the energy saving effect in this section different angles of attack are considered as shown in fig 16 the angle of attack was set such that the lift force is more inclined to the ship forward direction simulations were performed at three different angles 10 20 and 30 first investigation was conducted to determine the effect of angle of attack using the recommended orientation case 3 after which the undesirable mounting orientation case 1 was used see fig 11 a the summary of the obtained data from these simulations is presented in table 10 from the presented data the energy saving effect rises from 0 907 to 1 108 as the angle of attack increases from 0 to 2 after which it begins to fall moreover hull resistance increases with increase in angle of attack for all the considered angles of attack on the other hand when the undesired thrust fin orientation is applied device 13 the drop in energy saving effect from 0 907 to 0 701 was obvious as noted by carlton 2019 adjusting the incidence of the fin can increase its lift but from the presented data this can only hold if the fin orientation is correct otherwise it would have negative effect it is also noted that despite the improvement in propulsive efficiency the net fin thrust deteriorates with increase in angle of attack this implies that the fin performance maybe enhanced by improvement of the far wake through minimizing the effects of non uniformity fig 17 presents the comparison of stream lines and pressure distribution between device 5 angle of attack ɵ 00 and device 10 angle of attack ɵ 10 both with case 3 fin orientation it is evident that the angle of attack plays a role in improving distribution of stream lines on both suction and pressure sides this could be attributed to the improvement in energy saving since a better distributed flow increases fin thrust 5 conclusions in this paper an unsteady rans method with dynamic overset rotor was found to be adequate and accurate for analysis of hull propeller rudder interaction a validation study was carried out and cfd data showed good agreement with experimental data the experimental test shows energy gains of 2 20 while cfd indicates gains by 2 68 although the comparison of raw data shows some deviations of more than 5 the energy improvement by the thrust fins forms about 30 of total energy gains obtained from the combination of rudder bulb and rudder thrust fins in the current work the influence of hydrofoil camber mounting orientation angle of attack and asymmetrical span on rudder thrust fins were investigated the following conclusions are then drawn from the studies firstly it was observed that rudder thrust fins are sensitive to hydrofoil camber the sensitivity appears to increase with hydrofoil camber where energy gains drops from 0 908 to 0 738 0 477 and 0 283 for cambers of 2 4 and 5 respectively secondly it is noted that the foil orientation significantly enhances performance of cambered thrust fins this can be justified by the fact that energy saving effect improved from 0 738 to 0 907 and from 0 477 to 0 765 for naca 2412 and naca 4412 hydrofoils respectively thirdly adjusting the fin angle of attack increases the energy saving effect this is evident from the rise in energy saving effect from 0 907 to 1 108 as the angle of attack increases from 0 to 2 after which it begins to fall however these gains are realized when the correct fin orientation is used else negative effect is obvious fourthly the net fin thrust is consistent with recorded improvements in terms of propulsive efficiency except in the case of angle of attack lastly the fin span on the starboard side was found to optimum at 0 3d the current work was conducted at model scale however various literatures have shown existence of scale effects for various energy saving devices it is therefore recommended that an extensive study be carried out in full scale to provide more insight on the subject also the current work studies rudder thrust fin parameters through manual variations an automatic optimization tool is therefore necessary not only for the thrust fin but also other esds credit authorship contribution statement obwogi enock omweri conceptualization

20571,in this study the effects of the crack on the residual ultimate strength of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack under the combined lateral pressure and in panel compression are investigated numerically based on the fact that the extent of model should be sufficient to analyze the surrounding structure a two span 1 2 1 1 2 model is modeled periodic and symmetric boundary

investigation showed that crack location was very important in the evaluation of the residual ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a crack and in particular the cracks under the stiffener have a great influence on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel finally a prediction equation capable of predicting the ultimate strength reduction rate of continuous stiffened panels

directions 1 introduction numerical investigation methods are widely used in investigating the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength with increasing reliability the compressive experiment for a stiffened panel with a single crack is too small to obtain the crack we expect since the numerical process of the cracked panel and the intact stiffened panel are identical however it is acceptable to prove the numerical method by comparing it with the reference experiment results yu et al 2018 in the analysis if the initial imperfections were properly modeled the finite element analysis results could fit well with the experiment results paik et al 2005 since the finite element analysis model does not represent the partial gap between the plates used in the experiment there is a slight inconsistency between the finite element analysis and the experiment in the ultimate strength evaluation of a cracked plate however the fea can reasonably predict the residual ultimate strength of a stiffened plate with a crack shi et al 2019 in steel plated structures such as ships and offshore structures it is a common phenomenon that cracks are formed during the fabrication procedures or in service with time and this seriously threatens the load carrying capacity of the structure it is important to study the effect of the occurrence and propagation of fatigue cracks on the structural safety of the aged steel plate structure under the cyclic loading but it is also very important to investigate the effect of cracks that already existed in the structure on the residual ultimate strength of the structure under the monotonic loading paik et al 2005 in buckling analysis using nonlinear finite element analysis the extent of the model should be sufficient to reduce uncertainty through boundary conditions soares 1988b various extents of the model were applied to investigate the effect of the cracks on the residual ultimate strength in paik et al 2005 paik 2008 paik 2009 the effects of the crack length and crack position were experimentally and numerically studied by using rectangular plates subjected to axial compression additionally by brighenti 2005 khedmati et al 2009 and seifi and khoda yari 2011 have studied the buckling strength behaviors of the unstiffened plate in shi et al 2019 the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength was experimentally and numerically studied using one span model 1 2 1 2 with a longitudinal stiffener in addition the finite element analysis was carried out to study buckling behaviors of the cracked stiffened panel bayatfar et al 2014 cui et al 2016 feng et al 2012 margaritis and toulios 2012 and the ship with cracks shi and wang 2012 based on the conclusion xu et al 2013 that panels with a 1 2 1 1 2 span provide more stable results in the experiment soares 1988b and paik 2008 used the 1 2 1 1 2 span model to consider the effects of cracks but the periodic boundary condition at the longitudinal edge of the stiffened panel was not considered xu et al 2013 has reported that the 1 2 1 1 2 span model was a specially required model for continuous stiffened panels subjected to both lateral pressure and in panel compression although this model requires a larger extent of the model than the one span model with the symmetric boundary condition it can express symmetrical and asymmetric buckling deformations or their combinations therefore it is needed to apply periodic boundary conditions bc1 and symmetric boundary conditions bc2 at the longitudinal edges of the model in this paper the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with periodic boundary condition bc1 and symmetric boundary condition bc2 at the longitudinal edges are used to numerically investigate the effects of the cracks on the residual ultimate strength of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack which was simultaneously subjected to the lateral pressure and in panel compression in this paper to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus has been developed using python language the accuracy of the advanced finite element model is verified and the effects of the crack parameters such as crack position crack length and crack angle force conditions such as biaxial compression and lateral pressure and plate parameters such as the plate aspect ratio and the plate slenderness on the ultimate strength reduction rate of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack are comprehensively investigated 2 nonlinear finite element analysis 2 1 model for analysis the extent of the model used for the ultimate strength evaluation should be sufficient to describe the given panel surrounding structure xu et al 2013 in a continuous stiffened panel model simultaneously subjected to the lateral pressure and in panel compression the deflection of stiffeners is generally symmetric and the buckling mode may be asymmetric in this study the bottom rectangular plate of bulk carriers was selected as a test sample the yield stress and young s modulus are 313 6 mpa and 205 8gpa respectively an elastic perfectly plastic material with a poisson s ratio of 0 3 is assumed fig 1 and table 1 show the geometries of the stiffeners and the dimensions of the stiffened panel used in the paper the plate thickness is 13 11 and 9 5 mm the main parameters affecting the ultimate strength of the plate subjected to the compressive load and the stiffened panel are defined as follows faulkner 1975 plate slenderness 1 β b t p σ y e column slenderness 2 λ a r σ y e where the radius of gyration r is determined by the following equation 3 r i a where i and a are the moment of inertia and the area of the cross section respectively 2 2 configuration of crack the crack may be closed under the compression in this case due to the contact of crack faces the crack has little influence on ultimate strength fig 2 shows the change in ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack width increase when the contact of crack faces is considered as shown in fig 2 if there exist the crack faces contact while reaching the uls ultimate limit state the crack width is less than 1 7 mm the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is not so significant on the contrary if not the crack width is 1 7 mm or more the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is prominent if the center of crack is not positioned at the crest or trough of the buckling half wave the crack faces may come into contact with each other partially therefore the crack will have a great influence on the reduction of the ultimate strength from the above facts it is expected that the reduction of the ultimate strength will be related to the reduction of cross sectional area shi et al 2019 in this study from a viewpoint of conservatism it is assumed that there is no face contact and crack propagation and the cracks are though thickness a series of nonlinear finite element analysis is performed to select a reasonable crack width and tip shape that satisfies the above assumption so that the effect of the crack width and the tip shape on the ultimate strength is investigated as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the relative errors of the ultimate strength according to the crack width and tip shape are less than 1 which is very small feng et al 2020 however as shown in figs 4 and 5 deformation and stress distribution near the cracks are severely affected by the crack width and tip shape it can be seen form fig 4 that when the crack width is 1 mm the crack faces are already overlapped in the uls and the above assumption is not satisfied on the other hand when the crack width is 3 mm and 10 mm the crack faces do not overlap in the uls and the above assumption is satisfied on the other hand from fig 5 it can be seen that the stress distribution for the triangular and quadrangular tip shapes in the uls are sharp but the stress distribution for the semicircle is gentle therefore in the current paper the semicircular crack tip shape is used and the crack gap w 3 mm selected by babazadeh and khedmati 2019 is used for the finite element analysis simulation in this study the main crack parameters are the relative length c l the orientation angle θ and the crack relative location c x c y it is assumed that the crack relative location c l does not exceed 0 75 times the spacing distance between the stiffeners the crack relative location is indicated by coordinates of the crack center and the crack relative location is considered in the quarter range of the stiffened panel due to the symmetric geometry of the panel fig 6 shows the geometrical description of the cracks to consider the cases where the crack center position is located at the crest or trough of plate buckling half waves and under the longitudinal stiffener the values of c x and c y are taken in 0 25 intervals between 0 and 2 75 2 3 boundary conditions and loading one of the causes of errors between the finite element analysis results and the experimental results in evaluating the ultimate strength of a cracked stiffened panel may be that the boundary conditions are not the same shi et al 2019 in the intact stiffened panel the deflection of the plate becomes symmetrical or periodic in both the local and overall buckling modes due to the continuous property of the plate xu et al 2013 for the buckling mode there is one half wave between stiffeners in the transverse direction however in the longitudinal direction there is more than one half wave within one span if the number of half waves within one span in the longitudinal direction of the continuous stiffened panel is odd the deformation mode of the plate becomes symmetrical if it is even the deformation mode of the plate becomes periodic fig 7 a and b show the deformation modes of the stiffened panel when the number of half waves is 3 odd and 6 even respectively the symmetric boundary condition assumes that the buckling deformation of the continuous stiffened panel is symmetric about the center of each span on the other hand the periodic boundary condition is assumed to have the same displacement and rotation at the edge fig 8 shows the geometric shape of the periodic and symmetric modes of buckling in the longitudinal direction of the continuous stiffened panel in the experiment it is impossible to fully realize periodic or symmetric boundary conditions but theoretically these two boundary configurations are representative buckling modes of continuous stiffened panels thus in this paper two cases of periodic boundary condition bc1 and symmetric boundary condition bc2 are used the detailed descriptions of the boundary conditions are given as follows periodic boundary condition bc1 a 1 b 1 u x 0 u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z 0 a 4 b 4 u x c p x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z 0 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 u z 0 θ x 0 c 2 d 2 c 5 d 5 u z 0 θ y 0 a 1 a 4 u y 0 θ x 0 θ z 0 b 1 b 4 u y c p y θ x 0 θ z 0 e 1 f 1 u x u x c p x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z θ z e 4 f 4 u x u x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z θ z e 2 f 2 e 3 f 3 θ z 0 where asterisks depict that the displacement components are the same at the two nodes located opposite each other at the two opposite edges c p x and c p y are displacement loads corresponding to in panel compression in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively symmetric boundary condition bc2 a 1 b 1 e 1 f 1 u x 0 θ y 0 θ z 0 a 4 b 4 e 4 f 4 u x c p x θ y 0 θ z 0 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 u z 0 θ x 0 c 2 d 2 c 5 d 5 u y 0 θ x 0 a 1 a 4 u y 0 θ x 0 θ z 0 b 1 b 4 u y c p y θ x 0 θ z 0 e 2 f 2 e 3 f 3 θ x 0 to model the water pressure a lateral pressure of 0 2 mpa is applied to the plate the ratios of the compression stress applied in the transverse direction p y to the compression stress applied in the longitudinal direction p x is 0 1 0 41 1 and 0 67 1 respectively when considering the elastic plastic large deflection behavior the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel subjected to both longitudinal and transverse compression force and lateral pressure at the same time differs according to the load order however the effect of the load sequence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is insignificant therefore the lateral pressure and the compression forces are applied in two steps first the pressure is applied in the lateral direction of the plate and forced displacement is applied along the edge of the stiffened panel boundary conditions are also applied with lateral pressure first and then compression force 2 4 geometrical initial imperfections the effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength cannot be ignored guedes 1988 a guedes et al 1993 in this paper the effect of welding residual stress is not considered geometrical imperfections occur in complicated fabrication procedures and there are considerable uncertainties in size and spatial variations the ultimate strength behavior of a plate subjected to buckling loads varies considerably depending on the shape of the initial deflection kmiecik et al 1995 in general it is assumed that the initial deflection has the same shape as the fourier components the shape and size of the initial deflection are not identical to those measured in the actual ships but it is assumed to be an idealized mode as a fundamental case xu et al 2013 in the paper the following three types of deflections are assumed to be the initial imperfections of the stiffened panel fujikubo et al 2005 initial deflection of local plate panel 4 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π x a sin π z s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b column type initial deflection of stiffeners 5 w 0 s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b side ways initial deflection of stiffeners due to angular rotation about panel stiffener 6 v 0 s c 0 sin π x a the advantage of the periodic boundary condition is that it can express both symmetric and asymmetric buckling deformations and their mixed deformations the initial imperfections consisting of the different numbers of m e g m 3 4 5 are given as follows 7 w 0 p l m a 0 m sin m π x a sin π z s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b according to the results of xu et al 2017 the half wave numbers of collapse for the local plates m are as presented in table 3 in this paper to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus program was developed using python language it enables the same displacement and rotation at the longitudinal edge of the panel and the initial deflection of the panel can be set directly fig 9 shows the newly developed plug in in this study 2 5 adopted element type and convergence study the shell element s4r which is suitable for the analysis of thin walled structures in the finite element model is used and the arc length method is used to estimate the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with crack in abaqus the mesh sizes of the finite element model should be refined to give accurate and reliable results however a balance must be ensured between the computational accuracy and the cost according to the convergence study of the size of the element division for an intact stiffened panel six elements are set along with the web of the stiffener and the short edge of the flange respectively and the element size of the plate is set to 1 10 of the width of the local plate of 85 mm fig 10 to determine an appropriate element division number n tip at the crack tip where the stress concentration occurs a comparison of the ultimate strength values at n tip 4 6 8 10 is carried out the comparison result shows that the calculation results from n tip 6 to n tip 10 are similar therefore there is no need to perform a higher meshing refinement 2 6 finite element model verification in this paper to verify the applied finite element model the experimental model in literature of shi et al 2019 is modeled as a numerical analysis model that can apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions and the numerical calculation results are compared with the experimental results it is difficult to fully realize the periodic and symmetrical boundary conditions in the experiment because the boundary conditions applicable in the experiment are clamped or simple supports in the paper to apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions to the experimental model of shi et al 2019 a half span is extended towards both sides in the longitudinal direction and half of the spacing distance of the stiffeners are extended towards both sides in the transverse direction see fig 11 fig 12 shows the von mises stress distributions at the uls obtained by the numerical analysis method applied in this paper fig 13 represents the stress strain relationship for the numerical calculation results and the experimental values as shown in fig 13 in the numerical calculation results and the experimental values the ultimate strength values are almost identical and the behaviors in the elastic range are also similar this verifies the accuracy of the finite element model applied in this study 3 fe analysis results and discussions in the paper the effects of the crack parameters such as crack relative position crack relative length and crack angle loading conditions such as biaxial compression and lateral pressure boundary conditions and plate parameters such as the panel aspect ratio and the plate slenderness on the ultimate strength reduction rate were investigated for this nonlinear finite element analysis for a total of 12180 cases was carried out by the abaqus program fig 14 shows the von mises stress distributions at the uls with and without cracks for the panel type p 3 as shown in the figure the cracks change the stress distribution implying that the cracks affect the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel thus the present study aims to investigate the trend of the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel due to the existence of cracks the trend of the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel due to the existence of cracks 3 1 influence of boundary conditions the slenderness that gives the minimum ultimate strength of a simply supported plate is 0 7 0 8 yao 1985 which gives a larger constraint in the buckling behavior resulting in larger ultimate strength than the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with periodic boundary conditions therefore the ultimate strength of the model cannot be overestimated under the periodic boundary conditions fig 15 shows the changes in the average ultimate strength value and the ultimate strength reduction rate for an intact panel under the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions when the x axis coordinate of the transverse crack center is zero and the y axis coordinate changes as shown in fig 15 a the ultimate strength in bc1 is slightly smaller than in bc2 however as shown in fig 15 b there is almost no difference between the ultimate strength reduction rates in bc1 and bc2 this means that the effect of the boundary conditions bc1 or bc2 on the ultimate strength reduction rate is negligible 3 2 influence of crack center location from the results of cui et al 2016 it can be seen that the effect of the relative transverse location of crack center on the ultimate strength in the unstiffened plate is greater than the effect of the longitudinal location on the ultimate strength in this paper the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate was observed while changing the crack center coordinates for the transverse crack of θ 90 fig 16 shows the distribution of the ultimate strength reduction rate in a quarter range of stiffened panel from fig 16 it can be seen that the ultimate strength reduction rate at the longitudinal location of crack center c x 0 is more severe than at c x 2 5 fig 17 shows the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change of c x and c y in fig 17 a as the value c x is smaller the trend of the ultimate strength reduction rate curve is more similar to that of a sine function it also shows that the ultimate strength reduction in the place where the longitudinal stiffeners are located is more severe than in the plate between the longitudinal stiffeners this is similar to the change in ultimate strength reduction rate in the cracked unstiffened plate as shown by the experiment in paik et al 2005 fig 17 b and c show the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change in the relative longitudinal location of crack center c x when c y 1 as shown in the figure even if the crack center location is close to c x 1 5 where the frame is located the ultimate strength reduction is not severe additionally unlike in fig 17 a the trend of a sine function is not clear however as shown in fig 17 c the ultimate strength reduction rate at c x 1 0 which corresponds to the trough of the plate buckling half wave is smaller than the ultimate strength reduction rate at c x 0 and 2 0 which corresponds to the crest this means that the ultimate strength reduction rate differs depending on whether the transverse position of the crack center is placed at either the crest or the trough of the plate buckling half wave considering that the failure mode of the stiffened panel depends on the initial deflection it can be explained that the influence of the longitudinal position of the crack center is severely affected by the initial deflection in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the cracked stiffened panel to investigate the effect of the crack position on the collapse behaviors of the stiffened panel the post collapse behaviors are observed at different crack positions as shown in fig 18 the collapse line tends to include the crack location this is because stress concentration occurs at the crack position from which collapse begins and expands therefore it can be seen that the collapse behavior of the cracked stiffened plate is highly dependent on the crack position 3 3 influence of crack length and orientation angle in this paper to investigate the effect of the relative crack length on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened panel the position of the crack center is fixed at a specific position such as the peak of the plate buckling half wave or a longitudinal stiffener and the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the relative crack length is observed according to the research results of yu et al 2018 the increase of the crack length has a slight effect on the elastic behavior but has a significant effect on the residual ultimate strength fig 19 shows the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the relative crack length when the relative crack length c l is less than 0 5 the slope angle of the curve when c y 0 5 is greater than when c y 0 and 1 0 however when the relative crack length c y is greater than 0 5 the effects of the crack length increase on the ultimate strength reduction rate are both large this implies that the increase in the crack length has a greater effect on the ultimate strength reduction rate when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener than when it is at the peak or field or trough of the bulking half wave the reason is that the cracks under the stiffener reduce the stiffness of both the stiffener and the plate as shown in fig 20 the effect of the increase in the crack angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate is similar to the effect of the increase in the crack length on the ultimate strength reduction rate the increase in the crack angle has a greater effect on the ultimate strength reduction rate when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener than when it is at the peak or the trough of the buckling half wave furthermore it is noticeable that when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength reduction becomes very remarkable if the directions of the longitudinal stiffener and the crack were identical it may be due to a sharp increase in the cross sections where the stiffness of the stiffeners and plates decreases in figs 19 and 20 when the crack center is at the crest or trough of the buckling half wave the effect of the increase in the crack length or direction angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes more severe as the transverse coordinate values of the crack center increase 3 4 influence of plate slenderness ratio in this paper the crack length and direction angle was fixed when the crack center position was placed at the crest and trough of the plate buckling half wave and under the longitudinal stiffener and the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate was investigated when the plate thickness changes as 13 11 and 9 5 mm fig 21 shows the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the plate slenderness when the crack center position is c x 1 0 and c y 0 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the plate slenderness decreases as the plate thickness increases this is consistent with the results of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 however if the crack position changes if the value c y is greater than 0 5 the ultimate strength reduction according to the decrease in the plate slenderness is not clear this means that when the c y value is larger than 0 5 the influence of the reduction in cross sections due to the crack at the crack position is not clear according to the change of the plate slenderness 3 5 influence of plate aspect ratio in this paper when the crack center position is placed at the crest and trough of the plate buckling half wave and under the stiffener the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate was investigated by changing the plate shape as p 1 p 5 fig 22 shows the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the plate aspect increase as shown in fig 22 when the crack center position is c x 1 0 and c y 0 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases approximately linearly which is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2014 however when the crack position is c x 1 0 c y 0 5 if the a s value is less than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases linearly and if the a s value is greater than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes sharp in addition when the crack position is c x 1 0 c y 1 if the a s value is less than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate increases gradually and when the a s value is greater than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases this indicates that the effect of the plate aspect on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel is different depending on the crack location 3 6 loading conditions in this paper to investigate the effect of cracks on the stiffened panel under different loading conditions the ultimate strength reduction rate was observed when the ratio of the transverse compression to the longitudinal one p y p x was 0 1 0 41 1 and 0 67 1 respectively fig 23 shows the effect of cracks on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the loading condition when the crack is near the stiffener c x 1 0 c y 0 5 the ultimate strength reduction rate increases as the p y p x value increases this may be because the stress concentration around the cracks caused by the longitudinal compression is relieved to some extent by the transverse compression therefore when the crack center position is not near the stiffener the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is not significant 4 empirical formula 4 1 prediction equations as shown in fig 16 uncertainties about the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the crack relative location are very high therefore it is difficult to propose a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the change of all parameters in this paper we propose a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack relative location and the crack relative length when the ultimate strength reduction rate is severe that is when the crack orientation angle is zero and the further crack center is under the longitudinal stiffener fig 24 shows the geometric presentation of the crack location used to propose the prediction equation and fig 25 shows the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack location and the crack length as can be seen from fig 25 all curves have a cosine function pattern and the amplitude gradually increases while changing from 0 2 to 0 75 additionally the period length becomes 1 5π while changing from zero to 0 75 thus the paper proposes a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate of the continuous stiffened panel with a crack as follows origin pro 2017 is used to implement function fitting 8 σ u c σ u a 1 a 2 cos 2 c x π where 9 a 1 0 427 c l 3 0 612 c l 2 0 400 c l 1 054

comparison according to the results of the fitting implementation by origin pro 2017 the standard error of the fitness is 1 592e 7 and the mean r square cod is 0 999 this shows that the proposed prediction equation is accurate 5 conclusions in the paper the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the strength limit of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack simultaneously subjected to both in plane compression and lateral pressure was investigated in a numerical method in nonlinear finite element analysis a two span 1 2 1 1 2 model is modeled and the periodic boundary conditions bc1 and the symmetric boundary conditions bc2 were applied to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus has been developed using python language the accuracy of the used finite element model was verified and the effects of the crack parameters loading conditions and the plate parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the continuous stiffened panel with a crack were investigated finally a prediction equation capable of predicting the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change of the crack relative length and the crack relative location under the condition with the crack position limited and the other parameters kept constant was proposed and verified for its accuracy in the present study several conclusions were reached through the investigation results 1 uncertainties about the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the crack relative location are very high the notable thing is that when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength reduction becomes very remarkable if the direction of the longitudinal stiffener matches the crack orientation furthermore the collapse line of the cracked stiffened panel tends to include the crack location 2 the effect of the crack longitudinal location position on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel is largely dependent on the initial deflection of the plate the smaller the longitudinal location value of the crack center the closer the trend of the ultimate strength reduction rate curve to a sine function 3 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the transverse location value of the crack center increases the effect of the increase in the crack length or the orientation angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes more severe as the transverse coordinate of the crack center increases when the relative transverse location of the crack center is zero the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the plate slenderness decreases if the plate thickness increases however if the relative transverse location of the crack center is larger than 0 5 the decrease in the ultimate strength reduction according to the decrease in the plate slenderness is not clear in investigating the influence of parameters on the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a crack the crack location is very important and the ultimate strength reduction rate is largely dependent on the initial deflection of the plate additionally as the cracks are located closer to the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength decreases more severely considering that most of the cracks occur near the stiffener during the fabrication procedure a thorough protective measure against the occurrence of cracks is required when assembling

20571,in this study the effects of the crack on the residual ultimate strength of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack under the combined lateral pressure and in panel compression are investigated numerically based on the fact that the extent of model should be sufficient to analyze the surrounding structure a two span 1 2 1 1 2 model is modeled periodic and symmetric boundary

investigation showed that crack location was very important in the evaluation of the residual ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a crack and in particular the cracks under the stiffener have a great influence on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel finally a prediction equation capable of predicting the ultimate strength reduction rate of continuous stiffened panels

directions 1 introduction numerical investigation methods are widely used in investigating the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength with increasing reliability the compressive experiment for a stiffened panel with a single crack is too small to obtain the crack we expect since the numerical process of the cracked panel and the intact stiffened panel are identical however it is acceptable to prove the numerical method by comparing it with the reference experiment results yu et al 2018 in the analysis if the initial imperfections were properly modeled the finite element analysis results could fit well with the experiment results paik et al 2005 since the finite element analysis model does not represent the partial gap between the plates used in the experiment there is a slight inconsistency between the finite element analysis and the experiment in the ultimate strength evaluation of a cracked plate however the fea can reasonably predict the residual ultimate strength of a stiffened plate with a crack shi et al 2019 in steel plated structures such as ships and offshore structures it is a common phenomenon that cracks are formed during the fabrication procedures or in service with time and this seriously threatens the load carrying capacity of the structure it is important to study the effect of the occurrence and propagation of fatigue cracks on the structural safety of the aged steel plate structure under the cyclic loading but it is also very important to investigate the effect of cracks that already existed in the structure on the residual ultimate strength of the structure under the monotonic loading paik et al 2005 in buckling analysis using nonlinear finite element analysis the extent of the model should be sufficient to reduce uncertainty through boundary conditions soares 1988b various extents of the model were applied to investigate the effect of the cracks on the residual ultimate strength in paik et al 2005 paik 2008 paik 2009 the effects of the crack length and crack position were experimentally and numerically studied by using rectangular plates subjected to axial compression additionally by brighenti 2005 khedmati et al 2009 and seifi and khoda yari 2011 have studied the buckling strength behaviors of the unstiffened plate in shi et al 2019 the effect of cracks on the residual ultimate strength was experimentally and numerically studied using one span model 1 2 1 2 with a longitudinal stiffener in addition the finite element analysis was carried out to study buckling behaviors of the cracked stiffened panel bayatfar et al 2014 cui et al 2016 feng et al 2012 margaritis and toulios 2012 and the ship with cracks shi and wang 2012 based on the conclusion xu et al 2013 that panels with a 1 2 1 1 2 span provide more stable results in the experiment soares 1988b and paik 2008 used the 1 2 1 1 2 span model to consider the effects of cracks but the periodic boundary condition at the longitudinal edge of the stiffened panel was not considered xu et al 2013 has reported that the 1 2 1 1 2 span model was a specially required model for continuous stiffened panels subjected to both lateral pressure and in panel compression although this model requires a larger extent of the model than the one span model with the symmetric boundary condition it can express symmetrical and asymmetric buckling deformations or their combinations therefore it is needed to apply periodic boundary conditions bc1 and symmetric boundary conditions bc2 at the longitudinal edges of the model in this paper the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with periodic boundary condition bc1 and symmetric boundary condition bc2 at the longitudinal edges are used to numerically investigate the effects of the cracks on the residual ultimate strength of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack which was simultaneously subjected to the lateral pressure and in panel compression in this paper to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus has been developed using python language the accuracy of the advanced finite element model is verified and the effects of the crack parameters such as crack position crack length and crack angle force conditions such as biaxial compression and lateral pressure and plate parameters such as the plate aspect ratio and the plate slenderness on the ultimate strength reduction rate of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack are comprehensively investigated 2 nonlinear finite element analysis 2 1 model for analysis the extent of the model used for the ultimate strength evaluation should be sufficient to describe the given panel surrounding structure xu et al 2013 in a continuous stiffened panel model simultaneously subjected to the lateral pressure and in panel compression the deflection of stiffeners is generally symmetric and the buckling mode may be asymmetric in this study the bottom rectangular plate of bulk carriers was selected as a test sample the yield stress and young s modulus are 313 6 mpa and 205 8gpa respectively an elastic perfectly plastic material with a poisson s ratio of 0 3 is assumed fig 1 and table 1 show the geometries of the stiffeners and the dimensions of the stiffened panel used in the paper the plate thickness is 13 11 and 9 5 mm the main parameters affecting the ultimate strength of the plate subjected to the compressive load and the stiffened panel are defined as follows faulkner 1975 plate slenderness 1 β b t p σ y e column slenderness 2 λ a r σ y e where the radius of gyration r is determined by the following equation 3 r i a where i and a are the moment of inertia and the area of the cross section respectively 2 2 configuration of crack the crack may be closed under the compression in this case due to the contact of crack faces the crack has little influence on ultimate strength fig 2 shows the change in ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack width increase when the contact of crack faces is considered as shown in fig 2 if there exist the crack faces contact while reaching the uls ultimate limit state the crack width is less than 1 7 mm the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is not so significant on the contrary if not the crack width is 1 7 mm or more the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is prominent if the center of crack is not positioned at the crest or trough of the buckling half wave the crack faces may come into contact with each other partially therefore the crack will have a great influence on the reduction of the ultimate strength from the above facts it is expected that the reduction of the ultimate strength will be related to the reduction of cross sectional area shi et al 2019 in this study from a viewpoint of conservatism it is assumed that there is no face contact and crack propagation and the cracks are though thickness a series of nonlinear finite element analysis is performed to select a reasonable crack width and tip shape that satisfies the above assumption so that the effect of the crack width and the tip shape on the ultimate strength is investigated as shown in fig 3 and table 2 the relative errors of the ultimate strength according to the crack width and tip shape are less than 1 which is very small feng et al 2020 however as shown in figs 4 and 5 deformation and stress distribution near the cracks are severely affected by the crack width and tip shape it can be seen form fig 4 that when the crack width is 1 mm the crack faces are already overlapped in the uls and the above assumption is not satisfied on the other hand when the crack width is 3 mm and 10 mm the crack faces do not overlap in the uls and the above assumption is satisfied on the other hand from fig 5 it can be seen that the stress distribution for the triangular and quadrangular tip shapes in the uls are sharp but the stress distribution for the semicircle is gentle therefore in the current paper the semicircular crack tip shape is used and the crack gap w 3 mm selected by babazadeh and khedmati 2019 is used for the finite element analysis simulation in this study the main crack parameters are the relative length c l the orientation angle θ and the crack relative location c x c y it is assumed that the crack relative location c l does not exceed 0 75 times the spacing distance between the stiffeners the crack relative location is indicated by coordinates of the crack center and the crack relative location is considered in the quarter range of the stiffened panel due to the symmetric geometry of the panel fig 6 shows the geometrical description of the cracks to consider the cases where the crack center position is located at the crest or trough of plate buckling half waves and under the longitudinal stiffener the values of c x and c y are taken in 0 25 intervals between 0 and 2 75 2 3 boundary conditions and loading one of the causes of errors between the finite element analysis results and the experimental results in evaluating the ultimate strength of a cracked stiffened panel may be that the boundary conditions are not the same shi et al 2019 in the intact stiffened panel the deflection of the plate becomes symmetrical or periodic in both the local and overall buckling modes due to the continuous property of the plate xu et al 2013 for the buckling mode there is one half wave between stiffeners in the transverse direction however in the longitudinal direction there is more than one half wave within one span if the number of half waves within one span in the longitudinal direction of the continuous stiffened panel is odd the deformation mode of the plate becomes symmetrical if it is even the deformation mode of the plate becomes periodic fig 7 a and b show the deformation modes of the stiffened panel when the number of half waves is 3 odd and 6 even respectively the symmetric boundary condition assumes that the buckling deformation of the continuous stiffened panel is symmetric about the center of each span on the other hand the periodic boundary condition is assumed to have the same displacement and rotation at the edge fig 8 shows the geometric shape of the periodic and symmetric modes of buckling in the longitudinal direction of the continuous stiffened panel in the experiment it is impossible to fully realize periodic or symmetric boundary conditions but theoretically these two boundary configurations are representative buckling modes of continuous stiffened panels thus in this paper two cases of periodic boundary condition bc1 and symmetric boundary condition bc2 are used the detailed descriptions of the boundary conditions are given as follows periodic boundary condition bc1 a 1 b 1 u x 0 u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z 0 a 4 b 4 u x c p x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z 0 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 u z 0 θ x 0 c 2 d 2 c 5 d 5 u z 0 θ y 0 a 1 a 4 u y 0 θ x 0 θ z 0 b 1 b 4 u y c p y θ x 0 θ z 0 e 1 f 1 u x u x c p x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z θ z e 4 f 4 u x u x u y u y u z u z θ x θ x θ y θ y θ z θ z e 2 f 2 e 3 f 3 θ z 0 where asterisks depict that the displacement components are the same at the two nodes located opposite each other at the two opposite edges c p x and c p y are displacement loads corresponding to in panel compression in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively symmetric boundary condition bc2 a 1 b 1 e 1 f 1 u x 0 θ y 0 θ z 0 a 4 b 4 e 4 f 4 u x c p x θ y 0 θ z 0 a 2 b 2 a 3 b 3 u z 0 θ x 0 c 2 d 2 c 5 d 5 u y 0 θ x 0 a 1 a 4 u y 0 θ x 0 θ z 0 b 1 b 4 u y c p y θ x 0 θ z 0 e 2 f 2 e 3 f 3 θ x 0 to model the water pressure a lateral pressure of 0 2 mpa is applied to the plate the ratios of the compression stress applied in the transverse direction p y to the compression stress applied in the longitudinal direction p x is 0 1 0 41 1 and 0 67 1 respectively when considering the elastic plastic large deflection behavior the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel subjected to both longitudinal and transverse compression force and lateral pressure at the same time differs according to the load order however the effect of the load sequence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel is insignificant therefore the lateral pressure and the compression forces are applied in two steps first the pressure is applied in the lateral direction of the plate and forced displacement is applied along the edge of the stiffened panel boundary conditions are also applied with lateral pressure first and then compression force 2 4 geometrical initial imperfections the effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength cannot be ignored guedes 1988 a guedes et al 1993 in this paper the effect of welding residual stress is not considered geometrical imperfections occur in complicated fabrication procedures and there are considerable uncertainties in size and spatial variations the ultimate strength behavior of a plate subjected to buckling loads varies considerably depending on the shape of the initial deflection kmiecik et al 1995 in general it is assumed that the initial deflection has the same shape as the fourier components the shape and size of the initial deflection are not identical to those measured in the actual ships but it is assumed to be an idealized mode as a fundamental case xu et al 2013 in the paper the following three types of deflections are assumed to be the initial imperfections of the stiffened panel fujikubo et al 2005 initial deflection of local plate panel 4 w 0 p l a 0 sin m π x a sin π z s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b column type initial deflection of stiffeners 5 w 0 s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b side ways initial deflection of stiffeners due to angular rotation about panel stiffener 6 v 0 s c 0 sin π x a the advantage of the periodic boundary condition is that it can express both symmetric and asymmetric buckling deformations and their mixed deformations the initial imperfections consisting of the different numbers of m e g m 3 4 5 are given as follows 7 w 0 p l m a 0 m sin m π x a sin π z s b 0 sin π x a sin π z b according to the results of xu et al 2017 the half wave numbers of collapse for the local plates m are as presented in table 3 in this paper to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus program was developed using python language it enables the same displacement and rotation at the longitudinal edge of the panel and the initial deflection of the panel can be set directly fig 9 shows the newly developed plug in in this study 2 5 adopted element type and convergence study the shell element s4r which is suitable for the analysis of thin walled structures in the finite element model is used and the arc length method is used to estimate the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel with crack in abaqus the mesh sizes of the finite element model should be refined to give accurate and reliable results however a balance must be ensured between the computational accuracy and the cost according to the convergence study of the size of the element division for an intact stiffened panel six elements are set along with the web of the stiffener and the short edge of the flange respectively and the element size of the plate is set to 1 10 of the width of the local plate of 85 mm fig 10 to determine an appropriate element division number n tip at the crack tip where the stress concentration occurs a comparison of the ultimate strength values at n tip 4 6 8 10 is carried out the comparison result shows that the calculation results from n tip 6 to n tip 10 are similar therefore there is no need to perform a higher meshing refinement 2 6 finite element model verification in this paper to verify the applied finite element model the experimental model in literature of shi et al 2019 is modeled as a numerical analysis model that can apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions and the numerical calculation results are compared with the experimental results it is difficult to fully realize the periodic and symmetrical boundary conditions in the experiment because the boundary conditions applicable in the experiment are clamped or simple supports in the paper to apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions to the experimental model of shi et al 2019 a half span is extended towards both sides in the longitudinal direction and half of the spacing distance of the stiffeners are extended towards both sides in the transverse direction see fig 11 fig 12 shows the von mises stress distributions at the uls obtained by the numerical analysis method applied in this paper fig 13 represents the stress strain relationship for the numerical calculation results and the experimental values as shown in fig 13 in the numerical calculation results and the experimental values the ultimate strength values are almost identical and the behaviors in the elastic range are also similar this verifies the accuracy of the finite element model applied in this study 3 fe analysis results and discussions in the paper the effects of the crack parameters such as crack relative position crack relative length and crack angle loading conditions such as biaxial compression and lateral pressure boundary conditions and plate parameters such as the panel aspect ratio and the plate slenderness on the ultimate strength reduction rate were investigated for this nonlinear finite element analysis for a total of 12180 cases was carried out by the abaqus program fig 14 shows the von mises stress distributions at the uls with and without cracks for the panel type p 3 as shown in the figure the cracks change the stress distribution implying that the cracks affect the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel thus the present study aims to investigate the trend of the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel due to the existence of cracks the trend of the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel due to the existence of cracks 3 1 influence of boundary conditions the slenderness that gives the minimum ultimate strength of a simply supported plate is 0 7 0 8 yao 1985 which gives a larger constraint in the buckling behavior resulting in larger ultimate strength than the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with periodic boundary conditions therefore the ultimate strength of the model cannot be overestimated under the periodic boundary conditions fig 15 shows the changes in the average ultimate strength value and the ultimate strength reduction rate for an intact panel under the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions when the x axis coordinate of the transverse crack center is zero and the y axis coordinate changes as shown in fig 15 a the ultimate strength in bc1 is slightly smaller than in bc2 however as shown in fig 15 b there is almost no difference between the ultimate strength reduction rates in bc1 and bc2 this means that the effect of the boundary conditions bc1 or bc2 on the ultimate strength reduction rate is negligible 3 2 influence of crack center location from the results of cui et al 2016 it can be seen that the effect of the relative transverse location of crack center on the ultimate strength in the unstiffened plate is greater than the effect of the longitudinal location on the ultimate strength in this paper the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate was observed while changing the crack center coordinates for the transverse crack of θ 90 fig 16 shows the distribution of the ultimate strength reduction rate in a quarter range of stiffened panel from fig 16 it can be seen that the ultimate strength reduction rate at the longitudinal location of crack center c x 0 is more severe than at c x 2 5 fig 17 shows the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change of c x and c y in fig 17 a as the value c x is smaller the trend of the ultimate strength reduction rate curve is more similar to that of a sine function it also shows that the ultimate strength reduction in the place where the longitudinal stiffeners are located is more severe than in the plate between the longitudinal stiffeners this is similar to the change in ultimate strength reduction rate in the cracked unstiffened plate as shown by the experiment in paik et al 2005 fig 17 b and c show the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change in the relative longitudinal location of crack center c x when c y 1 as shown in the figure even if the crack center location is close to c x 1 5 where the frame is located the ultimate strength reduction is not severe additionally unlike in fig 17 a the trend of a sine function is not clear however as shown in fig 17 c the ultimate strength reduction rate at c x 1 0 which corresponds to the trough of the plate buckling half wave is smaller than the ultimate strength reduction rate at c x 0 and 2 0 which corresponds to the crest this means that the ultimate strength reduction rate differs depending on whether the transverse position of the crack center is placed at either the crest or the trough of the plate buckling half wave considering that the failure mode of the stiffened panel depends on the initial deflection it can be explained that the influence of the longitudinal position of the crack center is severely affected by the initial deflection in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the cracked stiffened panel to investigate the effect of the crack position on the collapse behaviors of the stiffened panel the post collapse behaviors are observed at different crack positions as shown in fig 18 the collapse line tends to include the crack location this is because stress concentration occurs at the crack position from which collapse begins and expands therefore it can be seen that the collapse behavior of the cracked stiffened plate is highly dependent on the crack position 3 3 influence of crack length and orientation angle in this paper to investigate the effect of the relative crack length on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened panel the position of the crack center is fixed at a specific position such as the peak of the plate buckling half wave or a longitudinal stiffener and the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the relative crack length is observed according to the research results of yu et al 2018 the increase of the crack length has a slight effect on the elastic behavior but has a significant effect on the residual ultimate strength fig 19 shows the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the relative crack length when the relative crack length c l is less than 0 5 the slope angle of the curve when c y 0 5 is greater than when c y 0 and 1 0 however when the relative crack length c y is greater than 0 5 the effects of the crack length increase on the ultimate strength reduction rate are both large this implies that the increase in the crack length has a greater effect on the ultimate strength reduction rate when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener than when it is at the peak or field or trough of the bulking half wave the reason is that the cracks under the stiffener reduce the stiffness of both the stiffener and the plate as shown in fig 20 the effect of the increase in the crack angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate is similar to the effect of the increase in the crack length on the ultimate strength reduction rate the increase in the crack angle has a greater effect on the ultimate strength reduction rate when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener than when it is at the peak or the trough of the buckling half wave furthermore it is noticeable that when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength reduction becomes very remarkable if the directions of the longitudinal stiffener and the crack were identical it may be due to a sharp increase in the cross sections where the stiffness of the stiffeners and plates decreases in figs 19 and 20 when the crack center is at the crest or trough of the buckling half wave the effect of the increase in the crack length or direction angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes more severe as the transverse coordinate values of the crack center increase 3 4 influence of plate slenderness ratio in this paper the crack length and direction angle was fixed when the crack center position was placed at the crest and trough of the plate buckling half wave and under the longitudinal stiffener and the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate was investigated when the plate thickness changes as 13 11 and 9 5 mm fig 21 shows the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the plate slenderness when the crack center position is c x 1 0 and c y 0 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the plate slenderness decreases as the plate thickness increases this is consistent with the results of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 however if the crack position changes if the value c y is greater than 0 5 the ultimate strength reduction according to the decrease in the plate slenderness is not clear this means that when the c y value is larger than 0 5 the influence of the reduction in cross sections due to the crack at the crack position is not clear according to the change of the plate slenderness 3 5 influence of plate aspect ratio in this paper when the crack center position is placed at the crest and trough of the plate buckling half wave and under the stiffener the change of the ultimate strength reduction rate was investigated by changing the plate shape as p 1 p 5 fig 22 shows the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the plate aspect increase as shown in fig 22 when the crack center position is c x 1 0 and c y 0 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases approximately linearly which is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2014 however when the crack position is c x 1 0 c y 0 5 if the a s value is less than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases linearly and if the a s value is greater than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes sharp in addition when the crack position is c x 1 0 c y 1 if the a s value is less than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate increases gradually and when the a s value is greater than 2 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases this indicates that the effect of the plate aspect on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel is different depending on the crack location 3 6 loading conditions in this paper to investigate the effect of cracks on the stiffened panel under different loading conditions the ultimate strength reduction rate was observed when the ratio of the transverse compression to the longitudinal one p y p x was 0 1 0 41 1 and 0 67 1 respectively fig 23 shows the effect of cracks on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the loading condition when the crack is near the stiffener c x 1 0 c y 0 5 the ultimate strength reduction rate increases as the p y p x value increases this may be because the stress concentration around the cracks caused by the longitudinal compression is relieved to some extent by the transverse compression therefore when the crack center position is not near the stiffener the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate is not significant 4 empirical formula 4 1 prediction equations as shown in fig 16 uncertainties about the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the crack relative location are very high therefore it is difficult to propose a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the change of all parameters in this paper we propose a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack relative location and the crack relative length when the ultimate strength reduction rate is severe that is when the crack orientation angle is zero and the further crack center is under the longitudinal stiffener fig 24 shows the geometric presentation of the crack location used to propose the prediction equation and fig 25 shows the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the crack location and the crack length as can be seen from fig 25 all curves have a cosine function pattern and the amplitude gradually increases while changing from 0 2 to 0 75 additionally the period length becomes 1 5π while changing from zero to 0 75 thus the paper proposes a prediction equation that can predict the ultimate strength reduction rate of the continuous stiffened panel with a crack as follows origin pro 2017 is used to implement function fitting 8 σ u c σ u a 1 a 2 cos 2 c x π where 9 a 1 0 427 c l 3 0 612 c l 2 0 400 c l 1 054

comparison according to the results of the fitting implementation by origin pro 2017 the standard error of the fitness is 1 592e 7 and the mean r square cod is 0 999 this shows that the proposed prediction equation is accurate 5 conclusions in the paper the influence of various parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the strength limit of a continuous stiffened panel with a crack simultaneously subjected to both in plane compression and lateral pressure was investigated in a numerical method in nonlinear finite element analysis a two span 1 2 1 1 2 model is modeled and the periodic boundary conditions bc1 and the symmetric boundary conditions bc2 were applied to consider initial imperfections in nonlinear finite element analysis and to easily apply the periodic and symmetric boundary conditions a plug in that can be executed in abaqus has been developed using python language the accuracy of the used finite element model was verified and the effects of the crack parameters loading conditions and the plate parameters on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the continuous stiffened panel with a crack were investigated finally a prediction equation capable of predicting the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the change of the crack relative length and the crack relative location under the condition with the crack position limited and the other parameters kept constant was proposed and verified for its accuracy in the present study several conclusions were reached through the investigation results 1 uncertainties about the change in the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel according to the crack relative location are very high the notable thing is that when the crack center is near the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength reduction becomes very remarkable if the direction of the longitudinal stiffener matches the crack orientation furthermore the collapse line of the cracked stiffened panel tends to include the crack location 2 the effect of the crack longitudinal location position on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the stiffened panel is largely dependent on the initial deflection of the plate the smaller the longitudinal location value of the crack center the closer the trend of the ultimate strength reduction rate curve to a sine function 3 the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the transverse location value of the crack center increases the effect of the increase in the crack length or the orientation angle on the ultimate strength reduction rate becomes more severe as the transverse coordinate of the crack center increases when the relative transverse location of the crack center is zero the ultimate strength reduction rate decreases as the plate slenderness decreases if the plate thickness increases however if the relative transverse location of the crack center is larger than 0 5 the decrease in the ultimate strength reduction according to the decrease in the plate slenderness is not clear in investigating the influence of parameters on the ultimate strength of a stiffened panel with a crack the crack location is very important and the ultimate strength reduction rate is largely dependent on the initial deflection of the plate additionally as the cracks are located closer to the longitudinal stiffener the ultimate strength decreases more severely considering that most of the cracks occur near the stiffener during the fabrication procedure a thorough protective measure against the occurrence of cracks is required when assembling

20572,this paper summarizes all detailed results obtained from a series of shake table testings of a 1 20 scale container crane with friction and pin boundary conditions at the seismic research and test center in south korea and compared them with those from its finite element analysis fea the tested 1 20 scale container crane was initially designed based on the similitude laws with scaling factors proportional to the sectional properties and dynamic characteristics of a commonly used full scale crane to determine experimental natural frequencies of the tested crane a white noise test was conducted on the shake table then three different ground motions including manjil iran abbar nahanni canada and mineral virginia were individually applied in a trolley boom direction to the crane placed on the shake table to secure its seismic responses especially for derailment uplift and drift a finite element model of the tested crane was also created using multi frame elements available in commercially used fea software and simulated to replicate the testing results key findings revealed that the effect of the boundary conditions did not significantly affect the mode shapes and frequencies of the tested crane but the drifts of the crane with the friction boundary condition resulting from each of the ground motions changed substantially as compared to those from the crane with the pin boundary condition the derailment displacement at the landside legs of the tested crane was also found to be 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes and 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake the results from the testing were largely in good agreement with those from the fea keywords earthquake derailment uplift drift scaling law response spectrum boundary condition 1 introduction over the past few years some coastal countries have been adversely affected by major earthquakes resulting in severe damage to container cranes in particular during the kobe earthquake in 1995 container cranes used for loading and unloading of containers at the port of kobe in japan suffered wide scale damage with a number of them suffering complete collapse japan society of mechanical engineers 1996 some cranes had uplifted and derailed legs while some of them completely collapsed at the worst chang 2000 showed that the kobe earthquake caused an estimated total of us 10 billion loss that was caused to the economy of japan at that time it is therefore necessary to study the seismic behavior of container cranes for damage mitigation following earthquakes there have been some studies kosbab 2010 tran et al 2018a 2018b to examine the seismic behaviors of crane structures by means of finite element analysis fea even though numerous research efforts seo and linzell 2010 2012 2013a 2013b seo and park 2017 rogers and seo 2017 seo and rogers 2017 seo 2013 mangalathu et al 2018 jeon et al 2016 padgett et al 2010 ramanathan et al 2015 have been devoted to the seismic performance evaluation of other large scale infrastructures such as bridges over the several decades huh et al 2019 determined the seismic response of a container crane subjected to moderate and strong earthquakes and considered the derailment and uplift using a frictional boundary condition through the fea it was found that the seismic displacement of the portal frames increased due to the derailment and uplifting under the frictional boundary although the total base shear was reduced kosbab 2010 also studied the seismic behavior of a container using 2d and 3d feas it was reported that some hypothesis and mathematical interpolation was incorporated into the feas to determine the uplift threshold of crane legs kobayashi et al 2004 performed an fea of a 1 8 scale crane model to consider the nonlinear seismic response of container crane with the uplift and derailment behavior of wheels indicating that the contact forces of wheels and rails could be expressed by a spring and damper forces and that the crane response would be affected by the uplift and derailment most studies azeloglu et al 2014 jacobs 2010 jin and li 2012 kanayama and kashiwazaki 1998 kobayashi et al 2004 nguyen et al 2021 that attempted to determine the seismic response or dynamic characteristics of container cranes have focused on shake table testing using scaled down cranes loaded with ground motions kanayama et al kanayama and kashiwazaki 1998 investigated derailment buckling of legs and elastic state of container cranes performed on the shake table testing with ground motions along the trolley boom direction on a 1 25 and a 1 8 scale cranes jacobs 2010 also performed a shake table testing on a 1 20 scale container crane with a boundary condition using friction disks and reported that the boundary condition affected the seismic response of the scaled down container crane when the uplift occurred azeloglu et al 2014 examined the seismic response of a container crane by shake table testings and then developed a mathematical model from the results of the testings it has been found that the mathematical model could predict the corresponding seismic response of crane however it should be noted that the mathematical model did not include the derailment between wheel rail connections jin et al jin and li 2012 designed a 1 50 scale container crane for shake table testing and conducted a hammering test as well to determine its natural fundamental frequencies and corresponding mode shapes the results indicated that the scale model was able to reflect the natural fundamental frequencies and mode shape of the full sized crane with a small margin of difference this paper aimed at investigating of the seismic behavior of a container crane through its 1 20 scale crane on shake table testing and fea specifically the paper examined the effect of the uplift and derailment on the seismic behavior of the 1 20 scale crane which is followed by details on how to manufacture the 1 20 scale crane from the full sized crane based on the similitude laws to efficiently delve into its seismic response dynamic characteristics of the scale crane were captured in terms of natural frequency and mode shape by a white noise test and then the seismic responses such as displacement acceleration uplift and derailment of legs were determined by the shake table testing the testing results were compared with those acquired from the fea and the important conclusions made based on all the results were summarized 2 similitude law based crane design to determine the seismic response of a scale container crane reflecting that of the full sized crane appropriate scale factors are required initially the similitude relations in this study were developed according to the basis of the buckingham s pi theorem which has been widely applied to shake table tests li et al 2019 coutinho et al 2016 harris and sabnis 1999 krawinkler et al 1978 for a scaled crane the solution equation of this theorem for some physical quantities of interest is given as equations 1 and 2 1 f x 1 x 2 x n 0 2 g π 1 π 2 π m 0 where the symbol π is the dimensionless products of physical quantities x 1 x 2 x n and m is a function of n r independent dimensionless products that could be derived from the physical quantities overall it states that the number of dimensionless products m is equivalent to the difference between the physical variables n and the fundamental measures r that are determined the theory for building a 1 20 scale crane is based on the fact that the physical laws of nature are the same for the full sized and scale cranes the complete similarity between the full sized and scale cranes could be achieved when the dimensionless products π 1 π m are identical both on full sized and scale models 3 π 1 p π 1 m π m p π m m from equation 3 the fundamental and secondary scale factors for the physical variables could be deduced the response of crane under seismic loads is determined by a function of the time dependent forces impacting on a structure the force is the inertia force that is a function between the acceleration and concentrated mass the resistance force that is a product of the stiffness and displacement of the crane in the applied force direction and the energy loss of damping forces the scale factors are determined from equation 4 and are used to convert the quantities from the full sized crane to the scaled crane 4 s l l l s t t t s m m m s a a a s e e e s q q q where s l s t s m s a s e s q are the scale factors of dimension time mass acceleration elastic and force respectively note that the numerator marked in uppercases in equation 4 indicates the quantities applied for the full sized crane while the denominators symbolized in lowercases represent the quantities applied for the scale crane three types of structural model can be applied for the transition from the full sized crane to the scale crane true model adequate model and distorted model the true model which keeps the similarity between full sized and scale cranes is based on every requirement by a proper dimensional analysis the adequate model maintains first order similarity when it is possible to reason that some of the requirements by the proper dimensional analysis are of second order importance the distorted model does not satisfy one or more of the first order requirement by the proper dimensional analysis the synthetic of scale factors for modeling of the scale crane under seismic loads is presented in table 1 harris and sabnis 1999 in relation to artificial mass and gravity forces the similitude laws described in table 1 have been used to produce the structural properties adequately krawinkler et al 1978 considerable achievements have been adopted for investigating reduced scaled structures and associated structural components mills et al 1979 on shake table tests where additional materials were added to make the required density of the scale structures the scaling laws for artificial mass simulation in this table was applied to modeling of the scale crane for this study according to the performance based seismic crane design

asce copri 61 14 2014 the drift of portal frame and uplift and derailment of wheels are considered essential factors to evaluate the seismic behavior of crane appropriately in this study therefore the uplift and derailment of wheels and drift of the portal frame were studied in detail to evaluate the seismic response of a container crane subjected to seismic loads it is clear that the stiffness of the main parts such as portal frames and seaside legs can be used to determine the drift of the portal frame while the uplift and derailment of wheels can be affected by the stiffness of these parts and inertial forces can be determined by mass and acceleration for these reasons three independent dimensionless quantities encompassing geometric length acceleration and elastic modulus were chosen and used for establishing the scaling laws for the scale crane physical quantities according to an adequate model which is the artificial mass simulation the dimensions of a shake table used for this work at the seismic center in south korea where the testing was carried out are 2 5 m 2 5 m thus the scale factor for the geometric length s l is chosen as s l 20 gravity and inertial forces are critical to the uplift and derailment of wheels and the shake table can withstand an acceleration up to 10 g therefore the scale factor for the acceleration s a is taken as s a 1 for convenient calculation the scale factor for the elastic modulus s e is also taken s e 1 since the same steel material is used in both the full sized and scale cranes the mass of the scale crane is obtained by using a scale factor of s m 400 table 2 summarizes the important scale factors for designing a 1 20 scale crane used for this study 3 shake table testing program this section provides the details on the shake table testing of the 1 20 scale crane the scale crane boundary condition and instrumentation setup along with input ground motions applied to the crane are presented in the following subsections 3 1 1 20 scale crane a container crane located at the gwangyang port in south korea was adopted as the full sized crane in this study as shown in fig 1 the crane has a mass of about 1 175 tons a total height of 78 m from the rails to the top of the container crane 130 m length of the trolley boom girder 17 5 m height of the portal beam and 30 5 m width of rail span the total mass of crane was from two sources the mass of the crane s frame was 885 tons and the mass of 290 tons comprising the mass of other components including machinery house drive trucks trolley girder end tie boom end tie stowed pins and cable reel the 1 20 scale crane was built according to the similitude laws coupled with the scale factors based on the full sized crane note the full sized crane was made up of tube sections and built up stiffened box sections thus the basic sections of the scale crane were constructed of hollow rectangular circular tube sections which were deduced according to the scaled moment inertia the forestays and backstays were made with steel cables that had an equivalent axial stiffness to the corresponding scaled member fig 2 shows the built 1 20 scale crane with its added masses upon the mass scale factor the required weight of the scale crane converted is 2 939 kg while its self weight was only 235 5 kg a total of additional 2703 5 kg of non structural mass was designed and added in two ways 1 the additional masses made with steel were located at different locations on the trolley boom girders and beams e g apex beam and 2 lead ingots were placed on the portal frame upper and lower leg of the crane sill beams where lumped masses are inappropriate due to second order effects related to their large deformations it should be noted that the added steel masses were connected to the girder and or beams by both welding and bolts the welding was 6 mm fillet welding with electrodes having a minimum weld tensile strength of 482 mpa while the bolts were made with a325 bolts having a diameter of 16 mm and tensile strength of 620 mpa the lead ingot was attached to the beams by steel ties with the length of 610 mm and minimum loop tensile strength of 1112 n in an attempt to minimize the possibility of the change in stiffness of the crane components the locations of added masses were adjusted so that the center of gravity mass of crane specimen coincided with the center of gravity mass of the full sized crane converted by the scaling law 3 2 boundary condition to investigate the effects of boundary condition on the seismic response of scale crane on the shake table the two boundaries encompassing friction and pin boundaries see fig 3 were considered following the recommendations from kosbab 2010 and jacobs 2010 and installed the friction boundary allows crane legs to undergo uplift and derailment under large seismic excitations these phenomena do not affect the bearing capacity of crane but it requires a significant time investment to repair by the use of mobile cranes and jacking systems to reposition the wheels back onto the crane rails before the crane becomes operable therefore the derailment state is defined as one of the seismic performance levels following the guidelines stipulated by the federal emergency management agency fema federal emergency management agency fema hazus mr4 2003 and the port and airport research institute pari port and airport research institute pari 2009 to represent the boundary for the scale crane grinding disks were placed between the crane legs and the base plate the frictional coefficient of grinding disks was 0 7 which was determined by an inclined friction test between the grinding disk and clean steel the friction boundary of the scale crane is shown in fig 3 a on the other hand the pin boundary can withstand both vertical and horizontal forces but not a moment the pin boundary is fabricated as displayed in fig 3 b where the bottom of the support was connected to the base plate by four bolts with a nominal size of 36 mm and the tensile strength of 830 mpa note the pin boundary does not allow the legs to have uplift and derailment under strong ground motions 3 3 instrumentation the shake table testing of the scale crane was performed at the seismic research and test center pusan national university in south korea the triaxial shake table with dimensions 2 5 m 2 5 m capable of carrying a maximum of 10 tones payload was used for this testing the triaxial shake table and its specifications are shown in table 3 and fig 4 to capture seismic responses of the scale crane during the testing seven accelerometers a1 through a7 and six linear variable displacement transformers lvdts with a camera nikon d5500 having 50 mm lens d1 through d6 were installed on critical sections of the crane as shown in fig 5 a and b in this figure the green rectangular marked a indicates the location of accelerometers and the red triangular marked d indicates the location of the displacement all accelerations were measured in the x y and z axes while all displacements were captured in the x axis it is noted that the x axis parallels to the longitudinal direction of trolley boom girder y axis to the transverse direction of trolley boom girder and z axis to the vertical direction for example a2 a5 and a6 are placed at the connection of portal beam and frame of legs on the landside and seaside to measure the accelerations in all the axes and d1 d2 and d3 are placed at the connection of portal beam and frame of legs to measure portal displacements in the x axis 3 4 input ground motions for this work input ground motions representing seismic events in the target region in south korea were selected from a list of earthquakes that were categorized into the domestic and overseas intra plate earthquake records generated based on the korean standard design spectrum kim et al 2016 due to time and cost limitations three ground motions were used for the shake table testing as listed in table 4 according to the seismic design guideline recommended by the american society of civil engineers asce sei 7 05 american society of civil engineers asce sei 7 05 2003 all the selected ground motions were matched to the target design response spectrum stipulated by the korean design standard kim 2017 architectural institue of korea 2016 via seismomatch software seismosoft 2018 as shown in fig 6 a three grey light blue purple dash curves represent the response spectrum of the original three ground motions were matched to the red curve the korean elastic response spectrum this figure includes three matching response spectra of ground motions marked with a green round dot curve fitted to the korean design spectrum as shown in fig 6 b the ground motions marked green round dot line corresponding to the matching response spectrum are adjusted in terms of accelerations and time scale factors in order to obtain input ground motions marked red line for shake table testing again these adjusted ground motions in time were applied to the scale crane in the trolley boom direction single direction ox axis to determine its seismic responses 4 test results and discussion this section provides the results obtained from the shake table testing on the 1 20 scale crane with two different boundary conditions details on the natural frequencies of crane the derailment and uplift responses and the drift of portal frame are presented herein 4 1 natural frequency a white noise test was initially carried out to obtain the natural frequencies and equivalent mode shapes of the 1 20 scale crane that serves as the basis to characterize its dynamics during the test a vibrator was employed to vibrate the scale crane at a broad range of selected frequencies the vibrator s frequencies varied from 0 5 hz to 50 hz until the steady state acceleration amplitude of the crane was consistently measured as shown in fig 7 frequency response curves in the form of acceleration amplitude versus frequency were created for the first three mode shapes within matlab code irvine 2019 with the frequency quantities measured from the test this figure includes the frequency response curves for the first three mode shapes with friction and pin boundaries the three natural frequencies were determined for the most significant mode shapes of the scale crane encompassing two torsion modes of the frame for the first and second mode shapes 1 and 2 and a portal sway mode for the third mode shape as depicted in fig 8 note the natural frequencies of the scale crane were equal to the vibrator s frequency at resonance the measured frequencies for the first and second mode shapes between friction and pin boundary conditions were identical although the difference in the percentage between the friction and pin boundary conditions was only 2 for the third mode shape this difference is not significant to consider when analyzing mode shapes of the scale crane this difference can be attributed to the fact that the coefficients of sliding friction applied to the friction boundary and the coefficient of rolling friction for the pin boundary were different 4 2 derailment and uplift response derailment and uplift responses of the scale crane were recorded through the installed lvdts and cameras when conducting its shake table testing of scale crane under the friction boundary condition it is noted that the derailment and uplift responses were able to be recorded because the friction boundary allowed for movement in both the horizontal and vertical directions the derailment responses indicated the displacements of the crane legs measured at lvdt d5 see fig 5 in the horizontal direction the displacements of the crane legs were determined through the absolute displacements of the shake table and a critical point on the leg as shown in equation 5 5 r d i s p a b l e g d i s p a b s h a k e d i s p where r disp is the relative displacement of the leg ab leg disp is the absolute displacement of the leg ab shake disp is the absolute displacement of the shake table the absolute displacements of the shake table and leg were measured by the cameras and lvdts in which the displacements from the cameras were determined based on the face detection and tracking using the kanade lucas tomasi klt algorithm in matlab viola and jones 2001 lucas and kanade 1981 guru and dinesh 2004 galuk et al 2018 kalal et al 2010 this algorithm was capable of tracking the movements of the crane legs and measuring corresponding displacements through the face detection tracking system the uplift response was recorded using vertical displacements of crane s legs through the lvdt d6 see fig 5 the derailment displacements of the crane legs compared to the shake table are shown in fig 9 it appears that the displacements of the crane legs subjected to each of the input ground motions are slightly different although the response spectra of the ground motions are consistent with the elastic response spectrum created according to the korean standards architectural institue of korea 2016 specifically the displacement causing the crane leg derailment is 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes while the derailment is 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake under these earthquakes all the derailments occurred at the landside legs recorded during the testing it is important to note that the eccentricity values measured from the center of gravity of the scale crane to the seaside leg and landside leg are 57 cm and 95 6 cm respectively therefore the derailment occurred at the landside crane legs due to the large eccentricity of the entire scale crane from the center of the landside legs fig 10 shows the detailed derailment of the landside leg in the shake table testing the uplift displacements of the landside legs measured from lvdt d6 during the shake table test are shown in fig 11 it appears that there is only one occurrence of uplift in the mineral virginia earthquake while the nahanni canada and manjil iran earthquakes caused three and seven uplifts respectively it is noteworthy that the displacements named effect of derailment refer to fig 11 resulting from the derailment of crane legs make the measured uplift values larger especially for the manjil iran earthquake compared to the others 4 3 drift of portal frame the drifts of the tested scale crane were able to be measured at the end of portal frames d1 and top of the upper legs d4 as shown in fig 5 b it is necessary to mention that the drifts at the end of the portal frames and the top of the upper legs give information on how much deformation occurs in the portal sway mode and entire frame structures in the past work the major deformation and plastic hinges occurred at the end of portal frames permanent international association for navigation congresses pianc 2001 thus the location of the portal frame was chosen to investigate the drifts of the tested container crane with different boundary conditions including pin and friction during the test the fundamental mode of the container crane is the portal sway mode in which the participating mass in translation in the trolley boom direction is 91 as such the relative displacement of the portal frame compared to the shake table in the trolley boom direction was defined as the drift of portal frame as shown in equation 6 6 r p o r t a l d i s p a b p o r t a l d i s p a b s h a k e d i s p where r portal disp is the relative displacement of the portal frame ab portal disp is the absolute displacement of the portal frame ab shake disp is the absolute displacement of the shake table the drifts of the scale crane tested with the manjil iran nahanni canada mineral virginia earthquakes recorded at the location d1 see fig 5b of the seaside portal frame by the camera and lvdt sensors can be seen in fig 12 a b and 12c respectively it is apparent that there is a considerable difference in the drift between the friction and pin boundaries for each of the input ground motions overall the maximum relative displacements of the friction boundary are larger than those for the pin boundary specifically the maximum displacement of the crane with the friction boundary induced by manjil iran earthquake is 14 7 mm while the pin boundary is 6 9 mm which means that the difference in the percentage is 53 note the negative displacement indicates that the point moves at the landside compared to the original position for nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes the portal drifts of the friction boundary are 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm respectively while corresponding values for the pin boundary are 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm the percentage differences between friction and pin boundaries for nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes are 50 and 52 individually occurrence of the significant percentage differences indicated that the effects of the boundary condition had critically affected the drifts of portal frame this is because the friction boundary allows the crane legs to move in both the horizontal and vertical directions resulting in the portal frame derailment and uplift simultaneously but the pin boundary does not cause both cases furthermore the portal frame of the friction boundary maintains a residual deformation after each of the input earthquakes applied to the tested crane leading to the bowing and buckling of the lower and upper legs the manjil iran and mineral virginia earthquakes caused the largest and least residual deformation of 6 44 mm and 3 95 mm while the deformation resulting from nahanni canada earthquake is 4 73 mm 5 fea of tested scale crane seismic responses of the tested scale crane were examined by fea with the input earthquakes used in the shake table testing fea results in terms of frequency drift and derailment were compared to those acquired from the shake table testing in the following subsections 5 1 model description a fea model of the tested scale crane was developed using sap2000 software as shown in fig 13 the major components in the scale crane such as landside and seaside legs trolley girders and boom girders were idealized using frame elements available in sap2000 while the forestay and backstay were modeled with cables all masses were added to apex beam trolley girder support beam trolley girder boom girder landside and seaside legs sill beams and portal beams as either concentrated or distributed forces in the fea model the connections between trolley boom girders and trolley girder support beams were created utilizing rigid link elements as discussed above the derailments and uplift of the tested crane were the dominant failure modes observed in the shake table testing thus the fea model allowed for the derailment and uplift by making appropriate adjustments on the boundary conditions in this model the friction isolator was applied to idealize the link between rails and wheels of crane based on the modeling recommendations made by jaradat jaradat et al 2013 and huh huh et al 2019 tran et al 2019 the friction isolator has a compression property with a spring constant of 2189 kn cm in the axial direction and a frictional property with a spring constant of 2189 kn cm along with an additional friction coefficient of 0 75 as shown in fig 13 the axial movement was restrained when the link was in compression but the link provided no restraint to axial movement when the link was in tension for the two shear directions the link enabled the shear deformation but only when the shear was greater than the axial force multiplied by a coefficient of friction to compare the seismic responses of the scale crane obtained from the shake table testing and fea the same set of input ground motions used for the testing was utilized for the fea simulation it is noteworthy that each of the input ground motions recorded by an accelerometer sensor placed on the shake table was applied to the fea model 5 2 comparison with test results 5 2 1 natural frequency the natural frequencies of the scale crane were analyzed by the fem model coupled with ritz vectors method wilson 2004 as in the shake table testing the first three natural frequencies deemed to be the most significant modes were acquired from the fem similar to the results from the testing these modes comprise two torsional modes for modes 1 and 2 and a portal sway mode for mode 3 these three natural frequencies and modal participating mass ratios of the scale crane are detailed in table 5 and corresponding frequencies obtained from the testing are included in this table it turns out that the frequencies determined from the shake table testing and the fea are similar in practice specifically the differences between the frequencies estimated by the fea and shake table testing are 15 3 mode 1 and 6 2 mode 2 for friction boundary and pin boundary and 10 3 and 13 3 mode 3 respectively the differences can be attributed to the fact that the masses added for the tested scale crane was simply idealized using concentrated or distributed forces in the fea model and the backstay and forestay cables see fig 13 in the testing that was controlled through turnbuckles were considered a straight cable element 5 2 2 derailment of crane legs the seismic responses of crane legs for the scale crane were recorded during the fea simulation with the friction isolator on boundary conditions similar to the responses of the crane legs in the testing the derailment of the landside legs were observed fig 14 a through 14c illustrate all quantifiable derailment results from the fea and shake table testing for each of the input earthquakes it is found that the testing and fea show a similar trend although there is a slight difference in the amplitude of derailment for the results from the manjil iran earthquake the derailment values of crane legs are 12 1 mm and 12 5 mm for the fea and shake table testing respectively the derailment measured from the shake table testing resulting from nahanni canada earthquake is 12 5 mm which is slightly lower than that of 12 9 mm from the fea and the derailment values for mineral virginia earthquake are 12 3 mm and 11 5 mm for the fea and shake table testing an average value of the derailments from all the testings is 12 2 mm which is negligibly less than the corresponding fea value of 12 3 mm indicating a marginal 2 3 difference 5 2 3 drift of portal frame drifts of the portal frame in the crane model were measured to compare with the results obtained at the location d1 from the shake table testing as stated before the relative displacement of the portal frame in comparison with the shake table in the trolley boom direction was deemed as the drift fig 15 a through 15c show the relative displacements so called drifts of the seaside portal frame between the shake table testing and fea from each of the input earthquakes in each of the figures the results from the shake table testing and fea are similar in terms of overall displacement patterns but the maximum displacements are seen to vary between them over time for the manjil iran earthquake the maximum displacements of the shake table testing and fea are 14 7 mm and 15 3 mm correspondingly while those obtained from the nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes by the fea are 14 2 mm and 13 1 mm which are higher than the testing results of 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm respectively respective average maximum displacements to the fea and shake table testing are 14 2 mm and 12 1 mm indicating that the difference in on average maximum displacement is 14 7 it is worthwhile to note that the derailment of crane legs has an influence on the displacement of the portal frame resulting in its residual deformation after the earthquakes applied to the fe model as observed in the shake table testing the average residual deformations are 6 4 mm and 5 0 mm for the fea and shake table testing from all the earthquakes demonstrating a difference of 22 6 it should be also noted that each of the residual deformation values for the fea and shake table testing for the manjil iran nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes are included in fig 14a through 14c as stated before the simplified modeling of the backstay and forestay cables and added mass on the fea can contribute to the differences in drift between the fea and testing 6 conclusions this paper presented the seismic responses from the shake table testing conducted on the 1 20 scale container crane designed from its full scale crane located at gwangyang port in south korea according to the similitude law for the testing three actual ground motions i e manjil iran abbar nahanni canada and mineral virginia were one at a time applied in the trolley boom direction to the crane placed on the shake table and respective seismic responses were measured using accelerometers and displacement sensors along with cameras installed on critical sections of the crane a detailed comparison of the seismic responses of the tested crane with the friction and pin boundary conditions was performed in terms of derailment and uplift responses along with drift of the portal frame furthermore the seismic responses of the tested crane were examined by finite element analysis fea with the input ground motions used in the shake table testing major findings obtained from this work indicate as below the effect of the boundary conditions on the mode shape acquired from both the testing and fea was found to be insignificant through the analysis of the shake table testing results the three natural frequencies were identified for the most significant mode shapes two torsion modes for the first and second mode shapes and a portal sway mode for the third mode shape the shake table testing demonstrated that the maximum difference was only 2 for the third mode shape between the use of pin and friction boundary conditions the mode shapes and frequencies obtained from the shake table testing were in good agreement with those from the fea the derailment displacement at the landside legs of the tested crane was found to be 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes and 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake one three and seven uplifts of the landside legs loaded with the mineral virginia nahanni canada and manjil iran earthquake occurred during the tests under these ground motions all the derailments and uplifts occurred at the landside legs during the testing due to the larger eccentricity from the center of landside legs compared to those measured from the center of seaside legs the fea were able to accurately predict the seismic responses of the tested crane especially for the derailment of the crane legs indicating the percentage difference between the fea and testing of only 2 3 the maximum portal drifts of the tested crane with the friction boundary were observed to be 14 7 mm 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm whereas the values corresponding to the pin boundary were 6 9 mm 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm for manjil iran nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes respectively the portal frame of the tested crane with the friction boundary also resulted in the residual deformation of 6 44 mm 3 95 mm and 4 73 mm for manjil iran mineral virginia and nahanni canada earthquakes it was found that the fea was capable of fairly forecasting the portal drift and the residual deformation acquired from the shake table testing credit

20572,this paper summarizes all detailed results obtained from a series of shake table testings of a 1 20 scale container crane with friction and pin boundary conditions at the seismic research and test center in south korea and compared them with those from its finite element analysis fea the tested 1 20 scale container crane was initially designed based on the similitude laws with scaling factors proportional to the sectional properties and dynamic characteristics of a commonly used full scale crane to determine experimental natural frequencies of the tested crane a white noise test was conducted on the shake table then three different ground motions including manjil iran abbar nahanni canada and mineral virginia were individually applied in a trolley boom direction to the crane placed on the shake table to secure its seismic responses especially for derailment uplift and drift a finite element model of the tested crane was also created using multi frame elements available in commercially used fea software and simulated to replicate the testing results key findings revealed that the effect of the boundary conditions did not significantly affect the mode shapes and frequencies of the tested crane but the drifts of the crane with the friction boundary condition resulting from each of the ground motions changed substantially as compared to those from the crane with the pin boundary condition the derailment displacement at the landside legs of the tested crane was also found to be 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes and 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake the results from the testing were largely in good agreement with those from the fea keywords earthquake derailment uplift drift scaling law response spectrum boundary condition 1 introduction over the past few years some coastal countries have been adversely affected by major earthquakes resulting in severe damage to container cranes in particular during the kobe earthquake in 1995 container cranes used for loading and unloading of containers at the port of kobe in japan suffered wide scale damage with a number of them suffering complete collapse japan society of mechanical engineers 1996 some cranes had uplifted and derailed legs while some of them completely collapsed at the worst chang 2000 showed that the kobe earthquake caused an estimated total of us 10 billion loss that was caused to the economy of japan at that time it is therefore necessary to study the seismic behavior of container cranes for damage mitigation following earthquakes there have been some studies kosbab 2010 tran et al 2018a 2018b to examine the seismic behaviors of crane structures by means of finite element analysis fea even though numerous research efforts seo and linzell 2010 2012 2013a 2013b seo and park 2017 rogers and seo 2017 seo and rogers 2017 seo 2013 mangalathu et al 2018 jeon et al 2016 padgett et al 2010 ramanathan et al 2015 have been devoted to the seismic performance evaluation of other large scale infrastructures such as bridges over the several decades huh et al 2019 determined the seismic response of a container crane subjected to moderate and strong earthquakes and considered the derailment and uplift using a frictional boundary condition through the fea it was found that the seismic displacement of the portal frames increased due to the derailment and uplifting under the frictional boundary although the total base shear was reduced kosbab 2010 also studied the seismic behavior of a container using 2d and 3d feas it was reported that some hypothesis and mathematical interpolation was incorporated into the feas to determine the uplift threshold of crane legs kobayashi et al 2004 performed an fea of a 1 8 scale crane model to consider the nonlinear seismic response of container crane with the uplift and derailment behavior of wheels indicating that the contact forces of wheels and rails could be expressed by a spring and damper forces and that the crane response would be affected by the uplift and derailment most studies azeloglu et al 2014 jacobs 2010 jin and li 2012 kanayama and kashiwazaki 1998 kobayashi et al 2004 nguyen et al 2021 that attempted to determine the seismic response or dynamic characteristics of container cranes have focused on shake table testing using scaled down cranes loaded with ground motions kanayama et al kanayama and kashiwazaki 1998 investigated derailment buckling of legs and elastic state of container cranes performed on the shake table testing with ground motions along the trolley boom direction on a 1 25 and a 1 8 scale cranes jacobs 2010 also performed a shake table testing on a 1 20 scale container crane with a boundary condition using friction disks and reported that the boundary condition affected the seismic response of the scaled down container crane when the uplift occurred azeloglu et al 2014 examined the seismic response of a container crane by shake table testings and then developed a mathematical model from the results of the testings it has been found that the mathematical model could predict the corresponding seismic response of crane however it should be noted that the mathematical model did not include the derailment between wheel rail connections jin et al jin and li 2012 designed a 1 50 scale container crane for shake table testing and conducted a hammering test as well to determine its natural fundamental frequencies and corresponding mode shapes the results indicated that the scale model was able to reflect the natural fundamental frequencies and mode shape of the full sized crane with a small margin of difference this paper aimed at investigating of the seismic behavior of a container crane through its 1 20 scale crane on shake table testing and fea specifically the paper examined the effect of the uplift and derailment on the seismic behavior of the 1 20 scale crane which is followed by details on how to manufacture the 1 20 scale crane from the full sized crane based on the similitude laws to efficiently delve into its seismic response dynamic characteristics of the scale crane were captured in terms of natural frequency and mode shape by a white noise test and then the seismic responses such as displacement acceleration uplift and derailment of legs were determined by the shake table testing the testing results were compared with those acquired from the fea and the important conclusions made based on all the results were summarized 2 similitude law based crane design to determine the seismic response of a scale container crane reflecting that of the full sized crane appropriate scale factors are required initially the similitude relations in this study were developed according to the basis of the buckingham s pi theorem which has been widely applied to shake table tests li et al 2019 coutinho et al 2016 harris and sabnis 1999 krawinkler et al 1978 for a scaled crane the solution equation of this theorem for some physical quantities of interest is given as equations 1 and 2 1 f x 1 x 2 x n 0 2 g π 1 π 2 π m 0 where the symbol π is the dimensionless products of physical quantities x 1 x 2 x n and m is a function of n r independent dimensionless products that could be derived from the physical quantities overall it states that the number of dimensionless products m is equivalent to the difference between the physical variables n and the fundamental measures r that are determined the theory for building a 1 20 scale crane is based on the fact that the physical laws of nature are the same for the full sized and scale cranes the complete similarity between the full sized and scale cranes could be achieved when the dimensionless products π 1 π m are identical both on full sized and scale models 3 π 1 p π 1 m π m p π m m from equation 3 the fundamental and secondary scale factors for the physical variables could be deduced the response of crane under seismic loads is determined by a function of the time dependent forces impacting on a structure the force is the inertia force that is a function between the acceleration and concentrated mass the resistance force that is a product of the stiffness and displacement of the crane in the applied force direction and the energy loss of damping forces the scale factors are determined from equation 4 and are used to convert the quantities from the full sized crane to the scaled crane 4 s l l l s t t t s m m m s a a a s e e e s q q q where s l s t s m s a s e s q are the scale factors of dimension time mass acceleration elastic and force respectively note that the numerator marked in uppercases in equation 4 indicates the quantities applied for the full sized crane while the denominators symbolized in lowercases represent the quantities applied for the scale crane three types of structural model can be applied for the transition from the full sized crane to the scale crane true model adequate model and distorted model the true model which keeps the similarity between full sized and scale cranes is based on every requirement by a proper dimensional analysis the adequate model maintains first order similarity when it is possible to reason that some of the requirements by the proper dimensional analysis are of second order importance the distorted model does not satisfy one or more of the first order requirement by the proper dimensional analysis the synthetic of scale factors for modeling of the scale crane under seismic loads is presented in table 1 harris and sabnis 1999 in relation to artificial mass and gravity forces the similitude laws described in table 1 have been used to produce the structural properties adequately krawinkler et al 1978 considerable achievements have been adopted for investigating reduced scaled structures and associated structural components mills et al 1979 on shake table tests where additional materials were added to make the required density of the scale structures the scaling laws for artificial mass simulation in this table was applied to modeling of the scale crane for this study according to the performance based seismic crane design

asce copri 61 14 2014 the drift of portal frame and uplift and derailment of wheels are considered essential factors to evaluate the seismic behavior of crane appropriately in this study therefore the uplift and derailment of wheels and drift of the portal frame were studied in detail to evaluate the seismic response of a container crane subjected to seismic loads it is clear that the stiffness of the main parts such as portal frames and seaside legs can be used to determine the drift of the portal frame while the uplift and derailment of wheels can be affected by the stiffness of these parts and inertial forces can be determined by mass and acceleration for these reasons three independent dimensionless quantities encompassing geometric length acceleration and elastic modulus were chosen and used for establishing the scaling laws for the scale crane physical quantities according to an adequate model which is the artificial mass simulation the dimensions of a shake table used for this work at the seismic center in south korea where the testing was carried out are 2 5 m 2 5 m thus the scale factor for the geometric length s l is chosen as s l 20 gravity and inertial forces are critical to the uplift and derailment of wheels and the shake table can withstand an acceleration up to 10 g therefore the scale factor for the acceleration s a is taken as s a 1 for convenient calculation the scale factor for the elastic modulus s e is also taken s e 1 since the same steel material is used in both the full sized and scale cranes the mass of the scale crane is obtained by using a scale factor of s m 400 table 2 summarizes the important scale factors for designing a 1 20 scale crane used for this study 3 shake table testing program this section provides the details on the shake table testing of the 1 20 scale crane the scale crane boundary condition and instrumentation setup along with input ground motions applied to the crane are presented in the following subsections 3 1 1 20 scale crane a container crane located at the gwangyang port in south korea was adopted as the full sized crane in this study as shown in fig 1 the crane has a mass of about 1 175 tons a total height of 78 m from the rails to the top of the container crane 130 m length of the trolley boom girder 17 5 m height of the portal beam and 30 5 m width of rail span the total mass of crane was from two sources the mass of the crane s frame was 885 tons and the mass of 290 tons comprising the mass of other components including machinery house drive trucks trolley girder end tie boom end tie stowed pins and cable reel the 1 20 scale crane was built according to the similitude laws coupled with the scale factors based on the full sized crane note the full sized crane was made up of tube sections and built up stiffened box sections thus the basic sections of the scale crane were constructed of hollow rectangular circular tube sections which were deduced according to the scaled moment inertia the forestays and backstays were made with steel cables that had an equivalent axial stiffness to the corresponding scaled member fig 2 shows the built 1 20 scale crane with its added masses upon the mass scale factor the required weight of the scale crane converted is 2 939 kg while its self weight was only 235 5 kg a total of additional 2703 5 kg of non structural mass was designed and added in two ways 1 the additional masses made with steel were located at different locations on the trolley boom girders and beams e g apex beam and 2 lead ingots were placed on the portal frame upper and lower leg of the crane sill beams where lumped masses are inappropriate due to second order effects related to their large deformations it should be noted that the added steel masses were connected to the girder and or beams by both welding and bolts the welding was 6 mm fillet welding with electrodes having a minimum weld tensile strength of 482 mpa while the bolts were made with a325 bolts having a diameter of 16 mm and tensile strength of 620 mpa the lead ingot was attached to the beams by steel ties with the length of 610 mm and minimum loop tensile strength of 1112 n in an attempt to minimize the possibility of the change in stiffness of the crane components the locations of added masses were adjusted so that the center of gravity mass of crane specimen coincided with the center of gravity mass of the full sized crane converted by the scaling law 3 2 boundary condition to investigate the effects of boundary condition on the seismic response of scale crane on the shake table the two boundaries encompassing friction and pin boundaries see fig 3 were considered following the recommendations from kosbab 2010 and jacobs 2010 and installed the friction boundary allows crane legs to undergo uplift and derailment under large seismic excitations these phenomena do not affect the bearing capacity of crane but it requires a significant time investment to repair by the use of mobile cranes and jacking systems to reposition the wheels back onto the crane rails before the crane becomes operable therefore the derailment state is defined as one of the seismic performance levels following the guidelines stipulated by the federal emergency management agency fema federal emergency management agency fema hazus mr4 2003 and the port and airport research institute pari port and airport research institute pari 2009 to represent the boundary for the scale crane grinding disks were placed between the crane legs and the base plate the frictional coefficient of grinding disks was 0 7 which was determined by an inclined friction test between the grinding disk and clean steel the friction boundary of the scale crane is shown in fig 3 a on the other hand the pin boundary can withstand both vertical and horizontal forces but not a moment the pin boundary is fabricated as displayed in fig 3 b where the bottom of the support was connected to the base plate by four bolts with a nominal size of 36 mm and the tensile strength of 830 mpa note the pin boundary does not allow the legs to have uplift and derailment under strong ground motions 3 3 instrumentation the shake table testing of the scale crane was performed at the seismic research and test center pusan national university in south korea the triaxial shake table with dimensions 2 5 m 2 5 m capable of carrying a maximum of 10 tones payload was used for this testing the triaxial shake table and its specifications are shown in table 3 and fig 4 to capture seismic responses of the scale crane during the testing seven accelerometers a1 through a7 and six linear variable displacement transformers lvdts with a camera nikon d5500 having 50 mm lens d1 through d6 were installed on critical sections of the crane as shown in fig 5 a and b in this figure the green rectangular marked a indicates the location of accelerometers and the red triangular marked d indicates the location of the displacement all accelerations were measured in the x y and z axes while all displacements were captured in the x axis it is noted that the x axis parallels to the longitudinal direction of trolley boom girder y axis to the transverse direction of trolley boom girder and z axis to the vertical direction for example a2 a5 and a6 are placed at the connection of portal beam and frame of legs on the landside and seaside to measure the accelerations in all the axes and d1 d2 and d3 are placed at the connection of portal beam and frame of legs to measure portal displacements in the x axis 3 4 input ground motions for this work input ground motions representing seismic events in the target region in south korea were selected from a list of earthquakes that were categorized into the domestic and overseas intra plate earthquake records generated based on the korean standard design spectrum kim et al 2016 due to time and cost limitations three ground motions were used for the shake table testing as listed in table 4 according to the seismic design guideline recommended by the american society of civil engineers asce sei 7 05 american society of civil engineers asce sei 7 05 2003 all the selected ground motions were matched to the target design response spectrum stipulated by the korean design standard kim 2017 architectural institue of korea 2016 via seismomatch software seismosoft 2018 as shown in fig 6 a three grey light blue purple dash curves represent the response spectrum of the original three ground motions were matched to the red curve the korean elastic response spectrum this figure includes three matching response spectra of ground motions marked with a green round dot curve fitted to the korean design spectrum as shown in fig 6 b the ground motions marked green round dot line corresponding to the matching response spectrum are adjusted in terms of accelerations and time scale factors in order to obtain input ground motions marked red line for shake table testing again these adjusted ground motions in time were applied to the scale crane in the trolley boom direction single direction ox axis to determine its seismic responses 4 test results and discussion this section provides the results obtained from the shake table testing on the 1 20 scale crane with two different boundary conditions details on the natural frequencies of crane the derailment and uplift responses and the drift of portal frame are presented herein 4 1 natural frequency a white noise test was initially carried out to obtain the natural frequencies and equivalent mode shapes of the 1 20 scale crane that serves as the basis to characterize its dynamics during the test a vibrator was employed to vibrate the scale crane at a broad range of selected frequencies the vibrator s frequencies varied from 0 5 hz to 50 hz until the steady state acceleration amplitude of the crane was consistently measured as shown in fig 7 frequency response curves in the form of acceleration amplitude versus frequency were created for the first three mode shapes within matlab code irvine 2019 with the frequency quantities measured from the test this figure includes the frequency response curves for the first three mode shapes with friction and pin boundaries the three natural frequencies were determined for the most significant mode shapes of the scale crane encompassing two torsion modes of the frame for the first and second mode shapes 1 and 2 and a portal sway mode for the third mode shape as depicted in fig 8 note the natural frequencies of the scale crane were equal to the vibrator s frequency at resonance the measured frequencies for the first and second mode shapes between friction and pin boundary conditions were identical although the difference in the percentage between the friction and pin boundary conditions was only 2 for the third mode shape this difference is not significant to consider when analyzing mode shapes of the scale crane this difference can be attributed to the fact that the coefficients of sliding friction applied to the friction boundary and the coefficient of rolling friction for the pin boundary were different 4 2 derailment and uplift response derailment and uplift responses of the scale crane were recorded through the installed lvdts and cameras when conducting its shake table testing of scale crane under the friction boundary condition it is noted that the derailment and uplift responses were able to be recorded because the friction boundary allowed for movement in both the horizontal and vertical directions the derailment responses indicated the displacements of the crane legs measured at lvdt d5 see fig 5 in the horizontal direction the displacements of the crane legs were determined through the absolute displacements of the shake table and a critical point on the leg as shown in equation 5 5 r d i s p a b l e g d i s p a b s h a k e d i s p where r disp is the relative displacement of the leg ab leg disp is the absolute displacement of the leg ab shake disp is the absolute displacement of the shake table the absolute displacements of the shake table and leg were measured by the cameras and lvdts in which the displacements from the cameras were determined based on the face detection and tracking using the kanade lucas tomasi klt algorithm in matlab viola and jones 2001 lucas and kanade 1981 guru and dinesh 2004 galuk et al 2018 kalal et al 2010 this algorithm was capable of tracking the movements of the crane legs and measuring corresponding displacements through the face detection tracking system the uplift response was recorded using vertical displacements of crane s legs through the lvdt d6 see fig 5 the derailment displacements of the crane legs compared to the shake table are shown in fig 9 it appears that the displacements of the crane legs subjected to each of the input ground motions are slightly different although the response spectra of the ground motions are consistent with the elastic response spectrum created according to the korean standards architectural institue of korea 2016 specifically the displacement causing the crane leg derailment is 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes while the derailment is 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake under these earthquakes all the derailments occurred at the landside legs recorded during the testing it is important to note that the eccentricity values measured from the center of gravity of the scale crane to the seaside leg and landside leg are 57 cm and 95 6 cm respectively therefore the derailment occurred at the landside crane legs due to the large eccentricity of the entire scale crane from the center of the landside legs fig 10 shows the detailed derailment of the landside leg in the shake table testing the uplift displacements of the landside legs measured from lvdt d6 during the shake table test are shown in fig 11 it appears that there is only one occurrence of uplift in the mineral virginia earthquake while the nahanni canada and manjil iran earthquakes caused three and seven uplifts respectively it is noteworthy that the displacements named effect of derailment refer to fig 11 resulting from the derailment of crane legs make the measured uplift values larger especially for the manjil iran earthquake compared to the others 4 3 drift of portal frame the drifts of the tested scale crane were able to be measured at the end of portal frames d1 and top of the upper legs d4 as shown in fig 5 b it is necessary to mention that the drifts at the end of the portal frames and the top of the upper legs give information on how much deformation occurs in the portal sway mode and entire frame structures in the past work the major deformation and plastic hinges occurred at the end of portal frames permanent international association for navigation congresses pianc 2001 thus the location of the portal frame was chosen to investigate the drifts of the tested container crane with different boundary conditions including pin and friction during the test the fundamental mode of the container crane is the portal sway mode in which the participating mass in translation in the trolley boom direction is 91 as such the relative displacement of the portal frame compared to the shake table in the trolley boom direction was defined as the drift of portal frame as shown in equation 6 6 r p o r t a l d i s p a b p o r t a l d i s p a b s h a k e d i s p where r portal disp is the relative displacement of the portal frame ab portal disp is the absolute displacement of the portal frame ab shake disp is the absolute displacement of the shake table the drifts of the scale crane tested with the manjil iran nahanni canada mineral virginia earthquakes recorded at the location d1 see fig 5b of the seaside portal frame by the camera and lvdt sensors can be seen in fig 12 a b and 12c respectively it is apparent that there is a considerable difference in the drift between the friction and pin boundaries for each of the input ground motions overall the maximum relative displacements of the friction boundary are larger than those for the pin boundary specifically the maximum displacement of the crane with the friction boundary induced by manjil iran earthquake is 14 7 mm while the pin boundary is 6 9 mm which means that the difference in the percentage is 53 note the negative displacement indicates that the point moves at the landside compared to the original position for nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes the portal drifts of the friction boundary are 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm respectively while corresponding values for the pin boundary are 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm the percentage differences between friction and pin boundaries for nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes are 50 and 52 individually occurrence of the significant percentage differences indicated that the effects of the boundary condition had critically affected the drifts of portal frame this is because the friction boundary allows the crane legs to move in both the horizontal and vertical directions resulting in the portal frame derailment and uplift simultaneously but the pin boundary does not cause both cases furthermore the portal frame of the friction boundary maintains a residual deformation after each of the input earthquakes applied to the tested crane leading to the bowing and buckling of the lower and upper legs the manjil iran and mineral virginia earthquakes caused the largest and least residual deformation of 6 44 mm and 3 95 mm while the deformation resulting from nahanni canada earthquake is 4 73 mm 5 fea of tested scale crane seismic responses of the tested scale crane were examined by fea with the input earthquakes used in the shake table testing fea results in terms of frequency drift and derailment were compared to those acquired from the shake table testing in the following subsections 5 1 model description a fea model of the tested scale crane was developed using sap2000 software as shown in fig 13 the major components in the scale crane such as landside and seaside legs trolley girders and boom girders were idealized using frame elements available in sap2000 while the forestay and backstay were modeled with cables all masses were added to apex beam trolley girder support beam trolley girder boom girder landside and seaside legs sill beams and portal beams as either concentrated or distributed forces in the fea model the connections between trolley boom girders and trolley girder support beams were created utilizing rigid link elements as discussed above the derailments and uplift of the tested crane were the dominant failure modes observed in the shake table testing thus the fea model allowed for the derailment and uplift by making appropriate adjustments on the boundary conditions in this model the friction isolator was applied to idealize the link between rails and wheels of crane based on the modeling recommendations made by jaradat jaradat et al 2013 and huh huh et al 2019 tran et al 2019 the friction isolator has a compression property with a spring constant of 2189 kn cm in the axial direction and a frictional property with a spring constant of 2189 kn cm along with an additional friction coefficient of 0 75 as shown in fig 13 the axial movement was restrained when the link was in compression but the link provided no restraint to axial movement when the link was in tension for the two shear directions the link enabled the shear deformation but only when the shear was greater than the axial force multiplied by a coefficient of friction to compare the seismic responses of the scale crane obtained from the shake table testing and fea the same set of input ground motions used for the testing was utilized for the fea simulation it is noteworthy that each of the input ground motions recorded by an accelerometer sensor placed on the shake table was applied to the fea model 5 2 comparison with test results 5 2 1 natural frequency the natural frequencies of the scale crane were analyzed by the fem model coupled with ritz vectors method wilson 2004 as in the shake table testing the first three natural frequencies deemed to be the most significant modes were acquired from the fem similar to the results from the testing these modes comprise two torsional modes for modes 1 and 2 and a portal sway mode for mode 3 these three natural frequencies and modal participating mass ratios of the scale crane are detailed in table 5 and corresponding frequencies obtained from the testing are included in this table it turns out that the frequencies determined from the shake table testing and the fea are similar in practice specifically the differences between the frequencies estimated by the fea and shake table testing are 15 3 mode 1 and 6 2 mode 2 for friction boundary and pin boundary and 10 3 and 13 3 mode 3 respectively the differences can be attributed to the fact that the masses added for the tested scale crane was simply idealized using concentrated or distributed forces in the fea model and the backstay and forestay cables see fig 13 in the testing that was controlled through turnbuckles were considered a straight cable element 5 2 2 derailment of crane legs the seismic responses of crane legs for the scale crane were recorded during the fea simulation with the friction isolator on boundary conditions similar to the responses of the crane legs in the testing the derailment of the landside legs were observed fig 14 a through 14c illustrate all quantifiable derailment results from the fea and shake table testing for each of the input earthquakes it is found that the testing and fea show a similar trend although there is a slight difference in the amplitude of derailment for the results from the manjil iran earthquake the derailment values of crane legs are 12 1 mm and 12 5 mm for the fea and shake table testing respectively the derailment measured from the shake table testing resulting from nahanni canada earthquake is 12 5 mm which is slightly lower than that of 12 9 mm from the fea and the derailment values for mineral virginia earthquake are 12 3 mm and 11 5 mm for the fea and shake table testing an average value of the derailments from all the testings is 12 2 mm which is negligibly less than the corresponding fea value of 12 3 mm indicating a marginal 2 3 difference 5 2 3 drift of portal frame drifts of the portal frame in the crane model were measured to compare with the results obtained at the location d1 from the shake table testing as stated before the relative displacement of the portal frame in comparison with the shake table in the trolley boom direction was deemed as the drift fig 15 a through 15c show the relative displacements so called drifts of the seaside portal frame between the shake table testing and fea from each of the input earthquakes in each of the figures the results from the shake table testing and fea are similar in terms of overall displacement patterns but the maximum displacements are seen to vary between them over time for the manjil iran earthquake the maximum displacements of the shake table testing and fea are 14 7 mm and 15 3 mm correspondingly while those obtained from the nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes by the fea are 14 2 mm and 13 1 mm which are higher than the testing results of 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm respectively respective average maximum displacements to the fea and shake table testing are 14 2 mm and 12 1 mm indicating that the difference in on average maximum displacement is 14 7 it is worthwhile to note that the derailment of crane legs has an influence on the displacement of the portal frame resulting in its residual deformation after the earthquakes applied to the fe model as observed in the shake table testing the average residual deformations are 6 4 mm and 5 0 mm for the fea and shake table testing from all the earthquakes demonstrating a difference of 22 6 it should be also noted that each of the residual deformation values for the fea and shake table testing for the manjil iran nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes are included in fig 14a through 14c as stated before the simplified modeling of the backstay and forestay cables and added mass on the fea can contribute to the differences in drift between the fea and testing 6 conclusions this paper presented the seismic responses from the shake table testing conducted on the 1 20 scale container crane designed from its full scale crane located at gwangyang port in south korea according to the similitude law for the testing three actual ground motions i e manjil iran abbar nahanni canada and mineral virginia were one at a time applied in the trolley boom direction to the crane placed on the shake table and respective seismic responses were measured using accelerometers and displacement sensors along with cameras installed on critical sections of the crane a detailed comparison of the seismic responses of the tested crane with the friction and pin boundary conditions was performed in terms of derailment and uplift responses along with drift of the portal frame furthermore the seismic responses of the tested crane were examined by finite element analysis fea with the input ground motions used in the shake table testing major findings obtained from this work indicate as below the effect of the boundary conditions on the mode shape acquired from both the testing and fea was found to be insignificant through the analysis of the shake table testing results the three natural frequencies were identified for the most significant mode shapes two torsion modes for the first and second mode shapes and a portal sway mode for the third mode shape the shake table testing demonstrated that the maximum difference was only 2 for the third mode shape between the use of pin and friction boundary conditions the mode shapes and frequencies obtained from the shake table testing were in good agreement with those from the fea the derailment displacement at the landside legs of the tested crane was found to be 12 5 mm for the manjil iran and nahanni canada earthquakes and 11 5 mm for the mineral virginia earthquake one three and seven uplifts of the landside legs loaded with the mineral virginia nahanni canada and manjil iran earthquake occurred during the tests under these ground motions all the derailments and uplifts occurred at the landside legs during the testing due to the larger eccentricity from the center of landside legs compared to those measured from the center of seaside legs the fea were able to accurately predict the seismic responses of the tested crane especially for the derailment of the crane legs indicating the percentage difference between the fea and testing of only 2 3 the maximum portal drifts of the tested crane with the friction boundary were observed to be 14 7 mm 12 1 mm and 9 5 mm whereas the values corresponding to the pin boundary were 6 9 mm 6 0 mm and 4 5 mm for manjil iran nahanni canada and mineral virginia earthquakes respectively the portal frame of the tested crane with the friction boundary also resulted in the residual deformation of 6 44 mm 3 95 mm and 4 73 mm for manjil iran mineral virginia and nahanni canada earthquakes it was found that the fea was capable of fairly forecasting the portal drift and the residual deformation acquired from the shake table testing credit

20573,as one of the essential types of clean energy renewable energy has great potential to achieve the self powered of wireless sensor the health of the bridge depends mainly on the lifetime of the sensor therefore it is of great significance to use renewable energy to achieve self powered application of bridges in this paper a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvester wereh system for a self powered sea crossing bridge is presented the proposed wereh is installed on the drainpipe on the pier of the sea crossing bridge the system mainly includes three modules energy collection module energy conversion module and energy storage module the energy collection module is composed of s rotor and water wheel the energy conversion module is made up of a pvdf film array and magnet array electric energy can be obtained by the methods in which the pvdf films strike the adjustable plate and the changing magnetic field excites the coil when only windy weather or only rainy weather is available the s rotor and water wheel are used to collect wind energy or rainwater energy respectively when it is windy and rainy mixed weather the energy conversion module can keep working via one way bearings what is more the s rotor and water wheel can be flexibly combined with the energy conversion module to collect wind energy and rain energy respectively finally the power storage module stores the electricity by supercapacitors and the electric energy will be used to supply power for the low power sensor of the sea crossing bridge both simulations and experiments are performed to

under the same condition the maximum electric energy of the wereh can reach 8659 76 μ j in windy weather and 811 35 μ j in rainy weather in a sweep process 6s according to potential energy analysis the annual electricity generated by each wereh device can supply power for a displacement sensor ktc1 lwh for at least 239 95 days and a low power temperature sensor si705x for 254809 18 days at most keywords wind and rainwater energy harvesting supercapacitors sea crossing bridges self powered application 1 introduction due to energy shortage and the aggravation of environmental pollution the development of sustainable energy continues to attract increasing attention sarmiento et al 2019 in the past several years researches had been explored for renewable energy harvesting such as solar energy yang et al 2018 wind energy pan et al 2019 wave energy xie et al 2020 and mechanical vibration energy zhu et al 2020 these researches provided some novel approaches to harvest energy from natural environments e g wind turbines howey et al 2011 and solar cell panels mairizwan et al 2020 the energy collected by the mentioned equipment could be applied to supply power for wireless sensors of a large scale project for the bridge health monitoring system many wireless sensors are utilized to collect various status information such as temperature and crack in such a system the battery cannot maintain a persistent power supply for wireless sensors because they are always in remote areas such as the mountains and the sea this is especially true of sea crossing bridges which are located above sea level on the one hand there is great demand of power supply for sensors to monitor the health status on the other hand adverse work environments reduce the service life of batteries therefore it is of great significance to harvest energy from the surrounding environment to achieve self powered sensor for sea crossing bridges various methods were used to collect energy from the ambient environment such as electromagnetic arroyo and badel 2011 triboelectric wang et al 2012 piezoelectric zhang et al 2017 the other combinations these methods which were adopted to harvest energy largely depended on its environment pan et al 2021 for the sea crossing bridge in remote areas the abundantly available sources such as solar wind rainfall and mechanical vibration can be utilized solar energy is a type of clean and renewable energy but the energy conversion efficiency of it usually depends on weather condition and the area of sunlight that a solar panel can be received in recent years more and more researches about energy harvester for bridge health monitoring have focused on wind energy and mechanical vibration energy because they can be easily obtained from the surrounding environment sazonov et al 2009 regarding wind energy harvester many experiments have shown that electromagnetic and piezoelectric are the highly effective methods of achieving self powered wireless sensors iqbal and khan 2018 in electromagnetic methods the principle of energy harvester is using the transmission mechanism to convert wind energy into electric energy by the relative motion between the magnet and coil this method is widely used in wind turbine technology balat 2009 with the miniaturization of energy harvesting devices some electromagnetic energy harvesters which are based on windmill structures have been studied wu and lee 2014 proposed a miniature windmill structured energy harvester which could be used in wireless monitoring for forest fires and the peak output voltage could reach 5 2 v fei et al 2012 developed a low speed wind flutter energy harvester to harvest electrical energy using airflow and copper coils and a permanent magnet to supply power for wireless sensors although these researches had been completed some of them are rarely used in the self powered monitoring of sea crossing bridges the second wind energy harvesting strategy is based on piezoelectric materials compared with the electromagnetic strategy various experiments have shown that piezoelectric materials have more performance advantages because of their special material properties elahi et al 2018 fei et al 2012 described a piezo windmill prototype that was used to harvest wind energy qing et al 2017 introduced the application of piezoelectric technology in pavements to generate more electricity rezaei hosseinabadi et al 2015 presented a topology that used piezoelectric materials to collect wind energy and it could achieve self powered wireless sensor nodes yang et al 2018 utilized magnetic and piezoelectric methods to develop a small scale piezoelectric energy harvester to achieve wind energy harvesting piezoelectric materials have high work efficiency in many applications yan et al 2020 but many of them also show disadvantageous material properties when they are used in unfavorable conditions for example piezoelectric ceramic transducers pzts often show brittleness if they were impacted strongly nabavi and zhang 2016 although pzts have a higher piezoelectric constant and electromechanical coupling coefficient than piezoelectric films pvdfs vatansever et al 2011 the former pzts is very prone to exhibiting fatigue fracture in periodic load processes because of its brittleness lin and giurgiutiu 2006 despite the feasibility of wind energy harvesting with the existing approaches and systems it should be noted that other kinds of energy could be utilized in the drainage systems of bridges such as rainwater energy the rainwater which is collected from houses roads and bridges has great potential for exploitation imteaz et al 2012 many types of research have proved that using hydro generators to harvest rainwater energy is an effective approach rosmin et al 2015 aziz et al 2016 studied a micro hydro generator that collected rainwater energy from the roof and the results showed that the generator s output power could reach about 500 w kumar et al 2016 utilized a micro turbine to harvest the potential energy from rainwater in a tall building although the micro turbine system can use rainwater to harvest rainwater energy some disadvantages such as high cost make it fall short of the requirement of powering for wireless sensor nodes in addition other categories of rainwater energy harvesting are based on piezoelectric material wong et al 2015 most of the researches about rainwater energy harvesting usually focus on single raindrop energy harvesting guigon et al 2008a b raindrops impact the piezoelectric material and make it vibrate to achieve energy conversion wong and dahari 2017 ilyas and swingler 2017 developed an energy harvesting module which was composed of piezoelectric devices and the results showed that the overall efficiency of a single device could reach 0 671 0 158 to enhance the performance of piezoelectric energy harvester wong et al 2016 proposed using a hollow cut in the middle of the block as a water shelter in which raindrops were collected then a large number of raindrops would impact the piezoelectric material by syringe to enhance raindrop energy harvesting therefore the method which uses the rainwater collected by roof road or bridge to impact piezoelectric beam to generate electric energy is feasible the windy weather and rainy weather often appear at sea level but most of energy harvesting devices can only collect the single type of energy wind energy or rainwater energy the apparent result is that such a device cannot work in conditions when it lacks this type of energy hence it is imperative to increase the utilization rate of energy harvester and make energy harvester have high work efficiently in the complex environment in order to utilize energy harvesting around the sea crossing bridge and achieve self powered monitoring of wireless sensors this paper proposed a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvesting wereh system s rotor and water wheel are used to collect wind and rainwater respectively the pvdf film array strikes the adjustable plate to generate ac voltage and the coils are excited by the rotating magnetic array to generate ac voltage under the action of the controller ac voltage is converted to dc voltage and the electric energy will be stored in the supercapacitor to supply power for the wireless sensor although the starting speed of the s rotor and the water wheel are different the starting speed of the water wheel can be adjusted by changing the distance and the rainwater collector in addition rainwater can be stored and recycled but wind can t be stored to meet the requirement of real time energy harvesting wind energy can be harvested firstly and then rainwater energy is collected by the stored rainwater under the wind and rain mixed weather therefore the energy harvester can work in various weather conditions this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the design of the wereh and its operation principles section 3 describes the theoretical model the experimental details are presented in section 4 in section 5 the results and discussions are provided the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 system design and operation principles the goal of this research is to develop a mechanical structure of piezoelectric and electromagnetic hybrid energy harvesting to collect wind energy and rain energy around the sea crossing bridge a schematic of the wind energy and rainwater energy harvesting system proposed in this paper is shown in fig 1 it consists of three main parts energy collection module electricity conversion module and energy storage module the wereh is mounted on the bridge drain pipe under a sea crossing bridge considering the size of existing actual drain pipes of sea crossing bridges and the installation position of the wereh the overall size of the model and installation position can be shown in fig 2 as the direction of rainwater flow in the drainpipe is vertical downward the central axis of the rainwater wheel is a horizontal direction in order to keep the same direction between the central axis of the rainwater wheel and that of the s rotor the central axis of the s rotor is set to be a horizontal direction to collect the wind energy which flow across the bridge pier surface the schematic of the experimental setup of the wereh is shown in fig 3 there are three working modes only s rotor is rotation only the rainwater wheel is rotation and s rotor and rain wheel are both rotations at the same time for the first working mode it is usually used to collect the wind energy which flows across the bridge pier when the natural wind blows across the bridge and the wind speed reaches the minimum starting wind speed of the s rotor the s rotor begins to rotate in addition the inner ring of the one way bearing of the s rotor is connected to the axle and the outer ring is connected to the s rotor then the rotor pm rotor which is made of pvdf film and magnetic array will rotate clockwise via the one way bearing and axle the pvdf film will strike the adjustable plate to generate ac voltage at the same time the coil will generate electricity under the excitation of the changing magnetic field the second working mode is only the rain wheel rotates when the wind speed can t reach the minimum start up wind speed of the s rotor rainwater along the inner surface of the pipe impacts the wheel and makes pm rotor rotate under the effect of the one way bearing the rain wheel drives the axle to rotate clockwise the axle cannot drive the s rotor to rotate because of the function of one way bearing in this situation therefore the pm rotor will follow the rainwater wheel to rotate clockwise the third working mode is that both the rainwater wheel and s rotor are rotation under the impaction of rainwater and wind respectively under this working mode the state of pm rotor rotation is dependent on which one s rotation speed is faster i e s rotor and wheel and the slower one will not have any effect on the rotation state of the pm rotor because of the effect of one way bearings consequently the pm rotor will convert wind energy and rainwater energy into electrical energy via the electromagnetic harvester emh and pvdf energy harvester peh then the rectifying circuit converts ac voltage into dc voltage finally the electrical energy would be stored in the supercapacitors and it could be used to supply the power for sensors which monitor the health state of sea crossing bridges 2 1 energy collection module the energy collection module includes a wind energy collection module namely s rotor and a rainwater energy collection module namely water wheel and they are all fixed on the axle via one one way bearing and one rolling bearing as shown in fig 4 the function of the one way bearing is to maintain one way rotation of the rotor and the axle when one type of energy collection module begins to rotate the axle will follow to rotate in the same direction via the action of the one way bearing but the above process cannot be reversed i e the axle cannot drive the energy collection module to rotate in addition the function of the rolling bearing is to limit the axial displacement of the energy collection module the wind collection module is an important component the advantage of the s rotor is that it has a good start up performance and does not require high wind speed when the wind drives the s rotor to rotate or when rainwater impacts the water wheel the pm rotor will be driven to rotate under the effect of the axle subsequently wind energy and rainwater energy will be collected respectively 2 2 electricity generator module the electricity generator module namely pm rotor is one of the most important components for the wereh and it is utilized to convert wind energy and rainwater energy into electrical energy the module mainly includes the pvdf film energy harvester peh and the electromagnetic energy harvester emh as shown in fig 5 in the peh there are four pvdf films and one end is free and the other end fixed on the pm rotor by the clamped beam when the pm rotor is rotating the pvdf film will impact the adjustable plate and undergo the bending deformation the distance between the pvdf film s free end and the top of the excitation beam is called impact length different impact lengths will make the pvdf film have different degrees of deformation as for the emh it is made up of two parts four magnets and one copper coil the four magnets are symmetrically placed on the pm rotor to form the rotor of the electricity generator module as the stator of the electricity generator module the copper coil is placed in a protective shell the material of magnet is ndfeb n30uh and the distance between the two opposite magnets is 33 8 mm the coil is above the magnet and the distance between coil and magnet is 11 17 mm as the incentive part of the pvdf film the adjustable plate is located on top of the protective shell the related parameters of the rotor utilized in this paper are listed in fig 6 and table 1 2 3 power storage module after electric energy is generated by the peh and the emh the process of energy harvesting is completed the electrical energy is outputted in the form of ac voltage in order to furtherly achieve energy storage and recycling a rectifier circuit is utilized to convert ac voltage to dc voltage the rectified current will be stored in the storage battery for electrical energy storage supercapacitors is widely used because of their rapid charge time and long cycle life barra et al 2021 the electrical rectifier circuit for wereh is shown in fig 7 3 modeling and analysis as one of the important components of the wereh the s rotor is used to convert wind energy into mechanical energy the s rotor is one type of resistance wind turbine fan structure and it can achieve wind energy capture in multiple wind directions the theoretical model of the s rotor is shown in fig 8 the s rotor consists of five identical blades and two turn plates when the wind impacts it the concave surface and convex surface of the blades will be impacted by airflow at different intensities due to the concave surfaces obtaining more force than the convex surfaces the blades resistance can be calculated with the following formulas 1 f b 1 1 2 ρ s a c s 1 v w i n d ω r s 2 f b 2 1 2 ρ s a c s 2 v w i n d ω r s 2 2 where the f b 1 and f b 2 are the forces which air flow impacts the concave surface and convex surface respectively ρ is the

2 represent the resistance coefficient of the convex surface and concave surface of the blades v w i n d is the air velocity ω is the angular velocity of s rotor and the r s is the average radius of the s rotor as the different resistance coefficients of the concave surface and the convex surface the s rotor will rotate when rotary torque is produced the kinetic energy e w i n d can be calculated by the following formulas 4 e w i n d 1 2 ρ s a v w i n d 5 ω 2 e w i n d c p j 1 2 when the s rotor is rotating the rotational angular velocity of it can be calculated by formula 5 where c p is the average power factor and j is the moment of inertia for the s rotor ω represents the rotational angular velocity as the s rotor passes the moment of inertia to the pm rotor via the shaft all of them have the same rotational angular velocity in addition rainwater of the deck of the bridge is usually collected by water pipe kumar et al 2016 when the rainwater flows through the internal surface of the pipe the rainwater will impact the rainwater wheel blade and drive it to rotate under the action of the one way bearing the rain water wheel will drive the pm rotor to rotate when the shaft transfers force to rotate the pm rotor then the pvdf film will impact the adjustable plate to generate ac electricity at the same time the rotation of the magnet array will motivate the coil to generate ac electricity the schematic diagram of the rainwater wheel is shown in fig 9 assuming rainwater is in the form of a water jet when the rainwater impacts the wheel blades as shown in fig 9 b in order to simplify the model rainwater from the water pipe is described in the form of a water column and a stationary length of which impacts the blade vashisht 2012 there is a loss of rainwater after the rainwater strikes the blade pujol et al 2010 we assume a non viscous fluid unable to exert shear forces on the blade and the flow velocity of the rainwater is not changed the flow velocity of the rainwater is v w and the diameter of the rainwater column is d p therefore the rainwater flow rate q and the torque t can be given as follows 6 q v w π 1 2 d p 2 1 4 v w π d p 2 7 t ρ w v w d w cos a under different flow rates q the wheel will be impacted by different torques t in this paper the diameter of the rainwater column d p is 13 mm and the rainwater flow rate q can be measured by a flowmeter ρ w is the density of water i e 10 3 k g m 3 as the core component of the energy converter the pm rotor is applied to achieve energy conversion the pm rotor is made up of a pvdf film array and magnet array the pvdf film is mainly based on the piezoelectric effect and generates different charges on its surface to form coupling voltage when it deforms under external force zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 at the initial state fig 10 a there is no charge is generated on the surface of piezoelectric material once the pvdf film is bending deformation it will generate the positive charge and negative charge on the surface of the piezoelectric material layer hence it will generate a small electric potential namely coupling voltage under the conscious rotation of the pm rotor the pvdf film will continuously generate electricity by striking the adjustable plate in turn there are two working modes namely d 31 mode and d 33 mode the pvdf film will generate electric charge in d 31 mode

under uniform load when the uniform load impacts on the pvdf film the displacement d x can be calculated by the following formula wang et al 2018 11 d x b x 2 6 l 2 4 l x x 2 24 y i q the kinetic

to the ref wang et al 2018 the value of equivalent mass m e q is 0 257 m the corresponding induced stress of the pvdf film can be expressed as 13 φ 1 m e q c 1 κ 14 φ 2 β c 2 κ 15 φ 3 y κ 16 φ 4 d 31

to verify the effectiveness of the system the comsol multiphysics 5 5 is utilized to conduct finite element simulation when the pm rotor rotates the pvdf film will strike the adjustable plate and appear the bending deformation then the piezoelectric coupling effect is produced at the surface of the pvdf film and the coupling voltage can be extracted zhang et al 2017 in order to simplify the simulation model the two protective layer are merged into one and the material properties of protective layer is polyethylene the structural parameters and the material properties of the pvdf film are given in table 1 the implemented matrices of the material properties of the pvdf film can be obtained according to reference zhang et al 2017 the impact time of the equivalent impulse force can be estimated theoretically and experimentally by combining with the experimental waveform during the process of bending deformation of pvdf film the piezoelectric layer and the protective layer of the pvdf film will have damping the rayleigh damping α 0 5 s 1 β 6 10 4 s will be set during the simulation of the pvdf film bao and wang 2020 assume the equivalent impulse force is 0 25 n and the time of impaction is set 0 0015s under the wind speed of 7 m s as shown in fig 13 a the applied equivalent excitation force impacts on the free end of the pvdf film and the output voltage of it under the optimal load resistance 290 k ω in a working period 0 1s is shown in fig 13 b it can be seen that the maximum of the peak voltage can reach 8 0 v and the pvdf film will occur oscillation motion with decreasing amplitude during the process of the pvdf film recovery deformation after it passes through the adjustable plate fig 14 shows the corresponding results of the displacement and output voltageat different times 0 01s 0 06s therefore it can be obtained the output voltage of the pvdf film under various wind speeds by setting different equivalent impulse force and impact times once the simulation model is built for the emh part the magnet array will also rotate and the coil will generate ac electricity under the variation of the magnetic field when the pm rotor rotates the geometry parameter and material properties values of simulation model can be obtained by fig 6 and table 2 for the parameter values of various rotation speeds they can be obtained by the voltage waveform of a period time during the process of experiment respectively in order to analyze the distribution of the magnetic field and the variation of the output voltage a magnetostatic and transient solution type was used to simulate the magnetic field and the output voltage at different rotation speeds fig 15 depicts the distribution of magnetic flux density with rotation speed at 400 rpm wind speed of 8 m s it can be observed that the magnetic flux density is changing around the magnets and the maximum magnet flux density is 1 13 t at 0 015 s and 0 035 s 4 experimental details to verify the feasibility of the proposed model a prototype of the wereh was built fig 16 showed the wind energy harvester experimental schematic mode and the details a centrifugal air blower was used to simulate the wind field a wind tunnel was utilized to ensure the stability and the concentration of the wind in order to change the value of wind speed an adjustable transformer was used to control the value of voltage to change the speed of the centrifugal air blower the wind generated by the centrifugal air blower impacted the s rotor by the wind tunnel under the action of the axle and the one way bearing the water wheel didn t rotate and the pm rotor would follow the s rotor to rotate after that the free end of the pvdf film would strike the adjustable plate to generate electricity and the magnet array would rotate to generate a changing magnetic field then the pvdf film generated electrical energy because of the bending deformation and simultaneously the coil would generate electrical energy under the changing magnetic field for the magnet array the magnets are arranged in the same polar symmetrically the prototype parameters are shown in table 2 the wind speed was measured by an anemometer smart sensor ar866 and the resistance box shahe zx99 ia was used as the external load resistance when the wind speed was changed the data of generated voltage by the pvdf and the coil could be measured respectively by adjusting the length of the adjustable plate and the value of load resistance the various voltage of the pvdf and the coil will be obtained finally all the recorded data were input to the computer to analysis to improve the accuracy of the prototype performance a lot of reliable data are recorded and analyzed see fig 17 in order to simulate the effect of the rainwater energy harvesting for the wereh a simple experimental setup was shown in fig 16 water was pumped up from a pool to simulate the process of the rainwater impacting the blade of the water wheel after the water piper was full of rainwater and the flow rate was stable the relevant data would be recorded during the experiment the flow rate would be controlled by a water tap and a flow meter was used to record the flow data of the water pipe when the water of the pipe impacted on the water wheel the water wheel would be driven to rotate due to the action of the one way bearing and the axle the s rotor would not rotate while the pm rotor could follow rotation then the pvdf film would impact the adjustable plate to generate ac electrical energy at the same time the coil would generate electrical energy under the changing magnetic field an oscilloscope was utilized to measure the piezoelectric voltage from the pvdf film and the electromagnetic voltage from the coil by changing the flow rate and the load resistance the output voltages of the pvdf film and the coil would be recorded in order to ensure the accuracy of the prototype performance evaluation a lot of highly reliable data were collected 5 results and discussions 5 1 the piezoelectric portion of wind energy harvesting the prototype of the wereh was placed in the wind tunnel to study its performance as the wind speed increased from 7 m s to 12 m s different impact length will make the pvdf film generate different voltages fig 18 shows the open circuit root mean square rms voltage at the following wind speeds 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s the rms voltage will increase with the increase of the impact length when the impact length is 15 mm the rms voltage reaches its maximum value under wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s although the pvdf film has the higher rms voltage at the impact length of 15 mm and 20 mm when the wind speed is 11 m s and 12 m s the longer impact length will hinder the rotation of the pm rotor and cause the reduction of rms voltage of pvdf film in order to simplify the experiment process and maintain the uniformity of experimental conditions the impact length of 15 mm will be utilized in the follow up experiments when the output voltage is obtained the average power p a v e can be calculated by p a v e t 0 t 1 v t 2 d t r t 1 t 0 where the v t is the load voltage at t moment and the r is load resistance and the t 1 t 0 is the duration of the voltage waveform zhao et al 2019 in order to simplify the calculation the rms voltage v r m s was used to calculate the average output power p a v e and the calculation formula is p a v e v r m s 2 r the effects of rms voltage and average power under the load at different wind speeds are shown in fig 19 as the value of load resistance increases the rms voltage increases the average power also increases when the load resistance increases and it will reach maximum at the optimal load resistance kim et al 2015 from fig 19 b it can be observed that the optimal load resistance are about 350 k ω 290 k ω 270 k ω 290 k ω 230 ω 210 ω for wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s respectively furtherly the rms voltage increases correspondingly with the increase of load resistance at the same wind speed nevertheless the average power increases firstly and than decreases in order to maintain uniformity of experiments and consistency of experimental conditions a resistance of 290 k ω will be used in the subsequent experiments in addition the excitation frequency under different wind speeds can be evaluated by voltage waveform over a while in the experiment zhao et al 2019 fig 20 depicts the relationship between the excitation frequency of the pvdf film and wind speed under the open circuit as shown in fig 20 the value of excitation frequency increases with an increase in wind speed the corresponding excitation frequencies the frequency of one rotation period are approximately 3 63 hz 5 67 hz 7 93 hz 9 64 hz 12 64 hz 14 79 hz under the wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s and 12 m s respectively fig 21 depicts the output voltage of simulation and experimentat different wind speeds when the load resistance is 290 k ω when the wind speed is 7 m s the waveform of the output voltage is a gradual attenuation oscillation waveform with the increase of wind speed the vibration period of the pvdf film will be shortened accordingly at the same time the number of excitation times is also increased the same phenomenon can be found in ref bao and wang 2020 thus more wind energy will be captured when wind speed is increasing fig 22 depicts the electrical performance comparison between the open circuit voltage and load voltage for the peh at different wind speeds when the peh is open circuit the output voltage amplitude increases from 24 v to 30 v with an increase in wind speed moreover the maximum amplitude of voltage can reach about 30 v when the wind speed is 9 m s this phenomenon may be that the pvdf films appear different impact length when they strike the adjustable plate and it causes the inconsistency of output voltage for each pvdf film additionally the output voltage of the peh with a resistance of 290 k ω is demonstrated in fig 22 c and d respectively the current i can be calculated by i v r the maximum voltage amplitudes are about 9 2 v for wind speed of 7 m s and 13 6 v for wind speed of 12 m s at the same time the corresponding maximum currents are 0 0317 ma and 0 0468 ma respectively when the wind speed is low the amplitude of the voltage waveform maintains a stable value 9 2 v similarly when the wind speed is high the voltage amplitude is another stable value 13 6 v 5 2 the electromagnetic portion of wind energy harvesting the coil is connected with a load resistance of 30 ω which is equal to the measured resistance of the coil the rotation speed of the magnet array is equal to that of the pvdf rotor and it can be obtained from the output voltage waveform of the pvdf film the results of the experiment and simulation for the emh at wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s are shown in fig 23 from the fig 23 the rotational speed of the rotor is increasing when the wind speed increases the load voltage generated by electromagnetic induction rises from 0 08 v to 0 184 v in addition it is clear that the results of the simulation agree well with the experimental data at the different wind speeds even so there are still inconsistencies between the output voltage waveform for experimental data and the adjacent waveform the reason for this phenomenon may be the measurement error and additionally assembly error which made the prototype structure less than completely symmetrical moreover there will be some slight fluctuations during the experiment which may cause tiny errors between the experiment and simulation the energy harvesting system of wereh is made up of the peh and the emh and they are connected by a rotor hence they have the same work frequency in the process of pm rotor rotation usually there is energy loss in electrical energy during transmission the power of the prototype can be obtained without considering energy loss when the wind speed ranges from 7 m s to 12 m s the instantaneous power of peh and emh is shown in fig 24 the peh s maximum power increases from 168 9 μ w to 1117 2 μ w while the emh s maximum power rises from 213 3 μ w to 1128 5 μ w the maximum output power can reach 2196 7 μ w when wind speeds are 7 m s and 8 m s the maximum power for the emh is higher than that of the peh this is because the voltage waveform generated by pvdf film is not uniform although their peak voltage is higher as the wind speed reaches 9 m s the maximum output power of the emh is lower than that of the peh when the rotation speed increases the time of that the pvdf film is from bending deformation to restitution is shortened it makes the maximum power of the peh increase when the wind speed increases from 10 m s to 12 m s the maximum power of the emh is higher than that of the peh the high rotation speed of the pm rotor accelerates the change of magnetic flux under the high wind speed conditions the method of electromagnetic power generation has more advantages in order to furtherly analyze the electrical performance of the peh and the emh the rms voltage and average power of them under the load are shown in fig 25 for the peh as the wind speed increases from 7 m s to 12 m s the rms voltage rises from 3 887 v to 13 441 v and the average power increases from 52 122 μ w to 622 92 μ w respectively for the emh the rms voltage increases from 0 057 v to 0 157 v and the average power rises from 108 333 μ w to 832 μ w fig 26 shows that the comparisons of average power between simulation and experiment of peh emh and wereh peh emh it can be seen that the average power is increasing with the increase of wind speed the result of the simulation and the experiment have the same change trend fig 27 shows the comparisons of average current between the peh and the emh at different wind speeds the average current of the peh changes from 0 013 ma to 0 046 ma and that of the emh changes from 1 9 ma to 5 24 ma although the output voltage of the peh is higher than that of the emh the average power and average current of the peh are less than those of the emh the same results can be obtained in zhao et al 2019 the reason for this is that the emh has lower load resistance and the voltage generated by the changing magnetic flux is more uniform hence the wereh can be suitable for wireless power supply equipment with low load resistance and high load resistance 5 3 the piezoelectric and electromagnetic portions of rainwater energy harvesting there is great potential to harvest electrical energy from rainwater chua et al 2016 fig 28 shows the results of simulation and experiment for the peh at different flow rates when the flow rate is low the excitation frequency of the pvdf film is also low and the oscillation period of it is long before the next pvdf film strikes the adjustable plate with the increase of flow rate the number of incentives in unit time also increases and the oscillation period of each pvdf film will be shortened fig 29 describes the results of simulation and experiment for the emh with load at different flow rates when the flow rate of rainwater is low the voltage waveform is relatively sparse because the rotation speed of the magnet array low it can be seen that the peak voltage of load is increasing when the flow rate increases for the coil the larger rotation speed makes the change of magnetic flux per unit time become faster and the induced voltage of it is also increase fig 30 shows the time histories of output voltage when the different flow rates of rainwater impact the water wheel under open circuit and load when the flow rates range from 10 l min to 20 l min the maximum output voltage boosts from 14 v to 18 8 v under open circuit and the change trend is not apparent even though the number of excitation times rises with the increase of the flow rate for the emh it is evident that the output voltage is increasing when the flow rate enhances in addition the rms voltage and the value of peak to peak voltage vpp are important factors to evaluate the performance of electricity the rms voltage and vpp voltage are increasing with the increase of flow rate for the peh as shown in fig 31 when the flow rate is 18 l min the maximum rms voltage and vpp voltage reach 11 10 v and 32 v respectively after that the rms voltage and vpp voltage decrease with the increase of the flow rate from fig 31 a the maximum output voltage amplitude can reach 16 4 v for the peh for the emh the rms voltage and the vpp voltage range from 0 192 v to 0 33 v and 0 046 v 0 102 v respectively fig 32 illustrates the respective effects of electrical energy harvesting under the load for the peh and emh when the flow rate raises from 10 l min to 18 l min the rms voltage and the average power increase from 2 82 v to 4 80 v and 27 56 μ w to 79 45 μ w respectively while the flow rate continues to increase the rms voltage and the average power will decrease for the emh the rms voltage and the average power show the tendency of linear increase in addition the maximum rms voltage and the average powers are 0 044 v and 65 41 μ w for the emh respectively the rotation speed of the pm rotor is increasing with the increase of the flow rate meanwhile the excitation frequency of pvdf film and magnet array is also increasing for the peh the electric energy collected by the pvdf film is increasing when the excitation frequency increases however the amount of energy generated by each excitation is related to the bending degree of the pvdf film when the excitation frequency keeps increasing until the value is beyond one particular frequency the degree of bending deformation will decrease for the emh the voltage is generated by the variation in magnetic flux the faster the magnetic flux changes in unit time the more energy is generated therefore the rms voltage and the average power tend to rise firstly and then falling for the peh but the emh tends to continuously increase the instantaneous power values of the peh and the emh under different flow rates are shown in fig 33 it can be seen the maximum output power of the emh increases from 22 53 μ w to 120 μ w as the flow rate increases from 10 l min to 20 l min while the maximum output power keeps fluctuating around 150 μ w in the peh for the wereh the maximum output power increases from 179 76 μ w to 245 76 μ w the emh s output power improves significantly when the flow rate increases in order to furtherly analyze the power generation performance of wereh the comparisons of average power between simulation and experiment for peh and emh at different flow rates are shown in fig 34 the results show that simulations and experiments both peh and emh are good agreements the total average power of wereh peh emh is increasing from 35 45 μ w to 135 44 μ w when the flow rate ranges from 10 l min to 18 l min during of experiment when the flow rate is 20 l min the total average of wereh is decreasing although the value of average power increases it can be seen the performance of the peh is higher than the emh under the low rotation speeds of pm rotor under high rotation speed wind speeds at 7 m s 12 m s the performance of energy transformation for the emh will improve obviously fig 35 shows the comparison of average current between the peh and the emh at different flow rates of rainwater as the flow rate increases from 10 l min to 20 l min the peh average current ranges from 0 0097 ma to 0 0167 ma while the emh average current ranges from 0 512 ma to 1 477 ma although the instantaneous voltage of the emh is lower than that of the peh the average current of the emh is higher than that of the peh the reason for this is that the optimal load of the peh is much higher than that of the emh for the emh it is easy to provide higher current m a scale for load but its output voltage is very low but the peh can provide higher output voltage and the output current is very low for the capacitor the higher output current can improve the charging rate and the energy converter with higher output voltage decide the final voltage of capacitor therefore the wereh hybridized energy converter has better performance than individual the energy converter the peh or the emh fig 36 shows the energy harvested by the wereh in a sweep process time 6s at different wind speeds and flow rates from fig 36 a the wind energy which is harvested by the wereh increases from 961 22 μ j to 8659 76 μ j when the wind speed ranges from 7 m s to 12 m s in addition the wind energy harvested by the emh is always higher than that of the peh at different wind speeds for rainwater energy the electrical energy harvested by the wereh increases from 63 65 μ j to 718 58 μ j as the flow increases 10 l min to 20 l min and the maximum energy is 811 35 μ j at the flow rate of 18 l min the energy collected by the peh is higher than the energy collected by the emh as the flow rate ranges from 12 l min to 18 l min when the flow rate is 20 l min the rotation speed of the pm rotor is higher than that at 18 l min the rotation speed of pm rotor in the windy condition is higher than that in the rainwater condition therefore it can be seen the emh is the device s main way of harvesting energy at high rotation speeds while the peh is the main way of harvesting energy at low rotation speeds additionally the proposed wind energy and rainwater harvester can improve average output power by increasing the number of turns of coil or the number of pvdf films moreover the proposed wind energy and rainwater harvester can be applied in different wind and rainwater environments such as tall buildings and roofs 5 4 energy harvesting potentiality analysis to estimate the energy harvesting potentiality of the wereh xia zhang cross sea bridge located in the east of xiamen and zhangzhou was selected as the case study as shown in fig 37 the total length of the main bridge of xia zhang cross sea bridge is 8 56 km and the width of the bridge deck is 33 5 m liu et al 2010 2015 the number of total bridge piers is 322 and the distance from the bottom of the pier to the bridge deck is 61 6 m chen and chen 2012 considering toll stations and environmental factors this study adopts an effective bridge length of 6 km and width of 30 m and 300 bridge piers the wereh is connected to the bridge drainage pipe which is installed on bridge piers and each bridge pier has two drainage pipes we assume that an energy harvester is placed every 1 m and an effective length of 20 m will be used to calculate for every drainage pipe therefore it can be calculated that there are 12000 energy harvesters and 180000 m 2 of the effective bridge area are used to collect rainwater in order to conveniently evaluate the energy output performance of all the wereh the relevant assumptions are given as follows 1 in order to better evaluate energy harvesting levels we assume that ten energy harvesters in each bridge pipe are used to harvest rainwater energy and another ten harvesters are used to harvest wind energy in addition wind energy harvesters and rainwater energy harvesters do not affect each other because each bridge pier has two drainage pipes there are 20 energy harvesters used to collect wind energy and another 20 energy harvesters used to collect rainwater energy for every bridge pier 2 we ignore the influence of the pier and deck of the bridge during the wind energy calculation 3 we assume the wind speed is stable and each energy harvester will be impacted under the same wind speed when the wind impacts all the wind energy harvesters 4 considering the rainwater we assume that the same flow rate impacts every rainwater energy harvester in each pipe for the wereh the monthly wind power can be calculated by the following formulas 26 e m e w m e r m 27 e w m p v i d v i 0 d v i 30 28 e r m ρ p v r where the e m is the total amount of electricity generation in a month e w m and e r m stand for the electrical energy generated from wind energy and rainwater energy in a month respectively p v i is the power at a given wind speed 7 m s v i 12 m s in a month and d v i is the corresponding effective working day under the same wind speed every month in order to simplify the calculation we assume the flow rate of rainwater is keeping 18 l min and the power density ρ p of that as the calculation power for the wereh during the rainwater energy harvesting v r is the volume of rainwater collected in a month for the estimation of wind power generation we assume that 5 h cumulative work time of the energy harvester as one day under a certain stable wind speed 7 m s 12 m s considering the variation of wind speed at different times in one day and the corresponding output power is used to calculate the power generation the annual wind speed distribution is predicted by the measured wind speed in refs liu et al 2010 chen and chen 2012 considering the variation of wind speed at different times in one day the total workday of the energy harvester under one certain stable wind speed is assumed and the total electric energy under the different wind speeds is shown in fig 38 it can be seen the work time of the energy harvester is increasing when the wind speed increases from 7 m s to 12 m s and that the total electrical energy ranges from 0 6727 kwh to 17 318 kwh therefore the annual electrical energy of wind energy is about 39 7913 kwh in order to obtain the meteorological precipitation data we used the meteonorm software a combination of reliable data sources from global energy balance archive data geba gilgen et al 1998 fig 39 shows the monthly average precipitation distribution in xiamen 1991 2010 the monthly electricity power generated by rainwater is shown in fig 40 the maximum electric power is 0 1167 kwh in june the total electrical power generated by the rainwater is 0 52 kwh therefore the total annual electricity power generated by wind energy and rainwater energy is about 40 3113 kwh comparing the total annual electricity power of rainwater and that of wind it should be noted that the former is much lower than the latter the reason is that the sea crossing bridge is located above sea level where wind energy is always present but rainwater can only be formed in special climatic conditions and rainy weather is seasonal therefore the electric power generated in a year by rainwater is far less than that of wind because the days of rain in a year are far less than windy weather however the advantage of the rainwater that can be stored and recycled will furtherly increase its utilization rate and the wind energy can only be collected in real time in other words wind energy can be harvested firstly and then rainwater energy is collected by the stored rainwater under the wind and rain mixed weather to meet the requirements of real time energy harvesting for the core component pm rotor all the wind energy and rainwater energy can be harvested hence the combination of the two types of energy harvester can improve the energy resource utilization of the surrounding sea crossing bridge environment considering rainwater energy loss and other electrical power loss we assume that 80 of total electricity power will be used to charge for supercapacitors as the efficiency energy conversion of supercapacitors can reach 90 98 barra et al 2020 so we assume 72 of the harvestable total electrical power is used to supply power for sensors at least to estimate the time of supplying power for low power sensors we choose three types of low power sensors displacement sensor ktc1 lwh accelerometer sensor meas 832 0200 and temperature sensor si705x so the annual electricity generation is 0 002418678 kwh 40 3113 kwh 12000 for per wereh device the power consumption parameters of the three types of sensors are shown in table 3 assuming each bridge pier has three types of sensors that need to be supplied power the time of power supplied for each sensor can be calculated and the results are shown in table 3 comparing the power supply time of the three different type of sensors in a sea crossing bridge the longest power supply time is 254809 18 days and the shortest is 239 95 days for per wereh consequently the lower the power consumption of the sensor the longer the power supply time of the total electrical power assuming every sensor is set per 4 m sazonov et al 2009 there are about 1500 sensors for each type need to be supplied power as the power consumption is different for each kind of sensor taking displacement sensor ktc1 lwh as an example it needs about 2250 werehs to supply the 1500 displacement sensors of sea crossing bridge every year therefore the wereh has potential capability to achieve the self powered technology of low power wireless sensor considering the manufacturing cost and the energy collection efficiency it needs to optimize the construct of the wereh to decrease the number of the werehs and meet the power supply demands of low power sensors as shown in fig 41 the wereh is installed along the piers of the sea crossing bridge natural wind and rainwater at sea level impact the wereh and the wind energy and rainwater energy will be stored in supercapacitors to achieve self powered sensor of sea crossing bridge the proposed wereh could be a reliable solution in order to improve the energy harvesting efficiency and increase its applicability it is necessary to conduct the optimization design about the device s components such as the number of blades and the size of the s rotor and rainwater wheel and furtherly increase the installation accuracy at the same time increasing the number of pvdf films and coil turns may be the required method to enhance the ability to generate electric energy nevertheless the increase in the number of pvdf films or coil turns will increase the damping of the pm rotor in addition when the efficiency of energy harvesting is improved the number of the wereh will need to be further optimized because of the price of materials energy consumption of other higher power sensors mw scale these optimization work will be studied in future research 6 conclusion this paper presents a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvester wereh that can be used to harvest wind energy and rainwater energy around the sea crossing bridges compared with traditional wind energy or rainwater energy harvesters the wereh combined piezoelectric and electromagnetic effect can achieve hybrid energy harvesting as the effect of one way bearing the s rotor and the waterwheel can be separated to harvest the wind energy and the potential rainwater energy under the wind and rain mixed weather the wind energy can be firstly harvested in real time and then the rainwater can be stored to generate electric energy the theoretical analysis model is designed and the working principle of the proposed structure is validated the experiment results show that the proposed energy harvester has an excellent performance in generating energy under different conditions in addition the maximum peak voltage can reach 30 v for open circuit and the maximum average current of the coil with 30 ω resistance is 5 24 ma when the wind speed is 12 m s meanwhile the output average power is 622 92 μ w and 832 μ w for the peh and emh under the optimal load resistance respectively the maximum total output power of the wereh can reach 2196 7 μ w at a wind speed of 12 m s under the impact of rainwater the peak peak voltage can reach 32 v at the optimal flow rate of 18 l min and the maximum average current of the coil is 1 477 ma the maximum energy of the wereh can reach 8659 76 μ j at wind speed 12 m s and 811 35 μ j at flow rate 18 l min in a sweep process time 6s respectively by comparing three different types of low power sensors in sea crossing bridges the longest time of power supply is 254809 18 days and the shortest time is 239 95 days under the total electric power generated per the wereh in one year it provides the potential capability and feasibility to achieve the self powered technology of low power wireless sensors considering the manufacturing cost and the energy harvesting efficiency the optimization structure should be furtherly researched increasing the number of pvdf films and coil turns may be the important methods to enhance the ability to generate electric energy and the ultimate size of the device s components s rotor rainwater wheel will also affect the final energy harvestable how to obtain the optimal structure and improve the final energy harvesting efficiency to meet the needs in practical application will be explored in future work credit authorship contribution statement hao cao methodology software writing original draft xiaohui zeng investigation

20573,as one of the essential types of clean energy renewable energy has great potential to achieve the self powered of wireless sensor the health of the bridge depends mainly on the lifetime of the sensor therefore it is of great significance to use renewable energy to achieve self powered application of bridges in this paper a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvester wereh system for a self powered sea crossing bridge is presented the proposed wereh is installed on the drainpipe on the pier of the sea crossing bridge the system mainly includes three modules energy collection module energy conversion module and energy storage module the energy collection module is composed of s rotor and water wheel the energy conversion module is made up of a pvdf film array and magnet array electric energy can be obtained by the methods in which the pvdf films strike the adjustable plate and the changing magnetic field excites the coil when only windy weather or only rainy weather is available the s rotor and water wheel are used to collect wind energy or rainwater energy respectively when it is windy and rainy mixed weather the energy conversion module can keep working via one way bearings what is more the s rotor and water wheel can be flexibly combined with the energy conversion module to collect wind energy and rain energy respectively finally the power storage module stores the electricity by supercapacitors and the electric energy will be used to supply power for the low power sensor of the sea crossing bridge both simulations and experiments are performed to validate the feasibility and suitability of the system experimental results show that maximum output power can reach 2196 7 μ w at the wind speed of 12 m s and 245 76 μ w at the flow rate of 18 l min under the same condition the maximum electric energy of the wereh can reach 8659 76 μ j in windy weather and 811 35 μ j in rainy weather in a sweep process 6s according to potential energy analysis the annual electricity generated by each wereh device can supply power for a displacement sensor ktc1 lwh for at least 239 95 days and a low power temperature sensor si705x for 254809 18 days at most keywords wind and rainwater energy harvesting supercapacitors sea crossing bridges self powered application 1 introduction due to energy shortage and the aggravation of environmental pollution the development of sustainable energy continues to attract increasing attention sarmiento et al 2019 in the past several years researches had been explored for renewable energy harvesting such as solar energy yang et al 2018 wind energy pan et al 2019 wave energy xie et al 2020 and mechanical vibration energy zhu et al 2020 these researches provided some novel approaches to harvest energy from natural environments e g wind turbines howey et al 2011 and solar cell panels mairizwan et al 2020 the energy collected by the mentioned equipment could be applied to supply power for wireless sensors of a large scale project for the bridge health monitoring system many wireless sensors are utilized to collect various status information such as temperature and crack in such a system the battery cannot maintain a persistent power supply for wireless sensors because they are always in remote areas such as the mountains and the sea this is especially true of sea crossing bridges which are located above sea level on the one hand there is great demand of power supply for sensors to monitor the health status on the other hand adverse work environments reduce the service life of batteries therefore it is of great significance to harvest energy from the surrounding environment to achieve self powered sensor for sea crossing bridges various methods were used to collect energy from the ambient environment such as electromagnetic arroyo and badel 2011 triboelectric wang et al 2012 piezoelectric zhang et al 2017 the other combinations these methods which were adopted to harvest energy largely depended on its environment pan et al 2021 for the sea crossing bridge in remote areas the abundantly available sources such as solar wind rainfall and mechanical vibration can be utilized solar energy is a type of clean and renewable energy but the energy conversion efficiency of it usually depends on weather condition and the area of sunlight that a solar panel can be received in recent years more and more researches about energy harvester for bridge health monitoring have focused on wind energy and mechanical vibration energy because they can be easily obtained from the surrounding environment sazonov et al 2009 regarding wind energy harvester many experiments have shown that electromagnetic and piezoelectric are the highly effective methods of achieving self powered wireless sensors iqbal and khan 2018 in electromagnetic methods the principle of energy harvester is using the transmission mechanism to convert wind energy into electric energy by the relative motion between the magnet and coil this method is widely used in wind turbine technology balat 2009 with the miniaturization of energy harvesting devices some electromagnetic energy harvesters which are based on windmill structures have been studied wu and lee 2014 proposed a miniature windmill structured energy harvester which could be used in wireless monitoring for forest fires and the peak output voltage could reach 5 2 v fei et al 2012 developed a low speed wind flutter energy harvester to harvest electrical energy using airflow and copper coils and a permanent magnet to supply power for wireless sensors although these researches had been completed some of them are rarely used in the self powered monitoring of sea crossing bridges the second wind energy harvesting strategy is based on piezoelectric materials compared with the electromagnetic strategy various experiments have shown that piezoelectric materials have more performance advantages because of their special material properties elahi et al 2018 fei et al 2012 described a piezo windmill prototype that was used to harvest wind energy qing et al 2017 introduced the application of piezoelectric technology in pavements to generate more electricity rezaei hosseinabadi et al 2015 presented a topology that used piezoelectric materials to collect wind energy and it could achieve self powered wireless sensor nodes yang et al 2018 utilized magnetic and piezoelectric methods to develop a small scale piezoelectric energy harvester to achieve wind energy harvesting piezoelectric materials have high work efficiency in many applications yan et al 2020 but many of them also show disadvantageous material properties when they are used in unfavorable conditions for example piezoelectric ceramic transducers pzts often show brittleness if they were impacted strongly nabavi and zhang 2016 although pzts have a higher piezoelectric constant and electromechanical coupling coefficient than piezoelectric films pvdfs vatansever et al 2011 the former pzts is very prone to exhibiting fatigue fracture in periodic load processes because of its brittleness lin and giurgiutiu 2006 despite the feasibility of wind energy harvesting with the existing approaches and systems it should be noted that other kinds of energy could be utilized in the drainage systems of bridges such as rainwater energy the rainwater which is collected from houses roads and bridges has great potential for exploitation imteaz et al 2012 many types of research have proved that using hydro generators to harvest rainwater energy is an effective approach rosmin et al 2015 aziz et al 2016 studied a micro hydro generator that collected rainwater energy from the roof and the results showed that the generator s output power could reach about 500 w kumar et al 2016 utilized a micro turbine to harvest the potential energy from rainwater in a tall building although the micro turbine system can use rainwater to harvest rainwater energy some disadvantages such as high cost make it fall short of the requirement of powering for wireless sensor nodes in addition other categories of rainwater energy harvesting are based on piezoelectric material wong et al 2015 most of the researches about rainwater energy harvesting usually focus on single raindrop energy harvesting guigon et al 2008a b raindrops impact the piezoelectric material and make it vibrate to achieve energy conversion wong and dahari 2017 ilyas and swingler 2017 developed an energy harvesting module which was composed of piezoelectric devices and the results showed that the overall efficiency of a single device could reach 0 671 0 158 to enhance the performance of piezoelectric energy harvester wong et al 2016 proposed using a hollow cut in the middle of the block as a water shelter in which raindrops were collected then a large number of raindrops would impact the piezoelectric material by syringe to enhance raindrop energy harvesting therefore the method which uses the rainwater collected by roof road or bridge to impact piezoelectric beam to generate electric energy is feasible the windy weather and rainy weather often appear at sea level but most of energy harvesting devices can only collect the single type of energy wind energy or rainwater energy the apparent result is that such a device cannot work in conditions when it lacks this type of energy hence it is imperative to increase the utilization rate of energy harvester and make energy harvester have high work efficiently in the complex environment in order to utilize energy harvesting around the sea crossing bridge and achieve self powered monitoring of wireless sensors this paper proposed a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvesting wereh system s rotor and water wheel are used to collect wind and rainwater respectively the pvdf film array strikes the adjustable plate to generate ac voltage and the coils are excited by the rotating magnetic array to generate ac voltage under the action of the controller ac voltage is converted to dc voltage and the electric energy will be stored in the supercapacitor to supply power for the wireless sensor although the starting speed of the s rotor and the water wheel are different the starting speed of the water wheel can be adjusted by changing the distance and the rainwater collector in addition rainwater can be stored and recycled but wind can t be stored to meet the requirement of real time energy harvesting wind energy can be harvested firstly and then rainwater energy is collected by the stored rainwater under the wind and rain mixed weather therefore the energy harvester can work in various weather conditions this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the design of the wereh and its operation principles section 3 describes the theoretical model the experimental details are presented in section 4 in section 5 the results and discussions are provided the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 system design and operation principles the goal of this research is to develop a mechanical structure of piezoelectric and electromagnetic hybrid energy harvesting to collect wind energy and rain energy around the sea crossing bridge a schematic of the wind energy and rainwater energy harvesting system proposed in this paper is shown in fig 1 it consists of three main parts energy collection module electricity conversion module and energy storage module the wereh is mounted on the bridge drain pipe under a sea crossing bridge considering the size of existing actual drain pipes of sea crossing bridges and the installation position of the wereh the overall size of the model and installation position can be shown in fig 2 as the direction of rainwater flow in the drainpipe is vertical downward the central axis of the rainwater wheel is a horizontal direction in order to keep the same direction between the central axis of the rainwater wheel and that of the s rotor the central axis of the s rotor is set to be a horizontal direction to collect the wind energy which flow across the bridge pier surface the schematic of the experimental setup of the wereh is shown in fig 3 there are three working modes only s rotor is rotation only the rainwater wheel is rotation and s rotor and rain wheel are both rotations at the same time for the first working mode it is usually used to collect the wind energy which flows across the bridge pier when the natural wind blows across the bridge and the wind speed reaches the minimum starting wind speed of the s rotor the s rotor begins to rotate in addition the inner ring of the one way bearing of the s rotor is connected to the axle and the outer ring is connected to the s rotor then the rotor pm rotor which is made of pvdf film and magnetic array will rotate clockwise via the one way bearing and axle the pvdf film will strike the adjustable plate to generate ac voltage at the same time the coil will generate electricity under the excitation of the changing magnetic field the second working mode is only the rain wheel rotates when the wind speed can t reach the minimum start up wind speed of the s rotor rainwater along the inner surface of the pipe impacts the wheel and makes pm rotor rotate under the effect of the one way bearing the rain wheel drives the axle to rotate clockwise the axle cannot drive the s rotor to rotate because of the function of one way bearing in this situation therefore the pm rotor will follow the rainwater wheel to rotate clockwise the third working mode is that both the rainwater wheel and s rotor are rotation under the impaction of rainwater and wind respectively under this working mode the state of pm rotor rotation is dependent on which one s rotation speed is faster i e s rotor and wheel and the slower one will not have any effect on the rotation state of the pm rotor because of the effect of one way bearings consequently the pm rotor will convert wind energy and rainwater energy into electrical energy via the electromagnetic harvester emh and pvdf energy harvester peh then the rectifying circuit converts ac voltage into dc voltage finally the electrical energy would be stored in the supercapacitors and it could be used to supply the power for sensors which monitor the health state of sea crossing bridges 2 1 energy collection module the energy collection module includes a wind energy collection module namely s rotor and a rainwater energy collection module namely water wheel and they are all fixed on the axle via one one way bearing and one rolling bearing as shown in fig 4 the function of the one way bearing is to maintain one way rotation of the rotor and the axle when one type of energy collection module begins to rotate the axle will follow to rotate in the same direction via the action of the one way bearing but the above process cannot be reversed i e the axle cannot drive the energy collection module to rotate in addition the function of the rolling bearing is to limit the axial displacement of the energy collection module the wind collection module is an important component the advantage of the s rotor is that it has a good start up performance and does not require high wind speed when the wind drives the s rotor to rotate or when rainwater impacts the water wheel the pm rotor will be driven to rotate under the effect of the axle subsequently wind energy and rainwater energy will be collected respectively 2 2 electricity generator module the electricity generator module namely pm rotor is one of the most important components for the wereh and it is utilized to convert wind energy and rainwater energy into electrical energy the module mainly includes the pvdf film energy harvester peh and the electromagnetic energy harvester emh as shown in fig 5 in the peh there are four pvdf films and one end is free and the other end fixed on the pm rotor by the clamped beam when the pm rotor is rotating the pvdf film will impact the adjustable plate and undergo the bending deformation the distance between the pvdf film s free end and the top of the excitation beam is called impact length different impact lengths will make the pvdf film have different degrees of deformation as for the emh it is made up of two parts four magnets and one copper coil the four magnets are symmetrically placed on the pm rotor to form the rotor of the electricity generator module as the stator of the electricity generator module the copper coil is placed in a protective shell the material of magnet is ndfeb n30uh and the distance between the two opposite magnets is 33 8 mm the coil is above the magnet and the distance between coil and magnet is 11 17 mm as the incentive part of the pvdf film the adjustable plate is located on top of the protective shell the related parameters of the rotor utilized in this paper are listed in fig 6 and table 1 2 3 power storage module after electric energy is generated by the peh and the emh the process of energy harvesting is completed the electrical energy is outputted in the form of ac voltage in order to furtherly achieve energy storage and recycling a rectifier circuit is utilized to convert ac voltage to dc voltage the rectified current will be stored in the storage battery for electrical energy storage supercapacitors is widely used because of their rapid charge time and long cycle life barra et al 2021 the electrical rectifier circuit for wereh is shown in fig 7 3 modeling and analysis as one of the important components of the wereh the s rotor is used to convert wind energy into mechanical energy the s rotor is one type of resistance wind turbine fan structure and it can achieve wind energy capture in multiple wind directions the theoretical model of the s rotor is shown in fig 8 the s rotor consists of five identical blades and two turn plates when the wind impacts it the concave surface and convex surface of the blades will be impacted by airflow at different intensities due to the concave surfaces obtaining more force than the convex surfaces the blades resistance can be calculated with the following formulas 1 f b 1 1

2 represent the resistance coefficient of the convex surface and concave surface of the blades v w i n d is the air velocity ω is the angular velocity of s rotor and the r s is the average radius of the s rotor as the different resistance coefficients of the concave surface and the convex surface the s rotor will rotate when rotary torque is produced the kinetic energy e w i n d can be calculated by the following formulas 4 e w i n d 1 2 ρ s a v w i n d 5 ω 2 e w i n d c p j 1 2 when the s rotor is rotating the rotational angular velocity of it can be calculated by formula 5 where c p is the average power factor and j is the moment of inertia for the s rotor ω represents the rotational angular velocity as the s rotor passes the moment of inertia to the pm rotor via the shaft all of them have the same rotational angular velocity in addition rainwater of the deck of the bridge is usually collected by water pipe kumar et al 2016 when the rainwater flows through the internal surface of the pipe the rainwater will impact the rainwater wheel blade and drive it to rotate under the action of the one way bearing the rain water wheel will drive the pm rotor to rotate when the shaft transfers force to rotate the pm rotor then the pvdf film will impact the adjustable plate to generate ac electricity at the same time the rotation of the magnet array will motivate the coil to generate ac electricity the schematic diagram of the rainwater wheel is shown in fig 9 assuming rainwater is in the form of a water jet when the rainwater impacts the wheel blades as shown in fig 9 b in order to simplify the model rainwater from the water pipe is described in the form of a water column and a stationary length of which impacts the blade vashisht 2012 there is a loss of rainwater after the rainwater strikes the blade pujol et al 2010 we assume a non viscous fluid unable to exert shear forces on the blade and the flow velocity of the rainwater is not changed the flow velocity of the rainwater is v w and the diameter of the rainwater column is d p therefore the rainwater flow rate q and the torque t can be given as follows 6 q v w π 1 2 d p 2 1 4 v w π d p 2 7 t ρ w v w d w cos a under different flow rates q the wheel will be impacted by different torques t in this paper the diameter of the rainwater column d p is 13 mm and the rainwater flow rate q can be measured by a flowmeter ρ w is the density of water i e 10 3 k g m 3 as the core component of the energy converter the pm rotor is applied to achieve energy conversion the pm rotor is made up of a pvdf film array and magnet array the pvdf film is mainly based on the piezoelectric effect and generates different charges on its surface to form coupling voltage when it deforms under external force zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 10 at the initial state fig 10 a there is no charge is generated on the surface of piezoelectric material once the pvdf film is bending deformation it will generate the positive charge and negative charge on the surface of the piezoelectric material layer hence it will generate a small electric potential namely coupling voltage under the conscious rotation of the pm rotor the pvdf film will continuously generate electricity by striking the adjustable plate in turn there are two working modes namely d 31 mode and d 33 mode the pvdf film will generate electric charge in d 31 mode

to verify the effectiveness of the system the comsol multiphysics 5 5 is utilized to conduct finite element simulation when the pm rotor rotates the pvdf film will strike the adjustable plate and appear the bending deformation then the piezoelectric coupling effect is produced at the surface of the pvdf film and the coupling voltage can be extracted zhang et al 2017 in order to simplify the simulation model the two protective layer are merged into one and the material properties of protective layer is polyethylene the structural parameters and the material properties of the pvdf film are given in table 1 the implemented matrices of the material properties of the pvdf film can be obtained according to reference zhang et al 2017 the impact time of the equivalent impulse force can be estimated theoretically and experimentally by combining with the experimental waveform during the process of bending deformation of pvdf film the piezoelectric layer and the protective layer of the pvdf film will have damping the rayleigh damping α 0 5 s 1 β 6 10 4 s will be set during the simulation of the pvdf film bao and wang 2020 assume the equivalent impulse force is 0 25 n and the time of impaction is set 0 0015s under the wind speed of 7 m s as shown in fig 13 a the applied equivalent excitation force impacts on the free end of the pvdf film and the output voltage of it under the optimal load resistance 290 k ω in a working period 0 1s is shown in fig 13 b it can be seen that the maximum of the peak voltage can reach 8 0 v and the pvdf film will occur oscillation motion with decreasing amplitude during the process of the pvdf film recovery deformation after it passes through the adjustable plate fig 14 shows the corresponding results of the displacement and output voltageat different times 0 01s 0 06s therefore it can be obtained the output voltage of the pvdf film under various wind speeds by setting different equivalent impulse force and impact times once the simulation model is built for the emh part the magnet array will also rotate and the coil will generate ac electricity under the variation of the magnetic field when the pm rotor rotates the geometry parameter and material properties values of simulation model can be obtained by fig 6 and table 2 for the parameter values of various rotation speeds they can be obtained by the voltage waveform of a period time during the process of experiment respectively in order to analyze the distribution of the magnetic field and the variation of the output voltage a magnetostatic and transient solution type was used to simulate the magnetic field and the output voltage at different rotation speeds fig 15 depicts the distribution of magnetic flux density with rotation speed at 400 rpm wind speed of 8 m s it can be observed that the magnetic flux density is changing around the magnets and the maximum magnet flux density is 1 13 t at 0 015 s and 0 035 s 4 experimental details to verify the feasibility of the proposed model a prototype of the wereh was built fig 16 showed the wind energy harvester experimental schematic mode and the details a centrifugal air blower was used to simulate the wind field a wind tunnel was utilized to ensure the stability and the concentration of the wind in order to change the value of wind speed an adjustable transformer was used to control the value of voltage to change the speed of the centrifugal air blower the wind generated by the centrifugal air blower impacted the s rotor by the wind tunnel under the action of the axle and the one way bearing the water wheel didn t rotate and the pm rotor would follow the s rotor to rotate after that the free end of the pvdf film would strike the adjustable plate to generate electricity and the magnet array would rotate to generate a changing magnetic field then the pvdf film generated electrical energy because of the bending deformation and simultaneously the coil would generate electrical energy under the changing magnetic field for the magnet array the magnets are arranged in the same polar symmetrically the prototype parameters are shown in table 2 the wind speed was measured by an anemometer smart sensor ar866 and the resistance box shahe zx99 ia was used as the external load resistance when the wind speed was changed the data of generated voltage by the pvdf and the coil could be measured respectively by adjusting the length of the adjustable plate and the value of load resistance the various voltage of the pvdf and the coil will be obtained finally all the recorded data were input to the computer to analysis to improve the accuracy of the prototype performance a lot of reliable data are recorded and analyzed see fig 17 in order to simulate the effect of the rainwater energy harvesting for the wereh a simple experimental setup was shown in fig 16 water was pumped up from a pool to simulate the process of the rainwater impacting the blade of the water wheel after the water piper was full of rainwater and the flow rate was stable the relevant data would be recorded during the experiment the flow rate would be controlled by a water tap and a flow meter was used to record the flow data of the water pipe when the water of the pipe impacted on the water wheel the water wheel would be driven to rotate due to the action of the one way bearing and the axle the s rotor would not rotate while the pm rotor could follow rotation then the pvdf film would impact the adjustable plate to generate ac electrical energy at the same time the coil would generate electrical energy under the changing magnetic field an oscilloscope was utilized to measure the piezoelectric voltage from the pvdf film and the electromagnetic voltage from the coil by changing the flow rate and the load resistance the output voltages of the pvdf film and the coil would be recorded in order to ensure the accuracy of the prototype performance evaluation a lot of highly reliable data were collected 5 results and discussions 5 1 the piezoelectric portion of wind energy harvesting the prototype of the wereh was placed in the wind tunnel to study its performance as the wind speed increased from 7 m s to 12 m s different impact length will make the pvdf film generate different voltages fig 18 shows the open circuit root mean square rms voltage at the following wind speeds 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s the rms voltage will increase with the increase of the impact length when the impact length is 15 mm the rms voltage reaches its maximum value under wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s although the pvdf film has the higher rms voltage at the impact length of 15 mm and 20 mm when the wind speed is 11 m s and 12 m s the longer impact length will hinder the rotation of the pm rotor and cause the reduction of rms voltage of pvdf film in order to simplify the experiment process and maintain the uniformity of experimental conditions the impact length of 15 mm will be utilized in the follow up experiments when the output voltage is obtained the average power p a v e can be calculated by p a v e t 0 t 1 v t 2 d t r t 1 t 0 where the v t is the load voltage at t moment and the r is load resistance and the t 1 t 0 is the duration of the voltage waveform zhao et al 2019 in order to simplify the calculation the rms voltage v r m s was used to calculate the average output power p a v e and the calculation formula is p a v e v r m s 2 r the effects of rms voltage and average power under the load at different wind speeds are shown in fig 19 as the value of load resistance increases the rms voltage increases the average power also increases when the load resistance increases and it will reach maximum at the optimal load resistance kim et al 2015 from fig 19 b it can be observed that the optimal load resistance are about 350 k ω 290 k ω 270 k ω 290 k ω 230 ω 210 ω for wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s respectively furtherly the rms voltage increases correspondingly with the increase of load resistance at the same wind speed nevertheless the average power increases firstly and than decreases in order to maintain uniformity of experiments and consistency of experimental conditions a resistance of 290 k ω will be used in the subsequent experiments in addition the excitation frequency under different wind speeds can be evaluated by voltage waveform over a while in the experiment zhao et al 2019 fig 20 depicts the relationship between the excitation frequency of the pvdf film and wind speed under the open circuit as shown in fig 20 the value of excitation frequency increases with an increase in wind speed the corresponding excitation frequencies the frequency of one rotation period are approximately 3 63 hz 5 67 hz 7 93 hz 9 64 hz 12 64 hz 14 79 hz under the wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s and 12 m s respectively fig 21 depicts the output voltage of simulation and experimentat different wind speeds when the load resistance is 290 k ω when the wind speed is 7 m s the waveform of the output voltage is a gradual attenuation oscillation waveform with the increase of wind speed the vibration period of the pvdf film will be shortened accordingly at the same time the number of excitation times is also increased the same phenomenon can be found in ref bao and wang 2020 thus more wind energy will be captured when wind speed is increasing fig 22 depicts the electrical performance comparison between the open circuit voltage and load voltage for the peh at different wind speeds when the peh is open circuit the output voltage amplitude increases from 24 v to 30 v with an increase in wind speed moreover the maximum amplitude of voltage can reach about 30 v when the wind speed is 9 m s this phenomenon may be that the pvdf films appear different impact length when they strike the adjustable plate and it causes the inconsistency of output voltage for each pvdf film additionally the output voltage of the peh with a resistance of 290 k ω is demonstrated in fig 22 c and d respectively the current i can be calculated by i v r the maximum voltage amplitudes are about 9 2 v for wind speed of 7 m s and 13 6 v for wind speed of 12 m s at the same time the corresponding maximum currents are 0 0317 ma and 0 0468 ma respectively when the wind speed is low the amplitude of the voltage waveform maintains a stable value 9 2 v similarly when the wind speed is high the voltage amplitude is another stable value 13 6 v 5 2 the electromagnetic portion of wind energy harvesting the coil is connected with a load resistance of 30 ω which is equal to the measured resistance of the coil the rotation speed of the magnet array is equal to that of the pvdf rotor and it can be obtained from the output voltage waveform of the pvdf film the results of the experiment and simulation for the emh at wind speeds of 7 m s 8 m s 9 m s 10 m s 11 m s 12 m s are shown in fig 23 from the fig 23 the rotational speed of the rotor is increasing when the wind speed increases the load voltage generated by electromagnetic induction rises from 0 08 v to 0 184 v in addition it is clear that the results of the simulation agree well with the experimental data at the different wind speeds even so there are still inconsistencies between the output voltage waveform for experimental data and the adjacent waveform the reason for this phenomenon may be the measurement error and additionally assembly error which made the prototype structure less than completely symmetrical moreover there will be some slight fluctuations during the experiment which may cause tiny errors between the experiment and simulation the energy harvesting system of wereh is made up of the peh and the emh and they are connected by a rotor hence they have the same work frequency in the process of pm rotor rotation usually there is energy loss in electrical energy during transmission the power of the prototype can be obtained without considering energy loss when the wind speed ranges from 7 m s to 12 m s the instantaneous power of peh and emh is shown in fig 24 the peh s maximum power increases from 168 9 μ w to 1117 2 μ w while the emh s maximum power rises from 213 3 μ w to 1128 5 μ w the maximum output power can reach 2196 7 μ w when wind speeds are 7 m s and 8 m s the maximum power for the emh is higher than that of the peh this is because the voltage waveform generated by pvdf film is not uniform although their peak voltage is higher as the wind speed reaches 9 m s the maximum output power of the emh is lower than that of the peh when the rotation speed increases the time of that the pvdf film is from bending deformation to restitution is shortened it makes the maximum power of the peh increase when the wind speed increases from 10 m s to 12 m s the maximum power of the emh is higher than that of the peh the high rotation speed of the pm rotor accelerates the change of magnetic flux under the high wind speed conditions the method of electromagnetic power generation has more advantages in order to furtherly analyze the electrical performance of the peh and the emh the rms voltage and average power of them under the load are shown in fig 25 for the peh as the wind speed increases from 7 m s to 12 m s the rms voltage rises from 3 887 v to 13 441 v and the average power increases from 52 122 μ w to 622 92 μ w respectively for the emh the rms voltage increases from 0 057 v to 0 157 v and the average power rises from 108 333 μ w to 832 μ w fig 26 shows that the comparisons of average power between simulation and experiment of peh emh and wereh peh emh it can be seen that the average power is increasing with the increase of wind speed the result of the simulation and the experiment have the same change trend fig 27 shows the comparisons of average current between the peh and the emh at different wind speeds the average current of the peh changes from 0 013 ma to 0 046 ma and that of the emh changes from 1 9 ma to 5 24 ma although the output voltage of the peh is higher than that of the emh the average power and average current of the peh are less than those of the emh the same results can be obtained in zhao et al 2019 the reason for this is that the emh has lower load resistance and the voltage generated by the changing magnetic flux is more uniform hence the wereh can be suitable for wireless power supply equipment with low load resistance and high load resistance 5 3 the piezoelectric and electromagnetic portions of rainwater energy harvesting there is great potential to harvest electrical energy from rainwater chua et al 2016 fig 28 shows the results of simulation and experiment for the peh at different flow rates when the flow rate is low the excitation frequency of the pvdf film is also low and the oscillation period of it is long before the next pvdf film strikes the adjustable plate with the increase of flow rate the number of incentives in unit time also increases and the oscillation period of each pvdf film will be shortened fig 29 describes the results of simulation and experiment for the emh with load at different flow rates when the flow rate of rainwater is low the voltage waveform is relatively sparse because the rotation speed of the magnet array low it can be seen that the peak voltage of load is increasing when the flow rate increases for the coil the larger rotation speed makes the change of magnetic flux per unit time become faster and the induced voltage of it is also increase fig 30 shows the time histories of output voltage when the different flow rates of rainwater impact the water wheel under open circuit and load when the flow rates range from 10 l min to 20 l min the maximum output voltage boosts from 14 v to 18 8 v under open circuit and the change trend is not apparent even though the number of excitation times rises with the increase of the flow rate for the emh it is evident that the output voltage is increasing when the flow rate enhances in addition the rms voltage and the value of peak to peak voltage vpp are important factors to evaluate the performance of electricity the rms voltage and vpp voltage are increasing with the increase of flow rate for the peh as shown in fig 31 when the flow rate is 18 l min the maximum rms voltage and vpp voltage reach 11 10 v and 32 v respectively after that the rms voltage and vpp voltage decrease with the increase of the flow rate from fig 31 a the maximum output voltage amplitude can reach 16 4 v for the peh for the emh the rms voltage and the vpp voltage range from 0 192 v to 0 33 v and 0 046 v 0 102 v respectively fig 32 illustrates the respective effects of electrical energy harvesting under the load for the peh and emh when the flow rate raises from 10 l min to 18 l min the rms voltage and the average power increase from 2 82 v to 4 80 v and 27 56 μ w to 79 45 μ w respectively while the flow rate continues to increase the rms voltage and the average power will decrease for the emh the rms voltage and the average power show the tendency of linear increase in addition the maximum rms voltage and the average powers are 0 044 v and 65 41 μ w for the emh respectively the rotation speed of the pm rotor is increasing with the increase of the flow rate meanwhile the excitation frequency of pvdf film and magnet array is also increasing for the peh the electric energy collected by the pvdf film is increasing when the excitation frequency increases however the amount of energy generated by each excitation is related to the bending degree of the pvdf film when the excitation frequency keeps increasing until the value is beyond one particular frequency the degree of bending deformation will decrease for the emh the voltage is generated by the variation in magnetic flux the faster the magnetic flux changes in unit time the more energy is generated therefore the rms voltage and the average power tend to rise firstly and then falling for the peh but the emh tends to continuously increase the instantaneous power values of the peh and the emh under different flow rates are shown in fig 33 it can be seen the maximum output power of the emh increases from 22 53 μ w to 120 μ w as the flow rate increases from 10 l min to 20 l min while the maximum output power keeps fluctuating around 150 μ w in the peh for the wereh the maximum output power increases from 179 76 μ w to 245 76 μ w the emh s output power improves significantly when the flow rate increases in order to furtherly analyze the power generation performance of wereh the comparisons of average power between simulation and experiment for peh and emh at different flow rates are shown in fig 34 the results show that simulations and experiments both peh and emh are good agreements the total average power of wereh peh emh is increasing from 35 45 μ w to 135 44 μ w when the flow rate ranges from 10 l min to 18 l min during of experiment when the flow rate is 20 l min the total average of wereh is decreasing although the value of average power increases it can be seen the performance of the peh is higher than the emh under the low rotation speeds of pm rotor under high rotation speed wind speeds at 7 m s 12 m s the performance of energy transformation for the emh will improve obviously fig 35 shows the comparison of average current between the peh and the emh at different flow rates of rainwater as the flow rate increases from 10 l min to 20 l min the peh average current ranges from 0 0097 ma to 0 0167 ma while the emh average current ranges from 0 512 ma to 1 477 ma although the instantaneous voltage of the emh is lower than that of the peh the average current of the emh is higher than that of the peh the reason for this is that the optimal load of the peh is much higher than that of the emh for the emh it is easy to provide higher current m a scale for load but its output voltage is very low but the peh can provide higher output voltage and the output current is very low for the capacitor the higher output current can improve the charging rate and the energy converter with higher output voltage decide the final voltage of capacitor therefore the wereh hybridized energy converter has better performance than individual the energy converter the peh or the emh fig 36 shows the energy harvested by the wereh in a sweep process time 6s at different wind speeds and flow rates from fig 36 a the wind energy which is harvested by the wereh increases from 961 22 μ j to 8659 76 μ j when the wind speed ranges from 7 m s to 12 m s in addition the wind energy harvested by the emh is always higher than that of the peh at different wind speeds for rainwater energy the electrical energy harvested by the wereh increases from 63 65 μ j to 718 58 μ j as the flow increases 10 l min to 20 l min and the maximum energy is 811 35 μ j at the flow rate of 18 l min the energy collected by the peh is higher than the energy collected by the emh as the flow rate ranges from 12 l min to 18 l min when the flow rate is 20 l min the rotation speed of the pm rotor is higher than that at 18 l min the rotation speed of pm rotor in the windy condition is higher than that in the rainwater condition therefore it can be seen the emh is the device s main way of harvesting energy at high rotation speeds while the peh is the main way of harvesting energy at low rotation speeds additionally the proposed wind energy and rainwater harvester can improve average output power by increasing the number of turns of coil or the number of pvdf films moreover the proposed wind energy and rainwater harvester can be applied in different wind and rainwater environments such as tall buildings and roofs 5 4 energy harvesting potentiality analysis to estimate the energy harvesting potentiality of the wereh xia zhang cross sea bridge located in the east of xiamen and zhangzhou was selected as the case study as shown in fig 37 the total length of the main bridge of xia zhang cross sea bridge is 8 56 km and the width of the bridge deck is 33 5 m liu et al 2010 2015 the number of total bridge piers is 322 and the distance from the bottom of the pier to the bridge deck is 61 6 m chen and chen 2012 considering toll stations and environmental factors this study adopts an effective bridge length of 6 km and width of 30 m and 300 bridge piers the wereh is connected to the bridge drainage pipe which is installed on bridge piers and each bridge pier has two drainage pipes we assume that an energy harvester is placed every 1 m and an effective length of 20 m will be used to calculate for every drainage pipe therefore it can be calculated that there are 12000 energy harvesters and 180000 m 2 of the effective bridge area are used to collect rainwater in order to conveniently evaluate the energy output performance of all the wereh the relevant assumptions are given as follows 1 in order to better evaluate energy harvesting levels we assume that ten energy harvesters in each bridge pipe are used to harvest rainwater energy and another ten harvesters are used to harvest wind energy in addition wind energy harvesters and rainwater energy harvesters do not affect each other because each bridge pier has two drainage pipes there are 20 energy harvesters used to collect wind energy and another 20 energy harvesters used to collect rainwater energy for every bridge pier 2 we ignore the influence of the pier and deck of the bridge during the wind energy calculation 3 we assume the wind speed is stable and each energy harvester will be impacted under the same wind speed when the wind impacts all the wind energy harvesters 4 considering the rainwater we assume that the same flow rate impacts every rainwater energy harvester in each pipe for the wereh the monthly wind power can be calculated by the following formulas 26 e m e w m e r m 27 e w m p v i d v i 0 d v i 30 28 e r m ρ p v r where the e m is the total amount of electricity generation in a month e w m and e r m stand for the electrical energy generated from wind energy and rainwater energy in a month respectively p v i is the power at a given wind speed 7 m s v i 12 m s in a month and d v i is the corresponding effective working day under the same wind speed every month in order to simplify the calculation we assume the flow rate of rainwater is keeping 18 l min and the power density ρ p of that as the calculation power for the wereh during the rainwater energy harvesting v r is the volume of rainwater collected in a month for the estimation of wind power generation we assume that 5 h cumulative work time of the energy harvester as one day under a certain stable wind speed 7 m s 12 m s considering the variation of wind speed at different times in one day and the corresponding output power is used to calculate the power generation the annual wind speed distribution is predicted by the measured wind speed in refs liu et al 2010 chen and chen 2012 considering the variation of wind speed at different times in one day the total workday of the energy harvester under one certain stable wind speed is assumed and the total electric energy under the different wind speeds is shown in fig 38 it can be seen the work time of the energy harvester is increasing when the wind speed increases from 7 m s to 12 m s and that the total electrical energy ranges from 0 6727 kwh to 17 318 kwh therefore the annual electrical energy of wind energy is about 39 7913 kwh in order to obtain the meteorological precipitation data we used the meteonorm software a combination of reliable data sources from global energy balance archive data geba gilgen et al 1998 fig 39 shows the monthly average precipitation distribution in xiamen 1991 2010 the monthly electricity power generated by rainwater is shown in fig 40 the maximum electric power is 0 1167 kwh in june the total electrical power generated by the rainwater is 0 52 kwh therefore the total annual electricity power generated by wind energy and rainwater energy is about 40 3113 kwh comparing the total annual electricity power of rainwater and that of wind it should be noted that the former is much lower than the latter the reason is that the sea crossing bridge is located above sea level where wind energy is always present but rainwater can only be formed in special climatic conditions and rainy weather is seasonal therefore the electric power generated in a year by rainwater is far less than that of wind because the days of rain in a year are far less than windy weather however the advantage of the rainwater that can be stored and recycled will furtherly increase its utilization rate and the wind energy can only be collected in real time in other words wind energy can be harvested firstly and then rainwater energy is collected by the stored rainwater under the wind and rain mixed weather to meet the requirements of real time energy harvesting for the core component pm rotor all the wind energy and rainwater energy can be harvested hence the combination of the two types of energy harvester can improve the energy resource utilization of the surrounding sea crossing bridge environment considering rainwater energy loss and other electrical power loss we assume that 80 of total electricity power will be used to charge for supercapacitors as the efficiency energy conversion of supercapacitors can reach 90 98 barra et al 2020 so we assume 72 of the harvestable total electrical power is used to supply power for sensors at least to estimate the time of supplying power for low power sensors we choose three types of low power sensors displacement sensor ktc1 lwh accelerometer sensor meas 832 0200 and temperature sensor si705x so the annual electricity generation is 0 002418678 kwh 40 3113 kwh 12000 for per wereh device the power consumption parameters of the three types of sensors are shown in table 3 assuming each bridge pier has three types of sensors that need to be supplied power the time of power supplied for each sensor can be calculated and the results are shown in table 3 comparing the power supply time of the three different type of sensors in a sea crossing bridge the longest power supply time is 254809 18 days and the shortest is 239 95 days for per wereh consequently the lower the power consumption of the sensor the longer the power supply time of the total electrical power assuming every sensor is set per 4 m sazonov et al 2009 there are about 1500 sensors for each type need to be supplied power as the power consumption is different for each kind of sensor taking displacement sensor ktc1 lwh as an example it needs about 2250 werehs to supply the 1500 displacement sensors of sea crossing bridge every year therefore the wereh has potential capability to achieve the self powered technology of low power wireless sensor considering the manufacturing cost and the energy collection efficiency it needs to optimize the construct of the wereh to decrease the number of the werehs and meet the power supply demands of low power sensors as shown in fig 41 the wereh is installed along the piers of the sea crossing bridge natural wind and rainwater at sea level impact the wereh and the wind energy and rainwater energy will be stored in supercapacitors to achieve self powered sensor of sea crossing bridge the proposed wereh could be a reliable solution in order to improve the energy harvesting efficiency and increase its applicability it is necessary to conduct the optimization design about the device s components such as the number of blades and the size of the s rotor and rainwater wheel and furtherly increase the installation accuracy at the same time increasing the number of pvdf films and coil turns may be the required method to enhance the ability to generate electric energy nevertheless the increase in the number of pvdf films or coil turns will increase the damping of the pm rotor in addition when the efficiency of energy harvesting is improved the number of the wereh will need to be further optimized because of the price of materials energy consumption of other higher power sensors mw scale these optimization work will be studied in future research 6 conclusion this paper presents a hybrid wind energy and rainwater energy harvester wereh that can be used to harvest wind energy and rainwater energy around the sea crossing bridges compared with traditional wind energy or rainwater energy harvesters the wereh combined piezoelectric and electromagnetic effect can achieve hybrid energy harvesting as the effect of one way bearing the s rotor and the waterwheel can be separated to harvest the wind energy and the potential rainwater energy under the wind and rain mixed weather the wind energy can be firstly harvested in real time and then the rainwater can be stored to generate electric energy the theoretical analysis model is designed and the working principle of the proposed structure is validated the experiment results show that the proposed energy harvester has an excellent performance in generating energy under different conditions in addition the maximum peak voltage can reach 30 v for open circuit and the maximum average current of the coil with 30 ω resistance is 5 24 ma when the wind speed is 12 m s meanwhile the output average power is 622 92 μ w and 832 μ w for the peh and emh under the optimal load resistance respectively the maximum total output power of the wereh can reach 2196 7 μ w at a wind speed of 12 m s under the impact of rainwater the peak peak voltage can reach 32 v at the optimal flow rate of 18 l min and the maximum average current of the coil is 1 477 ma the maximum energy of the wereh can reach 8659 76 μ j at wind speed 12 m s and 811 35 μ j at flow rate 18 l min in a sweep process time 6s respectively by comparing three different types of low power sensors in sea crossing bridges the longest time of power supply is 254809 18 days and the shortest time is 239 95 days under the total electric power generated per the wereh in one year it provides the potential capability and feasibility to achieve the self powered technology of low power wireless sensors considering the manufacturing cost and the energy harvesting efficiency the optimization structure should be furtherly researched increasing the number of pvdf films and coil turns may be the important methods to enhance the ability to generate electric energy and the ultimate size of the device s components s rotor rainwater wheel will also affect the final energy harvestable how to obtain the optimal structure and improve the final energy harvesting efficiency to meet the needs in practical application will be explored in future work credit authorship contribution statement hao cao methodology software writing original draft xiaohui zeng investigation

increased 5 3 time histories the effect of deadrise angles on the dynamic deflection of the structure with respect to time is presented in fig 5 it is shown that with increasing the deadrise angle the dynamic deflection is decreased it is physically logical since enhancing the deadrise angle leads to lower pressure on the structure for more detail the maximum dynamic deflections for β 10 o and β 30 o are respectively 3 085 mm and 1 61 mm in other words with rising the deadrise angles from 10 to 30 the maximum dynamic displacement is decreased 47 in addition the oscillation peaks will be occurred at lower times with increasing the deadrise angle the effect of vertical speed of wave on the time history of structural deflection is shown in fig 6 it can be seen that with an increase in the vertical speed of wave the pressure induced by slamming is increased and hence the system dynamic deflection enhances about 40 in addition with increasing the vertical speed of wave the oscillation peak is happened at lower time for example the first oscillation peaks for v 3 m s and v 5 m s are happened at t 0 0039 s and t 0 0034 s respectively it means that with increasing the wave speed velocity the time of first oscillation peak is reduced about 15 fig 7 depicts the influence of the structural damping on the time history of beam deflection it can be found that considering the structural damping the dynamic displacement decreases about 30 it is since assuming the viscoelastic properties of the structure the energy observation in the structure increases the influences of gpls volume percent and its distribution on the dynamic deflection of the beam versus time are demonstrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively it can be found that with increasing gpl volume percent the dynamic deflection decreases for detailed study the maximum deflection for the aluminum beam is 2 45 mm and for a beam reinforced by 2 gpl it is 0 7975 mm in other words with reinforcing the beam with gpls the dynamic deflection is reduced about 67 this figure emphasized the important effect of nanoparticles for reinforcing the aluminum beams of wave piercing catamarans in fig 9 the effect of gpls distributions is presented it is evident that the dynamic deflection of beam reinforced by pattern 3 fgx type is lower than other cases it is since in fgx distribution of gpls in the beam the bending rigidity of the structure is improved due to more gpls in away from the neutral axis figs 10 and 11 illustrate the effect of porosity constant and its distribution on the dynamic deflection versus time respectively as it can be observed increasing the porosity constant the dynamic deflection is enhanced about 60 due to reduction in the stiffness of the system it is also found from fig 11 that the dynamic deflection of the beam with porosity distribution type 1 is lower than type 2 it is due to this fact that in porosity distribution type 2 bending rigidity of the structure is higher since the distribution is away from neutral axis fig 12 shows the effect of different boundary conditions on the time histories of dynamic deflection as can be seen the boundary conditions have a significant influence on the dynamic deflection of the beam the maximum dynamic displacement of the beam with cc cs and ss boundary conditions are respectively 1 629 3 26 and 4 083 mm in other words the beam with cc boundary condition has the dynamic displacement about 2 5 times lower than ss ones it is since the beam with cc boundary conditions has higher stiffness 6 conclusion the effect of
