17245,iodinated disinfection by products i dbps have recently emerged as part of the pool of dbps of public health concern due to limitations in measuring individual i dbps in a water sample the surrogate measure of total organic iodine toi is often used to account for the sum of all i dbps in this study toi and total iodine ti are quantified in raw and treated waters in treatment trains at three sites in the northeast united states the occurrence magnitude and seasonality of these species was investigated within each sampling train and across the different sites a regression model was developed to explore how toi occurrence varies with routinely measured physical and chemical parameters in a water sample the toi and ti concentration at the three sites ranged from below the method detection limit to 18 µg l and from 3 and 18 9 µg l respectively there was substantial inter monthly variability in toi without a clear seasonal signal and the concentration of toi did not increase upon treatment the results of the multivariate regression model showed that dissolved organic carbon doc specific uv254 absorbance suva combined chlorine residual tcl2 and ph were all significantly related to toi concentration to varying degrees a tobit model was fit to show toi predictions against observed measured toi values the model could explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi

chlor am ination 1 introduction disinfection by product dbp formation due to the chemical disinfection of drinking water with powerful oxidants such as chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide has been an ongoing challenge for health agencies and water utilities during disinfection hundreds possibly thousands of organically bound halogenated compounds form in chlorinated and chloraminated waters while chlorinated and brominated dbps have been studied for many years in terms of health risk and occurrence in drinking water iodinated dbps i dbps have been a relatively recent concern not only have improved analytical methods detected a variety of i dbps but health risk studies have also shown that i dbps exhibited enhanced cyto and genotoxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated dbps cemeli et al 2006 hunter et al 1996 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2004a 2004b richardson et al 2007 2008 sayess et al 2017 the large number and diversity of dbps is attributed to the many reaction pathways that are available to aqueous chlorine and chloramines coupled with the diverse nature of the organic reactants i e natural organic matter nom as a result measurement of specific dbps is both labor intensive and fragmentary instead the parameter tox total organic halogen has been accepted as a surrogate measure of the sum of all halogenated dbps i e compounds that are organically bound to chlorine bromine and iodine in a water sample li et al 2002 reckhow et al 1990 richardson 2003 similarly methods for total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi have been developed to discriminate between chlorinated brominated and iodinated dbps i dbps in a water sample hua and reckhow 2006 2007 hua et al 2006 kristiana et al 2009 oleksy frenzel et al 2000 sayess and reckhow 2017 while the formation of tobr occurs as a result of addition of chlorine to a water containing inorganic bromide and organic dbp precursors the environmental chemistry and transport of iodine is substantially different from that of bromine while most naturally occurring bromine exists as the bromide anion br total iodine ti is more evenly distributed across organic and reduced and oxidized inorganic forms i e iodide anion i and iodate anion io3 e g fuge and johnson 2015 gilfedder et al 2010 whitehead 1984 iodate is expected be the most stable form of iodine in oxygen saturated waters but environmental surveys have found waters dominated by each of the three forms a consequence of iodine s low ionization potential and facile redox transitions e g gilfedder et al 2010 yang et al 2007 furthermore each of the iodine species have the ability to rapidly change forms even within a water treatment plant for example recent studies have shown that iodinated organic compounds will release i and io3 will undergo chemical reduction to i simply from exposure to some common water treatment processes duirk et al 2011 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2000 zhang et al 2016 this unique chemistry is expected to have major implications on the formation of i dbps when i containing water is treated with oxidants disinfectants total iodine ti has been measured in japanese rivers takaku et al 1995 in u s canadian and european rivers moran et al 2002 in german lakes gilfedder et al 2010 and in danish groundwaters voutchkova et al 2014 it has also been studied in some canadian and in u s raw and treated drinking waters blount et al 2010 kim et al 2020 tugulea et al 2018 interest in quantifying specific i dbps and more generally toi in water samples has been growing due to the body of evidence showing greater cyto and genotoxicity of i dbps compared to their chlorinated and brominated analogues hunter et al 1996 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2008 2010 richardson et al 2008 sayess et al 2017 many groups of i dbps e g iodo trihalomethanes iodo acetic acids iodo acetamides and others have been detected in chlorinated and chloraminated natural and model waters spiked with different levels of iodide bromide and or humic substances and in grab samples of raw and finished drinking water ackerson et al 2018 2020 bichsel and von gunten 2000 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2013 hansson et al 1987 hu et al 2018 ioannou et al 2016 jeong et al 2015 krasner et al 2006 liu et al 2017 pantelaki and voutsa 2018 pan et al 2016a plewa et al 2008 postigo et al 2017 richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 wang et al 2016 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 others have focused on measuring toi in municipal and hospital wastewater gong et al 2018 oleksy frenzel et al 2000 in laboratory chlorinated ackerson et al 2018 2020 hua et al 2006 pan et al 2016a yang et al 2014 and chloraminated natural waters ackerson et al 2018 ersan et al 2019 pan et al 2016a yang et al 2014 model drinking waters zhu and zhang 2016 and laboratory chlorinated and chloraminated nom isolates kristiana et al 2009 aside from the municipal and hospital wastewater samples all the experiments were conducted while adding elevated levels of iodine and or bromine species to the raw water three studies reported the concentration of toi in grab tap water samples in china gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016a a recently published study on tox speciation in 12 drinking water systems in the u s failed to detect toi in any of the samples kim et al 2020 to our knowledge there have not been any successful attempts at measuring and characterizing the presence of toi in drinking water treatment plants wtps and their respective distribution systems at ambient halogen levels furthermore since all the studies were implemented either on raw lab treated simulated or one time grab water samples there are no data on how toi behaves in real world engineered systems over extended periods of time therefore this work presents the first full scale study on the occurrence of toi in raw and chloraminated drinking water at ambient iodine and bromine levels a recently developed highly sensitive method was used for toi determination sayess and reckhow 2017 in the context of the knowledge gaps we characterize the magnitude and seasonal behavior of toi and the contribution of toi to ti concentrations in three wtps we use that information to pose the following hypotheses 1 toi concentration significantly increases upon treatment and the organic fraction of ti changes between raw and treated water and 2 toi occurrence is influenced by commonly measured physical and chemical properties in a treated water sample the ultimate goal of this line of research is to understand and predict the occurrence of toi in treated water to enable water utilities to better control iodinated organics in their finished waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 instrumentation and sample analyses the detailed method for toi analysis has been previously described in sayess and reckhow 2017 in short samples were first acidified to a ph of less than 1 fifty ml of the acidified sample was then washed through a module of two granular activated carbon gac adsorption columns col 1 and col 2 cpi international santa rosa ca to remove inorganic iodine species using either a tox analysis filtration unit efu 1700 euroglas bv delft the netherlands or an xprep a6 trace elemental instruments delft the netherlands the two gac columns were then sequentially placed in a ceramic boat that is introduced into a high temperature 1000 c combustion system ecs 1200 euroglas bv delft the netherlands and combusted in the presence of oxygen gas 99 99 high purity grade for 10 minutes the combustion system is comprised of a combustion glass tube motor driven boat sampler a furnace sulfuric acid scrubbers a gas bubbler diffuser and trap and an oxygen gas supply upon combustion the organic iodine is released as hydrogen iodide hi in the gas phase that gets carried through sulfuric acid scrubbers and into a custom made absorber cell that contains about 15 ml of ultra pure water the trap solution at the end of the trapping cycle the trap solution is adjusted to 20 ml by rinsing out the walls of the absorber cell with ultra pure milli q water tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah 2 v v is then added to the 20 ml trap solution leading to a trap solution ph of about 12 the trap solution gets analyzed for iodide using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms perkin elmer elan 9000 to yield s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 1 and s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 2 measurements of ti in water samples were also conducted using an icp ms whereby tmah 0 1 v v was added to the samples prior to direct injection into the icp ms in both methods to account for any background iodine an ultra pure milli q travel blank was analyzed and the counts b l a n k c o u n t c o l 1 and b l a n k c o u n t c o l 2 were subtracted from the sample counts argon gas 99 99 high purity grade was used as the carrier and reaction gas and tmah 0 1 v v as the icp ms wash solutions of inorganic iodide potassium iodide ki or sodium iodide nai were prepared and used as stock standard solutions for the icp ms instrument calibration curves were obtained by direct analysis of five to six inorganic iodide standards having a concentration range that covers the expected toi and ti concentrations the data were fitted to a linear model by least squares regression with the intercept forced to zero the toi method has an mdl of 0 95 μg l and a coefficient of variance of 5 9 sayess and reckhow 2017 the methods for analyzing other physical and chemical parameters of the water samples are presented in the supplementary data table s1 2 2 chemicals and reagents deionized ultra pure water was with a resistivity greater than 18 3 mω cm building scale deionizing treatment followed by a milli q system emd millipore corporation billerica ma was used in preparing procedural calibration standard solutions laboratory reagent blanks model compound solutions and the icp ms wash solutions ki certified acs grade nai certified acs grade sodium iodate naio3 certified acs grade potassium bromide kbr certified acs grade and nitric acid 70 trace metal grade were obtained from fisher scientific tmah 25 w w aqueous solution electronic grade 99 999 was obtained from alfa aesar 2 3 field samples all raw and treated water samples were collected from the same upstream and downstream locations throughout the sampling period in three wtps a b and c and their distribution systems fig 1 the source watersheds are largely located in north central appalachian ecoregions 60 62 64 and 67 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2016 the a sampling train originates from a large river basin of about 14 000 square miles while b and c originate from a small river basin of about 2 000 square miles three raw waters a raw b raw c raw were collected from the intakes of the two rivers feeding into the three wtps at each of the wtps a water sample was collected from the point of entry into the distribution system a poe b poe and c poe in addition to two points in the distribution system a ds1 and a ds2 b ds1 and b ds2 and c ds1 and c ds2 in total there were 12 sampling locations three raw and nine treated where samples were collected over a period of 3 months in 2014 january june and july and 12 consecutive months from may of 2015 to april of 2016 the hydraulic detention time hdt of each treated sample poe ds1 and ds2 is presented in parenthesis in fig 1 the hdt of the treated samples is calculated as the average time that water spent in the system from the time of ammonia addition until the sampling event samples were collected within 1 2 days between the raw and treated waters although this does not necessarily indicate that the same plug of water is followed through the distribution sampling train we assume small changes in water quality within a range of a couple of days after confirming that the streamflow and precipitation data on the days of collection were similar therefore sampling events with high variation in streamflow and precipitation data during the collection days were eliminated from this study in the discussion to follow we distinguish the treatment trains a b and c as sites and the sampling locations along a treatment chain raw poe ds1 ds2 as locations the treatment process in the three wtps involves pre treatment pre chlorination coagulation flocculation gravity settling intermediate chlorination dual media filtration and ammonia addition disinfection of the water is achieved through addition of chlorine prior to coagulation during pre treatment and after settling at the filter and then addition of ammonia after filtration forming chloramines an additional pre chlorine dose is added during flocculation at site a the three plants typically applied about 2 4 5 mg l of chlorine prior to coagulation and 2 6 5 mg l after filtration depending on the season wtp a applies an additional 2 2 mg l during flocculation ammonia was added after about 1 hour of post chlorine contact at a cl n ratio of 2 9 4 mg mg more detailed information on the chlorination and chloramination for the three wtps is presented in the supplementary data fig s1 and table s2 ascorbic acid was added to each of the collected samples as a quenching agent prior to being transported overnight using ice coolers to the university of massachusetts amherst the range of values of some of the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples over the span of 15 months are presented in the supplementary data table s3 2 4 data screening data diagnostics were performed as a screening tool to isolate the samples that exhibited a high breakthrough from the first gac column col 1 to the second col 2 this was indicated by a low retention ratio of s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 1 s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 2 due to poor adsorption of the iodinated organics onto the two gac columns we have excluded samples with a retention ratio less than 2 a more conservative value over the recommended ratio of 2 5 usepa 1997 this resulted in the exclusion of 12 of the samples an additional step was taken to exclude outliers in the data for this study outliers were identified based on whether the ti value is less than the toi value allowing for some deviation based on toi measurement error ti measurement error is comparatively small and ignored here to quantify measurement error for toi the coefficient of variation cv was first calculated from a previous data set of duplicates of iodinated model organic compounds sayess and reckhow 2017 as well as duplicates from two months of the current toi data set here one cv value is calculated for each duplicate the mean cv across duplicates was then calculated separately for both datasets 0 12 and 0 10 for the real water samples and model compounds respectively their average cv value 0 12 was used to calculate an estimate of the standard deviation sd of each toi value in the current dataset finally samples were excluded if the associated ti measurement was lower than the lower bound of a 95 confidence bound toi 1 96 sd this resulted in the exclusion of 2 of the samples 2 5 data analysis for all comparisons of toi and ti concentrations across sites or months an analysis of variance anova was conducted to establish the statistical significance for mean differences and a tukey s post hoc test was used to verify the direction of those differences to test the first hypothesis and to determine if on average toi and ti significantly changed upon treatment the results from all of the 15 months were pooled into a single statistical testing framework a one way anova was conducted to avoid multiple t tests that would normally result in an augmentation of type i error this permits us to test the difference in mean toi concentration depending on the location in the distribution system raw poe ds1 and ds2 separate anova tests were conducted for sites a b or c due to differences in the mean and variance of toi across the sites a more detailed explanation of the anova is presented in the supplementary data statistical analysis in conjunction with the anova tests a tukey s post hoc test was conducted to compare and test the difference of the mean of one location with the mean of every other location to determine the direction of differences in toi between raw and treated waters another objective of this work is to test whether toi occurrence is influenced by physical and chemical parameters that are commonly measured during routine water quality analyses since the focus here is placed on the quality of the water that reaches the consumer raw water samples were not included to test this second hypothesis a multiple linear regression framework was employed to relate toi concentrations to a suite of physical and chemical properties several of these parameters are already highly correlated with one another e g chloride and conductivity and dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc collinearity among predictor variables increases the standard error on regression parameter estimates and reduces the ability to distinguish between significant and insignificant predictors a simple yet effective approach to reduce collinearity in a regression framework is simply retaining some predictors over others if the correlation coefficient between the covariates is greater than some threshold value dormann et al 2013 for interpretability we adopt this simple approach setting the threshold for pearson r to 0 6 and retaining predictors that are most likely to explain toi variability from a mechanistic perspective highlighted in bold in table s4 the retained variables for the multiple linear regression framework were ti temperature t ph combined residual chlorine tcl2 doc ammonia nitrogen nh3 n specific uv254 absorbance suva254 and chloride the formulation of the multivariate regression was also complicated by the measured toi values that were below the mdl of 0 95 µg l while numerical values are available for these observations the mdl renders them indistinguishable from background noise therefore assigning the numerical values for these observations equal weight to the other observations in a standard regression will lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates amemiya 1973 therefore a tobit model a type of multivariate censored regression model is used to correct for this and to assign the appropriate level of precision to these observations in the regression briefly the tobit model operates using maximum likelihood estimation instead of least squares in the likelihood function the probability density function pdf is evaluated for the residuals associated with the data above the mdl since those residuals can be estimated precisely for the data below the mdl the residuals cannot be estimated precisely because the original data values are not known for these residuals we evaluate the cumulative distribution function cdf with integration limits determined by the mdl in the likelihood function the pdf values will naturally have more weight than the cdf values giving more emphasis to the data we know more precisely the tobit model was fit using the censreg library henningsen 2011 in the r statistical programming language given the skewness in toi values the toi data was log transformed prior to running the tobit regression this transformation produced more normally distributed residuals which are needed for the interpretation of the significance tests for the regression parameters the r2 was calculated by assigning a value of half the mdl 0 475 µg l for values that were below the mdl 0 95 µg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence the ti and toi concentrations at sites a b and c were examined first by pooling across months and sampling locations fig 2 th original un pooled data for each of the sampling sites locations and months is presented in the supplementary data fig s2 for ti the lower end of the concentration range was about 3 μg l in the raw and treated water at all sites the median ti concentration was 5 μg l for site a and 11 μg l for sites b and c the higher end of the concentration range was 11 5 23 1 and 18 9 μg l for sites a b and c respectively many studies have reported on ti concentrations in fresh water sources fig 3 takaku et al 1995 reported on rivers in kanto region japan having ti values ranging between 0 65 and 35 9 μg l a survey of major u s canadian and european rivers showed ti concentrations usually below 20 μg l with median and mean concentrations of 10 2 and 19 9 μg l respectively moran et al 2002 notable exceptions concentrations between 30 and 212 μg l were rivers originating from watersheds in arid regions e g the rio grande the san joaquin the santa cruz the pecos and the brazos the ti concentrations in lake constance germany and its tributaries ranged between 0 66 and 10 μg l except for the steinach tributary which is known to have an input of iodinated x ray contrast media compounds gilfedder et al 2010 for treated waters gong and zhang 2013 reported on ti concentrations in four chlorinated grab samples in four wtps in china collected in august 2013 to be between 6 5 and 12 9 μg l overall the ti results obtained in our study are in line with those reported in the literature fig 3 for toi about half of the values at site a were below the mdl while the higher end of the range was about 4 µg l for the raw and treated waters the maximum toi values observed for site b were 11 75 µg l for the raw water and 17 7 µg l for the treated water with a median of about 3 µg l for both for site c maximum toi concentrations in the pooled raw and treated waters reached about 10 µg l also with a median of about 3 µg l by pooling across months and sampling locations the results showed that site a had significantly lower toi concentrations than sites b and c p value 0 005 this relationship was also evident when assigning a value of half the mdl 0 475 µg l for the samples that had a toi concentration below the mdl the lower toi concentration in site a could be directly related to the amount of ti in the raw and treated water which was significantly lower in site a as well p value 0 001 the pooled toi concentrations across the months and sampling locations did not show any statistical differences between sites b and c p value 0 05 considering that the same source water feeds into wtps b and c that operate in a similar manner fig s1 these results are not surprising the order of magnitude of toi presented for the bulk of the samples collected for sites a b and c are in line with results of raw gilfedder et al 2010 and treated grab tap water samples gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 in the literature fig 3 the toi concentration in lake constance germany and its tributaries was calculated from ti and total inorganic iodine tii to be generally below 5 μg l except for the steinach tributary which had a range of 2 to 68 μg l gilfedder et al 2010 for treated samples toi concentrations measured using the uplc esi ms method were as low as 1 3 μg l but reached up to 16 4 μg l in chlorinated grab water samples gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016a the skewness in toi concentrations in treated samples in the literature is also observed at sites b and c with a few toi values substantially larger than most measurements repeated sampling at sites b and c suggest that limited grab samples may miss important spikes in toi concentrations the ratios of toi ti at sites a b and c were examined next by pooling across months and sampling locations fig 2 the average ratios for sites a b and c were roughly the same with the mean ratio for site a 0 30 slightly lower than those for sites b and c 0 35 not only were the three sites similar in their means but all three sites displayed highly variable ratios across the months and sampling locations fig s2 the inter quartile range for ratios varied between 0 04 and 0 50 for site a and between 0 15 and 0 56 for sites b and c on many occasions and at all sites spikes in toi values were not accompanied by spikes in ti and vice versa leading to the high variability in ratio values the results from all the wtps are in line with the literature for example using reverse phase chromatography inductively coupled plasma isotope dilution mass spectroscopy rpc icp idms heumann et al 1998 reported organic iodine fractions of ti as 0 23 0 38 and 0 38 in rivers nile regen and danube respectively however the authors reported that this method may have missed high molecular weight or volatile organic species which would have increased the organic fraction of ti shwehr and santschi 2003 reported that the organic iodine fraction calculated as the difference between ti and tii in fresh surface water from the trinity river texas ranged between 0 07 to 0 64 of ti with an average of 0 37 and a median of 0 42 others reported an even bigger toi fraction reaching up to 1 in several natural fresh waters using an isotope dilution mass spectrometry that had a similar problem as rpc icp idms reifenhäuser and heumann 1990 overall the high variability in the organic fraction observed in our study is not uncommon the results of toi ti and ratio of toi ti for the fifteen months pooled across all sites and sampling locations are presented in fig 4 we assume here that any systematic mean differences between sites a b and c or sampling locations are consistent across the months for ti the primary seasonal pattern is characterized by higher concentrations in the spring and summer months april september compared to concentrations in the fall and winter months october march p value 0 001 this pattern however is not observed for toi where the seasonal pattern is less clear there is substantial inter monthly variability in toi measurements in which high or low values of toi cluster for 2 3 months at a time july to august 2015 october to december 2015 gilfedder et al 2009 reported the highest formation of soluble organic iodine calculated not measured in the humic rich mummelsee lake doc 7 mg l germany between july and november apart from september this pattern is similar to what has been observed in this study we conclude that there may be a cyclic pattern in toi variability like that reported in gilfedder et al 2009 with peak values between the late summer and early winter but additional years of data are necessary to confirm this pattern the toi ti ratios become similarly elevated in the late summer and early winter compared to the other seasons the cyclic behavior in toi seems to highly influence the toi ti ratio as this ratio mostly follows the observed occurrence trends of toi the concentrations of toi ti and the ratio of toi ti pooled across the 15 months are presented in fig 5 the results show that measurable toi was present in the raw water of the three wtps in contrast to bromine and chlorine the more labile nature of iodine allows the natural formation of organic iodine in rivers and lakes for example the reduction of iodate by soil organic matter produces reactive intermediate species hypoiodous acid hoi and molecular iodine i2 that undergo rapid electrophilic substitution reactions with electron donor groups on the nom leading to the formation of organic iodine species francois 1987a fukui et al 1996 steinberg et al 2008b whitehead 1974b bowley et al 2016 showed that both iodide and iodate react with humic acid a fraction of nom in soils to produce organic iodine they also showed that the humic acid itself originally contained native sources of iodine namely iodide and organic iodine another source of toi in the raw water samples might be due to the disposal of hospital wastewater containing iodinated x ray contrast media upstream of the source water duirk et al 2011 3 2 influence of treatment the first hypothesis we tested was that toi concentration in the raw water increases upon treatment in parallel with an increase in known i dbp formation however our results show a significant decrease in both the toi concentration between the raw water and ds1 at site a as well as in the ratio of toi ti between raw water and treated waters fig 5 though not statistically significant there is a clear net decrease in toi concentration and in toi ti between raw samples and treated poe samples at all three locations the results presented here ran counter to our expectations of higher toi in chloraminated waters since iodinated methanes acids acetaldehydes acetamides acetonitriles and phenols have all been identified in chloraminated waters bichsel and von gunten 2000 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2013 hansson et al 1987 jeong et al 2015 krasner et al 2006 pan et al 2016a plewa et al 2004 2008 richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the reason we did not observe an increase in toi may be due to the deiodination of organic iodinated compounds upon pre and intermediate chlorination prior to ammonia addition fig s1 and table s2 this may have caused the release of iodide into the solution whereby under the ph and residual chlorine conditions of the three wtps hypochlorous acid hocl instantaneously reacts with iodide forming hoi nagy et al 1988 two possible pathways follow whereby hoi could either react with nom to produce iodinated organic compounds or get oxidized by both hocl and hypochlorite ion ocl to iodate using the kinetic rate constants provided by bichsel and von gunten 1999 oxidation to iodate the preferred iodine sink in water treatment would occur within about 20 30 minutes a time interval that is below the chlorine contact time of the three wtps fig s1 the deiodination of organic iodinated compounds has been previously documented in the literature e g tian et al 2017 zhu and zhang 2016 while coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes may have also aided in some toi removal we predict that these processes were not a major contributor to toi removal since a similar decrease in ti concentration between raw and poe samples was not observed fig 5 the decrease in the organic fraction of ti in treated waters further suggests that the ti components shifted from organic to inorganic iodine iodide and iodate within the treatment process itself to validate such findings future work must also have simultaneous measures of iodate and iodide 3 3 regression analysis and toi prediction table 1 shows the results of the tobit regression scatterplots of each of the individual predictors against the measured toi values are presented in the supplementary data fig s3 of the eight chosen parameters four exhibited a significant relationship with toi p value 0 05 doc and suva were highly significant p value 0 00001 and p value 0 005 respectively while tcl2 and ph were significant at the 0 05 level the observed positive relationship between doc and toi is expected since upon chloramination of iodide containing waters hoi forms bichsel and von gunten 1999 which in turn reacts with nom to form i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 karpel vel leitner et al 1998 richardson et al 2008 allard and colleagues 2015 showed that at low doc concentrations 1 mg l almost all the iodide in the water is converted to iodate the stable form of iodine due to from the fast reaction with chlorine in contrast at high doc concentrations 4 mg l iodine binds to the many reactive sites within the nom forming iodinated organics before it can be converted to iodate in general the authors showed that at high doc concentrations a higher formation of iodinated organic compounds is expected this is in line with what we observed in our study suva254 values reflect the nature and composition of nom in a water sample edzwald and tobiason 1999 and have been shown to correlate with dbp formation higher suva254 values 4 or greater imply high hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular weight components while low suva254 values 2 indicate the opposite suva254 values between 2 and 4 suggest mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic and aromatic and non aromatic nom with a mixture of molecular weights during the 15 months of this study we observed suva254 values that were between 1 85 4 17 for the treated waters table s3 chloramination experiments conducted by kristiana et al 2009 showed that the aromatic components within nom play a major role in the formation of tobr and tocl but not in the formation of toi the authors suggested that when the reactive sites in nom have a high aromatic content high suva254 values hyprobromous and hypochlorous acids known to be highly reactive with phenolic moieties better outcompete hoi for reaction with nom criquet et al 2015 echigo and minear 2006 lee et al 2005 westerhoff et al 2004 this fact could explain what we observed here for the low to mid range suva254 values observed in this study 1 85 4 17 toi concentration decreases with an increase in suva254 allard et al 2015 observed similar results in chloraminated water but attributed this to the chlorination bromination of the active sites during the chlorine contact period throughout the 15 months and across all three sites the ph of the raw samples was adjusted by the wtps to between 6 93 and 7 45 prior to release into the distribution system table s3 the effective ph range for monochloramine is between 7 5 and 9 the further the ph drops below 7 5 the more monochloramine becomes less stable and is likely to dissociate into hocl and nh3 deborde and von gunten 2008 in other words decreasing the ph is expected to enhance the release of hocl by the hydrolysis of nh2cl since hocl rapidly oxidizes hoi to iodate the stable form bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 it leads to lower formation of i dbps this is consistent with what we observed in our study where an increase in ph was accompanied by a subsequent increase in toi concentration our results also show that an increase in tcl2 concentration is accompanied by a decrease in toi concentration this could be seen as a result of an equilibrium between chloramine and free chlorine achieved at sufficiently high tcl2 concentrations once equilibrium is achieved hocl starts slowly forming which then leads to the rapid oxidation of hoi to form iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 this has been previously hypothesized in the literature hua et al 2006 and concurs with the negative effect of tcl2 on toi observed in the regression despite that the tobit model determined doc suva254 ph and tcl2 as the most significant this does not definitively rule out the influence of other parameters on toi for instance as ti concentrations increase in water it is more likely that toi concentrations will increase as well mainly due to the higher availability of iodine to form toi as noted previously iodinated species such as organic iodine iodate and iodide are labile and can undergo transformation into one another in the environment amachi et al 2005a councell et al 1997 farrenkopf et al 1997 gong and zhang 2013 radlinger and heumann 2000 our results showed that toi concentrations did often increase with an increase in ti concentrations even though the regression coefficient was not statistically significant p value 0 05 the lack of significance could be due to remaining multicollinearity between the covariates that confounds significance testing also some high ti values at sites b and c during june of 2014 were not accompanied by similarly high toi values which led to a weakening in the expected signal fig s2 fig 6 shows toi predictions from the tobit regression against observed measured toi values the model provides a reasonably good fit whereby the eight parameters could explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi concentrations in treated waters r2 0 46 still a significant portion of the observed variability remains unexplained for instance an observed value of 20 µg l corresponds to a predicted value of 2 µg l however to the best of our understanding this is the first attempt at predicting the concentration of toi in water using commonly measured water quality parameters while further work is needed to improve such toi predictions the performance of this model can act as a baseline against which to compare the performance of future models 4 conclusions the work presented here characterizes toi in three drinking water treatment trains in the northeast us we have established the order of magnitude of toi and ti species over a period of 15 months as well as the differences in the raw water and several points in the distribution system we observed a clear increase in ti during the spring and summer months compared to the fall and winter months despite the absence of a clear seasonal pattern for toi there was substantial inter monthly variability where toi values cluster high or low for months at a time the toi concentrations exhibited peak values between the late summer and early winter the results also showed that toi was present in the raw water and that there was a slight decrease in toi concentration and in the ratio of toi ti upon treatment suggesting that the ti components may have shifted between the raw and treated waters the results of our multivariate regression showed that toi was correlated with doc suva254 tcl2 and ph to varying degrees toi increased with an increase in doc and ph and a decrease in suva254 and tcl2 a predictive model that used eight water quality parameters was fit for toi occurrence in water and was able to explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi concentrations in the treated waters this is highly valuable since it will allow the estimation of toi to a degree of certainty in relation to parameters that are routinely measured in water by utilities since most of the i dbps identified in drinking water have shown enhanced cyto and genotoxicity compared to their brominated and chlorinated analogues improving the quality of the water without the reliance on expensive and complicated analytical techniques and equipment is helpful the advantages of using a toi as a surrogate measure is that it can quantify the amount of iodinated organic compounds in a water sample the drawback on the other hand is that toi does not provide an accurate identification of the contents of the water since it does not break down toi into its specific species a deeper understanding of toi and the way it varies with the other constituents in a water sample is required to mitigate this limitation declaration of competing interest the

17245,iodinated disinfection by products i dbps have recently emerged as part of the pool of dbps of public health concern due to limitations in measuring individual i dbps in a water sample the surrogate measure of total organic iodine toi is often used to account for the sum of all i dbps in this study toi and total iodine ti are quantified in raw and treated waters in treatment trains at three sites in the northeast united states the occurrence magnitude and seasonality of these species was investigated within each sampling train and across the different sites a regression model was developed to explore how toi occurrence varies with routinely measured physical and chemical parameters in a water sample the toi and ti concentration at the three sites ranged from below the method detection limit to 18 µg l and from 3 and 18 9 µg l respectively there was substantial inter monthly variability in toi without a clear seasonal signal and the concentration of toi did not increase upon treatment the results of the multivariate regression model showed that dissolved organic carbon doc specific uv254 absorbance suva combined chlorine residual tcl2 and ph were all significantly related to toi concentration to varying degrees a tobit model was fit to show toi predictions against observed measured toi values the model could explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi

chlor am ination 1 introduction disinfection by product dbp formation due to the chemical disinfection of drinking water with powerful oxidants such as chlorine chloramines and chlorine dioxide has been an ongoing challenge for health agencies and water utilities during disinfection hundreds possibly thousands of organically bound halogenated compounds form in chlorinated and chloraminated waters while chlorinated and brominated dbps have been studied for many years in terms of health risk and occurrence in drinking water iodinated dbps i dbps have been a relatively recent concern not only have improved analytical methods detected a variety of i dbps but health risk studies have also shown that i dbps exhibited enhanced cyto and genotoxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated dbps cemeli et al 2006 hunter et al 1996 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2004a 2004b richardson et al 2007 2008 sayess et al 2017 the large number and diversity of dbps is attributed to the many reaction pathways that are available to aqueous chlorine and chloramines coupled with the diverse nature of the organic reactants i e natural organic matter nom as a result measurement of specific dbps is both labor intensive and fragmentary instead the parameter tox total organic halogen has been accepted as a surrogate measure of the sum of all halogenated dbps i e compounds that are organically bound to chlorine bromine and iodine in a water sample li et al 2002 reckhow et al 1990 richardson 2003 similarly methods for total organic chlorine tocl total organic bromine tobr and total organic iodine toi

sayess and reckhow 2017 while the formation of tobr occurs as a result of addition of chlorine to a water containing inorganic bromide and organic dbp precursors the environmental chemistry and transport of iodine is substantially different from that of bromine while most naturally occurring bromine exists as the bromide anion br total iodine ti is more evenly distributed across organic and reduced and oxidized inorganic forms i e iodide anion i and iodate anion io3 e g fuge and johnson 2015 gilfedder et al 2010 whitehead 1984 iodate is expected be the most stable form of iodine in oxygen saturated waters but environmental surveys have found waters dominated by each of the three forms a consequence of iodine s low ionization potential and facile redox transitions e g gilfedder et al 2010 yang et al 2007 furthermore each of the iodine species have the ability to rapidly change forms even within a water treatment plant for example recent studies have shown that iodinated organic compounds will release i and io3 will undergo chemical reduction to i simply from exposure to some common water treatment processes duirk et al 2011 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2000 zhang et al 2016 this unique chemistry is expected to have major implications on the formation of i dbps when i containing water is treated with oxidants disinfectants total iodine ti has been measured in japanese rivers takaku et al 1995 in u s canadian and european rivers moran et al 2002 in german lakes gilfedder et al 2010 and in danish groundwaters voutchkova et al 2014 it has also been studied in some canadian and in u s raw and treated drinking waters blount et al 2010 kim et al 2020 tugulea et al 2018 interest in quantifying specific i dbps and more generally toi in water samples has been growing due to the body of evidence showing greater cyto and genotoxicity of i dbps compared to their chlorinated and brominated analogues hunter et al 1996 jeong et al 2015 plewa et al 2008 2010 richardson et al 2008 sayess et al 2017 many groups of i dbps e g iodo trihalomethanes iodo acetic acids iodo acetamides and others have been detected in chlorinated and chloraminated

samples all the experiments were conducted while adding elevated levels of iodine and or bromine species to the raw water three studies reported the concentration of toi in grab tap water samples in china gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016a a recently published study on tox speciation in 12 drinking water systems in the u s failed to detect toi in any of the samples kim et al 2020 to our knowledge there have not been any successful attempts at measuring and characterizing the presence of toi in drinking water treatment plants wtps and their respective distribution systems at ambient halogen levels furthermore since all the studies were implemented either on raw lab treated simulated or one time grab water samples there are no data on how toi behaves in real world engineered systems over extended periods of time therefore this work presents the first full scale study on the occurrence of toi in raw and chloraminated drinking water at ambient iodine and bromine levels a recently developed highly sensitive method was used for toi determination sayess and reckhow 2017 in the context of the knowledge gaps we characterize the magnitude and seasonal behavior of toi and the contribution of toi to ti concentrations in three wtps we use that information to pose the following hypotheses 1 toi concentration significantly increases upon treatment and the organic fraction of ti changes between raw and treated water and 2 toi occurrence is influenced by commonly measured physical and chemical properties in a treated water sample the ultimate goal of this line of research is to understand and predict the occurrence of toi in treated water to enable water utilities to better control iodinated organics in their finished waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 instrumentation and sample analyses the detailed method for toi analysis has been previously described in sayess and reckhow 2017 in short samples were first acidified to a ph of less than 1 fifty ml of the acidified sample was then washed through a module of two granular activated carbon gac adsorption columns col 1 and col 2 cpi international santa rosa ca to remove inorganic iodine species using either a tox analysis filtration unit efu 1700 euroglas bv delft the netherlands or an xprep a6 trace elemental instruments delft the netherlands the two gac columns were then sequentially placed in a ceramic boat that is introduced into a high temperature 1000 c combustion system ecs 1200 euroglas bv delft the netherlands and combusted in the presence of oxygen gas 99 99 high purity grade for 10 minutes the combustion system is comprised of a combustion glass tube motor driven boat sampler a furnace sulfuric acid scrubbers a gas bubbler diffuser and trap and an oxygen gas supply upon combustion the organic iodine is released as hydrogen iodide hi in the gas phase that gets carried through sulfuric acid scrubbers and into a custom made absorber cell that contains about 15 ml of ultra pure water the trap solution at the end of the trapping cycle the trap solution is adjusted to 20 ml by rinsing out the walls of the absorber cell with ultra pure milli q water tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah 2 v v is then added to the 20 ml trap solution leading to a trap solution ph of about 12 the trap solution gets analyzed for iodide using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms perkin elmer elan 9000 to yield s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 1 and s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 2 measurements of ti in water samples were also conducted using an icp ms whereby tmah 0 1 v v was added to the samples prior to direct injection into the icp ms in both methods to account for any background iodine an ultra pure milli q travel blank was analyzed and the counts b l a n k c o u n t c o l 1 and b l a n k c o u n t c o l 2 were subtracted from the sample counts argon gas 99 99 high purity grade was used as the carrier and reaction gas and tmah 0 1 v v as the icp ms wash solutions of inorganic iodide potassium iodide ki or sodium iodide nai were prepared and used as stock standard solutions for the icp ms instrument calibration curves were obtained by direct analysis of five to six inorganic iodide standards having a concentration range that covers the expected toi and ti concentrations the data were fitted to a linear model by least squares regression with the intercept forced to zero the toi method has an mdl of 0 95 μg l and a coefficient of variance of 5 9 sayess and reckhow 2017 the methods for analyzing other physical and chemical parameters of the water samples are presented in the supplementary data table s1 2 2 chemicals and reagents deionized ultra pure water was with a resistivity greater than 18 3 mω cm building scale

grade were obtained from fisher scientific tmah 25 w w aqueous solution electronic grade 99 999 was obtained from alfa aesar 2 3 field samples all raw and treated water samples were collected from the same upstream and downstream locations throughout the sampling period in three wtps a b and c and their distribution systems fig 1 the source watersheds are largely located in north central appalachian ecoregions 60 62 64 and 67 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2016 the a sampling train originates from a large river basin of about 14 000 square miles while b and c originate from a small river basin of about 2 000 square miles three raw waters a raw b raw c raw were collected from the intakes of the two rivers feeding into the three wtps at each of the wtps a water sample was collected from the point of entry into the distribution system a poe b poe and c poe in addition to two points in the distribution system a ds1 and a ds2 b ds1 and b ds2 and c ds1 and c ds2 in total there were 12 sampling locations three raw and nine treated where samples were collected over a period of 3 months in 2014 january june and july and 12 consecutive months from may of 2015 to april of 2016 the hydraulic detention time hdt of each treated sample poe ds1 and ds2 is presented in parenthesis in fig 1 the hdt of the treated samples is calculated as the average time that water spent in the system from the time of ammonia addition until the sampling event samples were collected within 1 2 days between the raw and treated waters although this does not necessarily indicate that the same plug of water is followed through the distribution sampling train we assume small changes in water quality within a range of a couple of days after confirming that the streamflow and precipitation data on the days of collection were similar therefore sampling events with high variation in streamflow and precipitation data during the collection days were eliminated from this study in the discussion to follow we distinguish the treatment trains a b and c as sites and the sampling locations along a treatment chain raw poe ds1 ds2 as locations the treatment process in the three wtps involves pre treatment pre chlorination coagulation flocculation gravity settling intermediate chlorination dual media filtration and ammonia addition disinfection of the water is achieved through addition of chlorine prior to coagulation during pre treatment and after settling at the filter and then addition of ammonia after filtration forming chloramines an additional pre chlorine dose is added during flocculation at site a the three plants typically applied about 2 4 5 mg l of chlorine prior to coagulation and 2 6 5 mg l after filtration depending on the season wtp a applies an additional 2 2 mg l during flocculation ammonia was added after about 1 hour of post chlorine contact at a cl n ratio of 2 9 4 mg mg more detailed information on the chlorination and chloramination for the three wtps is presented in the supplementary data fig s1 and table s2 ascorbic acid was added to each of the collected samples as a quenching agent prior to being transported overnight using ice coolers to the university of massachusetts amherst the range of values of some of the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples over the span of 15 months are presented in the supplementary data table s3 2 4 data screening data diagnostics were performed as a screening tool to isolate the samples that exhibited a high breakthrough from the first gac column col 1 to the second col 2 this was indicated by a low retention ratio of s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 1 s a m p l e c o u n t c o l 2 due to poor adsorption of the iodinated organics onto the two gac columns we have excluded samples with a retention ratio less than 2 a more conservative value over the recommended ratio of 2 5 usepa 1997 this resulted in the exclusion of 12 of the samples an additional step was taken to exclude outliers in the data for this study outliers were identified based on whether the ti value is less than the toi value allowing for some deviation based on toi measurement error ti measurement error is comparatively small and ignored here to quantify measurement error for toi the coefficient of variation cv was first calculated from a previous data set of duplicates of iodinated model organic compounds sayess and reckhow 2017 as well as duplicates from two months of the current toi data set here one cv value is calculated for each duplicate the mean cv across duplicates was then calculated separately for both datasets 0 12 and 0 10 for the real water samples and model compounds respectively their average cv value 0 12 was used to calculate an estimate of the standard deviation sd of each toi value in the current dataset finally samples were excluded if the associated ti measurement was lower than the lower bound of a 95 confidence bound toi 1 96 sd this resulted in the exclusion of 2 of the samples 2 5 data analysis for all comparisons of toi and ti concentrations across sites or months an analysis of variance anova was conducted to establish the statistical significance for mean differences and a tukey s post hoc test was used to verify the direction of those differences to test the first hypothesis and to determine if on average toi and ti significantly changed upon treatment the results from all of the 15 months were pooled into a single statistical testing framework a one way anova was conducted to avoid multiple t tests that would normally result in an augmentation of type i error this permits us to test the difference in mean toi concentration depending on the location in the distribution system raw poe ds1 and ds2 separate anova tests were conducted for sites a b or c due to differences in the mean and variance of toi across the sites a more detailed explanation of the anova is presented in the supplementary data statistical analysis in conjunction with the anova tests a tukey s post hoc test was conducted to compare and test the difference of the mean of one location with the mean of every other location to determine the direction of differences in toi between raw and treated waters another objective of this work is to test whether toi occurrence is influenced by physical and chemical parameters that are commonly measured during routine water quality analyses since the focus here is placed on the quality of the water that reaches the consumer raw water samples were not included to test this second hypothesis a multiple linear regression framework was employed to relate toi concentrations to a suite of physical and chemical properties several of these parameters are already highly correlated with one another e g chloride and conductivity and dissolved organic carbon doc and total organic carbon toc collinearity among predictor variables increases the standard error on regression parameter estimates and reduces the ability to distinguish between significant and insignificant predictors a simple yet effective approach to reduce collinearity in a regression framework is simply retaining some predictors over others if the correlation coefficient between the covariates is greater than some threshold value dormann et al 2013 for interpretability we adopt this simple approach setting the threshold for pearson r to 0 6 and retaining predictors that are most likely to explain toi variability from a mechanistic perspective highlighted in bold in table s4 the retained variables for the multiple linear regression framework were ti temperature t ph combined residual chlorine tcl2 doc ammonia nitrogen nh3 n specific uv254 absorbance suva254 and chloride the formulation of the multivariate regression was also complicated by the measured toi values that were below the mdl of 0 95 µg l while numerical values are available for these observations the mdl renders them indistinguishable from background noise therefore assigning the numerical values for these observations equal weight to the other observations in a standard regression will lead to inconsistent regression coefficient estimates amemiya 1973 therefore a tobit model a type of multivariate censored regression model is used to correct for this and to assign the appropriate level of precision to these observations in the regression briefly the tobit model operates using maximum likelihood estimation instead of least squares in the likelihood function the probability density function pdf is evaluated for the residuals associated with the data above the mdl since those residuals can be estimated precisely for the data below the mdl the residuals cannot be estimated precisely because the original data values are not known for these residuals we evaluate the cumulative distribution function cdf with integration limits determined by the mdl in the likelihood function the pdf values will naturally have more weight than the cdf values giving more emphasis to the data we know more precisely the tobit model was fit using the censreg library henningsen 2011 in the r statistical programming language given the skewness in toi values the toi data was log transformed prior to running the tobit regression this transformation produced more normally distributed residuals which are needed for the interpretation of the significance tests for the regression parameters the r2 was calculated by assigning a value of half the mdl 0 475 µg l for values that were below the mdl 0 95 µg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence the ti and toi concentrations at sites a b and c were examined first by pooling across months and sampling locations fig 2 th original un pooled data for each of the sampling sites locations and months is presented in the supplementary data fig s2 for ti the lower end of the concentration range was about 3 μg l in the raw and treated water at all sites the median ti concentration was 5 μg l for site a and 11 μg l for sites b and c the higher end of the concentration range was 11 5 23 1 and 18 9 μg l for sites a b and c respectively many studies have reported on ti concentrations in fresh water sources fig 3 takaku et al 1995 reported on rivers in kanto region japan having ti values ranging between 0 65 and 35 9 μg l a survey of major u s canadian and european rivers showed ti concentrations usually below 20 μg l with median and mean concentrations of 10 2 and 19 9 μg l respectively moran et al 2002 notable exceptions concentrations between 30 and 212 μg l were rivers originating from watersheds in arid regions e g the rio grande the san joaquin the santa cruz the pecos and the brazos the ti concentrations in lake constance germany and its tributaries ranged between 0 66 and 10 μg l except for the steinach tributary which is known to have an input of iodinated x ray contrast media compounds gilfedder et al 2010 for treated waters gong and zhang 2013 reported on ti concentrations in four chlorinated grab samples in four wtps in china collected in august 2013 to be between 6 5 and 12 9 μg l overall the ti results obtained in our study are in line with those reported in the literature fig 3 for toi about half of the values at site a were below the mdl while the higher end of the range was about 4 µg l for the raw and treated waters the maximum toi values observed for site b were 11 75 µg l for the raw water and 17 7 µg l for the treated water with a median of about 3 µg l for both for site c maximum toi concentrations in the pooled raw and treated waters reached about 10 µg l also with a median of about 3 µg l by pooling across months and sampling locations the results showed that site a had significantly lower toi concentrations than sites b and c p value 0 005 this relationship was also evident when assigning a value of half the mdl 0 475 µg l for the samples that had a toi concentration below the mdl the lower toi concentration in site a could be directly related to the amount of ti in the raw and treated water which was significantly lower in site a as well p value 0 001 the pooled toi concentrations across the months and sampling locations did not show any statistical differences between sites b and c p value 0 05 considering that the same source water feeds into wtps b and c that operate in a similar manner fig s1 these results are not surprising the order of magnitude of toi presented for the bulk of the samples collected for sites a b and c are in line with results of raw gilfedder et al 2010 and treated grab tap water samples gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 in the literature fig 3 the toi concentration in lake constance germany and its tributaries was calculated from ti and total inorganic iodine tii to be generally below 5 μg l except for the steinach tributary which had a range of 2 to 68 μg l gilfedder et al 2010 for treated samples toi concentrations measured using the uplc esi ms method were as low as 1 3 μg l but reached up to 16 4 μg l in chlorinated grab water samples gong and zhang 2013 pan and zhang 2013 pan et al 2016a the skewness in toi concentrations in treated samples in the literature is also observed at sites b and c with a few toi values substantially larger than most measurements repeated sampling at sites b and c suggest that limited grab samples may miss important spikes in toi concentrations the ratios of toi ti at sites a b and c were examined next by pooling across months and sampling locations fig 2 the average ratios for sites a b and c were roughly the same with the mean ratio for site a 0 30 slightly lower than those for sites b and c 0 35 not only were the three sites similar in their means but all three sites displayed highly variable ratios across the months and sampling locations fig s2 the inter quartile range for ratios varied between 0 04 and 0 50 for site a and between 0 15 and 0 56 for sites b and c on many occasions and at all sites spikes in toi values were not accompanied by spikes in ti and vice versa leading to the high variability in ratio values the results from all the wtps are in line with the literature for example using reverse phase chromatography inductively coupled plasma isotope dilution mass spectroscopy rpc icp idms heumann et al 1998 reported organic iodine fractions of ti as 0 23 0 38 and 0 38 in rivers nile regen and danube respectively however the authors reported that this method may have missed high molecular weight or volatile organic species which would have increased the organic fraction of ti shwehr and santschi 2003 reported that the organic iodine fraction calculated as the difference between ti and tii in fresh surface water from the trinity river texas ranged between 0 07 to 0 64 of ti with an average of 0 37 and a median of 0 42 others reported an even bigger toi fraction reaching up to 1 in several natural fresh waters using an isotope dilution mass spectrometry that had a similar problem as rpc icp idms reifenhäuser and heumann 1990 overall the high variability in the organic fraction observed in our study is not uncommon the results of toi ti and ratio of toi ti for the fifteen months pooled across all sites and sampling locations are presented in fig 4 we assume here that any systematic mean differences between sites a b and c or sampling locations are consistent across the months for ti the primary seasonal pattern is characterized by higher concentrations in the spring and summer months april september compared to concentrations in the fall and winter months october march p value 0 001 this pattern however is not observed for toi where the seasonal pattern is less clear there is substantial inter monthly variability in toi measurements in which high or low values of toi cluster for 2 3 months at a time july to august 2015 october to december 2015 gilfedder et al 2009 reported the highest formation of soluble organic iodine calculated not measured in the humic rich mummelsee lake doc 7 mg l germany between july and november apart from september this pattern is similar to what has been observed in this study we conclude that there may be a cyclic pattern in toi variability like that reported in gilfedder et al 2009 with peak values between the late summer and early winter but additional years of data are necessary to confirm this pattern the toi ti ratios become similarly elevated in the late summer and early winter compared to the other seasons the cyclic behavior in toi seems to highly influence the toi ti ratio as this ratio mostly follows the observed occurrence trends of toi the concentrations of toi ti and the ratio of toi ti pooled across the 15 months are presented in fig 5 the results show that measurable toi was present in the raw water of the three wtps in contrast to bromine and chlorine the more labile nature of iodine allows the natural formation of organic iodine in rivers and lakes for example the reduction of iodate by soil organic matter produces reactive intermediate species hypoiodous acid hoi and molecular iodine i2 that undergo rapid electrophilic substitution reactions with electron donor groups on the nom leading to the formation of organic iodine species francois 1987a fukui et al 1996 steinberg et al 2008b whitehead 1974b bowley et al 2016 showed that both iodide and iodate react with humic acid a fraction of nom in soils to produce organic iodine they also showed that the humic acid itself originally contained native sources of iodine namely iodide and organic iodine another source of toi in the raw water samples might be due to the disposal of hospital wastewater containing iodinated x ray contrast media upstream of the source water duirk et al 2011 3 2 influence of treatment the first hypothesis we tested was that toi concentration in the raw water increases upon treatment in parallel with an increase in known i dbp formation however our results show a significant decrease in both the toi concentration between the raw water and ds1 at site a as well as in the ratio of toi ti between raw water and treated waters fig 5 though not statistically significant there is a clear net decrease in toi concentration and in toi ti between raw samples and treated poe samples at all three locations the results presented here ran counter to our expectations of higher toi in chloraminated waters since iodinated methanes acids acetaldehydes acetamides acetonitriles and phenols have all been identified in chloraminated waters bichsel and von gunten 2000 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2013 hansson et al 1987 jeong et al 2015 krasner et al 2006 pan et al 2016a plewa et al 2004 2008 richardson et al 2008 tugulea et al 2018 wei et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 the reason we did not observe an increase in toi may be due to the deiodination of organic iodinated compounds upon pre and intermediate chlorination prior to ammonia addition fig s1 and table s2 this may have caused the release of iodide into the solution whereby under the ph and residual chlorine conditions of the three wtps hypochlorous acid hocl instantaneously reacts with iodide forming hoi nagy et al 1988 two possible pathways follow whereby hoi could either react with nom to produce iodinated organic compounds or get oxidized by both hocl and hypochlorite ion ocl to iodate using the kinetic rate constants provided by bichsel and von gunten 1999 oxidation to iodate the preferred iodine sink in water treatment would occur within about 20 30 minutes a time interval that is below the chlorine contact time of the three wtps fig s1 the deiodination of organic iodinated compounds has been previously documented in the literature e g tian et al 2017 zhu and zhang 2016 while coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes may have also aided in some toi removal we predict that these processes were not a major contributor to toi removal since a similar decrease in ti concentration between raw and poe samples was not observed fig 5 the decrease in the organic fraction of ti in treated waters further suggests that the ti components shifted from organic to inorganic iodine iodide and iodate within the treatment process itself to validate such findings future work must also have simultaneous measures of iodate and iodide 3 3 regression analysis and toi prediction table 1 shows the results of the tobit regression scatterplots of each of the individual predictors against the measured toi values are presented in the supplementary data fig s3 of the eight chosen parameters four exhibited a significant relationship with toi p value 0 05 doc and suva were highly significant p value 0 00001 and p value 0 005 respectively while tcl2 and ph were significant at the 0 05 level the observed positive relationship between doc and toi is expected since upon chloramination of iodide containing waters hoi forms bichsel and von gunten 1999 which in turn reacts with nom to form i dbps bichsel and von gunten 2000 hua and reckhow 2006 karpel vel leitner et al 1998 richardson et al 2008 allard and colleagues 2015 showed that at low doc concentrations 1 mg l almost all the iodide in the water is converted to iodate the stable form of iodine due to from the fast reaction with chlorine in contrast at high doc concentrations 4 mg l iodine binds to the many reactive sites within the nom forming iodinated organics before it can be converted to iodate in general the authors showed that at high doc concentrations a higher formation of iodinated organic compounds is expected this is in line with what we observed in our study suva254 values reflect the nature and composition of nom in a water sample edzwald and tobiason 1999 and have been shown to correlate with dbp formation higher suva254 values 4 or greater imply high hydrophobicity aromaticity and molecular weight components while low suva254 values 2 indicate the opposite suva254 values between 2 and 4 suggest mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic and aromatic and non aromatic nom with a mixture of molecular weights during the 15 months of this study we observed suva254 values that were between 1 85 4 17 for the treated waters table s3 chloramination experiments conducted by kristiana et al 2009 showed that the aromatic components within nom play a major role in the formation of tobr and tocl but not in the formation of toi the authors suggested that when the reactive sites in nom have a high aromatic content high suva254 values hyprobromous and hypochlorous acids known to be highly reactive with phenolic moieties better outcompete hoi for reaction with nom criquet et al 2015 echigo and minear 2006 lee et al 2005 westerhoff et al 2004 this fact could explain what we observed here for the low to mid range suva254 values observed in this study 1 85 4 17 toi concentration decreases with an increase in suva254 allard et al 2015 observed similar results in chloraminated water but attributed this to the chlorination bromination of the active sites during the chlorine contact period throughout the 15 months and across all three sites the ph of the raw samples was adjusted by the wtps to between 6 93 and 7 45 prior to release into the distribution system table s3 the effective ph range for monochloramine is between 7 5 and 9 the further the ph drops below 7 5 the more monochloramine becomes less stable and is likely to dissociate into hocl and nh3 deborde and von gunten 2008 in other words decreasing the ph is expected to enhance the release of hocl by the hydrolysis of nh2cl since hocl rapidly oxidizes hoi to iodate the stable form bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 it leads to lower formation of i dbps this is consistent with what we observed in our study where an increase in ph was accompanied by a subsequent increase in toi concentration our results also show that an increase in tcl2 concentration is accompanied by a decrease in toi concentration this could be seen as a result of an equilibrium between chloramine and free chlorine achieved at sufficiently high tcl2 concentrations once equilibrium is achieved hocl starts slowly forming which then leads to the rapid oxidation of hoi to form iodate bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 this has been previously hypothesized in the literature hua et al 2006 and concurs with the negative effect of tcl2 on toi observed in the regression despite that the tobit model determined doc suva254 ph and tcl2 as the most significant this does not definitively rule out the influence of other parameters on toi for instance as ti concentrations increase in water it is more likely that toi concentrations will increase as well mainly due to the higher availability of iodine to form toi as noted previously iodinated species such as organic iodine iodate and iodide are labile and can undergo transformation into one another in the environment amachi et al 2005a councell et al 1997 farrenkopf et al 1997 gong and zhang 2013 radlinger and heumann 2000 our results showed that toi concentrations did often increase with an increase in ti concentrations even though the regression coefficient was not statistically significant p value 0 05 the lack of significance could be due to remaining multicollinearity between the covariates that confounds significance testing also some high ti values at sites b and c during june of 2014 were not accompanied by similarly high toi values which led to a weakening in the expected signal fig s2 fig 6 shows toi predictions from the tobit regression against observed measured toi values the model provides a reasonably good fit whereby the eight parameters could explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi concentrations in treated waters r2 0 46 still a significant portion of the observed variability remains unexplained for instance an observed value of 20 µg l corresponds to a predicted value of 2 µg l however to the best of our understanding this is the first attempt at predicting the concentration of toi in water using commonly measured water quality parameters while further work is needed to improve such toi predictions the performance of this model can act as a baseline against which to compare the performance of future models 4 conclusions the work presented here characterizes toi in three drinking water treatment trains in the northeast us we have established the order of magnitude of toi and ti species over a period of 15 months as well as the differences in the raw water and several points in the distribution system we observed a clear increase in ti during the spring and summer months compared to the fall and winter months despite the absence of a clear seasonal pattern for toi there was substantial inter monthly variability where toi values cluster high or low for months at a time the toi concentrations exhibited peak values between the late summer and early winter the results also showed that toi was present in the raw water and that there was a slight decrease in toi concentration and in the ratio of toi ti upon treatment suggesting that the ti components may have shifted between the raw and treated waters the results of our multivariate regression showed that toi was correlated with doc suva254 tcl2 and ph to varying degrees toi increased with an increase in doc and ph and a decrease in suva254 and tcl2 a predictive model that used eight water quality parameters was fit for toi occurrence in water and was able to explain approximately 46 of the variance of toi concentrations in the treated waters this is highly valuable since it will allow the estimation of toi to a degree of certainty in relation to parameters that are routinely measured in water by utilities since most of the i dbps identified in drinking water have shown enhanced cyto and genotoxicity compared to their brominated and chlorinated analogues improving the quality of the water without the reliance on expensive and complicated analytical techniques and equipment is helpful the advantages of using a toi as a surrogate measure is that it can quantify the amount of iodinated organic compounds in a water sample the drawback on the other hand is that toi does not provide an accurate identification of the contents of the water since it does not break down toi into its specific species a deeper understanding of toi and the way it varies with the other constituents in a water sample is required to mitigate this limitation declaration of competing interest the

energy consumption and hydraulic retention time of air flotation were higher compared with other methods such as coagulating and sedimentation for the regions occasionally influenced by algae boom local water treatment plant does not always have the specialized facilities for the air floatation of algae laden water besides air flotation uf is also an effective physical separation method for algae laden water treatment uf could effectively eliminate algae suspended particles partially remove natural organic matter and partially disinfect the water liang et al 2008 pryor et al 1998 however uf process also suffers from some weaknesses for algae laden water treatment 1 the high molecular weight organic matter such as proteinaceous and polysaccharides contained in algae laden water would

investigations revealed the mechanism of fe vi pre oxidation for the abatement of organic pollutants and hazardous species the effect of fe vi pre oxidation on the filtration of algae laden water was unknown this study explores the effect of fe vi on fecl3 coagulation uf of algae laden water in terms of algae cell property variation of dissolved components membrane fouling and formation potential

acidification of methanol containing 10 h2so4 to analyze the formation of haas 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae cell integrity and variation of the dissolved contents 3 1 1 algae cell morphology effect of fe vi oxidation on algae cell morphology was initially examined raw water contained 1 05 0 02 107 cells ml of algae fig 1 a average size of the algae cells was around 2 μm according to sem analysis fig 1b laser diffraction grain size analysis suggested that the average hydrodynamic size of algae cells was about 7 0 μm fig 1i hydrodynamic size of algae is larger than the physical size due to the hydration shell around algae zeta potential of the particles in raw water was 34 mv fig 1j after reacting with 0 01 mm of fe vi sem images showed that most algae cells shrunk fig 1d and figure s1a which may be caused by cell structure damage and intercellular organics leakage compared to those in raw water peak hydrodynamic size of suspended particles in the fe vi treated water increased to 14 2 μm intensity 5 8 fig 1i and zeta potential of the particles increased to 21 mv fig 1j theoretically size impacts the collision efficiency and the zeta potential impacts the attachment efficiency under neutral ph condition zeta potential of the ferric hydr oxides formed in the reduction of fe vi was around 0 5 mv when ferric particles combined with the negatively charged particles via electrostatic attraction the reduction in zeta potential resulted in the decrease of inhibitory energy among particles which is in favor for the particle aggregation when the algae laden water was treated by 0 02 mm of fe vi dense flocs formed during fast stirring process fig 1e and these flocs were easily subsided peak value of hydrodynamic size of the suspended particles increased to 22 4 μm intensity 6 5 fig 1f compared to those in the 0 01 mm group the algae cells in the 0 02 mm fe vi group were disrupted and mixed with nanosized particles fig 1f and s1 zeta potential of particles in the solution was around 15 mv being the highest among the four groups fig 1j due to their large sizes and high zeta potential the particles were easy to aggregate and settle in contrast fewer flocs formed in the 0 03 mm of fe vi treated water fig 1g and the algae cells were covered by ferric nanoparticles fig 1h and s1 peak value of hydrodynamic size of the suspended particles was 20 μm intensity 6 1 and zeta potential of these particles was around 19 mv fig 1i and 1j compared with those in 0 02 mm group the algae cells were mostly disrupted and mixed with more ferric particles this disruption of algae cells may negatively impact their aggregation 3 1 2 intracellular organic matter release breakage of algae cell and oxidation adsorption of algae organic matter simultaneously occurred during fe vi pre oxidation hence it was difficult to directly study the breakage of algae cells by determining the amount of the released algae intracellular organic matter iom k is an ingredient of algal exudation and stable during the oxidation liu et al 2018 a tentative estimation of iom released could be carried out based on an assumption that concentrations of k in iom and cell exudation during oxidation were similar content of k introduced by the added fe vi was subtracted based on control experiment in this case released and removed iom during fe vi pre oxidation could be calculated according to the k data in fig 2 a initially the percentage of k released in raw water was around 20 fig 2a as a certain number of algae cells may be senescent and would release intracellular contents into the water when the algae laden water treated by 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi the percentage of k released into water increased to 37 83 and 90 respectively these results were in accordance with above data fig 1 in which 0 01 mm of fe vi damaged algae cells while 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi disrupted algae cells this can be explained by that fe vi is a strong oxidant and highly reactive with organics containing nitrogen sulfur and phosphate he et al 2018 hu et al 2012 doc content in raw water was around 15 5 mg l it decreased to 12 5 mg l after uf fig 2b less than 20 of doc was removed by uf after coagulation with 0 5 mm of fecl3 content of doc decreased to 9 3 mg l in filtered water and 25 6 of doc was removed when pre oxidized by 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi algae cells were disrupted and content of doc varied to be 13 6 mg l 15 2 mg l and 15 5 mg l in un ultrafiltered samples and further decreased to 8 8 mg l 7 7 mg l and 6 3 mg l in ultrafiltered samples fe vi pre oxidation disrupted algae cell and led to the release of doc in water the fe vi resulted particles and fecl3 may interact with doc and coagulated adsorbed them which resulted in the improved removal of doc after uf generally 35 3 49 4 and 59 4 of doc was removed during fe vi fecl3 uf treatment 10 34 higher than that removed by fecl3 uf treatment previous studies on chemical oxidation of polluted water mainly focused on the conversion of target pollutants into harmless products while the effect on doc control was rarely examined small molecular weight products would form in the oxidation of target pollutants and background organics in natural water removing doc could improve the microbial and chemical stability of the treated water reduction of fe vi leads to the formation of ferric nanoparticles and these particles are highly dispersed in the solution with and have larger surface areas they can easily adsorb inorganic species and interact with organic compounds through hydrogen bonding for the algae laden water in this study content of doc decreased from 15 47 to 12 42 mg l after uf fig 2b while the content of doc decreased to 6 32 mg l after the fe vi 0 03 mm fecl3 0 5 mm uf treatment around 50 of doc was eliminated compared with uf alone besides doc variation of tn in relevant samples was evaluated as well fig 2c raw water contained 12 5 mg l of tn after uf 20 of tn was removed and the outflow contained 1 7 mg l of nh3 n 0 8 mg l of no2 n 5 0 mg l of no3 n and 2 6 mg l of org n compared with uf fecl3 coagulation uf removed more than 0 5 mg l of tn indicating that the extra removal of nitrogen was mainly composed of no3 n around 0 35 mg l as the dosage of fe vi increased from 0 01 to 0 03 mm content of tn increased from 12 5 mg l to 15 mg l in raw water the released intracellular substance contains org n which plays an important role in the tn increase however the tn content decreased in the outflows after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment removal ratios of tn in fe vi pre oxidation groups were 26 31 and 37 respectively the contents of nh3 n and no2 n dropped below 0 4 mg l and 0 mg l respectively and the content of org n surpassed 3 6 mg l on average fe vi can oxidize nh3 n and no2 n to produce no3 n he et al 2018 liu et al 2016 considering the high solubility of nh3 n no2 n no3 n and org n the total amount of nitrogen in the system was in balance thus due to that the large amount of intercellular substances was released after fe vi pre oxidation the enhanced removal of tn in fe vi pre oxidation groups may lie in the adsorption of org n by ferric hydr oxides 3 1 3 sec and 3d eem analysis sec and 3d eem analysis were used to study the variation of organics components in algae laden water pre oxidized water without fecl3 coagulation and uf and filtered water sec peaks could be attributed to high molecular weight substances 1 kda 20 kda building blocks degradation products of high molecular weight substances and low molecular weight substances 1000 da henderson et al 2008b figs 3 a and 3c in raw water intensity of high molecular weight substances and lower molecular weight substances was 10 000 and 3000 respectively fig 3a after pre oxidation with 0 01 mm of fe vi intensity of high molecular weight substances decreased to below 5000 while intensity of building blocks and low molecular weight substances increased to 18 000 and 20 000 respectively as the dosage of fe vi further increased to 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm more building blocks and low molecular weight substances formed fig 3a 3d eem analysis also showed similar variation three fluorescence peaks belonging to protein like substances peak a fulvic like substances peak b and humic like substances peak c were identified in the water samples cheng et al 2018 henderson et al 2009 figs 3b and 3d intensity of the peaks was summarized in table s1 in raw water intensity of peak a peak b and peak c was 1226 415 and 562 respectively fig 3b and table s1 as the dosage of fe vi increased from 0 01 mm to 0 03 mm protein like substances were degraded intensity of peak a decreased by 29 2 46 8 and 57 9 respectively fig 3b and table s1 while enhanced formation of fulvic like substances and humic like substances was observed the sec and 3d eem analysis results are in accordance which high molecular weight substances protein like substances and polysaccharides were degraded by fe vi with the formation of lower molecular weight substances fulvic like and humic like substances and amino acids in the filtered raw water intensity of building blocks and low molecular weight substances dropped below 10 000 in all samples fig 3c and intensity of the three eem fluorescence peaks decreased by 30 around fig 3d direct uf treatment rejected part of organics content of protein like substances further decreased after fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 coagulation uf treatment while the intensity of peak b and peak c was higher than peak a in 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm of fe vi pre oxidation groups uf was more effective for the interception of high molecular weight substances than the lower molecular weight substances 3 2 membrane fouling 3 2 1 images of cake layer ferric particles formed during the fe vi reduction process would interact with suspended particles and gradually coagulate considering that main problems of uf in water treatment are organic and inorganic fouling the influence of fe vi pre oxidation on membrane fouling was investigated fluorescent microscope images of cake layer and sem images of backwashed membrane are illustrated in fig 4 pi is a fluorochrome that binds to nucleic acid it cannot penetrate intact cell and only enter damaged cell red fluorescence of pi was used as an indicator to study the degree of cell damage cake layer formed in raw water filtration was covered by amorphous substance with low fluorescence intensity fig 4c meanwhile the sem image also presented that the cake layer was covered with a lot of intact algae cell figure s2a and edx result of the cake layer was shown in figure s3 these substances may be organic matter released by senescent algae as about 20 of algae iom was released into the raw water fig 2a in comparison damaged cells red bright spots were mixed with amorphous substance in fe vi treated samples fig 4b fluorescence intensity of these samples was higher than that in direct uf and fecl3 uf groups fig 4c and 4d this suggests that the amorphous substances containing a large amount of nucleic acid were released by the damaged or disrupted algae cell the amount of damaged algae cell and amorphous substances increased with the increase of fe vi dosage fig 4b which was consistent with the determined percentage of cell damage fig 2a for the backwashed membranes the amount of residual substance in different groups was different after direct uf of algae laden water the membrane was backwashed but still covered with round and irregular particles φ 0 3 1 5 μm fig 4c these substances may be algae cells and inorganic particles in the raw water for the water samples pretreated by fecl3 coagulation large particles and flocs were backwashed while small particles φ 0 1 0 8 μm with amorphous substance were left on the backwashed membrane fig 4d for the membranes in fe vi pre oxidation group 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm a limited number of particles was left and no amorphous substance was observed on the backwashed membrane fig 4b this indicates that the membrane was easier to clean after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment 3 2 2 membrane flux analysis variations in normalized flux and membrane fouling resistance during the filtration of water samples were recorded fig 5 for the raw water without fe vi pre oxidation and fecl3 coagulation normalized flux decreased steadily during filtration and approached 0 445 after filtering 300 ml of solution fig 5a reversible rre and irreversible rir fouling resistances were 24 7 1011 m 1and 11 4 1011 m 1 respectively fig 5b after membrane backwashing and other filtration cycles the normalized flux decreased to 0 409 at cycle 2 and further decreased to 0 298 at cycle 3 rre increased to 35 4 1011 m 1 and 48 6 1011 m 1 at cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively rir increased to 13 3 1011 m 1 and 16 8 1011 m 1 at cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively in conclusion as filtration time increased membrane fouling became more severe due to the application of fecl3 coagulation prior to uf the normalized flux decreased to 0 572 in cycle 1 and to 0 524 and 0 463 in cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively rre and rir were 14 6 1011 m 1and 8 9 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 1 21 3 1011 m 1and 9 9 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 2 and 30 5 1011 m 1and 12 3 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 3 compared to the direct uf of raw water fecl3 coagulation improved membrane flux by 55 and alleviated membrane fouling resistance rre and rir by 37 and 27 respectively for the water samples pre oxidized by fe vi 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm the normalized flux decreased to 0 688 0 763 and 0 726 respectively in cycle 1 to 0 637 0 732 and 0 706 respectively in cycle 2 and then to 0 580 0 699 and 0 627 respectively in cycle 3 fe vi pre oxidation 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm coupled with fecl3 coagulation improved membrane flux by 25 51 and 35 respectively in these groups rre was improved by 47 61 and 43 respectively and rir was improved by 26 52 and 41 respectively as evidenced above pre oxidation with 0 02 mm of fe vi showed the best improvement in both rre and rir 3 2 3 membrane fouling mechanism membrane pore was small and real cake layer and pore blocking were hard to observe modeling analysis was carried out to analyze the membrane fouling mechanism based on permeate volume v permeate flux j and filtration time t hermia s model was used to explain membrane fouling mechanism fig 6 theoretically the low n values from 0 to 1 indicate that membrane pores are largely blocked at this stage cake filtration and intermediate pore blocking are the main types of membrane fouling as the n value increases from 1 to 2 membrane fouling is not as severe as that ranged from 0 to 1 in this scenario the standard pore blocking and complete pore blocking are the main types of membrane fouling for the raw water filtration in the first cycle after filtering 120 ml of water membrane fouling changed from complete pore blocking to cake filtration fig 6a initially the particles and organics in raw water coated on membrane and blocked membrane pores n 2 058 as more water was filtered membrane pores were blocked with particles and organics and cake filtration became the dominant fouling type n 0 013 transition from virgin membrane to pore blocked membrane and then to cake layer packed membrane led to the decrease of membrane flux in the second filtration cycle after backwashing irreversible fouling resistances increased fig 5b and the transition volume from pore blocking membrane fouling to cake filtration membrane fouling advanced to 100 ml for the filtration of water coagulated by fecl3 transition volume from pore blocking membrane fouling to cake filtration membrane fouling was 150 ml in the first cycle and 110 ml in the second cycle fig 6b as evidenced above fecl3 coagulation attenuated membrane fouling in the filtration of algae laden water for the algae laden waters treated with fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 aggregation uf the fouling mechanism transition point delayed obviously interestingly for the water treated by 0 02 mm of fe vi no change in membrane fouling type was observed fig 6d as the membrane fouling type was standard pore blocking n 1 237 and 1 399 in both filtration cycles this trend is in consistent with the above data in which high molecular weight substances were degraded into low molecular weight substances fig 3 the low molecular weight substances were coagulated by ferric hydr oxides or penetrated membrane pores during filtration algae cells aggregated with ferric nanoparticles and the flocs fig 1e were easily captured by fecl3 and backwashed after filtration fig 4b in comparison the amount of dissolved organic matters doc sec eem data especially the lower mw fraction in 0 03 mm group was higher than that in 0 02 mm group in the filtrate and the overall particle size was smaller in 0 03 mm group than that in 0 02 mm group fig 1i these substances may block membrane pores and decrease membrane permeation flux due to the formation of nanoparticles increasing the dosage of fe vi does not linearly correlate with the improving of membrane fouling pilot experiments are necessary to optimize operation parameters in authentic water pollution control although cell debris and intracellular organic matter formed during ozonation of algae laden water can aggravate membrane fouling bin et al 2017 ferric species formed in the reduction of fe vi can alleviate membrane fouling by aggregating with algae cell debris to form a more porous cake layer liu et al 2018 because these ferric nanoparticles were positively charged fig 1 interacted with negatively charged algae cells and facilitated floc formation fig 1e besides ferric nanoparticles could adsorb more organics due to the high surface area fig 2 the algae debris ferric flocs became a porous cake layer after filtration fig 6c 6d and 6e and were easily backwashed fig 4b in comparison the membrane cake layer could not be completely backwashed in uf or fecl3 uf treatment fig 4c and 4d in conclusion fe vi pre oxidation enhanced fecl3 coagulation of algae laden water and alleviated membrane fouling 3 3 formation potential of dbps intracellular organics released by algae not only negatively affect water quality with toxic and odorous compounds but also increase the formation potential of disinfection byproducts in downstream disinfection processes e g chlorination fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008a influence of fe vi pre oxidation on the formation potential of chlorinated disinfection byproducts in algae laden water was investigated fig 7 water samples were chlorinated concentration of naocl 15 mg active chlorine l dosed once for 3 days after chlorination formation of 19 kinds of disinfection byproducts was monitored content of tcm in raw water was the highest with 181 μg l followed by bdcm ch tcp and tcnm fig 7a direct filtration of raw water showed no significant effect on controlling the formation potential of these organics but fecl3 0 5 mm coagulation coupled with uf controlled the formation potential of tcm by 12 bdcm by 6 ch by 32 tcp by 11 and tcnm by 19 fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 coagulation uf treatment was more effective in eliminating the formation potential of these dbps and the elimination effect increased with the increase of fe vi dosage fe vi 0 03 mm pre oxidation controlled 32 of tcm 33 of bdcm 80 of ch 43 of tcp and 82 of tcnm respectively fecl3 0 5 mm coagulation decreased the formation potential of mcan dbcm dcan and dcp by 50 19 36 and 39 respectively superior to the uf treatment 10 20 on average fig 7b fe vi pre oxidation 0 03 mm coupled with fecl3 uf showed the best inhibitory effect eliminating 62 of mcan 40 of dbcm 62 of dcan and 50 of dcp compared with that in uf group compared to the 9 disinfection products above uf fecl3 coagulation uf and fe vi fecl3 uf had little effect on controlling the formation potential of tcan tcacam bcan and dban fig 7c their contents in chlorinated raw water were 3 8 μg l 2 3 μg l 1 8 μg l and 1 1 μg l respectively in fe vi 0 03 mm group their contents were 3 2 μg l 2 2 μg l 1 2 μg l and 0 9 μg l respectively meaning less than 30 of tcan tcacam bcan and dban were eliminated with fe vi pre oxidation formation of 6 kinds of haas was shown in fig 7d generally fecl3 coagulation uf treatment decreased the formation of dcaa and bdcaa by 24 and 44 respectively however after pre oxidized by different dosage of fe vi variation of the 6 kinds of haas was within 10 fe vi pre oxidation showed no intense effect on controlling the formation of the detected haas in above section it was found that lower molecular weight products formed after fe vi pre oxidation fig 3 considering that lower molecular weight products include precursors of haas maintaining stable without forming more haas after fe vi pre oxidation is in favor for improving quality of the treated water these investigated disinfection products could be classified into 2 groups carbonaceous byproducts including trihalomethanes tcm bdcm dbcm haas dcaa dbaa bcaa bdcaa tbaa cdbaa ch tcp and dcp and nitrogenous byproducts including haloacetonitriles tcan mcan dcan bcan dban tcnm and tcacam compared with fecl3 coagulation uf fe vi 0 02 mm pre oxidation coupled with fecl3 coagulation uf eliminated 32 5 of the formation potential of carbonaceous byproducts on average while only 22 5 of the formation potential of nitrogenous byproducts was eliminated on average chemically the formation of nitrogenous byproducts was correlated with the presence of n containing organics in the above section fig 2 we found that after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment doc was largely controlled while the content of org n increased after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment the formation potential of nitrogenous byproducts showed a decreasing trend suggesting that a certain amount of nitrogenous byproducts precursor was eliminated although fe vi pre oxidation showed a greater control over the formation potential of carbonaceous byproducts than on nitrogenous byproducts ozone is a strong oxidant standard redox potential 2 07 v and is more reactive with organic compounds even 0 4 mg l of ozone could destroy more than 98 of algae cell in algae laden water although pre ozonated o3 2 0 mg l algae laden water followed by al2 so4 3 coagulation sedimentation could only remove over 80 of algae and 63 of doc in algae laden water the formation potential of ch tcnm and tcm increased by about 260 450 and 40 respectively xie et al 2013 in comparison permanganate is a mild oxidant standard redox potential 1 51 v as less than 5 of algae cells was damaged in permanganate 2 0 mg l pre oxidation furthermore permanganate 0 4 1 0 and 2 0 mg l pre oxidation slightly increased the formation potential of tcm ch dcp tcp dcan tcan tcnm and tcacam by 2 15 xie et al 2013 researchers emphasized that the majority of dbp precursors is cellular material plummer and edzwald 2001 and leakage of intercellular substance increases the difficulty of controlling dbp formation according to above results fe vi oxidation disrupted algae cell fig 1 and fig 2a and 10 34 of doc could be simultaneously removed after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment compared with fecl3 uf treatment fig 2b fe vi not only exerted a strong influence on oxidizing organics but also the resulted ferric nanoparticles also participated in the aggregation of cell debris fig 1 and adsorption of organic components fig 2 compared with fecl3 hydrolyzed flocs the ferric nanoparticles containing flocs alleviated membrane fouling figs 5 and 6 and were easier to be backwashed fig 4 due to the high doc removal efficiency formation potential of c dbps and n dbps decreased after fe vi 0 02 mm fecl3 uf treatment compared to fecl3 uf treatment fig 7 4 conclusions effect of fe vi pre oxidation on treating fecl3 uf of algae laden water was investigated in this study fe vi pre oxidation disrupted algae cells and promoted their aggregation with ferric nanoparticles after treatment with 0 02 mm of fe vi particle size and zeta potential of algae increased by 20 and 55 on average respectively which facilitated algae aggregation membrane flux reversible membrane resistance rr and irreversible membrane resistance rir were improved by 51 61 and 52 in fe vi 0 02 mm fecl3 uf treatment group compared with fecl3 uf treatment after three filtration cycles formation potential of 12 kinds of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps and 7 kinds of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps decreased by 32 5 and 22 5 respectively due to the exceeding removal of 10 34 of the dissolved organic compounds doc and 6 17 of total nitrogen tn after fe

17246,effect of ferrate fe vi pre oxidation on improving fecl3 ultrafiltration uf of algae laden source water was investigated fe vi disrupted algae cells and the in situ formed ferric hydr oxides aggregated with cell debris particle size and zeta potential of algae increased by 20 and 55 on average respectively after treatment with 0 02 mm of fe vi these variations facilitated the formation of algae ferric floc fe vi degraded algal extracellular organic matter into lower molecular weight products fulvic like and humic like substances membrane flux reversible membrane resistance rr and irreversible membrane resistance rir were improved by 51 61 and 52 in fe vi 0 02 mm fecl3 uf treatment group compared with fecl3 uf treatment after three filtration cycles fe vi fecl3 uf removed more than 10 34 of the dissolved organic compounds doc and 6 17 of the total nitrogen tn compared with fecl3 uf due to the enhanced removal of doc and tn formation potential of 12 kinds of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps and 7 kinds of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps decreased by 32 5 and 22 5 respectively fe vi pre oxidant was effective for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing formation potential of dbps in algal laden water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction many algae are unicellular organisms with small size and large surface area they could efficiently ingest nutrients from the environment due to the global industrialization and urbanization excess nutrients e g phosphorus nitrogen and potassium and organics were discharged into receiving water this process provides sufficient nutrients for the growth of algae elevated content of carbon dioxide in atmosphere and global warming also facilitated the algae proliferation yan et al 2017 algal would clog filtration tank and the released algal organic matter would deteriorate esthetic properties of water e g test odor color and turbidity elevated content of organics in water would also increase the formation potential of dbps in disinfection treatment carpenter et al 1998 venkateswarlu 1969 zhang et al 2010 air flotation is highly efficient for the treatment of algae laden water however air flotation requires specialized facilities such as air compressor pressure sensor air dissolving pump water distribution system and scraper moto meanwhile energy consumption and hydraulic retention time of air flotation were higher compared with other methods such as coagulating and sedimentation for the regions occasionally influenced by algae boom local water treatment plant does not always have the specialized facilities for the air floatation of algae laden water besides air flotation uf is also an effective physical separation method for algae laden water treatment uf could effectively eliminate algae suspended particles partially remove natural organic matter and partially disinfect the water liang et al 2008 pryor et al 1998 however uf process also suffers from some weaknesses for algae laden water treatment 1 the high molecular weight organic matter such as proteinaceous and polysaccharides contained in algae laden water would cause membrane fouling qu et al 2012 which deteriorates membrane flux and requires additional driving energy 2 dissolved pollutants cannot be fully eliminated through uf treatment jermann et al 2007 it is necessary to explore supporting methods for alleviating membrane fouling and enhancing the removal of dissolved organic pollutants in the uf of source water pre treatment methods such as coagulation alizadeh tabatabai et al 2014 diamadopoulos and vlachos 1996 adsorption huang et al 2009 li et al 2014 and pre oxidation cheng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wei et al 2016 have been investigated for the alleviation of membrane fouling and enhancing the removal of pollutants oxidation is one of the most commonly used ways to alleviate membrane fouling henderson et al 2008a high molecular weight organic matter could be oxidized into lower molecular weight organic matter kmno4 is a mild oxidant and can be used for pre oxidation of algae laden water deka et al 2018 jun et al 2000 it would not lead to the damage of algae cell and could eliminate organic pollutants in the solution dietrich et al 1995 mno2 colloid formed in the reduction of permanganate would aggregate with algae and enhance their coagulation however dosage of permanganate has to be well controlled to prevent the residual of dissolved mn species and thus the impact on water colority jun et al 2004 fe vi has the advantage of oxidizing pollutants hu et al 2012 huang et al 2018 prucek et al 2015 and nano sized ferric hydr oxides would form in the reduction of fe vi compared with the hydrolyzation product of fecl3 more nano sized ferric hydr oxides would form in the reduction of fe vi goodwill et al 2015a jiang et al 2015 these nano sized ferric hydr oxides were highly dispersed in solution smoother and more granular liu et al 2017 yang et al 2018 they were stable in treated water and can effectively interact with hazardous species goodwill et al 2015b he et al 2019 although investigations revealed the mechanism of fe vi pre oxidation for the abatement of organic pollutants and hazardous species the effect of fe vi pre oxidation on the filtration of algae laden water was unknown this study explores the effect of fe vi on fecl3 coagulation uf of algae laden water in terms of algae cell property variation of dissolved components membrane fouling and formation potential of dbps these results may provide useful information for treating algae laden water alleviating membrane fouling and controlling the formation of dbps in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1

acidification of methanol containing 10 h2so4 to analyze the formation of haas 3 results and discussion 3 1 algae cell integrity and variation of the dissolved contents 3 1 1 algae cell morphology effect of fe vi oxidation on algae cell morphology was initially examined raw water contained 1 05 0 02 107 cells ml of algae fig 1 a average size of the algae cells was around 2 μm according to sem analysis fig 1b laser diffraction grain size analysis suggested that the average hydrodynamic size of algae cells was about 7 0 μm fig 1i hydrodynamic size of algae is larger than the physical size due to the hydration shell around algae zeta potential of the particles in raw water was 34 mv fig 1j after reacting with 0 01 mm of fe vi sem images showed that most algae cells shrunk fig 1d and figure s1a which may be caused by cell structure damage and intercellular organics leakage compared to those in raw water peak hydrodynamic size of suspended particles in the fe vi treated water increased to 14 2 μm intensity 5 8 fig 1i and zeta potential of the particles increased to 21 mv fig 1j theoretically size impacts the collision efficiency and the zeta potential impacts the attachment efficiency under neutral ph condition zeta potential of the ferric hydr oxides formed in the reduction of fe vi was around 0 5 mv when ferric particles combined with the negatively charged particles via electrostatic attraction the reduction in zeta potential resulted in the decrease of inhibitory energy among particles which is in favor for the particle aggregation when the algae laden water was treated by 0 02 mm of fe vi dense flocs formed during fast stirring process fig 1e and these flocs were easily subsided peak value of hydrodynamic size of the suspended particles increased to 22 4 μm intensity 6 5 fig 1f compared to those in the 0 01 mm group the algae cells in the 0 02 mm fe vi group were disrupted and mixed with nanosized particles fig 1f and s1 zeta potential of particles in the solution was around 15 mv being the highest among the four groups fig 1j due to their large sizes and high zeta potential the particles were easy to aggregate and settle in contrast fewer flocs formed in the 0 03 mm of fe vi treated water fig 1g and the algae cells were covered by ferric nanoparticles fig 1h and s1 peak value of hydrodynamic size of the suspended particles was 20 μm intensity 6 1 and zeta potential of these particles was around 19 mv fig 1i and 1j compared with those in 0 02 mm group the algae cells were mostly disrupted and mixed with more ferric particles this disruption of algae cells may negatively impact their aggregation 3 1 2 intracellular organic matter release breakage of algae cell and oxidation adsorption of algae organic matter simultaneously occurred during fe vi pre oxidation hence it was difficult to directly study the breakage of algae cells by determining the amount of the released algae intracellular organic matter iom k is an ingredient of algal exudation and stable during the oxidation liu et al 2018 a tentative estimation of iom released could be carried out based on an assumption that concentrations of k in iom and cell exudation during oxidation were similar content of k introduced by the added fe vi was subtracted based on control experiment in this case released and removed iom during fe vi pre oxidation could be calculated according to the k data in fig 2 a initially the percentage of k released in raw water was around 20 fig 2a as a certain number of algae cells may be senescent and would release intracellular contents into the water when the algae laden water treated by 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi the percentage of k released into water increased to 37 83 and 90 respectively these results were in accordance with above data fig 1 in which 0 01 mm of fe vi damaged algae cells while 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi disrupted algae cells this can be explained by that fe vi is a strong oxidant and highly reactive with organics containing nitrogen sulfur and phosphate he et al 2018 hu et al 2012 doc content in raw water was around 15 5 mg l it decreased to 12 5 mg l after uf fig 2b less than 20 of doc was removed by uf after coagulation with 0 5 mm of fecl3 content of doc decreased to 9 3 mg l in filtered water and 25 6 of doc was removed when pre oxidized by 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 mm of fe vi algae cells were disrupted and content of doc varied to be 13 6 mg l 15 2 mg l and 15 5 mg l in un ultrafiltered samples and further decreased to 8 8 mg l 7 7 mg l and 6 3 mg l in ultrafiltered samples fe vi pre oxidation disrupted algae cell and led to the release of doc in water the fe vi resulted particles and fecl3 may interact with doc and coagulated adsorbed them which resulted in the improved removal of doc after uf generally 35 3 49 4 and 59 4 of doc was removed during fe vi fecl3 uf treatment 10 34 higher than that removed by fecl3 uf treatment previous studies on chemical oxidation of polluted water mainly focused on the conversion of target pollutants into harmless products while the effect on doc control was rarely examined small molecular weight products would form in the oxidation of target pollutants and background organics in natural water removing doc could improve the microbial and chemical stability of the treated water reduction of fe vi leads to the formation of ferric nanoparticles and these particles are highly dispersed in the solution with and have larger surface areas they can easily adsorb inorganic species and interact with organic compounds through hydrogen bonding for the algae laden water in this study content of doc decreased from 15 47 to 12 42 mg l after uf fig 2b while the content of doc decreased to 6 32 mg l after the fe vi 0 03 mm fecl3 0 5 mm uf treatment around 50 of doc was eliminated compared with uf alone besides doc variation of tn in relevant samples was evaluated as well fig 2c raw water contained 12 5 mg l of tn after uf 20 of tn was removed and the outflow contained 1 7 mg l of nh3 n 0 8 mg l of no2 n 5 0 mg l of no3 n and 2 6 mg l of org n compared with uf fecl3 coagulation uf removed more than 0 5 mg l of tn indicating that the extra removal of nitrogen was mainly composed of no3 n around 0 35 mg l as the dosage of fe vi increased from 0 01 to 0 03 mm content of tn increased from 12 5 mg l to 15 mg l in raw water the released intracellular substance contains org n which plays an important role in the tn increase however the tn content decreased in the outflows after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment removal ratios of tn in fe vi pre oxidation groups were 26 31 and 37 respectively the contents of nh3 n and no2 n dropped below 0 4 mg l and 0 mg l respectively and the content of org n surpassed 3 6 mg l on average fe vi can oxidize nh3 n and no2 n to produce no3 n he et al 2018 liu et al 2016 considering the high solubility of nh3 n no2 n no3 n and org n the total amount of nitrogen in the system was in balance thus due to that the large amount of intercellular substances was released after fe vi pre oxidation the enhanced removal of tn in fe vi pre oxidation groups may lie in the adsorption of org n by ferric hydr oxides 3 1 3 sec and 3d eem analysis sec and 3d eem analysis were used to study the variation of organics components in algae laden water pre oxidized water without fecl3 coagulation and uf and filtered water sec peaks could be attributed to high molecular weight substances 1 kda 20 kda building blocks degradation products of high molecular weight substances and low molecular weight substances 1000 da henderson et al 2008b figs 3 a and 3c in raw water intensity of high molecular weight substances and lower molecular weight substances was 10 000 and 3000 respectively fig 3a after pre oxidation with 0 01 mm of fe vi intensity of high molecular weight substances decreased to below 5000 while intensity of building blocks and low molecular weight substances increased to 18 000 and 20 000 respectively as the dosage of fe vi further increased to 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm more building blocks and low molecular weight substances formed fig 3a 3d eem analysis also showed similar variation three fluorescence peaks belonging to protein like substances peak a fulvic like substances peak b and humic like substances peak c were identified in the water samples cheng et al 2018 henderson et al 2009 figs 3b and 3d intensity of the peaks was summarized in table s1 in raw water intensity of peak a peak b and peak c was 1226 415 and 562 respectively fig 3b and table s1 as the dosage of fe vi increased from 0 01 mm to 0 03 mm protein like substances were degraded intensity of peak a decreased by 29 2 46 8 and 57 9 respectively fig 3b and table s1 while enhanced formation of fulvic like substances and humic like substances was observed the sec and 3d eem analysis results are in accordance which high molecular weight substances protein like substances and polysaccharides were degraded by fe vi with the formation of lower molecular weight substances fulvic like and humic like substances and amino acids in the filtered raw water intensity of building blocks and low molecular weight substances dropped below 10 000 in all samples fig 3c and intensity of the three eem fluorescence peaks decreased by 30 around fig 3d direct uf treatment rejected part of organics content of protein like substances further decreased after fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 coagulation uf treatment while the intensity of peak b and peak c was higher than peak a in 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm of fe vi pre oxidation groups uf was more effective for the interception of high molecular weight substances than the lower molecular weight substances 3 2 membrane fouling 3 2 1 images of cake layer ferric particles formed during the fe vi reduction process would interact with suspended particles and gradually coagulate considering that main problems of uf in water treatment are organic and inorganic fouling the influence of fe vi pre oxidation on membrane fouling was investigated fluorescent microscope images of cake layer and sem images of backwashed membrane are illustrated in fig 4 pi is a fluorochrome that binds to nucleic acid it cannot penetrate intact cell and only enter damaged cell red fluorescence of pi was used as an indicator to study the degree of cell damage cake layer formed in raw water filtration was covered by amorphous substance with low fluorescence intensity fig 4c meanwhile the sem image also presented that the cake layer was covered with a lot of intact algae cell figure s2a and edx result of the cake layer was shown in figure s3 these substances may be organic matter released by senescent algae as about 20 of algae iom was released into the raw water fig 2a in comparison damaged cells red bright spots were mixed with amorphous substance in fe vi treated samples fig 4b fluorescence intensity of these samples was higher than that in direct uf and fecl3 uf groups fig 4c and 4d this suggests that the amorphous substances containing a large amount of nucleic acid were released by the damaged or disrupted algae cell the amount of damaged algae cell and amorphous substances increased with the increase of fe vi dosage fig 4b which was consistent with the determined percentage of cell damage fig 2a for the backwashed membranes the amount of residual substance in different groups was different after direct uf of algae laden water the membrane was backwashed but still covered with round and irregular particles φ 0 3 1 5 μm fig 4c these substances may be algae cells and inorganic particles in the raw water for the water samples pretreated by fecl3 coagulation large particles and flocs were backwashed while small particles φ 0 1 0 8 μm with amorphous substance were left on the backwashed membrane fig 4d for the membranes in fe vi pre oxidation group 0 02 mm and 0 03 mm a limited number of particles was left and no amorphous substance was observed on the backwashed membrane fig 4b this indicates that the membrane was easier to clean after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment 3 2 2 membrane flux analysis variations in normalized flux and membrane fouling resistance during the filtration of water samples were recorded fig 5 for the raw water without fe vi pre oxidation and fecl3 coagulation normalized flux decreased steadily during filtration and approached 0 445 after filtering 300 ml of solution fig 5a reversible rre and irreversible rir fouling resistances were 24 7 1011 m 1and 11 4 1011 m 1 respectively fig 5b after membrane backwashing and other filtration cycles the normalized flux decreased to 0 409 at cycle 2 and further decreased to 0 298 at cycle 3 rre increased to 35 4 1011 m 1 and 48 6 1011 m 1 at cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively rir increased to 13 3 1011 m 1 and 16 8 1011 m 1 at cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively in conclusion as filtration time increased membrane fouling became more severe due to the application of fecl3 coagulation prior to uf the normalized flux decreased to 0 572 in cycle 1 and to 0 524 and 0 463 in cycle 2 and cycle 3 respectively rre and rir were 14 6 1011 m 1and 8 9 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 1 21 3 1011 m 1and 9 9 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 2 and 30 5 1011 m 1and 12 3 1011 m 1 respectively in cycle 3 compared to the direct uf of raw water fecl3 coagulation improved membrane flux by 55 and alleviated membrane fouling resistance rre and rir by 37 and 27 respectively for the water samples pre oxidized by fe vi 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm the normalized flux decreased to 0 688 0 763 and 0 726 respectively in cycle 1 to 0 637 0 732 and 0 706 respectively in cycle 2 and then to 0 580 0 699 and 0 627 respectively in cycle 3 fe vi pre oxidation 0 01 mm 0 02 mm 0 03 mm coupled with fecl3 coagulation improved membrane flux by 25 51 and 35 respectively in these groups rre was improved by 47 61 and 43 respectively and rir was improved by 26 52 and 41 respectively as evidenced above pre oxidation with 0 02 mm of fe vi showed the best improvement in both rre and rir 3 2 3 membrane fouling mechanism membrane pore was small and real cake layer and pore blocking were hard to observe modeling analysis was carried out to analyze the membrane fouling mechanism based on permeate volume v permeate flux j and filtration time t hermia s model was used to explain membrane fouling mechanism fig 6 theoretically the low n values from 0 to 1 indicate that membrane pores are largely blocked at this stage cake filtration and intermediate pore blocking are the main types of membrane fouling as the n value increases from 1 to 2 membrane fouling is not as severe as that ranged from 0 to 1 in this scenario the standard pore blocking and complete pore blocking are the main types of membrane fouling for the raw water filtration in the first cycle after filtering 120 ml of water membrane fouling changed from complete pore blocking to cake filtration fig 6a initially the particles and organics in raw water coated on membrane and blocked membrane pores n 2 058 as more water was filtered membrane pores were blocked with particles and organics and cake filtration became the dominant fouling type n 0 013 transition from virgin membrane to pore blocked membrane and then to cake layer packed membrane led to the decrease of membrane flux in the second filtration cycle after backwashing irreversible fouling resistances increased fig 5b and the transition volume from pore blocking membrane fouling to cake filtration membrane fouling advanced to 100 ml for the filtration of water coagulated by fecl3 transition volume from pore blocking membrane fouling to cake filtration membrane fouling was 150 ml in the first cycle and 110 ml in the second cycle fig 6b as evidenced above fecl3 coagulation attenuated membrane fouling in the filtration of algae laden water for the algae laden waters treated with fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 aggregation uf the fouling mechanism transition point delayed obviously interestingly for the water treated by 0 02 mm of fe vi no change in membrane fouling type was observed fig 6d as the membrane fouling type was standard pore blocking n 1 237 and 1 399 in both filtration cycles this trend is in consistent with the above data in which high molecular weight substances were degraded into low molecular weight substances fig 3 the low molecular weight substances were coagulated by ferric hydr oxides or penetrated membrane pores during filtration algae cells aggregated with ferric nanoparticles and the flocs fig 1e were easily captured by fecl3 and backwashed after filtration fig 4b in comparison the amount of dissolved organic matters doc sec eem data especially the lower mw fraction in 0 03 mm group was higher than that in 0 02 mm group in the filtrate and the overall particle size was smaller in 0 03 mm group than that in 0 02 mm group fig 1i these substances may block membrane pores and decrease membrane permeation flux due to the formation of nanoparticles increasing the dosage of fe vi does not linearly correlate with the improving of membrane fouling pilot experiments are necessary to optimize operation parameters in authentic water pollution control although cell debris and intracellular organic matter formed during ozonation of algae laden water can aggravate membrane fouling bin et al 2017 ferric species formed in the reduction of fe vi can alleviate membrane fouling by aggregating with algae cell debris to form a more porous cake layer liu et al 2018 because these ferric nanoparticles were positively charged fig 1 interacted with negatively charged algae cells and facilitated floc formation fig 1e besides ferric nanoparticles could adsorb more organics due to the high surface area fig 2 the algae debris ferric flocs became a porous cake layer after filtration fig 6c 6d and 6e and were easily backwashed fig 4b in comparison the membrane cake layer could not be completely backwashed in uf or fecl3 uf treatment fig 4c and 4d in conclusion fe vi pre oxidation enhanced fecl3 coagulation of algae laden water and alleviated membrane fouling 3 3 formation potential of dbps intracellular organics released by algae not only negatively affect water quality with toxic and odorous compounds but also increase the formation potential of disinfection byproducts in downstream disinfection processes e g chlorination fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008a influence of fe vi pre oxidation on the formation potential of chlorinated disinfection byproducts in algae laden water was investigated fig 7 water samples were chlorinated concentration of naocl 15 mg active chlorine l dosed once for 3 days after chlorination formation of 19 kinds of disinfection byproducts was monitored content of tcm in raw water was the highest with 181 μg l followed by bdcm ch tcp and tcnm fig 7a direct filtration of raw water showed no significant effect on controlling the formation potential of these organics but fecl3 0 5 mm coagulation coupled with uf controlled the formation potential of tcm by 12 bdcm by 6 ch by 32 tcp by 11 and tcnm by 19 fe vi pre oxidation fecl3 coagulation uf treatment was more effective in eliminating the formation potential of these dbps and the elimination effect increased with the increase of fe vi dosage fe vi 0 03 mm pre oxidation controlled 32 of tcm 33 of bdcm 80 of ch 43 of tcp and 82 of tcnm respectively fecl3 0 5 mm coagulation decreased the formation potential of mcan dbcm dcan and dcp by 50 19 36 and 39 respectively superior to the uf treatment 10 20 on average fig 7b fe vi pre oxidation 0 03 mm coupled with fecl3 uf showed the best inhibitory effect eliminating 62 of mcan 40 of dbcm 62 of dcan and 50 of dcp compared with that in uf group compared to the 9 disinfection products above uf fecl3 coagulation uf and fe vi fecl3 uf had little effect on controlling the formation potential of tcan tcacam bcan and dban fig 7c their contents in chlorinated raw water were 3 8 μg l 2 3 μg l 1 8 μg l and 1 1 μg l respectively in fe vi 0 03 mm group their contents were 3 2 μg l 2 2 μg l 1 2 μg l and 0 9 μg l respectively meaning less than 30 of tcan tcacam bcan and dban were eliminated with fe vi pre oxidation formation of 6 kinds of haas was shown in fig 7d generally fecl3 coagulation uf treatment decreased the formation of dcaa and bdcaa by 24 and 44 respectively however after pre oxidized by different dosage of fe vi variation of the 6 kinds of haas was within 10 fe vi pre oxidation showed no intense effect on controlling the formation of the detected haas in above section it was found that lower molecular weight products formed after fe vi pre oxidation fig 3 considering that lower molecular weight products include precursors of haas maintaining stable without forming more haas after fe vi pre oxidation is in favor for improving quality of the treated water these investigated disinfection products could be classified into 2 groups carbonaceous byproducts including trihalomethanes tcm bdcm dbcm haas dcaa dbaa bcaa bdcaa tbaa cdbaa ch tcp and dcp and nitrogenous byproducts including haloacetonitriles tcan mcan dcan bcan dban tcnm and tcacam compared with fecl3 coagulation uf fe vi 0 02 mm pre oxidation coupled with fecl3 coagulation uf eliminated 32 5 of the formation potential of carbonaceous byproducts on average while only 22 5 of the formation potential of nitrogenous byproducts was eliminated on average chemically the formation of nitrogenous byproducts was correlated with the presence of n containing organics in the above section fig 2 we found that after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment doc was largely controlled while the content of org n increased after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment the formation potential of nitrogenous byproducts showed a decreasing trend suggesting that a certain amount of nitrogenous byproducts precursor was eliminated although fe vi pre oxidation showed a greater control over the formation potential of carbonaceous byproducts than on nitrogenous byproducts ozone is a strong oxidant standard redox potential 2 07 v and is more reactive with organic compounds even 0 4 mg l of ozone could destroy more than 98 of algae cell in algae laden water although pre ozonated o3 2 0 mg l algae laden water followed by al2 so4 3 coagulation sedimentation could only remove over 80 of algae and 63 of doc in algae laden water the formation potential of ch tcnm and tcm increased by about 260 450 and 40 respectively xie et al 2013 in comparison permanganate is a mild oxidant standard redox potential 1 51 v as less than 5 of algae cells was damaged in permanganate 2 0 mg l pre oxidation furthermore permanganate 0 4 1 0 and 2 0 mg l pre oxidation slightly increased the formation potential of tcm ch dcp tcp dcan tcan tcnm and tcacam by 2 15 xie et al 2013 researchers emphasized that the majority of dbp precursors is cellular material plummer and edzwald 2001 and leakage of intercellular substance increases the difficulty of controlling dbp formation according to above results fe vi oxidation disrupted algae cell fig 1 and fig 2a and 10 34 of doc could be simultaneously removed after fe vi fecl3 uf treatment compared with fecl3 uf treatment fig 2b fe vi not only exerted a strong influence on oxidizing organics but also the resulted ferric nanoparticles also participated in the aggregation of cell debris fig 1 and adsorption of organic components fig 2 compared with fecl3 hydrolyzed flocs the ferric nanoparticles containing flocs alleviated membrane fouling figs 5 and 6 and were easier to be backwashed fig 4 due to the high doc removal efficiency formation potential of c dbps and n dbps decreased after fe vi 0 02 mm fecl3 uf treatment compared to fecl3 uf treatment fig 7 4 conclusions effect of fe vi pre oxidation on treating fecl3 uf of algae laden water was investigated in this study fe vi pre oxidation disrupted algae cells and promoted their aggregation with ferric nanoparticles after treatment with 0 02 mm of fe vi particle size and zeta potential of algae increased by 20 and 55 on average respectively which facilitated algae aggregation membrane flux reversible membrane resistance rr and irreversible membrane resistance rir were improved by 51 61 and 52 in fe vi 0 02 mm fecl3 uf treatment group compared with fecl3 uf treatment after three filtration cycles formation potential of 12 kinds of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts c dbps and 7 kinds of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps decreased by 32 5 and 22 5 respectively due to the exceeding removal of 10 34 of the dissolved organic compounds doc and 6 17 of total nitrogen tn after fe

17247,phenolic compounds are common ccontaminants in industrial effluents in this study a combined catalytic microbubble ozonation and biological process was developed and applied for efficient industrial phenolic wastewater pww treatment catalytic activity of an iron oxides feox doped granular activated carbon gac catalyst feox gac in microbubble ozonation for pww treatment was investigated

catalyzed microbubble ozonation o3 gac k1 0 013 min 1 and ordinary microbubble ozonation k1 0 008 min 1 destruction rate constant of phenolic compounds k2 was improved from 0 014 min 1 ordinary microbubble ozonation to 0 025 min 1 o3 feox gac the 60 min pretreatment of pww by o3 feox gac process enhanced bod5 cod ratio from 0 31 to 0 76 and reduced the acute bio toxicity by 79 2 screening and characterization of biological post treatment processes were conducted among activated sludge process asp up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and membrane bioreactor mbr uasb and asp showed limited phenolic compounds removal of 35 4 and 57 0 with lower bio toxicity resistance than mbr 94 9 phenolic compounds removal the combined process o3 feox gac mbr was thus developed and achieved high cod removal 98 0 and phenolic compounds degradation 99 4 pww pretreatment by o3 feox gac process decreased membrane fouling rate of mbr by 88 2 by reducing proteins polysaccharides accumulation in both extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products 16s rrna high throughput sequencing revealed the predominance of phylum proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria and genera mycobacterium gordonia pedomicrobium defluviimonas in biological pww treatment bio systems pearson correlation coefficient and anova analysis verified that mycobacterium possessed high bio toxicity

oxides doped granular activated carbon feox gac membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling microbial characteristics 1 introduction phenol and its derivatives phenolic compounds are extensively utilized as raw materials in various industries such as petrochemical textile pharmaceutical chemical and surfactant industries muñoz sierra et al 2018 villegas et al 2016 phenolic compounds such as phenol bisphenol a chlorophenols and phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds are the most common contaminants in the industrial effluents baransi et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2014 phenolic compounds refer to a group of molecules with at least one benzene ring namely a hydroxyl group bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group they pose acute and chronic hazardous health effects to human and animals mohammadi et al 2014 wang and kannan 2018 in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical wastewater concentration of phenolic compounds can range between 500 2 000 mg l huang et al 2019 international regulatory organizations have established strict discharge standards of phenolic compounds davı and gnudi 1999 wang and kannan 2018 for instance the environmental protection agency u s epa included eleven phenolic compounds which retained hazardous for human health into the federal register list and assigned a maximum admissible concentrations range of 60 400 mg l according to their toxicity environmental protection agency 1984 therefore the treatment of phenolic compounds containing wastewater becomes imperative biological processes bps such as traditional activated sludge process asp up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and membrane bioreactor mbr have been widely recognized as cost effective alternatives for organic compounds removal grandclément et al 2017 kalyuzhnyi et al 1996 mbr is an innovative and attractive bio technology with the advantages of high organic loading high biomass low sludge production and ability to resist extreme environment mutamim et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 existing studies have demonstrated the better organic degradation performance of mbr than asp such as in the treatment of domestic wastewater fenu et al 2010 tannery wastewater munz et al 2008 and the stillage from bio ethanol production plant dereli et al 2014 however membrane fouling has been an inevitable issue when using mbr for industrial wastewater treatment due to the presence of toxic organics and metals membrane fouling could significantly reduce membrane performance and its lifespan resulting in increase of maintenance and operating costs extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp are two major foulants in mbr system they mainly consist of proteins and polysaccharides which promote cake layer formation during membrane fouling huang et al 2019 meng et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that the presence of high concentration toxic substances could cause rapid accumulation of eps and smp to improve the toxicity resistance drews 2010 mutamim et al 2013 these microbial protective mechanism to resist the surge in water toxicity could result in aggravation of membrane fouling mutamim et al 2013 thus adopting a pretreatment process to reduce toxic organics loading and improve the biodegradability would be significant for overall treatment efficiency improvement and membrane fouling mitigation advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven to be effective in recalcitrant organic compounds degradation cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 the aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh to oxidize most organic compounds unselectively besides the complete mineralization of organics aops are also capable of improving biodegradability and reducing bio toxicity by destroying the bio refractory organics de schepper et al 2009 khoufi et al 2006 it has been demonstrated that the combination of bps and aops can be more cost effective comparing to complete mineralization by aops the reason is that the complete mineralization by aops requires a prolonged reaction time which increases the consumption of substantial energy e g ozone generation and uv radiation and chemicals e g oxidants and catalysts cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 hence it is attractive to apply aops as pretreatment processes for the subsequent bps ozone based aops possess the advantages of simple operation procedure and no additional chemicals required cai et al 2020 jothinathan and hu 2018 however conventional bubble 1 mm ozonation processes have drawbacks of high energy consumption due to poor gaseous ozone utilization zheng et al 2015 microbubble 50 μm ozonation obtain the advantages of high internal pressure high interfacial area and long stagnation duration with lower bubble rising speed wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 these distinctive physicochemical properties could enhance ozone mass transfer thereby increasing the ozone utilization rate and promoting organics oxidation in wastewater zheng et al 2015 therefore microbubble ozonation has drawn great attention as an effective modification method of conventional ozonation process wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 nevertheless though efficient organic degradation by microbubble ozonation have been demonstrated tentscher et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 its efficiency on toxicity reduction and biodegradability enhancement as a pretreatment process has not been explored obtaining the advantages of inexpensive easy to get and eco friendly iron oxides feox have been widely utilized for the development of catalysts yan et al 2019a yang et al 2019 zelmanov and semiat 2008 yan et al 2019a explored the catalytic mechanism of fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh in ozonation the results showed that ozone could be electrostatically adsorbed by fe2o3 thereby enhancing the efficiency of ozone decomposition into oh yan et al 2019a whereas fe3o4 and feooh showed different mechanism in which the electronic cycle reactions of fe2 fe3 activated their lewis acid sites and promoted the ozone decomposition into o2 and oh yan et al 2019a jothinathan and hu 2018 utilized graphene oxide as the carrier of fe3o4 for catalytic ozonation process which efficiently enhanced ozone mass transfer and oh generation but the high cost of graphene oxide narrowed its application yan et al 2019b applied the silicon particles as the carrier of fe2o3 fe2o3 was identified as the catalytic sites on the particle surface for the decomposition of ozone into oh but the limited adsorption sites on silicon particles affected the catalytic performance yan et al 2019b it is well known that granular activated carbon gac possess the advantages of high specific surface area high adsorption capacity and low cost the activated carbon could effectively participate in the hydroxyl radicals chain reactions von sonntag 2008 therefore gac could be an ideal carrier of feox for catalytic ozonation additionally the existing study on feox catalyzed ozonation were mainly focused on the disposal of synthetic organic contaminated wastewater jothinathan and hu 2018 yan et al 2019a yan et al 2019b its utilization in industrial wastewater treatment particularly in industrial pww treatment is still unavailable in the literature in this study an iron oxides doped granular activated carbon catalyst feox gac was prepared and applied to catalyze microbubble ozonation o3 feox gac for pww treatment specifically the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the catalytic performance of feox gac on microbubble ozonation in organic removal phenolic compounds degradation and biodegradability improvement of industrial pww and ii feed the pretreated pww into different bps i e asp uasb and mbr to screen out suitable bps for subsequent biological post treatment additionally the influence of o3 feox gac pretreatment on the organic removal performance and membrane fouling characteristics of mbr was explored microbiological characterization based on 16s rrna was also conducted on the bio systems to better understand the impacts of ozonation pretreatment on the performance and robustness of bps in industrial pww treatment 2 materials and

feox gac catalyst and microbubble ozonation batch tests feox gac catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method zhang et al 2018 in which gac was pre treated by washing with 5 hcl for 2 h rinsing with ultrapure water to neutral ph and drying in oven at 100 c for 2 h the pre treated gac samples were impregnated in fecl2 4h2o 0 5 m aqueous solution for 24 hours at room temperature after impregnation the samples were washed by ultrapure water dried at 100 c overnight and then further calcinated at 400 c for 2 h after preparation energy dispersive spectrometry eds and x ray diffraction

were identified as highly correlated correlated and uncorrelated respectively anova was performed to test the significance of correlation analysis p 0 05 p 0 05 0 05 was identified as statistically significant the ibm spss statistics was used for pcc calculation and anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal and phenolic compounds degradation by o3 feox gac different microbubble ozonation processes i e o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac were evaluated for pww pretreatment control experiments were performed by dosing gac and feox gac directly into pww in the absence of o3 evolutions of toc levels and phenolic compounds concentrations are shown in fig 2 adsorption experiments suggested that adsorption with bare gac and feox gac catalyst could both achieve toc and phenol removal efficiencies of less than 10 indicating that in catalytic ozonation process chemical oxidation was the dominant mechanism for organics degradation it was noted that the o3 feox gac process was more efficient in toc and phenolic compounds removal when compared to ozone alone and o3 gac processes o3 feox gac process obtained the highest reaction rate constant k in toc removal of 0 023 min 1 compared to the 0 008 min 1 and 0 013 min 1 of ozone alone and o3 gac processes respectively the k value of phenolic compounds degradation in o3 feox gac 0 025 min 1 process was also much higher than ozone alone 0 014 min 1 and o3 gac 0 017 min 1 processes the previous studies have identified the catalytic activity of graphene carried fe3o4 jothinathan and hu 2018 and silicon carried fe2o3 on ozonation process yan et al 2019b the substrate gac used in this study was more cost effective than graphene oxide and possessed more adsorption sites compared to silicon moreover this present study demonstrated the considerable catalytic performance of feox gac in ozonation process therefore feox gac was suggested as a promising catalyst for ozonation process for pww treatment according to fig 2 a toc rapidly decreased to 680 0 81 1 mg l during the first 60 min in o3 feox gac process with average removal efficiency of 81 2 it was 36 3 and 17 2 higher than ozone alone and o3 gac processes respectively the o3 feox gac process also obtained a rapid degradation of phenolic compounds in the first 60 min with average removal efficiency of 86 3 prolonged reaction time from 60 to 120 min only increased the toc and phenolic compounds removal by 9 7 and 6 5 respectively therefore it was not cost effective to increase the contact time for o3 feox gac process cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 and reaction time of 60 min was selected for o3 feox gac pretreatment process 3 2 biodegradability enhancement and bio toxicity reduction by o3 feox gac the variation of bod5 cod ratio and 15 min acute bio toxicity along different ozonation processes were presented in fig 3 it was found that all ozonation processes effectively improved bod5 cod ratio of pww particularly in the first 60 min treatment the bod5 cod ratio of raw pww was 0 32 fig 3 a at reaction time of 60 min pww treated by o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac processes obtained average bod5 cod ratio of 0 65 0 72 and 0 76 respectively significant decrease of 15 min acute bio toxicity was observed as shown in fig 3 b the average 15 min acute bio toxicity of pww treated by o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac decreased from 33 2 to 13 3 9 0 and 6 9 at reaction time of 60 min respectively thus the bio toxicity was reduced by 59 9 72 9 and 79 2 the pcc and anova analysis showed that the bio toxicity significantly correlated pcc 0 692 p 0 05 0 019 with the phenolic compounds concentration as presented in fig 2 b the results demonstrated that ozone processes reduced the bio toxicity of pww by effective destruction of phenolic compounds comparatively o3 feox gac treated pww obtained a relatively high bod5 cod ratio and low bio toxicity compared to pww treated by o3 and o3 gac at 60 min the 120 min o3 and o3 gac processes obtained comparable bod5 cod ratio improvement and bio toxicity reduction with the 60 min o3 feox gac the results indicated that the application of feox gac catalyst effectively reduced the required reaction time of pretreatment which was significant in energy consumption reduction consequently the 60 min o3 feox gac process was applied to pww pretreatment 3 3 influence of o3 feox gac pretreatment on the biological processes the cod and phenolic compounds removal of different treatment processes are presented in fig 4 in operation phase 1 raw pww was fed directly into mbr the mbr showed limited cod removal with high effluent cod of 727 0 162 6 mg l fig 4 a a low phenolic compounds removal efficiency of 47 8 was also obtained with effluent phenolic compounds concentration of 312 2 49 6 mg l fig 4 b meanwhile according to the results of phase 2 the continuous operation of o3 feox gac reduced the concentration of phenolic compounds to 82 0 19 6 mg l with average removal efficiency of 87 5 at 60 min the results indicated that pretreatment with o3 feox gac process could significantly improve the degradation efficiency of phenolic compounds aforementioned in section 3 1 the o3 feox gac also improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 31 to 0 76 hence o3 feox gac was selected for pww pretreatment before bps in phase 2 60 min o3 feox gac pretreatment reduced cod to 607 3 108 6 mg l with average removal of 81 4 fig 4 a o3 feox gac treated pww was fed to subsequent asp and mbr systems as shown in fig 4 a mbr achieved much higher cod and phenolic compounds removal of 82 6 and 94 9 respectively compared to asp 69 6 and 57 0 respectively meanwhile the phenolic compounds concentration in the effluent of mbr 4 2 3 8 mg l was lower than that of the asp 35 3 10 5 mg l the results confirmed that mbr possessed stronger resistance to extreme environment and fluctuation of organic loading due to high biomass mutamim et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in this study the mbr system following o3 feox gac process possessed mlss of 4 4 0 3 g l meanwhile the asp system following the same pre treatment process had mlss of only 3 1 0 4 g l although the mlss of mbr in this study was lower than the mbr used for domestic wastewater treatment li et al 2015 mitra et al 2016 it was still 41 9 higher than the asp system under the same operating conditions the result was also in accordance with the findings by other researchers meng et al 2017 that mbr could exhibit much better organic degradation performance with stronger bio toxicity resistance than asp in industrial wastewater treatment finally the o3 feox gac asp and o3 feox gac mbr process obtained cod removal of 94 3 and 96 7 with effluent cod of 184 4 45 1 and 105 6 21 2 mg l respectively in phase 3 a uasb system was introduced to treat o3 feox gac treated pww before asp and mbr however the result showed that it only obtained phenolic compounds removal of 35 4 with corresponding average cod removal of 30 9 fig 4 it was noted that anaerobic treatment process had limited capacity of pww treatment and phenolic compounds degradation even with the pretreatment of o3 feox gac after pretreatment with o3 feox gac uasb process the effluent was fed into the asp and mbr system respectively as shown in fig 4 the effluent cod of the asp and mbr were stabled at 113 2 22 9 and 83 9 15 8 mg l respectively the results showed that the overall cod removal efficiency of o3 feox gac uasb asp process 96 5 was comparable to o3 feox gac mbr process 96 7 however the effluent phenolic concentration 18 0 3 2 mg l was still much higher than the o3 feox gac mbr process 4 2 3 8 mg l the o3 feox gac uasb mbr process further improved the cod removal efficiency to 97 5 and reduced the effluent concentrations of phenolic compounds to 2 9 1 8 mg l based on the o3 feox gac mbr process fig 4 however the enhancement was not significant enough to add a uasb system in the process therefore based on the cod removal and phenolic compounds degradation mbr process was selected as the biological system for pww post treatment after o3 feox gac process 3 4 membrane fouling mitigation of mbr by o3 feox gac pretreatment membrane fouling studies were conducted in three mbr systems i mbr receiving raw pww ii mbr of o3 feox gac mbr process and iii mbr of o3 feox gac uasb mbr process the results were illustrated in fig 5 fig 5 a showed that the mbr of o3 feox gac mbr process researched tmp 30 kpa in 160 13 h whereas the mbr receiving raw pww took only 85 7 h the results suggested that membrane fouling cycle was prolonged by 88 2 the observation demonstrated that the pretreatment by o3 feox gac process had significantly mitigated membrane fouling of the mbr treating pww it is worth noting that the pretreatment reduced the accumulation of both eps and smp fig 5 b specifically the specific concentrations of proteins and carbohydrate in eps were reduced by 34 7 from 32 6 2 3 to 21 3 3 4 mg g mlvss and 44 6 from 15 7 2 7 to 8 7 1 3 mg g mlvss respectively the proteins and carbohydrate in smp were reduced by 28 6 7 0 0 5 to 5 0 0 7 mg g mlvss and 35 7 from 8 4 1 2 to 5 4 0 6 mg g mlvss respectively this reduction is considerable comparing to the literature drews 2010 huang et al 2019 the proteins and carbohydrate are the main components of eps and smp which could be adsorbed deposited on membrane surface and aggravate the formation of gel layer and cake layer meng et al 2009 rosenberger et al 2005 the results suggested that membrane fouling was slowed by reducing the accumulation of both eps and smp additionally it has been verified that smp is the one major constituent of gel layer and the specific filtration resistance of gel layer is almost 100 times higher than cake layer huang et al 2019 some extreme conditions such as the presence of toxic organics and heavy metals and high salinity stress could induce bacteria to secrete smp and eps raynaud et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 proved that the microorganisms would secrete more smp and eps as a self defense mechanism under the presence of toxic compounds in this study the pretreatment by o3 feox gac process degraded 87 5 of the phenolic compounds thereby reducing the toxicity of pww by 79 2 the reduction of phenolic compounds concentration and bio toxicity decreased the accumulation of eps and smp in the mbr of the combined o3 feox gac mbr process it significantly reduced the membrane fouling of mbr in the mbr of o3 feox gac uasb mbr process the accumulation of protein and carbohydrate in eps and smp slightly decreased when compared to the mbr in o3 feox gac mbr process fig 5 b a membrane fouling cycle of 186 7 h was obtained which is only 16 3 higher than that of the o3 feox gac mbr process fig 5 a this result could be attributed to the limited cod and phenolic compounds reduction capacity of uasb fig 4 consequently based on the results of batch studies on phenolic compounds removal biodegradability enhancement and the performance of bps on organics removal and membrane fouling the o3 feox gac and mbr combined process was selected as the most effective and suitable technology for pww treatment 3 5 factors affecting mbr of the o3 feox gac mbr process the influences of hrt do ph and nutrients dosages on the mbr system of o3 feox gac mbr process were presented in fig 6 the decrease of hrt from 12 5 h to 10 h remarkably increased effluent cod to 133 8 13 4 mg l however prolonging the hrt to 15 h showed limited further improvement on cod removal hence 12 5 h was chosen as the optimal hrt for mbr process subsequently the increase of do from 4 5 5 5 to 5 5 6 5 mg l significantly improved cod removal by 7 4 but further increase of do to 6 5 7 5 mg l did not obviously enhance cod removal considering the energy consumption of aeration optimal do of 5 5 6 5 mg l was selected as the raw pww had a high ph of 8 9 9 5 and it was barely changed after ozonation process ph adjustment is needed for the mbr influent fig 6 c showed that ph adjustment to 8 0 8 5 and 7 0 7 5 increased cod removal by 2 0 and 2 3 respectively the result indicated that the ph adjustment from 9 5 to 7 0 benefited biological organic degradation but the improvement was not obvious because most of the residual organics in the effluent were non biodegradable organics however as table s2 supplementary information showed membrane fouling cycle 207 10 h was increase by 29 4 when ph was around 8 0 8 5 consequently 8 0 8 5 was determined as the optimal ph it was suggested that 5 mg l nitrogen n and 1 mg l phosphorus p are required for microorganisms to metabolize 100 mg c l organic carbon hamza et al 2019 whereas only 0 8 mg l tn and 0 2 mg l tp were present in the raw pww external n nh4cl and p kh2po4 were added to reach a balanced nutrient condition in mbr for microorganism to remove organic pollutants as fig 6 d illustrated nutrient addition at dosage of 10 mg n l 2 mg p l and 15 mg n l 3 mg p l significantly decreased the effluent cod of mbr at the dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l the average cod removal was increased from 84 5 to 89 1 and the effluent cod was reduced to 67 2 11 2 mg l as shown in fig s4 the addition of external nutrients increased mlss mlvss as well the mlvss mlss ratio of mbr at the dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l mlss was increased from 4 4 0 3 to 5 6 0 5 g l and the mlvss mlss ratio was increased from 0 27 0 02 to 0 38 0 04 g l fig s4 the results indicated that the addition of nutrients promoted microorganism growth in mbr for pww treatment when continuous increasing the dosage to 20 mg n l 4 mg p l no obvious decrease of effluent cod was observed 64 4 7 7 mg l hence 15 mg n l 3 mg p l was chosen as the optimal nutrients dosage in general hrt of 12 5 h do of 5 5 6 5 mg l ph of 8 0 8 5 and nutrient dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l were selected as the optimal operation conditions for mbr after o3 feox gac mbr process the effluent cod was further reduced from 105 6 21 2 mg l to 67 2 11 2 mg l under optimal conditions o3 feox gac mbr process achieved overall cod and phenolic compounds removal of 98 0 and 99 4 respectively 3 6 microbial characterization relatively high alpha diversity estimators i e chao ace simpson and shannon were obtained with coverage of over 0 997 table s3 suggesting that the sequencing results were sufficient for microbial characterization as shown in fig 7 the pca explained pc1 of 57 3 and pc2 of 18 5 all the samples were found far away from the ias indicating that the microbial communities shifted when industrial pww was fed the samples r m o m o u m and o a o u a were closely clustered respectively fig 7 microbial community constituents at phylum class and genus levels were presented in fig 8 a b proteobacteria 24 1 and firmicutes 23 8 comprised the highest percentages at the phylum level in ias in the mbr and asp systems the abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased to 36 7 65 9 with the enrichment of class alphaproteobacteria to 28 4 53 1 meanwhile the uasb was dominated by the anaerobic class bacilli which was comprised by phylum firmicutes it is worth noticing that phylum acidobacteria was significantly enriched in the mbr systems samples r m o m and o u m fig 8 b suggested that the enrichment of phylum acidobacteria was attributed to the increase of class acidobacteria in r m 30 5 o m 42 17 and o u m 31 6 previous studies also reported the dominance of classes alphaproteobacteria and acidobacteria in biological industrial wastewater treatment systems kragelund 2006 zhu et al 2013 hierarchical heat map on genomic dna according to 16s rrna hts was structured with r code according to fig 8 c the dominant genera significantly changed in the pww treatment systems compared to ias in the ias genera enterococcus otu687 9 9 and hydrogenophaga otu826 6 4 were dominant in the mbr and asp systems their abundances decreased to 0 0 1 and 0 1 2 2 respectively suggesting that the bio toxicity of pww inhibited their growth the abundances of genera mycobacterium otu91 238 and gordonia otu1364 in the mbr systems samples r m o m and o u m increased to 15 7 24 0 and 3 1 6 1 respectively whereas the asps showed significant increase in the abundances of genera pedomicrobium otu16 290 9 2 10 7 and defluviimonas otu1498 8 7 8 9 the results indicated that mycobacterium gordonia pedomicrobium and defluviimonas possessed higher bio toxicity resistance to pww these bacteria also might be related to the biodegradation of phenolic compounds in previous studies genera mycobacterium and gordonia were proven to be functional in the bio degradation of isoprene johnston et al 2017 anthracene pyrene mutnuri et al 2005 and the bio desulfurization of dibenzothiophene akhtar et al 2016 the genera pedomicrobium and defluviimonas were reported to be abundant in municipal wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2016 high salinity wastewater treatment systems hong et al 2013 and atrazine contaminated wastewater treatment systems satsuma 2009 in this study the correlations of dominant microbes with phenolic compounds removal were evaluated by pcc and anova according to the results presented in fig 9 genus hydrogenophaga was negatively correlated with initial phenolic compounds concentration pcc 0 43 p 0 05 0 044 suggesting that its growth was inhibited by pww the genus mycobacterium exhibited significantly positive correlation pcc 0 52 p 0 05 0 032 with initial phenolic compounds concentration and significantly high correlation pcc 0 76 p 0 05 0 011 with phenolic compounds removal gordonia showed positive correlation with phenolic compounds removal pcc 0 47 but this correlation was not significant p 0 05 0 053 moreover genera pedomicrobium and defluviimonas were not correlated to phenolic compounds removal based on the above discussion the genus mycobacterium consisting 24 0 of the total sequences exhibited high toxicity resistance and was proven to be the main contributor for biodegradation of phenolic compounds during pww treatment 4 conclusions catalytic microbubble ozonation and biological processes bps were combined for industrial phenolic wastewater pww treatment an iron oxides doped granular activated carbon catalyst feox gac was prepared and applied to catalyze microbubble ozonation o3 feox gac the o3 feox gac process obtained a much higher reaction rate constant k 0 023 min 1 on toc removal than microbubble ozonation k 0 008 min 1 and gac catalyzed microbubble ozonation o3 gac k 0 013 min 1 degradation rate of phenolic compounds in o3 feox gac was also improved with degradation rate constant k 2 of 0 025 min 1 compared to microbubble ozonation k 2 0 014 min 1 60 min pww pretreatment by o3 feox gac process improved bod5 cod ratio by 0 45 and reduced 15 min acute bio toxicity of pww by 79 2 mbr exhibited much higher phenolic compounds removal of 94 9 than uasb 35 4 and asp 57 0 with stronger bio toxicity resistance the pretreatment of pww by o3 feox gac extended membrane fouling cycle of mbr by 88 2 through reducing the accumulation of eps and smp optimal hrt do ph and nutrients dosage of 12 5 h 5 5 6 5 mg l 8 0 8 5 and 15 mg n l 3 mg p l were obtained the developed o3 feox gac mbr process achieved overall cod and phenolic compounds removal of 98 0 and 99 4 phylum proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria and

17247,phenolic compounds are common ccontaminants in industrial effluents in this study a combined catalytic microbubble ozonation and biological process was developed and applied for efficient industrial phenolic wastewater pww treatment catalytic activity of an iron oxides feox doped granular activated carbon gac catalyst feox gac in microbubble ozonation for pww treatment was investigated

catalyzed microbubble ozonation o3 gac k1 0 013 min 1 and ordinary microbubble ozonation k1 0 008 min 1 destruction rate constant of phenolic compounds k2 was improved from 0 014 min 1 ordinary microbubble ozonation to 0 025 min 1 o3 feox gac the 60 min pretreatment of pww by o3 feox gac process enhanced bod5 cod ratio from 0 31 to 0 76 and reduced the acute bio toxicity by 79 2 screening and characterization of biological post treatment processes were conducted among activated sludge process asp up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and membrane bioreactor mbr uasb and asp showed limited phenolic compounds removal of 35 4 and 57 0 with lower bio toxicity resistance than mbr 94 9 phenolic compounds removal the combined process o3 feox gac mbr was thus developed and achieved high cod removal 98 0 and phenolic compounds degradation 99 4 pww pretreatment by o3 feox gac process decreased membrane fouling rate of mbr by 88 2 by reducing proteins polysaccharides accumulation in both extracellular polymeric substances and soluble microbial products 16s rrna high throughput sequencing revealed the predominance of phylum proteobacteria class alphaproteobacteria and genera

oxides doped granular activated carbon feox gac membrane bioreactor mbr membrane fouling microbial characteristics 1 introduction phenol and its derivatives phenolic compounds are extensively utilized as raw materials in various industries such as petrochemical textile pharmaceutical chemical and surfactant industries muñoz sierra et al 2018 villegas et al 2016 phenolic compounds such as phenol bisphenol a chlorophenols and phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds are the most common contaminants in the industrial effluents baransi et al 2012 mohammadi et al 2014 phenolic compounds refer to a group of molecules with at least one benzene ring namely a hydroxyl group bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group they pose acute and chronic hazardous health effects to human and animals mohammadi et al 2014 wang and kannan 2018 in the petrochemical and pharmaceutical wastewater concentration of phenolic compounds can range between 500 2 000 mg l huang et al 2019 international regulatory organizations have established strict discharge standards of phenolic compounds davı and gnudi 1999 wang and kannan 2018 for instance the environmental protection agency u s epa included eleven phenolic compounds which retained hazardous for human health into the federal register list and assigned a maximum admissible concentrations range of 60 400 mg l according to their toxicity environmental protection agency 1984 therefore the treatment of phenolic compounds containing wastewater becomes imperative biological processes bps such as traditional activated sludge process asp up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb and membrane bioreactor mbr have been widely recognized as cost effective alternatives for organic compounds removal grandclément et al 2017 kalyuzhnyi et al 1996 mbr is an innovative and attractive bio technology with the advantages of high organic loading high biomass low sludge production and ability to resist extreme environment mutamim et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 existing studies have demonstrated the better organic degradation performance of mbr than asp such as in the treatment of domestic wastewater fenu et al 2010 tannery wastewater munz et al 2008 and the stillage from bio ethanol production plant dereli et al 2014 however membrane fouling has been an inevitable issue when using mbr for industrial wastewater treatment due to the presence of toxic organics and metals membrane fouling could significantly reduce membrane performance and its lifespan resulting in increase of maintenance and operating costs extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp are two major foulants in mbr system they mainly consist of proteins and polysaccharides which promote cake layer formation during membrane fouling huang et al 2019 meng et al 2009 several studies have demonstrated that the presence of high concentration toxic substances could cause rapid accumulation of eps and smp to improve the toxicity resistance drews 2010 mutamim et al 2013 these microbial protective mechanism to resist the surge in water toxicity could result in aggravation of membrane fouling mutamim et al 2013 thus adopting a pretreatment process to reduce toxic organics loading and improve the biodegradability would be significant for overall treatment efficiency improvement and membrane fouling mitigation advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven to be effective in recalcitrant organic compounds degradation cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 the aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh to oxidize most organic compounds unselectively besides the complete mineralization of organics aops are also capable of improving biodegradability and reducing bio toxicity by destroying the bio refractory organics de schepper et al 2009 khoufi et al 2006 it has been demonstrated that the combination of bps and aops can be more cost effective comparing to complete mineralization by aops the reason is that the complete mineralization by aops requires a prolonged reaction time which increases the consumption of substantial energy e g ozone generation and uv radiation and chemicals e g oxidants and catalysts cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 hence it is attractive to apply aops as pretreatment processes for the subsequent bps ozone based aops possess the advantages of simple operation procedure and no additional chemicals required cai et al 2020 jothinathan and hu 2018 however conventional bubble 1 mm ozonation processes have drawbacks of high energy consumption due to poor gaseous ozone utilization zheng et al 2015 microbubble 50 μm ozonation obtain the advantages of high internal pressure high interfacial area and long stagnation duration with lower bubble rising speed wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 these distinctive physicochemical properties could enhance ozone mass transfer thereby increasing the ozone utilization rate and promoting organics oxidation in wastewater zheng et al 2015 therefore microbubble ozonation has drawn great attention as an effective modification method of conventional ozonation process wu et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 nevertheless though efficient organic degradation by microbubble ozonation have been demonstrated tentscher et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 its efficiency on toxicity reduction and biodegradability enhancement as a pretreatment process has not been explored obtaining the advantages of inexpensive easy to get and eco friendly iron oxides feox have been widely utilized for the development of catalysts yan et al 2019a yang et al 2019 zelmanov and semiat 2008 yan et al 2019a explored the catalytic mechanism of fe2o3 fe3o4 and feooh in ozonation the results showed that ozone could be electrostatically adsorbed by fe2o3 thereby enhancing the efficiency of ozone decomposition into oh yan et al 2019a whereas fe3o4 and feooh showed different mechanism in which the electronic cycle reactions of fe2 fe3 activated their lewis acid sites and promoted the ozone decomposition into o2 and oh yan et al 2019a jothinathan and hu 2018 utilized graphene oxide as the carrier of fe3o4 for catalytic ozonation process which efficiently enhanced ozone mass transfer and oh generation but the high cost of graphene oxide narrowed its application yan et al 2019b applied the silicon particles as the carrier of fe2o3 fe2o3 was identified as the catalytic sites on the particle surface for the decomposition of ozone into oh but the limited adsorption sites on silicon particles affected the catalytic performance yan et al 2019b it is well known that granular activated carbon gac possess the advantages of high specific surface area high adsorption capacity and low cost the activated carbon could effectively participate in the hydroxyl radicals chain reactions von sonntag 2008 therefore gac could be an ideal carrier of feox for catalytic ozonation additionally the existing study on feox catalyzed ozonation were mainly focused on the disposal of synthetic organic contaminated wastewater jothinathan and hu 2018 yan et al 2019a yan et al 2019b its utilization in industrial wastewater treatment particularly in industrial pww treatment is still unavailable in the literature in this study an iron oxides doped granular activated carbon catalyst feox gac was prepared and applied to catalyze microbubble

significant the ibm spss statistics was used for pcc calculation and anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal and phenolic compounds degradation by o3 feox gac different microbubble ozonation processes i e o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac were evaluated for pww pretreatment control experiments were performed by dosing gac and feox gac directly into pww in the absence of o3 evolutions of toc levels and phenolic compounds concentrations are shown in fig 2 adsorption experiments suggested that adsorption with bare gac and feox gac catalyst could both achieve toc and phenol removal efficiencies of less than 10 indicating that in catalytic ozonation process chemical oxidation was the dominant mechanism for organics degradation it was noted that the o3 feox gac process was more efficient in toc and phenolic compounds removal when compared to ozone alone and o3 gac processes o3 feox gac process obtained the highest reaction rate constant k in toc removal of 0 023 min 1 compared to the 0 008 min 1 and 0 013 min 1 of ozone alone and o3 gac processes respectively the k value of phenolic compounds degradation in o3 feox gac 0 025 min 1 process was also much higher than ozone alone 0 014 min 1 and o3 gac 0 017 min 1 processes the previous studies have identified the catalytic activity of graphene carried fe3o4 jothinathan and hu 2018 and silicon carried fe2o3 on ozonation process yan et al 2019b the substrate gac used in this study was more cost effective than graphene oxide and possessed more adsorption sites compared to silicon moreover this present study demonstrated the considerable catalytic performance of feox gac in ozonation process therefore feox gac was suggested as a promising catalyst for ozonation process for pww treatment according to fig 2 a toc rapidly decreased to 680 0 81 1 mg l during the first 60 min in o3 feox gac process with average removal efficiency of 81 2 it was 36 3 and 17 2 higher than ozone alone and o3 gac processes respectively the o3 feox gac process also obtained a rapid degradation of phenolic compounds in the first 60 min with average removal efficiency of 86 3 prolonged reaction time from 60 to 120 min only increased the toc and phenolic compounds removal by 9 7 and 6 5 respectively therefore it was not cost effective to increase the contact time for o3 feox gac process cai et al 2020 li et al 2017 and reaction time of 60 min was selected for o3 feox gac pretreatment process 3 2 biodegradability enhancement and bio toxicity reduction by o3 feox gac the variation of bod5 cod ratio and 15 min acute bio toxicity along different ozonation processes were presented in fig 3 it was found that all ozonation processes effectively improved bod5 cod ratio of pww particularly in the first 60 min treatment the bod5 cod ratio of raw pww was 0 32 fig 3 a at reaction time of 60 min pww treated by o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac processes obtained average bod5 cod ratio of 0 65 0 72 and 0 76 respectively significant decrease of 15 min acute bio toxicity was observed as shown in fig 3 b the average 15 min acute bio toxicity of pww treated by o3 o3 gac and o3 feox gac decreased from 33 2 to 13 3 9 0 and 6 9 at reaction time of 60 min respectively thus the bio toxicity was reduced by 59 9 72 9 and 79 2 the pcc and anova analysis showed that the bio toxicity significantly correlated pcc 0 692 p 0 05 0 019 with the phenolic compounds concentration as presented in fig 2 b the results demonstrated that ozone processes reduced the bio toxicity of pww by effective destruction of phenolic compounds comparatively o3 feox gac treated pww obtained a relatively high bod5 cod ratio and low bio toxicity compared to pww treated by o3 and o3 gac at 60 min the 120 min o3 and o3 gac processes obtained comparable bod5 cod ratio improvement and bio toxicity reduction with the 60 min o3 feox gac the results indicated that the application of feox gac catalyst effectively reduced the required reaction time of pretreatment which was significant in energy consumption reduction consequently the 60 min o3 feox gac process was applied to pww pretreatment 3 3 influence of o3 feox gac pretreatment on the biological processes the cod and phenolic compounds removal of different treatment processes are presented in fig 4 in operation phase 1 raw pww was fed directly into mbr the mbr showed limited cod removal with high effluent cod of 727 0 162 6 mg l fig 4 a a low phenolic compounds removal efficiency of 47 8 was also obtained with effluent phenolic compounds concentration of 312 2 49 6 mg l fig 4 b meanwhile according to the results of phase 2 the continuous operation of o3 feox gac reduced the concentration of phenolic compounds to 82 0 19 6 mg l with average removal efficiency of 87 5 at 60 min the results indicated that pretreatment with o3 feox gac process could significantly improve the degradation efficiency of phenolic compounds aforementioned in section 3 1 the o3 feox gac also improved the bod5 cod ratio from 0 31 to 0 76 hence o3 feox gac was selected for pww pretreatment before bps in phase 2 60 min o3 feox gac pretreatment reduced cod to 607 3 108 6 mg l with average removal of 81 4 fig 4 a o3 feox gac treated pww was fed to subsequent asp and mbr systems as shown in fig 4 a mbr achieved much higher cod and phenolic compounds removal of 82 6 and 94 9 respectively compared to asp 69 6 and 57 0 respectively meanwhile the phenolic compounds concentration in the effluent of mbr 4 2 3 8 mg l was lower than that of the asp 35 3 10 5 mg l the results confirmed that mbr possessed stronger resistance to extreme environment and fluctuation of organic loading due to high biomass mutamim et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in this study the mbr system following o3 feox gac process possessed mlss of 4 4 0 3 g l meanwhile the asp system following the same pre treatment process had mlss of only 3 1 0 4 g l although the mlss of mbr in this study was lower than the mbr used for domestic wastewater treatment li et al 2015 mitra et al 2016 it was still 41 9 higher than the asp system under the same operating conditions the result was also in accordance with the findings by other researchers meng et al 2017 that mbr could exhibit much better organic degradation performance with stronger bio toxicity resistance than asp in industrial wastewater treatment finally the o3 feox gac asp and o3 feox gac mbr process obtained cod removal of 94 3 and 96 7 with effluent cod of 184 4 45 1 and 105 6 21 2 mg l respectively in phase 3 a uasb system was introduced to treat o3 feox gac treated pww before asp and mbr however the result showed that it only obtained phenolic compounds removal of 35 4 with corresponding average cod removal of 30 9 fig 4 it was noted that anaerobic treatment process had limited capacity of pww treatment and phenolic compounds degradation even with the pretreatment of o3 feox gac after pretreatment with o3 feox gac uasb process the effluent was fed into the asp and mbr system respectively as shown in fig 4 the effluent cod of the asp and mbr were stabled at 113 2 22 9 and 83 9 15 8 mg l respectively the results showed that the overall cod removal efficiency of o3 feox gac uasb asp process 96 5 was comparable to o3 feox gac mbr process 96 7 however the effluent phenolic concentration 18 0 3 2 mg l was still much higher than the o3 feox gac mbr process 4 2 3 8 mg l the o3 feox gac uasb mbr process further improved the cod removal efficiency to 97 5 and reduced the effluent concentrations of phenolic compounds to 2 9 1 8 mg l based on the o3 feox gac mbr process fig 4 however the enhancement was not significant enough to add a uasb system in the process therefore based on the cod removal and phenolic compounds degradation mbr process was selected as the biological system for pww post treatment after o3 feox gac process 3 4 membrane fouling mitigation of mbr by o3 feox gac pretreatment membrane fouling studies were conducted in three mbr systems i mbr receiving raw pww ii mbr of o3 feox gac mbr process and iii mbr of o3 feox gac uasb mbr process the results were illustrated in fig 5 fig 5 a showed that the mbr of o3 feox gac mbr process researched tmp 30 kpa in 160 13 h whereas the mbr receiving raw pww took only 85 7 h the results suggested that membrane fouling cycle was prolonged by 88 2 the observation demonstrated that the pretreatment by o3 feox gac process had significantly mitigated membrane fouling of the mbr treating pww it is worth noting that the pretreatment reduced the accumulation of both eps and smp fig 5 b specifically the specific concentrations of proteins and carbohydrate in eps were reduced by 34 7 from 32 6 2 3 to 21 3 3 4 mg g mlvss and 44 6 from 15 7 2 7 to 8 7 1 3 mg g mlvss respectively the proteins and carbohydrate in smp were reduced by 28 6 7 0 0 5 to 5 0 0 7 mg g mlvss and 35 7 from 8 4 1 2 to 5 4 0 6 mg g mlvss respectively this reduction is considerable comparing to the literature drews 2010 huang et al 2019 the proteins and carbohydrate are the main components of eps and smp which could be adsorbed deposited on membrane surface and aggravate the formation of gel layer and cake layer meng et al 2009 rosenberger et al 2005 the results suggested that membrane fouling was slowed by reducing the accumulation of both eps and smp additionally it has been verified that smp is the one major constituent of gel layer and the specific filtration resistance of gel layer is almost 100 times higher than cake layer huang et al 2019 some extreme conditions such as the presence of toxic organics and heavy metals and high salinity stress could induce bacteria to secrete smp and eps raynaud et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 proved that the microorganisms would secrete more smp and eps as a self defense mechanism under the presence of toxic compounds in this study the pretreatment by o3 feox gac process degraded 87 5 of the phenolic compounds thereby reducing the toxicity of pww by 79 2 the reduction of phenolic compounds concentration and bio toxicity decreased the accumulation of eps and smp in the mbr of the combined o3 feox gac mbr process it significantly reduced the membrane fouling of mbr in the mbr of o3 feox gac uasb mbr process the accumulation of protein and carbohydrate in eps and smp slightly decreased when compared to the mbr in o3 feox gac mbr process fig 5 b a membrane fouling cycle of 186 7 h was obtained which is only 16 3 higher than that of the o3 feox gac mbr process fig 5 a this result could be attributed to the limited cod and phenolic compounds reduction capacity of uasb fig 4 consequently based on the results of batch studies on phenolic compounds removal biodegradability enhancement and the performance of bps on organics removal and membrane fouling the o3 feox gac and mbr combined process was selected as the most effective and suitable technology for pww treatment 3 5 factors affecting mbr of the o3 feox gac mbr process the influences of hrt do ph and nutrients dosages on the mbr system of o3 feox gac mbr process were presented in fig 6 the decrease of hrt from 12 5 h to 10 h remarkably increased effluent cod to 133 8 13 4 mg l however prolonging the hrt to 15 h showed limited further improvement on cod removal hence 12 5 h was chosen as the optimal hrt for mbr process subsequently the increase of do from 4 5 5 5 to 5 5 6 5 mg l significantly improved cod removal by 7 4 but further increase of do to 6 5 7 5 mg l did not obviously enhance cod removal considering the energy consumption of aeration optimal do of 5 5 6 5 mg l was selected as the raw pww had a high ph of 8 9 9 5 and it was barely changed after ozonation process ph adjustment is needed for the mbr influent fig 6 c showed that ph adjustment to 8 0 8 5 and 7 0 7 5 increased cod removal by 2 0 and 2 3 respectively the result indicated that the ph adjustment from 9 5 to 7 0 benefited biological organic degradation but the improvement was not obvious because most of the residual organics in the effluent were non biodegradable organics however as table s2 supplementary information showed membrane fouling cycle 207 10 h was increase by 29 4 when ph was around 8 0 8 5 consequently 8 0 8 5 was determined as the optimal ph it was suggested that 5 mg l nitrogen n and 1 mg l phosphorus p are required for microorganisms to metabolize 100 mg c l organic carbon hamza et al 2019 whereas only 0 8 mg l tn and 0 2 mg l tp were present in the raw pww external n nh4cl and p kh2po4 were added to reach a balanced nutrient condition in mbr for microorganism to remove organic pollutants as fig 6 d illustrated nutrient addition at dosage of 10 mg n l 2 mg p l and 15 mg n l 3 mg p l significantly decreased the effluent cod of mbr at the dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l the average cod removal was increased from 84 5 to 89 1 and the effluent cod was reduced to 67 2 11 2 mg l as shown in fig s4 the addition of external nutrients increased mlss mlvss as well the mlvss mlss ratio of mbr at the dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l mlss was increased from 4 4 0 3 to 5 6 0 5 g l and the mlvss mlss ratio was increased from 0 27 0 02 to 0 38 0 04 g l fig s4 the results indicated that the addition of nutrients promoted microorganism growth in mbr for pww treatment when continuous increasing the dosage to 20 mg n l 4 mg p l no obvious decrease of effluent cod was observed 64 4 7 7 mg l hence 15 mg n l 3 mg p l was chosen as the optimal nutrients dosage in general hrt of 12 5 h do of 5 5 6 5 mg l ph of 8 0 8 5 and nutrient dosage of 15 mg n l 3 mg p l were selected as the optimal operation conditions for mbr after o3 feox gac mbr process the effluent cod was further reduced from 105 6 21 2 mg l to 67 2 11 2 mg l under optimal conditions o3 feox gac mbr process achieved overall cod and phenolic compounds removal of 98 0 and 99 4 respectively 3 6 microbial characterization relatively high alpha diversity estimators i e chao ace simpson and shannon were obtained with coverage of over 0 997 table s3 suggesting that the sequencing results were sufficient for microbial characterization as shown in fig 7 the pca explained pc1 of 57 3 and pc2 of 18 5 all the samples were found far away from the ias indicating that the microbial communities shifted when industrial pww was fed the samples r m o m o u m and o a o u a were closely clustered respectively fig 7 microbial community constituents at phylum class and genus levels were presented in fig 8 a b proteobacteria 24 1 and firmicutes 23 8 comprised the highest percentages at the phylum level in ias in the mbr and asp systems the abundance of phylum proteobacteria increased to 36 7 65 9 with the enrichment of class alphaproteobacteria to 28 4 53 1 meanwhile the uasb was dominated by the anaerobic class bacilli which was comprised by phylum firmicutes it is worth noticing that phylum acidobacteria was significantly enriched in the mbr systems samples r m o m and o u m fig 8 b suggested that the enrichment of phylum acidobacteria was attributed to the increase of class acidobacteria in r m 30 5 o m 42 17 and o u m 31 6 previous studies also reported the dominance of classes alphaproteobacteria and acidobacteria in biological industrial wastewater treatment systems kragelund 2006 zhu et al 2013 hierarchical heat map on genomic dna according to 16s rrna hts was structured with r code according to fig 8 c the dominant genera significantly changed in the pww treatment systems compared to ias in the ias genera enterococcus otu687 9 9 and hydrogenophaga otu826 6 4 were dominant in the mbr and asp systems their abundances decreased to 0 0 1 and 0 1 2 2 respectively suggesting that the bio toxicity of pww inhibited their growth the abundances of genera mycobacterium otu91 238 and gordonia otu1364 in the mbr systems samples r m o m and o u m increased to 15 7 24 0 and 3 1 6 1 respectively whereas the asps showed significant increase in the abundances of genera pedomicrobium otu16 290 9 2 10 7 and defluviimonas otu1498 8 7 8 9 the results indicated that mycobacterium gordonia pedomicrobium and defluviimonas possessed higher bio toxicity resistance to pww these bacteria also might be related to the biodegradation of phenolic compounds in previous studies genera mycobacterium and gordonia were proven to be functional in the bio degradation of isoprene johnston et al 2017 anthracene pyrene mutnuri et al 2005 and the bio desulfurization of dibenzothiophene akhtar et al 2016 the genera pedomicrobium and defluviimonas were reported to be abundant in municipal wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2016 high salinity wastewater treatment systems hong et al 2013 and atrazine contaminated wastewater treatment systems satsuma 2009 in this study the correlations of dominant microbes with phenolic compounds removal were evaluated by pcc and anova according to the results presented in fig 9 genus hydrogenophaga was negatively correlated with initial phenolic compounds concentration pcc 0 43 p 0 05 0 044 suggesting that its growth was inhibited by pww the genus mycobacterium exhibited significantly positive correlation pcc 0 52 p 0 05 0 032 with initial phenolic compounds concentration and significantly high correlation pcc 0 76 p 0 05 0 011 with phenolic

17248,cationic polyacrylamide cpam is a widely used flocculant to dewater sewage sludge ss for high solids anaerobic digestion ad and its degradation is crucial since it would release toxic acrylamide am once entering environment hydrothermal treatment htt is an efficient method to enhance the ad efficiency of ss however the effects of cpam on ad of ss and the degradation of cpam during htt ad process have not be studied the study showed cpam at 20 mg g ts increased methane yield of ss from 127 0 to 138 9 ml ch4 g ts in htt ad process and the biodegradability of cpam was 76 3 which was much higher than that 7 4 without htt in htt ad process the enrichment of certain microbes e g gelria sp was observed which might be related with cpam degradation htt decreased the molecular weight mw of cpam and resulted in the production of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium ammonia trimethylamine and ethanol methane potential tests of the main htt products also showed they were easily to be degraded overall htt ad integrated process was an efficient method to reduce environmental risk of cpam as well as increase energy output biogas and the study also provided insights into the degradation mechanism of cpam during htt graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words cationic polyacrylamide sewage sludge hydrothermal treatment anaerobic digestion decomposition mechanism 1 introduction large amounts of sewage sludge ss are produced every year during the treatment of municipal wastewater the treatment of ss is necessary in order to reduce the volumes and the associated health problems appels et al 2008 anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to stabilize ss and produce energy in the form of biogas carrere et al 2010 and at the same time high solid ad ts 8 process could reduce reactor volume and lower energy consumption duan et al 2012 chemical additives e g flocculating and coagulant agents were added to sludge to improve the dewaterability of ss before subsequent processing e g high solid ad of ss the additives were concentrated into ss biosolids accompanied by microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances and the minerals wang et al 2018 polyacrylamide pam as a flocculant in water treatment and sludge dewatering is widely used the term polyacrylamide is loosely used to describe any polymer with acrylamide present as one of the monomers pam can have various charges e g anionic apam cationic cpam or neutral npam which enhance their versatility chu et al 2003 cationic polyacrylamide cpam is very effective at flocculating negatively charged solids suspending in wastewater haveroen et al 2005 typical cpam level in ss is in the range of 2 5 10 mg g total solid ts wang et al 2018 however cpam concentrated into ss might result in serious environmental risks the significant accumulation of acrylamide am the monomer of pam was observed during biodegradation of pam in a previous study dai et al 2015 am is a known neurotoxin and a potential carcinogen xiong et al 2018 and many countries have already forbidden or restricted 1 mg l the application of pam in drinking water lapointe and barbeau 2017 therefore the significant level of cpam in ss may pollute the soil and groundwater if not properly treated the degradation mechanism especially by considering the positive charge structure of cpam in ss has not been extensively studied dai et al 2015 wang et al 2018 it was reported that pam in ss could be used as carbon and nitrogen sources during the anaerobic process dai et al 2015 haveroen et al showed the amide group could serve as a nitrogen source for microorganisms while the carbon backbone of pam polymers was unlikely to be cleaved by microbial activity haveroen et al 2005 in a review article in 2002 caulfield et al concluded high molecular weight mw pam was hard to undergo biodegradation and there was no result showing the formation of am caulfield et al 2002 kay shoemake et al also found that there were biological enzymes capable of hydrolyzing amide to form nh3 and coo groups which avoid the production of am kay shoemake et al 1998 conversely a recent study drawn a very different conclusion as they found that around 46 of cpam had been degraded through ad and am was one of the main degradation metabolites wang et al 2018 moreover controversial results were reported with respect to the details of how cpam affects ad of ss wang et al revealed the presence of cpam deteriorated the process of ad by restraining sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes and thus severely decreased methane yield from 139 1 ml ch4 g of volatile suspended vss without cpam to 86 7 ml g vss at cpam level 12 g kg total suspended solids tss wang et al 2018 they also concluded the degradation products am acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid pa of cpam significantly affected methane yield however chu et al concluded npam and apam dosed at the range of 0 15 g kg dried solids ds as well as cpam at the range of 0 5 g kg ds had no inhibition on methane yields but cpam would hinder the ad process if ss were flocculated to a higher dosage 15 g kg ds particle aggregation with greater floc size with high concentration of cpam 15 g kg ds could prohibit efficient mass exchange movement and hinder the subsequent hydrolysis to produce methane chu et al 2003 hydrolysis is the limiting step during ad of ss and therefore mechanical chemical and thermal pretreatments were used to shorten retention time and increase degradation efficiency appels et al 2008 burger and parker 2013 hydrothermal treatment htt carried out at certain temperature and pressure was shown to effectively destruct organic wastes and increase the biodegradability of ad suarez iglesias et al 2017 yousefifar et al 2017 htt at 170 c was concluded to be an appropriate condition and widely used in full scale biogas plants treating ss appels et al 2008 chen et al 2019 cpam is synthesized by the copolymerization of am and cationic monomers wu et al 2020 these cationic polymers vary in chemical structure and some may be more susceptible to biotic degradation than others chang et al 2005 unfortunately there is no literature systematically analyzing the effects of cpam on ad of ss by referring to the structure of cpam especially after htt pretreatment based on the above considerations this study aimed to investigate the degradation behavior of cpam and its effects on ad of ss during htt ad processes the influence of cpam on methane yield of ss with and without htt was explored and the microorganisms relating with the degradation of cpam were analyzed furthermore cpam solutions before and after htt were characterized to provide a comprehensive analysis of the degradation of cpam in htt process the main htt products were also used for methane potential tests and finally detailed molecular degradation mechanism of cpam during htt ad process was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 cpam and ss preparation with different cpam levels a typical structure of cpam poly acrylamide co n n n trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy dac with mw 8000 kda was used chengdu aikeda chemical reagent co ltd in the present study figure 1 charge density of the cpam was 50 the ratio of m to m n ss without adding cpam was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant in shanghai the sludge was concentrated by settling at 4 c for 14h screened with a 1 mm sieve and then centrifuged 8 000 rpm for 5 min to achieve solid content 8 0 before htt the predetermined dosages of cpam were 0 10 and 20 mg g ts in this study since this dosage range covered typical cpam level 2 5 10 mg g ts wang et al 2018 firstly 900 g prepared ss was divided equally into 3 beakers 500 ml and then different volumes of cpam solution 0 8 w v were added into the three beakers to achieve predetermined dosage meanwhile all the beakers were kept stirring at 100 rpm for 10 min and then 50 rpm for 60 min when cpam solutions were added they were named as s0 s10 and s20 with approximate weight of 360 g respectively the 0 8 w v cpam solution was prepared as follows 2 g of cpam was added to 250 ml deionized water slowly and meanwhile the water was mixed using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm after that the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 hours 2 2 htt of ss and cpams solutions htt of s0 s10 and s20 was performed in a 250 ml completely mixed stainless reactor chen et al 2017 in a typical run 240 g of the ss sample with certain dosage of cpam was loaded into the reactor then the reactor was sealed and heated to the desired temperature 170 c for residence time of 0 5 h the vessel was removed out and quenched rapidly to room temperature via cooling water subsequently the htt mixture products named as h0 h10 and h20 were further centrifugalized and the liquid and solid products were named as hl0 and hs0 hl10 and hs10 and hl20 and hs20 respectively htt for cpam solution 750 mg l at 120 c 170 c 220 c and 320 c for 0 5 h were also conducted to study cpam degradation mechanism and the procedure was the same as htt of ss 2 3 methane production tests of ss and cpam solutions before and after htt biochemical methane potential bmp tests of samples s0 s10 s20 h0 h10 and h20 were conducted in 118 ml serum bottles in order to determine the influence of cpam on methane productions of ss before and after htt 15 ml inoculum and 30 g different ss samples were added to each bottle ph values were adjusted to 7 5 by the addition of 2 m naoh and 2 m hcl all the bottles were flushed with n2 to remove oxygen before incubation and then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum screw caps the bottles were placed in an incubator with temperature controlled at 37 c the inoculum with ts 20 4 g l vs 14 1 g l and ph 7 1 was obtained from a lab scale biogas reactor treating sewage sludge ss htt liquid samples hl0 hl10 and hl20 and solid samples hs0 hs10 and hs20 were used for bmp tests to illustrate how cpam products influenced the methane production of ss solid and liquid phases after htt cpam solution with or without htt as well as the main detected htt products were also used for bmp test to further study the degradation metabolites of cpam during htt process and the following biodegradabilities of cpam htt products all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microorganisms analysis involved in cpam degradation in ss sludge samples were collected from batch reactors of hm0 and hm20 when maximum methane production was achieved dna was first extracted and pcr was conducted with the universal primers of arba515f and arch806r abi geneamp 9700 the purification quantitation and sequencing of pcr products and the following sequences classification methods were the same as we described before and the raw data were submitted to ncbi accession id sub8078327 chen et al 2016 2 5 analytical methods methane accumulated in the bottles was detected by a gas chromatography coupling with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd and helium was used as the carrier gas gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was used to characterize the chemical compositions of organics extracted from cpam solutions after enriched by solid phase extraction spe gc coupled with a flame ion detector gc fid was used to measure the organic acids and ethanol fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is10 thermofisher was used to analyze the chemical structure of cpam the mw distribution of cpam solutions before and after htt were determined by a gel permeation chromatography gpc which coupled a diode array detector wavelength 254 nm bandwidth 100nm agilent technologies inc ca usa the column was pl aquagel oh 30 column agilent 300 7 5 8 m and the mobile phase was 0 001 m nah2po4 0 001 m na2hpo4 0 03m nacl at rate of 0 5 ml min the mw was determined by the standard curve which was drawn by the standard kits ultra high performance of liquid supercritical fluid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry acquityuplc upc2 xevo g2 xs qtofms waters was used to make further qualitative analysis chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed according to apha apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of cpam on methane production from ss figure 2 a and b show the cumulative amounts of methane from ss with and without htt rapid gas production in the first 12 days was observed for all of the samples and there were no significant differences in methane yields anova p 0 05 for ss samples without htt treatment higher methane yield anova p 0 05 of ss was obtained at cpam 20 mg g ts 138 9 ml ch4 g ts compared to 0 and 10 mg cpam g ts 127 0 and 130 3 ml ch4 g ts when ss was subjected to htt cpam had no obvious effects on ad of ss without htt which could be due to the hard biodegradable polymers the high mw of cpam 8000 kda was thought to be responsible for the recalcitrance to microbial degradation el mamouni et al 2002 therefore the long carbon chains in cpam might act as inert substance during the testing ad time and had no significant promotion or inhibition on methane production of ss figure 2 a previous studies found that the existence of cpam in ss deteriorated ad because particle aggregation especially at higher cpam lever could hinder ss solubilization and hydrolysis processes and cpam degradation products also inhibited the processes of ad chu et al 2003 wang et al 2018 htt treatment might degrade and desorb the flocculated long chain cpam in ss which provided additional carbon source for methane production and resulted in the increase of methane production 11 9 ml ch4 g ts or 595 ml ch4 g cpam fig b and c it should be noted the increased methane production with 10 mg cpam g ts was not obvious with htt treatment anova p 0 05 this might be due to the lower amount of methane produced from cpam although the theoretical bmp value of cpam is 665 ml ch4 g the maximum methane production of cpam in hm10 was 3 3 ml g ts which was only accounted for 2 6 of the methane yield of ss 127 0 ml ch4 g ts and could not be identified due to the experimental error figure 2 c and d show the methane production from ss solid and liquid phases after htt with different concentrations of cpam it was found the flocculated cpam in ss mainly increased liquid phase methane yield 17 ml ch4 g ts with ss flocculated 20 cpam mg g ts after htt this suggested that htt could well destruct ss biosolids and degrade the cpam concentrated in ss to some extent besides the biodegradable products of cpam mainly infiltrated into liquid phase and acted as carbon source to increase methane yield therefore further study was conducted in order to better understand how cpam was degraded in htt ad process in the following parts 3 2 the influence of cpam on microbial community of ss during ad considering different methane yields were obtained for htt samples with cpam 20 mg g ts and without pam 0 cpam different microbial communities might be involved in biogas production the taxonomic classification of bacterial and archaea sequences by rdp classifier for htt ss with and without cpam flocculation at 20 cpam mg g ts was shown in figure 3 firmicutes 50 0 61 2 bacteroidetes 11 4 17 9 proteobacteria 6 8 9 5 and chloroflexi 1 5 8 7 were the dominant phyla in both samples figure 3 a which were consistent with previous reports in mesophilic reactors treating ss chen et al 2019 dai et al 2015 the relative abundances of cloacimonetes and chloroflexi were increased from 4 9 and 1 5 in ad reactor of ss without cpam flocculation to 7 1 and 8 7 in reactor of ss flocculated at 20 mg cpma ts respectively chloroflexi was turned out to be the critical microorganisms involved in pam degradation under anaerobic conditions and therefore its enrichment could be correlated with the ad of cpam or its htt products in ss zhao et al 2019 figure 3 b shows the results of genus level identification relative abundances higher than 1 others represents classified low abundant bacterial populations lower than 1 the percentage of others was almost 50 in ad reactor treating cpam flocculated ss suggesting the complexity of the microbial communities especially in reactor containing cpam the abundance of gelria sp in bioreactor treating ss without cpam was 2 9 while it was increased to 11 7 in the bioreactor for cpam flocculated ss gelria sp was a known syntrophic vfas oxidizing bacteria ma et al 2020 and its enrichment might have been involved in the degradation of cpam or its htt products however to our knowledge the evidence of gelria sp belong to phylum firmicute relating with pam degradation has not been reported currently bacillus cereus sp bacillus sp and clostridium bifermentans h1 sp were the very few isolated bacterial species capable of degrading pam by using it as the sole carbon source or nitrogen source under anaerobic condition so far joshi and abed 2017 the abundance of firmicute was decreased from 61 2 to 50 0 in the cpam flocculent reactor which suggested that the addition of cpam also affected other microorganisms that metabolize ss the overwhelming archaeal methanosarcina sp and methanobacterium sp had almost equal abundances in both ss bioreactors with and without cpam suggesting that cpam and its htt products had a minor effect on the evolution of archaea during ad figure 3 c overall microbial community analysis showed some bacteria eg gelria sp were enriched in ad bioreactors because of the existence of cpam in ss 3 3 degradation of cpam with and without htt bmp test of cpam solution with and without htt were conducted it was found that only 26 ml ch4 g cod theoretical value 350 ml ch4 g cod or 665 ml ch4 g cpam was obtained after 39 days ad of cpam solution without htt while cpam after htt could be quickly degraded and the methane yield of 267 ml ch4 g cod was obtained in three days figure 4 indicating htt was very efficient to promote the degradation of cpam it was consistent with the higher methane yield of ss with 20 mg g ts after htt 138 9 ml ch4 g ts in fact it was very hard for microorganisms to utilize the carbon backbone of cpam as the sole carbon source due to the lack of appropriate enzymes xiong et al 2018 a previous study also showed that only 6 7 of the degraded cpam could be transformed to the final product ch4 wang et al 2018 although some isolated bacterial strains e g clostridium bifermentans h1 and bacillus sp could utilize pam in anaerobic environments lacking carbon or nitrogen source the degradation rate of pam was much lower than aerobic process joshi and abed 2017 besides under natural conditions the direct biological utilization of pam was only between 0 6 and 0 7 and pam degradation seemed most likely to be stimulated by environmental factors e g uv light and mechanical shearing el mamouni et al 2002 joshi and abed 2017 compared with the natural environment e g sunlight exposure the intense interaction of htt treatment significantly accelerated the degradation efficiency from 7 4 to 76 3 the degradation of cpam during htt was further investigated in the following part 3 4 characterization of cpam solutions before and after htt htt significantly increased the biodegradability of cpam and it must undergo some reactions under htt condition therefore cpam solution before and after htt were characterized to better understand the role of htt 3 4 1 ph and nh3 n of cpam solutions the hydrolysis of the amide group in pam could lead to the generation of a carboxylic acid group and ammonium and therefore ammonia concentrations and ph values of cpam solutions before and after htt were determined firstly joshi and abed 2017 the ammonia concentration of cpam solution was increased from 0 00 to 17 35 0 04 mg l after htt treatment and the corresponding ph value was increased from 4 73 to 6 81 as shown in table 1 caulfield s result supported that amide nitrogen was susceptible during the biodegradation of pam caulfield et al 2002 muller s study of thermal stability of pam solutions also found that higher temperature 60 100 c was responsible for the hydrolysis of amide groups although there was no high polymer degradation muller 1981 therefore the ammonia should be produced by the hydrolysis of acylamino in cpam during htt which led to the increase of ph 3 4 2 mw variation of cpam after htt cpam added in ss was high mw 8000 kda polymer and it was not clear the changes of the polymerization degree and the following degradation performance after htt gpc was used to investigate the mw distribution of cpam before and after htt the results showed the organics with mw of 200 da 1000 kda were produced after htt of cpam indicting the chain s scission of cpam figure s2 previous studies also found during chemical process e g fenton reaction free hydroxyl radicals could activate pam polymer backbone degradation and higher temperature at 50 80 c resulted in a much higher rate for free radical chain scission reactions xiong et al 2018 water at the given htt condition enjoyed naturally higher concentrations of h and oh ions and radicals than in ambient liquid water which would stimulate the broken of the long chains in cpam peterson et al 2008 yousefifar et al 2017 gpc results indicated that the mw of cpam was decreased after htt 8000 kda vs 20 1000 kda this lower mw htt products of cpam could be more favorable for biodegradation joshi and abed 2017 which should be related to the higher methane production efficiency as shown in figure 4 3 4 3 ft ir analysis ft ir was performed to further characterize the changes of cpam chemical structure during htt cpam solution after htt showed a distinct signal associated with the carboxyl group 1403 cm 1 in figure 5 symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid dimer it was found that degraded polyacrylamide could lead to the increase of carboxylic groups after hydrolysis or degradation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions joshi and abed 2017 xiong et al 2018 the appearance of carboxyl group was most probably due to the hydrolysis of acylamino in cpam during htt which also resulted in the increasement of ammonia concentration 17 35 mg l in cpam solution in table 1 however the characteristic band at 3433 cm 1 ascribed to the strong stretching vibration of nh2 was still significant for cpam solution after htt suggesting that only parts about 30 5 of the acylamino groups were hydrolyzed to form ammonia the characteristic absorption peak at 1119 cm 1 arosing from the ch3 bending vibrations of n ch3 3 was found in both samples liao et al 2014 indicating trimethylamine group n ch3 3 was not further well degraded during the htt process in summary the ft ir analysis suggested that both acylamino and ester groups in cpam underwent hydrolysis to form carboxylic as well as ammonia and n ch3 3 like byproducts under the given htt condition 3 4 4 lc tof ms ms and other analysis qualitative analysis was further conducted to analyze possible htt degradation products of cpam through lc tof ms analysis a compound with mw of 104 1072 was found in the cpam solution after htt figure s3 cpam acquires their positive charge due to amine moieties within the organic structure chang et al 2005 trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy ch2 chcooch2 ch2n ch3 3 was the co monomer with acrylamide for the synthesis of the cpam in this study figure 1 ester group in the positive charge structure was easy to be hydrolyzed under htt condition as equation 1 shows akiya and savage 2002 and the detected htt product 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline c5h14no with mw of 104 1072 was more likely produced from the hydrolysis of the ester group in cationic pendant trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy of cpam 1 rcoor h 2 o rcooh r oh other possible small htt degradation products 200 da such as am acrylic acid acetic acid and ethanol were also measured through gc fid and gc ms analysis considerable amount of ethanol 164 89 mg l was found table 1 while am acrylic acid and acetic acid were not detected the generation of ethanol was more logically attributable to further hydrolysis of the moiety part of cationic pendant group 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium c5h14no if ethanol was produced from further hydrolysis of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium another hydrolytic concomitant product trimethylamine should be produced at the same time equations 1 however the trimethylamine in the solution treated at 170 c was not detected cpam htt solutions at different htt temperatures 120 320 c were also prepared to further analyze trimethylamine contents and only low trimethylamine concentrations were detected at 270 c 0 16 mg l and 320 c 0 12 mg l trimethylamine has high volatility and it is thermally unstable it might release into the gas phase and undergo further decomposition during the htt process wang et al 2014 3 5 degradation mechanism of cpam under htt there are acylamino and ester groups in the cpam structure in this study figure 1 compounds containing a saturated carbon atom attached to a functional group with heteroatom were very susceptible to be hydrolyzed under htt condition akiya and savage 2002 possible hydrolysis reactions relating to cpam are shown in equations 1 2 and 3 combined with the above discussion the hydrothermal degradation mechanism of cpam under htt condition were summarized in figure 6 an initial ester hydrolysis of the cationic pendant group in cpam occurred by the determination of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline equation 1 and figure s3 and s4 acylamino group underwent hydrolysis process leading to the generation of carboxylic groups and ammonium ion and resulted in the accumulation of nh3 17 35 mg l in htt solution table 1 at the same time pa with different polymerization degrees could be produced from the long carbon chains then the hydrolysis product e g choline was further decomposed by the production of ethanol 164 89 mg l and trimethylamine figure s4 for instance htt sample at 170 c had highest concentration of choline but it was further degraded when htt temperature was elevated figure s5 at the same time pa from backbone also underwent some secondary reactions 2 rcon h 2 h 2 o rcooh n h 3 3 rr nr 2 h 2 o roh r oh r n h 2 3 6 bmp test of the main htt degradation products of cpam to verify cpam degradation mechanism by considering their biodegradabilities during the htt ad process main cpam htt products were used to test their methane potentials according to above discussions htt products of cpam included small mw compounds such as ethanol ammonia and choline and pa like compounds with mw of 200 1000 kda the degradation property of ethanol under ad had been well recognized and it can be efficiently converted under ad condition dai et al 2015 therefore only products of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline cc and polyacrylic acid mw 450 kda with htt named hpa and without named pa htt were used to do bmp test figure 7 a the methane yield of cc 330 ml g cod was significantly higher than that of pa 3 ml g cod while the methane yield of hpa slightly increased to 49 ml g cod suggesting that the backbone carbon in cpam might undergo complex secondary reactions instead of forming simple pa figure 7 a at the same time the methane yield of nonionic polyacrylamide npam was increased from 2 to 157 ml g cod figure 7 b which was lower than that 267 ml g cod of cpam figure 7 b therefore the htt products from part of cationic structure was much easier to be anaerobic degraded for methane production according to the charge density of cpam 50 the cod percentages of cationic pendant groups choline and backbones in cpam were 45 3 and 54 7 while their methane yields were 330 ml g cod and 157 ml g cod ideally npam hydrolysate respectively the cumulative methane yield was 235 ml g cod which approximated the methane yield 267 ml g cod of cpam after htt therefore to avoid the interferences of cationic groups htt solution of npam could be used to further analyze reaction mechanism of backbone in cpam in the future studies 3 7 safety assessment of cpam in ss to flocculate and increase the dewaterability of ss quite high amounts of polymers are added to ss the addition of cpam 0 20 mg g ts to ss had no apparent toxicity to the inoculum and the final methane yield was not affected obviously with cpam flocculated ss without htt however the biodegradability of cpam in ss was quite low and only 7 4 of the polymers could be degraded to the final products ch4 after 39 days cultivation as a consequence cpam left in ss still has environmental risk to avoid the generation of the intermediate neurotoxin product of am new strategies should be developed to improve the anaerobic degradability of cpam especially to accelerating the amide hydrolysis process methods including microwave pretreatment and thermal alkaline pretreatment were adopted to alleviate the effect of cpam on ss ad but the degradability of cpam itself by considering the structure and the degradation mechanisms have not been studied liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b although the biological hydrolysis of pam reached 86 64 through control of the initial ph to be 9 which could avoid the generation of am to a great extent it would consume a large amount of alkali before the following ad dai et al 2015 htt was shown to effectively destruct organic wastes and increase the biodegradability of ss before ad according to the results of this study the final biodegradability of cpam significantly increased from 7 4 to 76 3 and at the same time the methane yield of ss was also increased by 46 from 95 ml ch4 g ts to 139 ml ch4 g ts through htt ad it should be noted that although cpam was efficiently degraded during the htt ad process it might be added again to the digestate of htt ss for further dewatering in order to facilitate landfill or incineration it deserves further investigation since cpam still has potential environmental risk if landfill is applied however cpam might not be necessarily added again for the dewatering of digestate a previous study showed htt had a significant advantage on the improvement of ss dewatering performance as the process could release water from sludge cells efficiently combined with mechanical dehydration the moisture content of the ss after htt pretreatment could be significantly reduced to lower than 30 without the addition of cpam wang and li 2015 despite higher energy consumption of htt for ss treatment the environmentally friendly benefits e g the subduction of potential hazards of cpam and pathogenic problems in ss as well as higher methane yields should be considered when choosing appropriate ss pretreatment in the future 4 conclusion the present study showed the addition of cpam 0 20 mg g ts to ss had no apparent influence on final methane yield and the biodegradability of cpam to methane was only 7 4 which still had potential environmental risks htt at 170 c for 0 5 h significantly increased the biodegradability of cpam to 76 3 and the methane yield of ss was also increased from 95 ml ch4 g ts to 139 ml ch4 g ts gelria sp was enriched in cpam 20 mg g ts flocculated ss reactor which could be correlated with the ad of cpam however cpam and its htt products had minor effects on the evolution of archaeal during ad the mechanism study showed the mw of cpam was decreased after htt and several htt products were identified 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium ammonia trimethylamine and ethanol further methane potential tests showed the main htt products were

17248,cationic polyacrylamide cpam is a widely used flocculant to dewater sewage sludge ss for high solids anaerobic digestion ad and its degradation is crucial since it would release toxic acrylamide am once entering environment hydrothermal treatment htt is an efficient method to enhance the ad efficiency of ss however the effects of cpam on ad of ss and the degradation of cpam during htt ad process have not be studied the study showed cpam at 20 mg g ts increased methane yield of ss from 127 0 to 138 9 ml ch4 g ts in htt ad process and the biodegradability of cpam was 76 3 which was much higher than that 7 4 without htt in htt ad process the enrichment of certain microbes e g gelria sp was observed which might be related with cpam degradation htt decreased the molecular weight mw of cpam and resulted in the production of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium ammonia trimethylamine and ethanol methane potential tests of the main htt products also showed they were easily to be degraded overall htt ad integrated process was an efficient method to reduce environmental risk of cpam as well as increase energy output biogas and the study also provided insights into the degradation mechanism of cpam during htt graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words cationic polyacrylamide sewage sludge hydrothermal treatment anaerobic digestion decomposition mechanism 1 introduction large amounts of sewage sludge ss are produced every year during the treatment of municipal wastewater the treatment of ss is necessary in order to reduce the volumes and the associated health problems appels et al 2008 anaerobic digestion ad is widely used to stabilize ss and produce energy in the form of biogas carrere et al 2010 and at the same time high solid ad ts 8 process could reduce reactor volume and lower energy consumption duan et al 2012 chemical additives e g flocculating and coagulant agents were added to sludge to improve the dewaterability of ss before subsequent processing e g high solid ad of ss the additives were concentrated into ss biosolids accompanied by microbial cells extracellular polymeric substances and the minerals wang et al 2018 polyacrylamide pam as a flocculant in water treatment and sludge dewatering is widely used the term polyacrylamide is loosely used to describe any polymer with acrylamide present as one of the monomers pam can have various charges e g anionic apam cationic cpam or neutral npam which enhance their versatility chu et al 2003 cationic polyacrylamide cpam is very effective at flocculating negatively charged solids suspending in wastewater haveroen et al 2005 typical cpam level in ss is in the range of 2 5 10 mg g total solid ts wang et al 2018 however cpam concentrated into ss might result in serious environmental risks the significant accumulation of acrylamide am the monomer of pam was observed during biodegradation of pam in a previous study dai et al 2015 am is a known neurotoxin and a potential carcinogen xiong et al 2018 and many countries have already forbidden or restricted 1 mg l the application of pam in drinking water lapointe and barbeau 2017 therefore the significant level of cpam in ss may pollute the soil and groundwater if not properly treated the degradation mechanism especially by considering the positive charge structure of cpam in ss has not been extensively studied dai et al 2015 wang et al 2018 it was reported that pam in ss could be used as carbon and nitrogen sources during the anaerobic process dai et al 2015 haveroen et al showed the amide group could serve as a nitrogen source for microorganisms while the carbon backbone of pam polymers was unlikely to be cleaved by microbial activity haveroen et al 2005 in a review article in 2002 caulfield et al concluded high molecular weight mw pam was hard to undergo biodegradation and there was no result showing the formation of am caulfield et al 2002 kay shoemake et al also found that there were biological enzymes capable of hydrolyzing amide to form nh3 and coo groups which avoid the production of am kay shoemake et al 1998 conversely a recent study drawn a very different conclusion as they found that around 46 of cpam had been degraded through ad and am was one of the main degradation metabolites wang et al 2018 moreover controversial results were reported with respect to the details of how cpam affects ad of ss wang et al revealed the presence of cpam deteriorated the process of ad by restraining sludge solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes and thus severely decreased methane yield from 139 1 ml ch4 g of volatile suspended vss without cpam to 86 7 ml g vss at cpam level 12 g kg total suspended solids tss wang et al 2018 they also concluded the degradation products am acrylic acid and polyacrylic acid pa of cpam significantly affected methane yield however chu et al concluded npam and apam dosed at the range of 0 15 g kg dried solids ds as well as cpam at the range of 0 5 g kg ds had no inhibition on methane yields but cpam would hinder the ad process if ss were flocculated to a higher dosage 15 g kg ds particle aggregation with greater floc size with high concentration of cpam 15 g kg ds could prohibit efficient mass exchange movement and hinder the subsequent hydrolysis to produce methane chu et al 2003 hydrolysis is the limiting step during ad of ss and therefore mechanical chemical and thermal pretreatments were used to shorten retention time and increase degradation efficiency appels et al 2008 burger and parker 2013 hydrothermal treatment htt carried out at certain temperature and pressure was shown to effectively destruct organic wastes and increase the biodegradability of ad suarez iglesias et al 2017 yousefifar et al 2017 htt at 170 c was concluded to be an appropriate condition and widely used in full scale biogas plants treating ss appels et al 2008 chen et al 2019 cpam is synthesized by the copolymerization of am and cationic monomers wu et al 2020 these cationic polymers vary in chemical structure and some may be more susceptible to biotic degradation than others chang et al 2005 unfortunately there is no literature systematically analyzing the effects of cpam on ad of ss by referring to the structure of cpam especially after htt pretreatment based on the above considerations this study aimed to investigate the degradation behavior of cpam and its effects on ad of ss during htt ad processes the influence of cpam on methane yield of ss with and without htt was explored and the microorganisms relating with the degradation of cpam were analyzed furthermore cpam solutions before and after htt were characterized to provide a comprehensive analysis of the degradation of cpam in htt process the main htt products were also used for methane potential tests and finally detailed molecular degradation mechanism of cpam during htt ad process was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 cpam and ss preparation with different cpam levels a typical structure of cpam poly acrylamide co n n n trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy dac with mw 8000 kda was used chengdu aikeda chemical reagent co ltd in the present study figure 1 charge density of the cpam was 50 the ratio of m to m n ss without adding cpam was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wastewater treatment plant in shanghai the sludge was concentrated by settling at 4 c for 14h screened with a 1 mm sieve and then centrifuged 8 000 rpm for 5 min to achieve solid content 8 0 before htt the predetermined dosages of cpam were 0 10 and 20 mg g ts in this study since this dosage range covered typical cpam level 2 5 10 mg g ts wang et al 2018 firstly 900 g prepared ss was divided equally into 3 beakers 500 ml and then different volumes of cpam solution 0 8 w v were added into the three beakers to achieve predetermined dosage meanwhile all the beakers were kept stirring at 100 rpm for 10 min and then 50 rpm for 60 min when cpam solutions were added they were named as s0 s10 and s20 with approximate weight of 360 g respectively the 0 8 w v cpam solution was prepared as follows 2 g of cpam was added to 250 ml deionized water slowly and meanwhile the water was mixed using a magnetic stirrer at 400 rpm after that the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 hours 2 2 htt of ss and cpams solutions htt of s0 s10 and s20 was performed in a 250 ml completely mixed stainless reactor chen et al 2017 in a typical run 240 g of the ss sample with certain dosage of cpam was loaded into the reactor then the reactor was sealed and heated to the desired temperature 170 c for residence time of 0 5 h the vessel was removed out and quenched rapidly to room temperature via cooling water subsequently the htt mixture products named as h0 h10 and h20 were further centrifugalized and the liquid and solid products were named as hl0 and hs0 hl10 and hs10 and hl20 and hs20 respectively htt for cpam solution 750 mg l at 120 c 170 c 220 c and 320 c for 0 5 h were also conducted to study cpam degradation mechanism and the procedure was the same as htt of ss 2 3 methane production tests of ss and cpam solutions before and after htt biochemical methane potential bmp tests of samples s0 s10 s20 h0 h10 and h20 were conducted in 118 ml serum bottles in order to determine the influence of cpam on methane productions of ss before and after htt 15 ml inoculum and 30 g different ss samples were added to each bottle ph values were adjusted to 7 5 by the addition of 2 m naoh and 2 m hcl all the bottles were flushed with n2 to remove oxygen before incubation and then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum screw caps the bottles were placed in an incubator with temperature controlled at 37 c the inoculum with ts 20 4 g l vs 14 1 g l and ph 7 1 was obtained from a lab scale biogas reactor treating sewage sludge ss htt liquid samples hl0 hl10 and hl20 and solid samples hs0 hs10 and hs20 were used for bmp tests to illustrate how cpam products influenced the methane production of ss solid and liquid phases after htt cpam solution with or without htt as well as the main detected htt products were also used for bmp test to further study the degradation metabolites of cpam during htt process and the following biodegradabilities of cpam htt products all tests were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microorganisms analysis involved in cpam degradation in ss sludge samples were collected from batch reactors of hm0 and hm20 when maximum methane production was achieved dna was first extracted and pcr was conducted with the universal primers of arba515f and arch806r abi geneamp 9700 the purification quantitation and sequencing of pcr products and the following sequences classification methods were the same as we described before and the raw data were submitted to ncbi accession id sub8078327 chen et al 2016 2 5 analytical methods methane accumulated in the bottles was detected by a gas chromatography coupling with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd and helium was used as the carrier gas gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was used to characterize the chemical compositions of organics extracted from cpam solutions after enriched by solid phase extraction spe gc coupled with a flame ion detector gc fid was used to measure the organic acids and ethanol fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet is10 thermofisher was used to analyze the chemical structure of cpam the mw distribution of cpam solutions before and after htt were determined by a gel permeation chromatography gpc which coupled a diode array detector wavelength 254 nm bandwidth 100nm agilent technologies inc ca usa the column was pl aquagel oh 30 column agilent 300 7 5 8 m and the mobile phase was 0 001 m nah2po4 0 001 m na2hpo4 0 03m nacl at rate of 0 5 ml min the mw was determined by the standard curve which was drawn by the standard kits ultra high performance of liquid supercritical fluid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry acquityuplc upc2 xevo g2 xs qtofms waters was used to make further qualitative analysis chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed according to apha apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 the influence of cpam on methane production from ss figure 2 a and b show the cumulative amounts of methane from ss with and without htt rapid gas production in the first 12 days was observed for all of the samples and there were no significant differences in methane yields anova p 0 05 for ss samples without htt treatment higher methane yield anova p 0 05 of ss was obtained at cpam 20 mg g ts 138 9 ml ch4 g ts compared to 0 and 10 mg cpam g ts 127 0 and 130 3 ml ch4 g ts when ss was subjected to htt cpam had no obvious effects on ad of ss without htt which could be due to the hard biodegradable polymers the high mw of cpam 8000 kda was thought to be responsible for the recalcitrance to microbial degradation el mamouni et al 2002 therefore the long carbon chains in cpam might act as inert substance during the testing ad time and had no significant promotion or inhibition on methane production of ss figure 2 a previous studies found that the existence of cpam in ss deteriorated ad because particle aggregation especially at higher cpam lever could hinder ss solubilization and hydrolysis processes and cpam degradation products also inhibited the processes of ad chu et al 2003 wang et al 2018 htt treatment might degrade and desorb the flocculated long chain cpam in ss which provided additional carbon source for methane production and resulted in the increase of methane production 11 9 ml ch4 g ts or 595 ml ch4 g cpam fig b and c it should be noted the increased methane production with 10 mg cpam g ts was not obvious with htt treatment anova p 0 05 this might be due to the lower amount of methane produced from cpam although the theoretical bmp value of cpam is 665 ml ch4 g the maximum methane production of cpam in hm10 was 3 3 ml g ts which was only accounted for 2 6 of the methane yield of ss 127 0 ml ch4 g ts and could not be identified due to the experimental error figure 2 c and d show the methane production from ss solid and liquid phases after htt with different concentrations of cpam it was found the flocculated cpam in ss mainly increased liquid phase methane yield 17 ml ch4 g ts with ss flocculated 20 cpam mg g ts after htt this suggested that htt could well destruct ss biosolids and degrade the cpam concentrated in ss to some extent besides the biodegradable products of cpam mainly infiltrated into liquid phase and acted as carbon source to increase methane yield therefore further study was conducted in order to better understand how cpam was degraded in htt ad process in the following parts 3 2 the influence of cpam on microbial community of ss during ad considering different methane yields were obtained for htt samples with cpam 20 mg g ts and without pam 0 cpam different microbial communities might be involved in biogas production the taxonomic classification of bacterial and archaea sequences by rdp classifier for htt ss with and without cpam flocculation at 20 cpam mg g ts was shown in figure 3 firmicutes 50 0 61 2 bacteroidetes 11 4 17 9 proteobacteria 6 8 9 5 and chloroflexi 1 5 8 7 were the dominant phyla in both samples figure 3 a which were consistent with previous reports in mesophilic reactors treating ss chen et al 2019 dai et al 2015 the relative abundances of cloacimonetes and chloroflexi were increased from 4 9 and 1 5 in ad reactor of ss without cpam flocculation to 7 1 and 8 7 in reactor of ss flocculated at 20 mg cpma ts respectively chloroflexi was turned out to be the critical microorganisms involved in pam degradation under anaerobic conditions and therefore its enrichment could be correlated with the ad of cpam or its htt products in ss zhao et al 2019 figure 3 b shows the results of genus level identification relative abundances higher than 1 others represents classified low abundant bacterial populations lower than 1 the percentage of others was almost 50 in ad reactor treating cpam flocculated ss suggesting the complexity of the microbial communities especially in reactor containing cpam the abundance of gelria sp in bioreactor treating ss without cpam was 2 9 while it was increased to 11 7 in the bioreactor for cpam flocculated ss gelria sp was a known syntrophic vfas oxidizing bacteria ma et al 2020 and its enrichment might have been involved in the degradation of cpam or its htt products however to our knowledge the evidence of gelria sp belong to phylum firmicute relating with pam degradation has not been reported currently bacillus cereus sp bacillus sp and clostridium bifermentans h1 sp were the very few isolated bacterial species capable of degrading pam by using it as the sole carbon source or nitrogen source under anaerobic condition so far joshi and abed 2017 the abundance of firmicute was decreased from 61 2 to 50 0 in the cpam flocculent reactor which suggested that the addition of cpam also affected other microorganisms that metabolize ss the overwhelming archaeal methanosarcina sp and methanobacterium sp had almost equal abundances in both ss bioreactors with and without cpam suggesting that cpam and its htt products had a minor effect on the evolution of archaea during ad figure 3 c overall microbial community analysis showed some bacteria eg gelria sp were enriched in ad bioreactors because of the existence of cpam in ss 3 3 degradation of cpam with and without htt bmp test of cpam solution with and without htt were conducted it was found that only 26 ml ch4 g cod theoretical value 350 ml ch4 g cod or 665 ml ch4 g cpam was obtained after 39 days ad of cpam solution without htt while cpam after htt could be quickly degraded and the methane yield of 267 ml ch4 g cod was obtained in three days figure 4 indicating htt was very efficient to promote the degradation of cpam it was consistent with the higher methane yield of ss with 20 mg g ts after htt 138 9 ml ch4 g ts in fact it was very hard for microorganisms to utilize the carbon backbone of cpam as the sole carbon source due to the lack of appropriate enzymes xiong et al 2018 a previous study also showed that only 6 7 of the degraded cpam could be transformed to the final product ch4 wang et al 2018 although some isolated bacterial strains e g clostridium bifermentans h1 and bacillus sp could utilize pam in anaerobic environments lacking carbon or nitrogen source the degradation rate of pam was much lower than aerobic process joshi and abed 2017 besides under natural conditions the direct biological utilization of pam was only between 0 6 and 0 7 and pam degradation seemed most likely to be stimulated by environmental factors e g uv light and mechanical shearing el mamouni et al 2002 joshi and abed 2017 compared with the natural environment e g sunlight exposure the intense interaction of htt treatment significantly accelerated the degradation efficiency from 7 4 to 76 3 the degradation of cpam during htt was further investigated in the following part 3 4 characterization of cpam solutions before and after htt htt significantly increased the biodegradability of cpam and it must undergo some reactions under htt condition therefore cpam solution before and after htt were characterized to better understand the role of htt 3 4 1 ph and nh3 n of cpam solutions the hydrolysis of the amide group in pam could lead to the generation of a carboxylic acid group and ammonium and therefore ammonia concentrations and ph values of cpam solutions before and after htt were determined firstly joshi and abed 2017 the ammonia concentration of cpam solution was increased from 0 00 to 17 35 0 04 mg l after htt treatment and the corresponding ph value was increased from 4 73 to 6 81 as shown in table 1 caulfield s result supported that amide nitrogen was susceptible during the biodegradation of pam caulfield et al 2002 muller s study of thermal stability of pam solutions also found that higher temperature 60 100 c was responsible for the hydrolysis of amide groups although there was no high polymer degradation muller 1981 therefore the ammonia should be produced by the hydrolysis of acylamino in cpam during htt which led to the increase of ph 3 4 2 mw variation of cpam after htt cpam added in ss was high mw 8000 kda polymer and it was not clear the changes of the polymerization degree and the following degradation performance after htt gpc was used to investigate the mw distribution of cpam before and after htt the results showed the organics with mw of 200 da 1000 kda were produced after htt of cpam indicting the chain s scission of cpam figure s2 previous studies also found during chemical process e g fenton reaction free hydroxyl radicals could activate pam polymer backbone degradation and higher temperature at 50 80 c resulted in a much higher rate for free radical chain scission reactions xiong et al 2018 water at the given htt condition enjoyed naturally higher concentrations of h and oh ions and radicals than in ambient liquid water which would stimulate the broken of the long chains in cpam peterson et al 2008 yousefifar et al 2017 gpc results indicated that the mw of cpam was decreased after htt 8000 kda vs 20 1000 kda this lower mw htt products of cpam could be more favorable for biodegradation joshi and abed 2017 which should be related to the higher methane production efficiency as shown in figure 4 3 4 3 ft ir analysis ft ir was performed to further characterize the changes of cpam chemical structure during htt cpam solution after htt showed a distinct signal associated with the carboxyl group 1403 cm 1 in figure 5 symmetric stretching vibrations of carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid dimer it was found that degraded polyacrylamide could lead to the increase of carboxylic groups after hydrolysis or degradation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions joshi and abed 2017 xiong et al 2018 the appearance of carboxyl group was most probably due to the hydrolysis of acylamino in cpam during htt which also resulted in the increasement of ammonia concentration 17 35 mg l in cpam solution in table 1 however the characteristic band at 3433 cm 1 ascribed to the strong stretching vibration of nh2 was still significant for cpam solution after htt suggesting that only parts about 30 5 of the acylamino groups were hydrolyzed to form ammonia the characteristic absorption peak at 1119 cm 1 arosing from the ch3 bending vibrations of n ch3 3 was found in both samples liao et al 2014 indicating trimethylamine group n ch3 3 was not further well degraded during the htt process in summary the ft ir analysis suggested that both acylamino and ester groups in cpam underwent hydrolysis to form carboxylic as well as ammonia and n ch3 3 like byproducts under the given htt condition 3 4 4 lc tof ms ms and other analysis qualitative analysis was further conducted to analyze possible htt degradation products of cpam through lc tof ms analysis a compound with mw of 104 1072 was found in the cpam solution after htt figure s3 cpam acquires their positive charge due to amine moieties within the organic structure chang et al 2005 trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy ch2 chcooch2 ch2n ch3 3 was the co monomer with acrylamide for the synthesis of the cpam in this study figure 1 ester group in the positive charge structure was easy to be hydrolyzed under htt condition as equation 1 shows akiya and savage 2002 and the detected htt product 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline c5h14no with mw of 104 1072 was more likely produced from the hydrolysis of the ester group in cationic pendant trimethyl 2 1 oxo 2 propenyl oxy of cpam 1 rcoor h 2 o rcooh r oh other possible small htt degradation products 200 da such as am acrylic acid acetic acid and ethanol were also measured through gc fid and gc ms analysis considerable amount of ethanol 164 89 mg l was found table 1 while am acrylic acid and acetic acid were not detected the generation of ethanol was more logically attributable to further hydrolysis of the moiety part of cationic pendant group 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium c5h14no if ethanol was produced from further hydrolysis of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium another hydrolytic concomitant product trimethylamine should be produced at the same time equations 1 however the trimethylamine in the solution treated at 170 c was not detected cpam htt solutions at different htt temperatures 120 320 c were also prepared to further analyze trimethylamine contents and only low trimethylamine concentrations were detected at 270 c 0 16 mg l and 320 c 0 12 mg l trimethylamine has high volatility and it is thermally unstable it might release into the gas phase and undergo further decomposition during the htt process wang et al 2014 3 5 degradation mechanism of cpam under htt there are acylamino and ester groups in the cpam structure in this study figure 1 compounds containing a saturated carbon atom attached to a functional group with heteroatom were very susceptible to be hydrolyzed under htt condition akiya and savage 2002 possible hydrolysis reactions relating to cpam are shown in equations 1 2 and 3 combined with the above discussion the hydrothermal degradation mechanism of cpam under htt condition were summarized in figure 6 an initial ester hydrolysis of the cationic pendant group in cpam occurred by the determination of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline equation 1 and figure s3 and s4 acylamino group underwent hydrolysis process leading to the generation of carboxylic groups and ammonium ion and resulted in the accumulation of nh3 17 35 mg l in htt solution table 1 at the same time pa with different polymerization degrees could be produced from the long carbon chains then the hydrolysis product e g choline was further decomposed by the production of ethanol 164 89 mg l and trimethylamine figure s4 for instance htt sample at 170 c had highest concentration of choline but it was further degraded when htt temperature was elevated figure s5 at the same time pa from backbone also underwent some secondary reactions 2 rcon h 2 h 2 o rcooh n h 3 3 rr nr 2 h 2 o roh r oh r n h 2 3 6 bmp test of the main htt degradation products of cpam to verify cpam degradation mechanism by considering their biodegradabilities during the htt ad process main cpam htt products were used to test their methane potentials according to above discussions htt products of cpam included small mw compounds such as ethanol ammonia and choline and pa like compounds with mw of 200 1000 kda the degradation property of ethanol under ad had been well recognized and it can be efficiently converted under ad condition dai et al 2015 therefore only products of 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium choline cc and polyacrylic acid mw 450 kda with htt named hpa and without named pa htt were used to do bmp test figure 7 a the methane yield of cc 330 ml g cod was significantly higher than that of pa 3 ml g cod while the methane yield of hpa slightly increased to 49 ml g cod suggesting that the backbone carbon in cpam might undergo complex secondary reactions instead of forming simple pa figure 7 a at the same time the methane yield of nonionic polyacrylamide npam was increased from 2 to 157 ml g cod figure 7 b which was lower than that 267 ml g cod of cpam figure 7 b therefore the htt products from part of cationic structure was much easier to be anaerobic degraded for methane production according to the charge density of cpam 50 the cod percentages of cationic pendant groups choline and backbones in cpam were 45 3 and 54 7 while their methane yields were 330 ml g cod and 157 ml g cod ideally npam hydrolysate respectively the cumulative methane yield was 235 ml g cod which approximated the methane yield 267 ml g cod of cpam after htt therefore to avoid the interferences of cationic groups htt solution of npam could be used to further analyze reaction mechanism of backbone in cpam in the future studies 3 7 safety assessment of cpam in ss to flocculate and increase the dewaterability of ss quite high amounts of polymers are added to ss the addition of cpam 0 20 mg g ts to ss had no apparent toxicity to the inoculum and the final methane yield was not affected obviously with cpam flocculated ss without htt however the biodegradability of cpam in ss was quite low and only 7 4 of the polymers could be degraded to the final products ch4 after 39 days cultivation as a consequence cpam left in ss still has environmental risk to avoid the generation of the intermediate neurotoxin product of am new strategies should be developed to improve the anaerobic degradability of cpam especially to accelerating the amide hydrolysis process methods including microwave pretreatment and thermal alkaline pretreatment were adopted to alleviate the effect of cpam on ss ad but the degradability of cpam itself by considering the structure and the degradation mechanisms have not been studied liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b although the biological hydrolysis of pam reached 86 64 through control of the initial ph to be 9 which could avoid the generation of am to a great extent it would consume a large amount of alkali before the following ad dai et al 2015 htt was shown to effectively destruct organic wastes and increase the biodegradability of ss before ad according to the results of this study the final biodegradability of cpam significantly increased from 7 4 to 76 3 and at the same time the methane yield of ss was also increased by 46 from 95 ml ch4 g ts to 139 ml ch4 g ts through htt ad it should be noted that although cpam was efficiently degraded during the htt ad process it might be added again to the digestate of htt ss for further dewatering in order to facilitate landfill or incineration it deserves further investigation since cpam still has potential environmental risk if landfill is applied however cpam might not be necessarily added again for the dewatering of digestate a previous study showed htt had a significant advantage on the improvement of ss dewatering performance as the process could release water from sludge cells efficiently combined with mechanical dehydration the moisture content of the ss after htt pretreatment could be significantly reduced to lower than 30 without the addition of cpam wang and li 2015 despite higher energy consumption of htt for ss treatment the environmentally friendly benefits e g the subduction of potential hazards of cpam and pathogenic problems in ss as well as higher methane yields should be considered when choosing appropriate ss pretreatment in the future 4 conclusion the present study showed the addition of cpam 0 20 mg g ts to ss had no apparent influence on final methane yield and the biodegradability of cpam to methane was only 7 4 which still had potential environmental risks htt at 170 c for 0 5 h significantly increased the biodegradability of cpam to 76 3 and the methane yield of ss was also increased from 95 ml ch4 g ts to 139 ml ch4 g ts gelria sp was enriched in cpam 20 mg g ts flocculated ss reactor which could be correlated with the ad of cpam however cpam and its htt products had minor effects on the evolution of archaeal during ad the mechanism study showed the mw of cpam was decreased after htt and several htt products were identified 2 hydroxy ethyl trimethylammonium ammonia trimethylamine and ethanol further methane potential tests showed the main htt products were

intended to quench scavenge 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh respectively and benzophenone reacted with nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger and furfuryl alcohol as a 1o2 trapping agent indicating quenchers may have unanticipated effects when using model sensitizers atrazine loss via reaction with 3dom will be relevant only in selected conditions and this work provides a more comprehensive view on the use of

2011 atrazine and its metabolites persist in the environment for decades and are resistant to microbial degradation jablonowski et al 2011 thus it is still important to understand the processes affecting the fate of atrazine photochemical reactions in surface waters play an important role in the degradation of micropollutants fenner et al 2013 these reactions involve both direct and indirect photolysis for direct photolysis to occur the absorption spectrum of the pollutant must overlap with the wavelengths of a given light source much past research on the photolysis of atrazine has involved the use of artificial light sources the quantum yield φ which is the ratio of the molecules degraded per number of photons absorbed of atrazine in the uvb region was measured as 0 0158 mol

that the wavelengths to which atrazine is exposed may affect the quantum yield and experiments in sunlight are needed to accurately assess its environmental fate in indirect photolysis a photosensitizer such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom becomes electronically excited by light absorption and either reacts directly in its excited state with a pollutant or produces

1992 kamiya and kameyama 1998 despite the fact that cdom acts as a photosensitizer to enhance the efficiency of pollutant depletion via triplet induced oxidation or other produced reactive species initiated reactions it also inhibits the oxidation of pollutants via light attenuation radical scavenging and a back reduction mechanism canonica and laubscher 2008b 3cdom is an important reactive

3cdom population has energy above 250 kj mol 1 depending on the dom source material zepp et al 1985 lower energy 3cdom participates in the energy transfer reaction with molecular oxygen to produce 1o2 while high energy 3cdom is thought to be involved in both the production of 1o2 and electron transfer and isomerization reactions tinnacher and honeyman 2007 in an electron transfer process the kinetics of the electron transfer reaction could be determined by the triplet reduction potential of 3cdom eberson 1982 it is well known that excited ketones with n π state are less selective than those with π π state for hydrogen abstraction wagner and park 2017 wagner et al 1973 eberson 1982 and charge transfer khan and cohen 1991 the higher proportion of non bonding n to π bonding π

2016 to assess photochemical reactivity the excited triplet state reduction potential e o 3 s s and n π π π framework may be critical parameters for interpreting reactivity mcneill and canonica 2016 loeff et al 1993 it is well known that the groups present in cdom are electron accepting moieties aromatic ketones aldehydes and quinones and electron donating moieties phenols mcneill and canonica 2016 marchetti et al 2013 loeff et al 1993 some works have been previously carried out to probe the role of 3cdom natural water and model photosensitizers in the indirect photolysis of atrazine suggesting the 3cdom induced reaction is an important photodegradation pathway of atrazine in surface waters carena and vione 2020 carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 minero et al 1992 prosen and zupancic kralj 2005 rebelo et al 2006 zeng and arnold 2013 furthermore 3cdom surrogates have been utilized to assess their reactivity with atrazine and measure the second order reaction rate constants of atrazine with excited triplet states of anthraquinone 2 sulphonate aq2s and 4 carboxybenzophenone cbbp the results are consistent with those obtained for the reaction of atrazine with cdom present in natural waters suggesting that both aq2s and cbbp are good cdom proxies for atrazine indirect photodegradation carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 however the triplet one electron reduction potential of aq2s 2 28 ev and cbbp 1 84 ev mcneill and canonica 2016 are higher than that of cdom 1 6 1 8 ev parker and mitch 2016 and the triplet energy of aq2s 258 kj mol loeff et al 1983 and cbbp 286 kj mol hurley et al 1988 are higher than that of most triplets within cdom 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 zhou et al 2019 as well additionally cdom induced reaction with atrazine is less efficient compared to aq2s and cbbp because it is evident that triplet 3aq2s and 3cbbp might be more reactive than the average 3cdom carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 arnold et al 2017 characterizing 3cdom and defining the one electron reduction potential in the excited triplet cdom however is difficult because of the variety of chromophores in dom mcneill and canonica 2016 canonica and laubscher 2008b thus it is still necessary to evaluate which cdom proxy is most appropriate to assess the reactivity of 3cdom with atrazine evidence suggests that dom photosensitized loss of atrazine is dependent on the dom type and concentration rejto et al 1983 hapeman et al 1998 zeng et al 2002 burkhard and guth 1976 torrents et al 1997 some 3dom surrogates cbbp hartenbach et al 2008 canonica and laubscher

et al 1983 and fulvic acid zeng et al 2002 it has also been reported that atrazine direct photolysis reaction was suppressed by the addition of dissolved organic carbon torrents et al 1997 karpuzcu et al 2016 found that dom from prairie pothole lakes also served as an antioxidant when cbbp was used as the sensitizer in atrazine indirect photolysis which is consistent with previous results canonica and laubscher 2008b the inhibition of triplet induced oxidation by dom involves reduction of the intermediate oxidation products back to their parent compounds canonica and laubscher 2008b furthermore dom acted as a reactive species scavenger and light screening agent to suppress the atrazine loss wenk et al 2011 wenk et al 2013 the triplet induced oxidation mechanism was different from that of the direct photolysis and oh mediated reaction because some products of the triplet state induced reaction were 2 chloro 4 6 diamino 1 3 5 triazine and ammeline and these were not found in the other two processes marchetti et al 2013 a clear understanding of how different dom structural moieties impact on the rate of phototransformation of atrazine would be helpful in predicting the fate and mechanism of atrazine indirect photolysis hence employing well defined photosensitizers to mimic photosensitization efficiency might provide insight into the role of 3cdom and help in the assessment of the reactivity of atrazine associated with the photophysical properties of photosensitizers when studying triplet state 3cdom it is important to account for the production of other reactive species that are formed including 1o2 zepp et al 1987 latch and mcneill 2006 and oh apell and mcneill 2019 canonica 2007 standard practice is to use quenchers to eliminate the reactions of these species but evidence suggests the quenchers are not as selective as desired and their quenching in the presence of model sensitizers has not been thoroughly explored minella et al 2018 found that furfuryl alcohol ffa one electron reduction potential 0 9 v kim et al 2017 and sodium azide nan3 one electron reduction potential 1 3 v alfassi et al 1987 acting as an 1o2 probe and scavengers quenchers respectively will react quench the triplet 3cbbp one electron oxidation potential 1 84 v mcneill and canonica 2016 which may skew the results of scavengers quenchers experiments when elucidating the atrazine 3cbbp mediated reaction pathway minella et al 2018 thus the production of downstream species from model sensitizers and conceivable interactions with quencher moieties needs to be considered in the present study the quantum yields for atrazine direct photolysis under simulated and natural sunlight were compared once the direct photolysis rate was established various triplet sensitizers were tested to discern the effects of triplet character triplet energy and triplet reduction potentials on reaction with atrazine the results with the model sensitizers are then compared to a nom isolate as well as

cosit lc 18 db column using the methods in table a8 1 of the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis and quantum yield the minimal spectral overlap for atrazine with either simulated or natural sunlight fig 1 may explain the limited and inconsistent direct photolysis data in the literature fig 2 shows the loss of atrazine versus the loss of the actinometer quantum yields were calculated by using the slopes in fig 2 the molar absorptivity and lamp irradiance as described in section a3 of the sm the calculated quantum yields of direct photolysis for atrazine were 0 00437 mol einstein 1 for sunlight and 0 0196 mol einstein 1 in the solar simulator there is evidence that the quantum yield of atrazine is wavelength dependent so one possibility is that the light between 275 290 nm present in the solar simulator output affects the value alternatively clouds or aerosols present in the outdoor experiments which were not included in the modeled spectrum could have impacted the outdoor value the calculated quantum yield 0 0196 mol einstein 1 in the present study is similar to a previously reported value 0 0158 mol einstein 1 marchetti et al 2013 upon ultraviolet b 290 320 nm irradiation and both values are lower than the 254 nm quantum yield 0 035 0 060 mol einstein 1 beltran et al 1993 de laat et al 1997a hessler et al 1993 khan et al 2014 prosen and zupancic kralj 2005 sanches et al 2010a stefan and bolton 2005 silva et al 2014a nick et al 1992 tace et al 1992 the half life t1 2 for atrazine direct photolysis under natural sunlight in this study is 96 2 days and previously reported direct photolysis half lives in natural environment exposed to natural sunlight ranged from 42 5 d 95 d navarro et al 2004 konstantinou et al 2001 the consistent half life data suggest that the quantum yield found herein is reasonable 3 2 indirect photolysis with model photosensitizers it is well established that ketones with the lowest n π triplet state strong photosensitizers are more reactive than those with the lowest π π triplet state weak photosensitizers wagner and park 2017 wagner et al 1973 for example the n π state of a carbonyl triplet is much more reactive than the π π state in direct hydrogen abstraction reactions wagner 1976 the π π states are usually inefficient in electron transfer induced photoreduction processes scaiano 1973 the n π configuration favors both inter system crossing isc and high t1 reactivity t1 first excited triplet state while the π π configuration is associated with a longer excited life time lower isc quantum yields and reduced photochemical reactivity maddigapu et al 2010b in the series of experiments under air saturated conditions the fastest transformations of atrazine were observed in aq2s and cbbp solutions table 1 with an overall trend of aq2s cbbp bp 3 map rb 2 an mb with mb the rate constant for atrazine was not different than that without a sensitizer when sparging with n2 atrazine reaction rates were substantially faster by 1 2 to 10 5 times and the overall trend for the sensitizers was similar bp cbbp aq2s 3 map rb 2 an mb this indicates that 1 the triplet sensitizers facilitate the degradation of atrazine and 2 the removal of oxygen a triplet quencher substantially increases the concentration of the triplet excited states that react with atrazine it is not expected that 1o2 plays a role given the low rate constant for reaction with atrazine 4 104 m 1 s 1 marchetti et al 2013 it is also noteworthy that removal of oxygen does not affect the rate constant of atrazine when it is photolyzed without sensitizer indicating that the self sensitization by 3atz is negligible plots used to determine the rate constants for atrazine and model photosensitizers are provided in the sm section a9 it is to be noted here that these are comparisons of the pseudo first order rate constants because the second rate constants of atrazine with photosensitizers were not measured in this study thus the reactivity trend is a combination of the second order rate constant and the steady state concentration of the triplet excited state the second order rate constants for atrazine reaction with aq2s and cbbp have been reported katz aq2s 1 4 109 l mol 1 s 1 and katz cbbp 0 7 109 l mol 1 s 1 carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 using these values the steady state concentration of the triplet photosensitizers in our experiments are calculated based on the equation k katz s 3s 3cbbp 6 31 10 13 mol l 1 3aq2s 2 78 10 13 mol l 1 the reported pseudo first order constants are positively related to 3s and 3s depends on i the absorption ability of s the cdom proxy ii its inter system crossing quantum yield and iii its deactivation rate constant a complete comparison of the reactivity of photosensitizers with atrazine will required the second order rate constants to be measured in the future to elucidate the relative reactivity of photosensitizers an alternative method was used to normalize the pseudo first order rate constants by the light absorption rate details in section a4 of the sm the ranking of the normalized first order rate constant under deoxygenated conditions removing any effect of differential quenching rates by oxygen is cbbp bp aq2s rb 3 map 2 an mb because the intersystem crossing yield and the quenching effects by o2 have minor impacts on the ranking because the values of φisc and kq by oxygen are similar for all of the sensitizers table a4 2 in the sm this ranking is a reasonable means to assess the relative reactivity of the photosensitizers from this ranking 3cbbp has higher than 3aq2s which is consistent with our data showing 3cbbp reacts more rapidly with atrazine than 3aq2s 3 map seems to be an outliner among the proxies because it has lower reactivity yet high triplet energy and a high intersystem crossing yield which may suggest that n π π π configurations are an important parameter to consider in selecting proxies triplet photosensitizers are thought to oxidize pollutants via energy transfer electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and proton coupled electron transfer or related mechanisms arnold 2014 electron transfer based oxidations however are the dominant reaction types of triplet induced reactions for most aquatic pollutants the triplet energy and triplet reduction potential were used to evaluate the reactivity of the model triplet sensitizers toward atrazine the three sensitizers with n π triplet configuration energy of 250 kj mol 1 and reduction potential 1 6 ev aq2s cbbp and bp led to the fastest atrazine loss which substantially increased 4 to 10 fold after n2 sparging the three sensitizers with π π configuration energy of 250 kj mol 1 and reduction potential 1 6 ev rb mb and 2 an had more limited enhancement of reactivity relative to direct photolysis and more modest enhancements after n2 purging 4 fold 3 map which has a high triplet energy 303 kj mol 1 and triplet reduction potential 1 64 ev with a π π configuration gave results more consistent with the other π π sensitizers rb mb and 2 an versus the n π sensitizers with similar energy reduction potential aq2s cbbp and bp overall it could be deduced that less electrophilic π π triplets generally have lower efficiency of photooxidation of pollutants while n π triplets with high triplet energy and triplet state reduction potential favor interaction with electron donors and react faster with pollutants via further quenching and photodegradation cohen et al 1972 thus it appears that both triplet state configuration and thermodynamic properties triplet energy and triplet reduction potential are important in the reactivity of photosensitizers with atrazine as for the role of the excited triplet state of photosensitizers the triplet photosensitizers can transfer energy to o2 producing singlet oxygen 1o2 and directly react with atrazine in solutions via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction mechanism because the rate of reaction of 1o2 with atrazine is negligible o2 served as a triplet quencher of the sensitizers which suppresses the triplet induced reactions and explains the substantial differences in the atrazine loss between the air saturated and deoxygenated conditions the relatively high singlet oxygen quantum yield of rb ϕ 0 75 wilkinson et al 1993 and mb ϕ 0 37 0 56 bilski et al 1996 may be partially responsible for the low efficiency of atrazine phototransformation under aerated conditions important information is also derived from the rate constants for the loss of the photosensitizers under air saturated condition cbbp bp and mb reacted slowly k 0 14 h 1 table 1 3 map rb aq2s and 2 an however reacted quickly k 0 62 h 1 table 1 after sparging with n2 the rate of 2 an cbbp and bp photodegradation increased while the decompositions of other photosensitizers aq2s 3 map rb and mb were depressed detailed kinetic data are provided in section a9 of the sm besides being a triplet quencher oxygen may also recycle the sensitizer via reaction with the radical anion of the sensitizer to form o2 reactions 1 and 2 1 3s atz s atz 2 s o2 s o2 if this reaction occurs there would be less loss of the sensitizer under air saturated conditions wenk and canonica 2012 as seen for cbbp bp and 2 an although this photosensitizer recycling may lead to enhanced atrazine loss the results after n2 sparging indicate the main role for o2 is as a triplet quencher given that atrazine loss increases for all sensitizers after n2 sparging the different results from aq2s and 2 an compared to other triplet sensitizers with similar configuration merits further discussion aq2s has unique hydroxylating ability and degrades ten times faster than cbbp or bp under oxygenated conditions it is possible for aq2s to react with h2o and with itself in addition to atz additionally o2 may catalyze aq2s degradation this combination of reactions has the potential to influence the processing of atz in the presence of 3aq2s for aq2s the loss rate is slower under deoxygenated conditions unlike cbbp or bp and this is consistent with previous results maurino et al 2008 the

product there are two other relevant transformation pathways mediated by o2 even though 3aq2s reacts with h2o faster than with o2 loeff et al 1983 o2 mediated aq2s decomposition may occur via formation of unstable exciplexes of the aq2s radical anion and oxygen reactions 7 and 8 maurino et al 2008 triplet 3aq2s is quenched by o2 kq o2 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 loeff et al 1983 and might induce the production of the subsequent aq2s hydroxylated deratives it has been suggested o2 catalyzes the aq2s transformation by enhancing the rate of formation of hydroxylating agents alegria et al 1997 alegrı

different from the result observed for phenol maurino et al 2008 and 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide alegrı a et al 1999 it is probably due to the different reactions mechanisms and roles of oxygen atz undergoes dealkylation and forms 4 amino 2 chloro 6 isopropylamino 1 3 5 triazine when triplet 3aq2s reacts with atz marchetti et al 2013 where o2 plays the role of the quencher and suppresses the atz loss in air saturated solution in the reaction with phenol and 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide oxygen might serve as a reactant in the hydroxylation reaction to produce oh adducts reaction 12 which accounts for the lower efficiency of phenol 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide loss with o2 is removed 12 3aq2s o2 h2o p p oh product interestingly 2 an is the exception for a π π state photosensitizers with high singlet oxygen yield ϕ 0 71 wilkinson et al 1993 compared to other π π photosensitizers 2 an leads to a similar rate of atrazine loss and an enhanced rate of 2 an loss when comparing air

an 2 ano 1 48 ev barwise et al 1978 it could be inferred that triplet 32 an could lead to the self sensitized transformation of 2 an which may be important in the absence of dissolved oxygen because the observed 2 an loss increased upon sparging with n2 further comparing the rate constant of 2 an direct photolysis k2 an 1 31 0 16 h 1 in the air saturated borate buffer solution see table 2 below atz could react with triplet 3 2 an and atz could oxidize the 2 an radical anion back to the parent 2 an reaction 16 and 17 which might account for the higher 2 an loss rate and mild atz photolysis

atrazine n π vs π π triplet configurations a series of selective quenching experiments were conducted in the bp n π and 2 an π π mediated reactions with atrazine a substantial decrease in atrazine loss was observed upon addition of the quenchers particularly hda his and nan3 for bp fig 3 with minimal effects on 2 an interestingly his and nan3 operate as 1o2 quenchers ffa functions as an 1o2 probe and thus a quencher and ipa hydrogen donor functions as an oh quencher all of these quenchers however depressed the oxidative efficiency of 3bp induced reactions similar experiments were conducted by minella et al 2018 and maddigapu et al 2010 the quenching rate constants of the triplet 3aq2s maddigapu et al 2010a and 3cbbp minella et al 2018 by ffa and n3 were reported to be above 109 l mol 1 s 1 which is possibly caused by the low one electron oxidation potential of ffa and n3 0 9 ev alfassi et al 1987 and 1 3 ev respectively kim et al 2017 the effect of the quenchers on the decay of the photosensitizers was also assessed table 2 detailed kinetic data are provided in sections a10 note that bp exhibited substantially higher loss rate constants upon addition of the quenchers hda his and ipa making it evident that atrazine loss was suppressed fig 3 in part to destruction of the bp sensitizer the 2 an transformation was significantly depressed with the addition of quenchers which suggest that 2 an is decomposed by self sensitization and the quenchers deactivate the triplet 32 an and hinder this process 2 an radical anion oxidation by oxygen is probably a minor pathway for 2 an loss reaction 15 based on the findings of this study assuming that quenchers are solely reacting with the targeted ppri and not affecting the model sensitizer is likely to result in inconsistent or incorrect findings this will be especially true if comparing the results of different sensitizers or results with sensitizers to those with nom where the effects of the quenchers on the 3cdom may not be as pronounced or different care must be taken in the application of the selective quenchers 3 4 photolysis in nom containing systems a summary of the water chemistry of natural water samples is shown in table a7 1 of the sm the ph is relatively consistent ranging from 7 09 8 72 among the water samples dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in ppl and upper red 2 above 24 mg c l are higher than zumbrota 1 low nitrate and 2 high nitrate as well as mrw below 10 mg c l specific conductance was higher in zumbrota 1 zumbrota 2 and ppl 8 than mrw nitrate levels in ppl 8 0 2 mg l and mrw below detection limit were much lower than in zumbrota effluent in general the 3dom photo reactivity varies with dom source allochthonous and autochthonous molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 and composition mccabe and arnold 2017 the formation rate of triplet 3dom is positively related to doc concentration dom source and composition is an important factor however in controlling the triplet 3dom yield which is independent of doc concentration mccabe and arnold 2017 overall the source quality and composition of dom controls the formation of ppris and thus influences the fate of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems dom may lower photolysis rates via light screening leifer 1988 schwarzenbach et al 2016 light screening factors table a5 1 in sm were calculated to evaluate the light attenuation effect all the samples showed the minor 5 effects except upper red 2 44 4 and ppl p8 13 9 it is suggested that upper red 2 might limit the fate of atrazine direct photolysis and ppris induced indirect photolysis to higher extent compared to ppl p8 due to the low efficiency of atrazine direct photolysis the light screening effect by cdom is likely minimal for zumbrota 1 and 2 and the triplet 3cdom induced reaction might play the main role of in atrazine transformation when comparing the photoreactivities of dom and efom the atrazine loss rate ranged from 2 32 0 22 10 2 h 1 to 3 37 0 25 10 2 h 1 indicating at most there was a factor of 2 enhancement compare to direct photolysis in the borate buffer table 1 after sparging with n2 there was either no effect or a slight decrease in rate constant table 3 which could be interpreted that 3cdom has a minimal effect on atrazine in these samples when comparing the one electron oxidation potential of atrazine 2 41 ev arnold 2014 to the triplet oxidation potential of 3dom 1 4 1 9 ev mcneill and canonica 2016 the oxidization of atrazine by triplet 3dom could be quite slow the inhibitory effect induced by electron donating moiety within dom canonica and laubscher 2008b wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 would be also counterbalanced by the oxidization of atrazine by triplet 3dom experiments using phenol as a model antioxidant demonstrate the potential for such an inhibitory effect figure a6 1 in the sm although it has been reported that efom has a higher quantum yield for 3efom production with higher energy than 3nom o connor et al 2019 no difference was observed for atrazine when adding quenchers hda his and ipa into the samples the rate constants were lower than those of the quencher free solutions as shown in fig 4 figure a10 1 and figure a11 3 of the sm however no obvious evidence of the decrease in the atrazine direct photolysis with the addition of ipa and his could be ascribed to the antioxidant activity of the quenchers because of the high experimental uncertainty it is unclear why hda has such a dramatic effect on atrazine photolysis given that deoxygenation experiments indicate triplets are of minor importance it is suggested that 3dom and hydroxyl radical also play a role in the fate of atrazine in the presence of dom efom because hda and ipa quench the 3dom and hydroxyl radical respectively and thus suppress indirect photolysis for his the likely explanation for the decreased rate constant is the reaction with an atz intermediate to re form the atz parent compound and thus to lower the apparent rate of loss because reaction of atz with 1o2 is negligible marchetti et al 2013 4 conclusion seven model sensitizers and dissolved organic matter from different sources were adopted to investigate the fate of atrazine in surface water environment this work provides some new insights in the photodegradation fate of atrazine in surface water the quantum yield of atrazine in natural sunlight is 5 times smaller than that in the solar simulator suggesting that the quantum yield may depend on the wavelength however spiking atrazine into most dom containing waters increased the atrazine loss rate 1 5 to 2 fold which means that direct photolysis and indirect photolysis are the substantial pathways in controlling the fate of atrazine in aquatic environment for model sensitizers the triplet excited state induces phototransformation of atz the energy electron configuration of the triplet model sensitizers and triplet intersystem crossing quantum yield are dictating the reactivity of cdom towards atrazine 2 an appears be a reasonable cdom proxy to assess the reactivity of 3cdom to atrazine because it has similar triplet intersystem quantum yield and thus similar performance of atrazine depletion with cdom other model sensitizers also have utility and the choice may be contaminant dependent more data on the photochemistry of 2 an triplet 32 an interacting with o2 pollutants and 2 an itself are needed to evaluate the net photosensitization capacity exactly the results on the selective quencher experiments for model photosensitizers and the target compounds could be substantially misleading due to the unexpected reactions with other photochemically produced reactive intermediates and transformation intermediates care must be taken in the application of quenchers the low efficiency of triplet 3cdom srnom river lake water and wastewater effluent in atrazine indirect photolysis suggests that the quality of the cdom and the energy of the triplets it forms will dictate the importance of 3cdom reaction with atrazine declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17249,atrazine a widely used herbicide is susceptible to photolysis the role of triplet excited states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter 3cdom in the photolysis of atrazine however is not well understood the direct photolysis of atrazine under irradiation sources natural sunlight environmentally relevant simulated solar light and its indirect photochemical reactivity with model triplet photosensitizers benzophenone 2 acetonaphthone 3 methoxy acetophenone 4 carboxybenzophenone rose bengal methylene blue and anthraquinone 2 sulphonate was investigated the reactivity of the model sensitizers and dom suwannee river natural organic matter river lake water and wastewater effluent were compared the direct photolysis quantum yield was determined as 0 0196 mol einstein 1 in a solar simulator and 0 00437 mol einstein 1 under natural sunlight considerable photosensitization was induced by triplet state n π model sensitizers while insignificant effects on atrazine loss were discerned in natural organic matter even when oxygen a triplet quencher was removed the triplet sensitizers benzophenone and 2 acetylnaphthone reacted with l histidine and 2 propanol that were intended to quench scavenge 1o2 and hydroxyl radical oh respectively and benzophenone reacted with nan3 as a 1o2 scavenger and furfuryl alcohol as a 1o2 trapping agent indicating quenchers may have unanticipated effects when using model sensitizers atrazine loss via reaction with 3dom will be relevant only in selected conditions and this work provides a more comprehensive view on the use of model photosensitizers to mimic triplet 3dom keywords atrazine triplet dissolved organic matter 2 acetylnaphthone triplet state configuration triplet reduction potential 1 introduction atrazine 2

2011 atrazine and its metabolites persist in the environment for decades and are resistant to microbial degradation jablonowski et al 2011 thus it is still important to understand the processes affecting the fate of atrazine photochemical reactions in surface waters play an important role in the degradation of micropollutants fenner et al 2013 these reactions involve both direct and indirect photolysis for direct photolysis to occur the absorption spectrum of the pollutant must overlap with the wavelengths of a given light source much past research on the photolysis of atrazine has involved the use of artificial light sources the quantum yield φ which is the ratio of the molecules degraded per number of photons absorbed of atrazine in the uvb region was measured as 0 0158 mol

that the wavelengths to which atrazine is exposed may affect the quantum yield and experiments in sunlight are needed to accurately assess its environmental fate in indirect photolysis a photosensitizer such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom becomes electronically excited by light absorption and either reacts directly in its excited state with a pollutant or produces

1992 kamiya and kameyama 1998 despite the fact that cdom acts as a photosensitizer to enhance the efficiency of pollutant depletion via triplet induced oxidation or other produced reactive species initiated reactions it also inhibits the oxidation of pollutants via light attenuation radical scavenging and a back reduction mechanism canonica and laubscher 2008b 3cdom is an important reactive

concentrations of 10 13 to 10 15 m zepp et al 1985 the reduction potential e o 3 s s of triplet cdom has been estimated as 1 36 1 95 ev canonica et al 2000 and it is estimated that about 15 53 of the 3cdom population has energy above 250 kj mol 1 depending on the dom source material zepp et al 1985 lower energy 3cdom participates in the energy transfer reaction with molecular oxygen to produce 1o2 while high energy 3cdom is thought to be involved in both the production of 1o2 and electron transfer and isomerization reactions tinnacher and honeyman 2007 in an electron transfer process the kinetics of the electron transfer reaction could be determined by the triplet reduction potential of 3cdom eberson 1982 it is well known that excited ketones with n π state are less selective than those with π π state for hydrogen abstraction wagner and park 2017 wagner et al 1973 eberson 1982 and charge transfer khan and cohen 1991 the higher proportion of non bonding n to π bonding π character in the lower energy singly occupied molecular orbital somo in the excited states would contribute to the higher reactivity in charge transfer and h abstraction processes mcneill and canonica 2016 to assess photochemical reactivity the excited triplet state reduction potential e o 3 s s and n π π π framework may be critical parameters for interpreting reactivity mcneill and canonica 2016 loeff et al 1993 it is well known that the groups present in cdom are electron accepting moieties aromatic ketones aldehydes and quinones and electron donating moieties phenols mcneill and canonica 2016 marchetti et al 2013 loeff et al 1993 some works have been previously carried out to probe the role of 3cdom natural water and model photosensitizers in the indirect photolysis of atrazine suggesting the 3cdom induced reaction is an important photodegradation pathway of atrazine in surface waters carena and vione 2020 carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 minero et al 1992 prosen and zupancic kralj 2005 rebelo et al 2006 zeng and arnold 2013 furthermore 3cdom surrogates have been utilized to assess their reactivity with atrazine and measure the second order reaction rate constants of atrazine with excited triplet states of anthraquinone 2 sulphonate aq2s and 4 carboxybenzophenone cbbp the results are consistent with those obtained for the reaction of atrazine with cdom present in natural waters suggesting that both aq2s and cbbp are good cdom proxies for atrazine indirect photodegradation carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 however the triplet one electron reduction potential of aq2s 2 28 ev and cbbp 1 84 ev mcneill and canonica 2016 are higher than that of cdom 1 6 1 8 ev parker and mitch 2016 and the triplet energy of aq2s 258 kj mol loeff et al 1983 and cbbp 286 kj mol hurley et al 1988 are higher than that of most triplets within cdom 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 zhou et al 2019 as well additionally cdom induced reaction with atrazine is less efficient compared to aq2s and cbbp because it is evident that triplet 3aq2s and 3cbbp might be more reactive than the average 3cdom carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 arnold et al 2017 characterizing 3cdom and defining the one electron reduction potential in the excited triplet cdom however is difficult because of the variety of chromophores in dom mcneill and canonica 2016 canonica and laubscher 2008b thus it is still necessary to evaluate which cdom proxy is most appropriate to assess the reactivity of 3cdom with atrazine evidence suggests that dom photosensitized loss of atrazine is dependent on the dom type and concentration rejto et al 1983 hapeman et al 1998 zeng et al 2002 burkhard and guth 1976 torrents et al 1997 some 3dom surrogates cbbp hartenbach et al 2008 canonica and laubscher

et al 1983 and fulvic acid zeng et al 2002 it has also been reported that atrazine direct photolysis reaction was suppressed by the addition of dissolved organic carbon torrents et al 1997 karpuzcu et al 2016 found that dom from prairie pothole lakes also served as an antioxidant when cbbp was used as the sensitizer in atrazine indirect photolysis which is consistent with previous results canonica and laubscher 2008b the inhibition of triplet induced oxidation by dom involves reduction of the intermediate oxidation products back to their parent compounds canonica and laubscher 2008b furthermore dom acted as a reactive species scavenger and light screening agent to suppress the atrazine loss wenk et al 2011 wenk et al 2013 the triplet induced oxidation mechanism was different from that of the direct photolysis and oh mediated reaction because some products of the triplet state induced reaction were 2 chloro 4 6 diamino 1 3 5 triazine and ammeline and these were not found in the other two processes marchetti et al 2013 a clear understanding of how different dom structural moieties impact on the rate of phototransformation of atrazine would be helpful in predicting the fate and mechanism of atrazine indirect photolysis hence employing well defined photosensitizers to mimic photosensitization efficiency might provide insight into the role of 3cdom and help in the assessment of the reactivity of atrazine associated with the photophysical properties of photosensitizers when studying triplet state 3cdom it is important to account for the production of other reactive species that are formed including 1o2 zepp et al 1987 latch and mcneill 2006 and oh apell and mcneill 2019 canonica 2007 standard practice is to use quenchers to eliminate the reactions of these species but evidence suggests the quenchers are not as selective as desired and their quenching in the presence of model sensitizers has not been thoroughly explored minella et al 2018 found that furfuryl alcohol ffa one electron reduction potential 0 9 v kim et al 2017 and sodium azide nan3 one electron reduction potential 1 3 v alfassi et al 1987 acting as an 1o2 probe and scavengers quenchers respectively will react quench the triplet 3cbbp one electron oxidation potential 1 84 v mcneill and canonica 2016 which may skew the results of scavengers quenchers experiments when elucidating the atrazine 3cbbp mediated reaction pathway minella et al 2018 thus the production of downstream species from model sensitizers and conceivable interactions with quencher moieties needs to be considered in the present study the quantum yields for atrazine direct photolysis under simulated and natural sunlight were compared once the direct photolysis rate was established various triplet sensitizers were tested to discern the effects of triplet character triplet energy and triplet reduction potentials on reaction with atrazine the results with the model sensitizers are then compared to a nom isolate as well as photolysis in collected natural waters and wastewater effluent to assess a range of nom compositions additionally experiments were undertaken to evaluate the possible effects of quenchers for 3cdom

desired ppri zeng and arnold 2012 subsamples were taken at selected time points during the course of the experiment and the concentrations of compounds atz bp 2 an were measured via hplc to

of rb and mb concentrations to follow their photolysis kinetics as described in section a6 1 of the sm measurements of the atz spectrum fig 1 were used to calculate the molar extinction coefficient as a function of wavelength concentrations of atrazine aq2s cbbp bp 3 map 2 an ffa and pnap were measured via high pressure liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 series ascentis rp amide column or cosit lc 18 db column using the methods in table a8 1 of the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 direct photolysis and quantum yield the minimal spectral overlap for atrazine with either simulated or natural sunlight fig 1 may explain the limited and inconsistent direct photolysis data in the literature fig 2 shows the loss of atrazine versus the loss of the actinometer quantum yields were calculated by using the slopes in fig 2 the molar absorptivity and lamp irradiance as described in section a3 of the sm the calculated quantum yields of direct photolysis for atrazine were 0 00437 mol einstein 1 for sunlight and 0 0196 mol einstein 1 in the solar simulator there is evidence that the quantum yield of atrazine is wavelength dependent so one possibility is that the light between 275 290 nm present in the solar simulator output affects the value alternatively clouds or aerosols present in the outdoor experiments which were not included in the modeled spectrum could have impacted the outdoor value the calculated quantum yield 0 0196 mol einstein 1 in the present study is similar to a previously reported value 0 0158 mol einstein 1 marchetti et al 2013 upon ultraviolet b 290 320 nm irradiation and both values are lower than the 254 nm quantum yield 0 035 0 060 mol einstein 1 beltran et al 1993 de laat et al 1997a hessler et al 1993 khan et al 2014 prosen and zupancic kralj 2005 sanches et al 2010a stefan and bolton 2005 silva et al 2014a nick et al 1992 tace et al 1992 the half life t1 2 for atrazine direct photolysis under natural sunlight in this study is 96 2 days and previously reported direct photolysis half lives in natural environment exposed to natural sunlight ranged from 42 5 d 95 d navarro et al 2004 konstantinou et al 2001 the consistent half life data suggest that the quantum yield found herein is reasonable 3 2 indirect photolysis with model photosensitizers it is well established that ketones with the lowest n π triplet state strong photosensitizers are more reactive than those with the lowest π π triplet state weak photosensitizers wagner and park 2017 wagner et al 1973 for example the n π state of a carbonyl triplet is much more reactive than the π π state in direct hydrogen abstraction reactions wagner 1976 the π π states are usually inefficient in electron transfer induced photoreduction processes scaiano 1973 the n π configuration favors both inter system crossing isc and high t1 reactivity t1 first excited triplet state while the π π configuration is associated with a longer excited life time lower isc quantum yields and reduced photochemical reactivity maddigapu et al 2010b in the series of experiments under air saturated conditions the fastest transformations of atrazine were observed in aq2s and cbbp solutions table 1 with an overall trend of aq2s cbbp bp 3 map rb 2 an mb with mb the rate constant for atrazine was not different than that without a sensitizer when sparging with n2 atrazine reaction rates were substantially faster by 1 2 to 10 5 times and the overall trend for the sensitizers was similar bp cbbp aq2s 3 map rb 2 an mb this indicates that 1 the triplet sensitizers facilitate the degradation of atrazine and 2 the removal of oxygen a triplet quencher substantially increases the concentration of the triplet excited states that react with atrazine it is not expected that 1o2 plays a role given the low rate constant for reaction with atrazine 4 104 m 1 s 1 marchetti et al 2013 it is also noteworthy that removal of oxygen does not affect the rate constant of atrazine when it is photolyzed without sensitizer indicating that the self sensitization by 3atz is negligible plots used to determine the rate constants for atrazine and model photosensitizers are provided in the sm section a9 it is to be noted here that these are comparisons of the pseudo first order rate constants because the second rate constants of atrazine with photosensitizers were not measured in this study thus the reactivity trend is a combination of the second order rate constant and the steady state concentration of the triplet excited state the second order rate constants for atrazine reaction with aq2s and cbbp have been reported katz aq2s 1 4 109 l mol 1 s 1 and katz cbbp 0 7 109 l mol 1 s 1 carena et al 2019 marchetti et al 2013 using these values the steady state concentration of the triplet photosensitizers in our experiments are calculated based on the equation k katz s 3s 3cbbp 6 31 10 13 mol l 1 3aq2s 2 78 10 13 mol l 1 the reported pseudo first order constants are positively related to 3s and 3s depends on i the absorption ability of s the cdom proxy ii its inter system crossing quantum yield and iii its deactivation rate constant a complete comparison of the reactivity of photosensitizers with atrazine will required the second order rate constants to be measured in the future to elucidate the relative reactivity of photosensitizers an alternative method was used to normalize the pseudo first order rate constants by the light absorption rate details in section a4 of the sm the ranking of the normalized first order rate constant under deoxygenated conditions removing any effect of differential quenching rates by oxygen is cbbp bp aq2s rb 3 map 2 an mb because the intersystem crossing yield and the quenching effects by o2 have minor impacts on the ranking because the values of φisc and kq by oxygen are similar for all of the sensitizers table a4 2 in the sm this ranking is a reasonable means to assess the relative reactivity of the photosensitizers from this ranking 3cbbp has higher than 3aq2s which is consistent with our data showing 3cbbp reacts more rapidly with atrazine than 3aq2s 3 map seems to be an outliner among the proxies because it has lower reactivity yet high triplet energy and a high intersystem crossing yield which may suggest that n π π π configurations are an important parameter to consider in selecting proxies triplet photosensitizers are thought to oxidize pollutants via energy transfer electron transfer hydrogen abstraction and proton coupled electron transfer or related mechanisms arnold 2014 electron transfer based oxidations however are the dominant reaction types of triplet induced reactions for most aquatic pollutants the triplet energy and triplet reduction potential were used to evaluate the reactivity of the model triplet sensitizers toward atrazine the three sensitizers with n π triplet configuration energy of 250 kj mol 1 and reduction potential 1 6 ev aq2s cbbp and bp led to the fastest atrazine loss which substantially increased 4 to 10 fold after n2 sparging the three sensitizers with π π configuration energy of 250 kj mol 1 and reduction potential 1 6 ev rb mb and 2 an had more limited enhancement of reactivity relative to direct photolysis and more modest enhancements after n2 purging 4 fold 3 map which has a high triplet energy 303 kj mol 1 and triplet reduction potential 1 64 ev with a π π configuration gave results more consistent with the other π π sensitizers rb mb and 2 an versus the n π sensitizers with similar energy reduction potential aq2s cbbp and bp overall it could be deduced that less electrophilic π π triplets generally have lower efficiency of photooxidation of pollutants while n π triplets with high triplet energy and triplet state reduction potential favor interaction with electron donors and react faster with pollutants via further quenching and photodegradation cohen et al 1972 thus it appears that both triplet state configuration and thermodynamic properties triplet energy and triplet reduction potential are important in the reactivity of photosensitizers with atrazine as for the role of the excited triplet state of photosensitizers the triplet photosensitizers can transfer energy to o2 producing singlet oxygen 1o2 and directly react with atrazine in solutions via electron transfer or hydrogen abstraction mechanism because the rate of reaction of 1o2 with atrazine is negligible o2 served as a triplet quencher of the sensitizers which suppresses the triplet induced reactions and explains the substantial differences in the atrazine loss between the air saturated and deoxygenated conditions the relatively high singlet oxygen quantum yield of rb ϕ 0 75 wilkinson et al 1993 and mb ϕ 0 37 0 56 bilski et al 1996 may be partially responsible for the low efficiency of atrazine phototransformation under aerated conditions important information is also derived from the rate constants for the loss of the photosensitizers under air saturated condition cbbp bp and mb reacted slowly k 0 14 h 1 table 1 3 map rb aq2s and 2 an however reacted quickly k 0 62 h 1 table 1 after sparging with n2 the rate of 2 an cbbp and bp photodegradation increased while the decompositions of other photosensitizers aq2s 3 map rb and mb were depressed detailed kinetic data are provided in section a9 of the sm besides being a triplet quencher oxygen may also recycle the sensitizer via reaction with the radical anion of the sensitizer to form o2 reactions 1 and 2 1 3s atz s atz 2 s o2 s o2 if this reaction occurs there would be less loss of the sensitizer under air saturated conditions wenk and canonica 2012 as seen for cbbp bp and 2 an although this photosensitizer recycling may lead to enhanced atrazine loss the results after n2 sparging indicate the main role for o2 is as a triplet quencher given that atrazine loss increases for all sensitizers after n2 sparging the different results from aq2s and 2 an compared to other triplet sensitizers with similar configuration merits further discussion aq2s has unique hydroxylating ability and degrades ten times faster than cbbp or bp under oxygenated conditions it is possible for aq2s to react with h2o and with itself in addition to atz additionally o2 may catalyze aq2s degradation this combination of reactions has the potential to influence the processing of atz in the presence of 3aq2s for aq2s the loss rate is slower under deoxygenated conditions unlike cbbp or bp and this is consistent with previous results maurino et al 2008 the reactions of 3aq2s with water atz and ground state aq2s will lead to aq2s phototransformation reaction 3 4 5 6 3 3aq2s aq2s aq2s aq2s 4 3aq2s h2o oh aq2soh product 5 3aq2s atz aq2s atz 6 aq2s aq2soh product there are two other relevant transformation pathways mediated by o2 even though 3aq2s reacts with h2o faster than with o2 loeff et al 1983 o2 mediated aq2s decomposition may occur via formation of unstable exciplexes of the aq2s radical anion and oxygen reactions 7 and 8 maurino et al 2008 triplet 3aq2s is quenched by o2 kq o2 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 loeff et al 1983 and might induce the production of the subsequent aq2s hydroxylated deratives it has been suggested o2 catalyzes the aq2s transformation by enhancing the rate of formation of hydroxylating agents alegria et al 1997 alegrı a et al 1999 7 aq2s o2 aq2s o2 8 aq2s o2 productsaq2s 9 3aq2s o2 aq2soh product o2 the reformation of aq2s could occur in the absence of oxygen by recombination of aq2s and atz aq2s reactions 10 and 11 which might account for the lower efficiency of aq2s loss 10 aq2s atz aq2s atz 11 aq2s aq2s 2aq2s atz loss rate in the presence of aq2s solution is enhanced in the absence of oxygen which is different from the result observed for phenol maurino et al 2008 and 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide alegrı a et al 1999 it is probably due to the different reactions mechanisms and roles of oxygen atz undergoes dealkylation and forms 4 amino 2 chloro 6 isopropylamino 1 3 5 triazine when triplet 3aq2s reacts with atz marchetti et al 2013 where o2 plays the role of the quencher and suppresses the atz loss in air saturated solution in the reaction with phenol and 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide oxygen might serve as a reactant in the hydroxylation reaction to produce oh adducts reaction 12 which accounts for the lower efficiency of phenol 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline 1 oxide loss with o2 is removed 12 3aq2s o2 h2o p p oh product interestingly 2 an is the exception for a π π state photosensitizers with high singlet oxygen yield ϕ 0 71 wilkinson et al 1993 compared to other π π photosensitizers 2 an leads to a similar rate of atrazine loss and an enhanced rate of 2 an loss when comparing air

an 2 ano 1 48 ev barwise et al 1978 it could be inferred that triplet 32 an could lead to the self sensitized transformation of 2 an which may be important in the absence of dissolved oxygen because the observed 2 an loss increased upon sparging with n2 further comparing the rate constant of 2 an direct photolysis k2 an 1 31 0 16 h 1 in the air saturated borate buffer solution see table 2 below atz could react with triplet 3 2 an and atz could oxidize the 2 an radical anion back to the parent 2 an reaction 16 and 17 which might account for the higher 2 an loss rate and mild atz photolysis

atrazine n π vs π π triplet configurations a series of selective quenching experiments were conducted in the bp n π and 2 an π π mediated reactions with atrazine a substantial decrease in atrazine loss was observed upon addition of the quenchers particularly hda his and nan3 for bp fig 3 with minimal effects on 2 an interestingly his and nan3 operate as 1o2 quenchers ffa functions as an 1o2 probe and thus a quencher and ipa hydrogen donor functions as an oh quencher all of these quenchers however depressed the oxidative efficiency of 3bp induced reactions similar experiments were conducted by minella et al 2018 and maddigapu et al 2010 the quenching rate constants of the triplet 3aq2s maddigapu et al 2010a and 3cbbp minella et al 2018 by ffa and n3 were reported to be above 109 l mol 1 s 1 which is possibly caused by the low one electron oxidation potential of ffa and n3 0 9 ev alfassi et al 1987 and 1 3 ev respectively kim et al 2017 the effect of the quenchers on the decay of the photosensitizers was also assessed table 2 detailed kinetic data are provided in sections a10 note that bp exhibited substantially higher loss rate constants upon addition of the quenchers hda his and ipa making it evident that atrazine loss was suppressed fig 3 in part to destruction of the bp sensitizer the 2 an transformation was significantly depressed with the addition of quenchers which suggest that 2 an is decomposed by self sensitization and the quenchers deactivate the triplet 32 an and hinder this process 2 an radical anion oxidation by oxygen is probably a minor pathway for 2 an loss reaction 15 based on the findings of this study assuming that quenchers are solely reacting with the targeted ppri and not affecting the model sensitizer is likely to result in inconsistent or incorrect findings this will be especially true if comparing the results of different sensitizers or results with sensitizers to those with nom where the effects of the quenchers on the 3cdom may not be as pronounced or different care must be taken in the application of the selective quenchers 3 4 photolysis in nom containing systems a summary of the water chemistry of natural water samples is shown in table a7 1 of the sm the ph is relatively consistent ranging from 7 09 8 72 among the water samples dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in ppl and upper red 2 above 24 mg c l are higher than zumbrota 1 low nitrate and 2 high nitrate as well as mrw below 10 mg c l specific conductance was higher in zumbrota 1 zumbrota 2 and ppl 8 than mrw nitrate levels in ppl 8 0 2 mg l and mrw below detection limit were much lower than in zumbrota effluent in general the 3dom photo reactivity varies with dom source allochthonous and autochthonous molecular weight maizel and remucal 2017 and composition mccabe and arnold 2017 the formation rate of triplet 3dom is positively related to doc concentration dom source and composition is an important factor however in controlling the triplet 3dom yield which is independent of doc concentration mccabe and arnold 2017 overall the source quality and composition of dom controls the formation of ppris and thus influences the fate of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems dom may lower photolysis rates via light screening leifer 1988 schwarzenbach et al 2016 light screening factors table a5 1 in sm were calculated to evaluate the light attenuation effect all the samples showed the minor 5 effects except upper red 2 44 4 and ppl p8 13 9 it is suggested that upper red 2 might limit the fate of atrazine direct photolysis and ppris induced indirect photolysis to higher extent compared to ppl p8 due to the low efficiency of atrazine direct photolysis the light screening effect by cdom is likely minimal for zumbrota 1 and 2 and the triplet 3cdom induced reaction might play the main role of in atrazine transformation when comparing the photoreactivities of dom and efom the atrazine loss rate ranged from 2 32 0 22 10 2 h 1 to 3 37 0 25 10 2 h 1 indicating at most there was a factor of 2 enhancement compare to direct photolysis in the borate buffer table 1 after sparging with n2 there was either no effect or a slight decrease in rate constant table 3 which could be interpreted that 3cdom has a minimal effect on atrazine in these samples when comparing the one electron oxidation potential of atrazine 2 41 ev arnold 2014 to the triplet oxidation potential of 3dom 1 4 1 9 ev mcneill and canonica 2016 the oxidization of atrazine by triplet 3dom could be quite slow the inhibitory effect induced by electron donating moiety within dom canonica and laubscher 2008b wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 would be also counterbalanced by the oxidization of atrazine by triplet 3dom experiments using phenol as a model antioxidant demonstrate the potential for such an inhibitory effect figure a6 1 in the sm although it has been reported that efom has a higher quantum yield for 3efom production with higher energy than 3nom o connor et al 2019 no difference was observed for atrazine when adding quenchers hda his and ipa into the samples the rate constants were lower than those of the quencher free solutions as shown in fig 4 figure a10 1 and figure a11 3 of the sm however no obvious evidence of the decrease in the atrazine direct photolysis with the addition of ipa and his could be ascribed to the antioxidant activity of the quenchers because of the high experimental uncertainty it is unclear why hda has such a dramatic effect on atrazine photolysis given that deoxygenation experiments indicate triplets are of minor importance it is suggested that 3dom and hydroxyl radical also play a role in the fate of atrazine in the presence of dom efom because hda and ipa quench the 3dom and hydroxyl radical respectively and thus suppress indirect photolysis for his the likely explanation for the decreased rate constant is the reaction with an atz intermediate to re form the atz parent compound and thus to lower the apparent rate of loss because reaction of atz with 1o2 is negligible marchetti et al 2013 4 conclusion seven model sensitizers and dissolved organic matter from different sources were adopted to investigate the fate of atrazine in surface water environment this work provides some new insights in the photodegradation fate of atrazine in surface water the quantum yield of atrazine in natural sunlight is 5 times smaller than that in the solar simulator suggesting that the quantum yield may depend on the wavelength however spiking atrazine into most dom containing waters increased the atrazine loss rate 1 5 to 2 fold which means that direct photolysis and indirect photolysis are the substantial pathways in controlling the fate of atrazine in aquatic environment for model sensitizers the triplet excited state induces phototransformation of atz the energy electron configuration of the triplet model sensitizers and triplet intersystem crossing quantum yield are dictating the reactivity of cdom towards atrazine 2 an appears be a reasonable cdom proxy to assess the reactivity of 3cdom to atrazine because it has similar triplet intersystem quantum yield and thus similar performance of atrazine depletion with cdom other model sensitizers also have utility and the choice may be contaminant dependent more data on the photochemistry of 2 an triplet 32 an interacting with o2 pollutants and 2 an itself are needed to evaluate the net photosensitization capacity exactly the results on the selective quencher experiments for model photosensitizers and the target compounds could be substantially misleading due to the unexpected reactions with other photochemically produced reactive intermediates and transformation intermediates care must be taken in the application of quenchers the low efficiency of triplet 3cdom srnom river lake water and wastewater effluent in atrazine indirect photolysis suggests that the quality of the cdom and the energy of the triplets it forms will dictate the importance of 3cdom reaction with atrazine declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
