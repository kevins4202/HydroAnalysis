17030,the broad application of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas has attracted global concern regarding their adverse environmental effects the possible removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands were excavated and quantified using two typical submerged macrophytes rooted potamogeton wrightii and rootless ceratophyllum demersum our results showed that 33 59 88 99 of pfaas could be removed via not only sediment sorption or phytoextraction but also by the bioaccumulation of microbiota the sediment acts as a vital sink for pfaas preloading 23 51 50 09 and 16 65 52 18 of pfaas in treatments with p wrightii pw1 and c demersum cd1 respectively c demersum showed a better capacity to accumulate pfaas 0 91 32 03 than p wrightii 10 considerable pfaas were observed to be distributed in microbes underlining the non negligible role of microbiota in bioaccumulating pfaas the contributions of planktonic microbes biofilm microbes and extracellular polymeric substances in biofilms were 0 39 20 96 0 03 7 95 and 0 39 14 15 in pw1 and 0 23 15 68 0 01 15 68 and 0 53 26 77 in cd1 respectively the adsorption uptake was significantly correlated with the perfluoroalkyl chain length p 0 05 except for the uptake of biofilms in c demersum furthermore pfaas and submerged macrophytes could decrease the richness of microbiota but increase the relative abundance of some strains in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales our results were helpful for understanding the removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands and their linkages with pfaa properties thus further providing insight into the management and removal of emerging organic contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluoroalkyl acids removal constructed wetland submerged macrophytes microbial community 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas refer to a family of anthropogenic chemicals characterized by perfluoroalkyl moieties cnf2n 1 and a functional group ahrens and bundschuh 2014 wang et al 2017 due to their high surface activity amphiphilicity and thermal and chemical stability liu et al 2019b pi et al 2017 tian et al 2018 pfaas are widely used in industrial and consumer applications mainly as firefighting foams food packaging materials and surfactants schaider et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however pfaas could not be effectively removed by wastewater treatment plants and have been continuously discharged into aquatic environments arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 fang et al 2020 since the first use of pfaas in the 1940s more than 2600 t of pfaas have been discharged into aquatic environments wang et al 2014 2017 it was reported that pfaas concentrations were 20 458 ng l in the effluents of wastewater treatment wuhan china and 4570 70 400 ng l in the receiving water tangxun lake zhou et al 2013 chen et al reported that pfaas maximum concentration was 18 000 ng l in rivers at approximately two fluorochemical manufacturing facilities chen et al 2018 anderson et al reported that individual pfaa s maximum concentration was up to 8970 ng l in surface water near the active u s air force installations anderson et al 2016 a national survey indicated that the total concentrations of pfaas in natural water ranged from 17 ng l malaren lake sweden to 260 ng l chao lake china pan et al 2018 the high persistence potential bioaccumulation and potential adverse environmental effects on the ecological environment and human health have made pfaas globally concerning contaminants as well as an intractable issue with respect to management and remediation chaparro ortega et al 2018 ojo et al 2020 wang et al 2017 constructed wetlands have been promoted to remediate trace persistent organic pollutants as a sustainable and cost effective technology due to their low operating costs and low carbon footprints liu et al 2019a qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however only sparse studies have paid attention to the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands submerged macrophytes are essential compartments in constructed wetlands and play an essential role in removing contaminants including heavy metals antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs because their fully submerged tissues provided them more opportunities to assimilate contaminates than other species geng et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have elucidated that removing nitrogen and organic pollutants mainly occurs via direct absorption of submerged macrophytes and biodegradation of the concomitant microbiota liu et al 2019a qin et al 2019 xing et al 2020 chi and yang reported that the presence of potamogeton crispus l could enhance the removal of dibutyl phthalate in an aquatic microcosm and their results showed that 17 7 of dibutyl phthalate was transferred to p crispus and 4 8 was removed by biodegradation chi and yang 2012 qin et al observed that vallisneria natans significantly improved the dissipation of pahs in constructed wetlands the improvement was mainly related to the uptake of v natans and the enhancement of biodegradation qin et al 2019 to date information about the bioaccumulation behavior of pfaas has usually been obtained with crops and vegetables and the results indicated that pfaas can be extensively absorbed felizeter et al 2014 gredelj et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c besides it is widely recognized that pfaas are resistant to biodegradation because of their extremely stable bonding between carbon and fluorine atoms thus the contributions of microbiota to detoxifying pfaas were often negligible as found in many previous studies chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a 2020 it was recently reported that pfoa showed a high affinity to adsorb onto the extracellular polymeric substances epss of microbiota butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 yan et al 2021 the physicochemical processes of biodegradation were that contaminants were first adsorbed onto the surface of microbiota that was inundated with epss and then bioaccumulated biodegraded by microbiota flemming et al 2016 geng et al 2019 worms et al 2006 however information about pfaa removal in constructed wetlands especially the contribution of submerged macrophytes and microbiota in removing pfaas and the influence of pfaa properties on the removal processes and thereby shifting the microbial community in water biofilm sediment and rhizosphere is still meager potamogeton wrightii and ceratophyllum demersum are two typical perennial submerged macrophytes dong et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 and have been widely applied to remove nutrients cao et al 2019 xing et al 2020 heavy metals geng et al 2019 peng et al 2008 and organic pollutants tao et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 in constructed wetlands p wrightii represents submerged macrophytes with well developed root systems that can root in sediment while c demersum represents submerged macrophytes without roots that live in water uptake into the former includes exchange with both shoots and roots and absorption into the latter only involves the shoots hence p wrightii and c demersum were selected as representatives to explore pfaas removal by constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes the main objectives of the present study were to 1 explore whether constructed wetlands could remove pfaas with submerged macrophytes 2 clarify the possible removal processes of pfaas by quantifying their removal contributions 3 elucidate the linkage between pfaa properties and their removal processes and 4 profile the shifts in microbial community structure under pfaa pressure we hypothesized that pfaas can be effectively removed by sediment sorption and the uptake of submerged macrophytes and their concomitant microbiota along with shifts in the microbial community and that the physicochemical properties of pfaas would regulate the removal the removal contributions of pfaas in sediment submerged macrophytes and microbiota with different ecological niches such as planktonic microbes biofilms and rhizosphere microbes were first investigated accordingly the removal mechanism in constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes was discussed thus providing a comprehensive understanding of pfaas management and removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents standard pfaas 98 included c4 12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and c4 6 8 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas the isotope labeled mpfoa and mpfos 98 were used as internal standards shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 full names molecular structures and commercial sources are summarized in table s1 hplc grade methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide ammonium acetate and milli q water were used throughout the study 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse located at hohai university nanjing china the greenhouse provided the right growing conditions for submerged macrophytes with temperatures of approximately 30 c and shelter from rainwater and atmospheric sedimentation sediments ph 7 49 organic matter 4 63 background pfaa concentration 0 5 ng g dw were collected from changdang lake 119 60 e 31 67 n in the northwestern taihu basin china p wrightii and c demersum aged approximately two months were purchased from local sources in total 60 polypropylene buckets 10 l measuring 22 cm in bottom diameter 26 cm in top diameter and 27 cm in height were used in the experiments the side of each bucket was wrapped in aluminum foil to avoid light interference each bucket contained 3 kg wet sediment approximately 5 cm in height and 7 l dechlorinated tap water 20 cm in height p wrightii and c demersum were acclimated for 14 days at a density of 5 seedlings per bucket schematic illustration is shown in fig s1 buckets were divided into five groups cg control group no macrophytes and pfaas pw1 p wrightii and pfaas pw2 p wrightii and no pfaas cd1 c demersum and pfaas and cd2 c demersum and no pfaas individual pfaas have been widely detected in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and in the receiving river of fluorine chemical plants with concentrations up to thousands ng l arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 chen et al 2018 several previous studied on the uptake of individual pfaa in plants with concentrations of 1 µg l to 80 µg l gredelj et al 2020 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 by applying concentrations little higher than the typical concentration 10 µg l of individual pfaa it is expected to more easily detect the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands all treatments were conducted in triplicate water sediment and macrophyte tissues were collected on days 0 1 2 4 7 and 10 environmental factors including ph dissolved oxygen do and the oxidation reduction potential orp in both water and sediment were recorded along with sampling as listed in table s2 as suggested in a previous study changes in microbial richness diversity and composition can be observed after eight days yu et al 2018 microbial samples were collected at the end of experiments including water samples wcg wpw1 wpw2 wcd1 and wcd2 biofilms on shoots bcg bpw2 bpw2 bcd2 and bcd2 sediment scg spw1 spw2 scd1 and scd2 and rhizosphere rpw1 and rpw2 half of the samples were frozen at 80 c until dna extraction and the other half were pretreated for pfaa analysis details of sample pretreatment and quality control can be found in text s2 2 3 pfaas analysis for the shoots and roots of submerged plants the extraction methods followed a previous study tian et al 2018 as shown in text s2 the extraction methods of pfaas in water and sediment can be found in our previous study li and hua 2021 pfaas were analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry uhplc ms ms triple quad 4500 ab sciex singapore details of the instrumental analysis are supplemented in text s1 and table s3 2 4 quality assurance and quality control the quantification method followed the uepa method 537 1 shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 calibration curves were obtained from methanol standards at 0 1 5 10 25 50 and 100 µg l the correlation coefficients of the calibration curve for each pfaa were greater than 0 99 with a relative standard deviation rsd less than 20 each group of 12 samples was analyzed with a procedure blank a solvent blank and a membrane blank pfaas in the blanks were either not detected or below the quantification limits loqs suggesting no background contamination throughout the procedure the limits of detection lods and loqs were defined as signal to noise s n ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively table s4 the method detection limits mdls were derived from the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blanks for target analytes that were not detected mdls were derived from their corresponding lods table s4 in the standard addition tests the target pfaas recoveries in each matrix fell in acceptable intervals 60 140 table s4 2 5 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing dna of the corresponding sample was extracted by dna extraction kits 16s rrna genes of distinct regions v4 were identified by high throughput sequencing the specific processes

significant difference lsd test student s t test pearson correlation was used when the data were continuous and normally distributed sequences were excavated by www miagichand online and sequences relevant to archaea were removed the number of otus chao1 shannon wiener diversity and richness were calculated to show the alpha diversity of the microbiota community beta distance was determined by principal coordinate analysis pcoa hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis distance was performed to compare the distinction among different treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of pfaas from water the dynamics of pfaa concentrations over time in water are shown in fig s2 most pfaas concentrations remained unchanged until day 2 and then rapidly decreased with time until day 4 while the very long chained pfaas c 10 directly declined in the initial experiments after that the concentrations substantially remained unchanged on days 7 10 at the end of the experiment the lowest concentration in cg was observed in pfdoda 2 30 0 11 µg l followed by pfda 2 79 0 24 µg l and pfunda 2 56 0 26 µg l while the highest concentration was found in pfba 6 64 0 25 µg l fig 1 a a similar trend was observed in pw1 2 30 0 11 µg l for pfdoda 6 64 0 25 µg l for pfba and cd1 1 10 0 11 µg l for pfdoda 5 69 0 25 µg l for pfba these results indicated that pfaas with longer chain lengths were more easily removed from the water the removal percentages of pfaas in cd1 and pw1 were 0 63 13 37 and 2 53 22 81 higher than those in cg suggesting that the presence of submerged macrophytes especially c demersum could enhance the dissipation of pfaas from water 3 2 possible removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands 3 2 1 sorption of pfaas to sediment pfaa concentrations in the sediment of all the treatments increased at the beginning of the experiments fig s3 concentrations for most pfaas reached a relatively stable level after seven days of exposure except for the very long chained pfaas c 10 which kept a moderate increase during the whole exposure period at the end of the experiment the pfaas concentrations were 13 72 31 29 ng g dw in cg 11 11 23 67 ng g dw in pw1 and 7 87 24 66 ng g dw in cd1 concentrations of pfcas except pfba and pfpea in different treatments can be sorted as cg pw1 cd1 p 0 05 fig 1b the presence of submerged macrophytes especially c demersum could significantly alleviate the adsorption of pfcas to sediment because the uptake of contaminants from overlying water into shoots could decrease their concentrations in pore water by affecting the exchange balance between overlying water and pore water and the uptake of contaminants from pore water into roots might compete with the adsorption onto sediment diepens et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 long chained pfcas c 8 in sediment exhibited significantly higher concentrations than short chained pfcas p 0 05 for pfos and pfna belonging to pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluoroalkyl moieties the former exhibited significantly higher concentrations p 0 05 similar observations were found between pfhxs and pfhpa the results suggested that the hydrophobicity of pfaas determined their affinity to absorb onto sediment which was in accordance with observations in crops and vegetables gredelj et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c the interactions of pfaas between sediment and water can be profiled by kd chen et al 2019a liu et al 2019b at the end of the experiment the kd values were in the range of 2 38 pfbs 11 22 pfunda l kg 1 90 pfbs 12 08 pfdoda l kg and 2 74 pfba 14 08 pfdoda l kg in cg pw1 and cd1 respectively table 1 pfaas sorption onto sediment was suggested to be determined by the properties of molecules solution and the sorbent groffen et al 2019 higgins and luthy 2006 liu et al 2019b under simulation systems with the same water and sediment the distribution was more likely to depend on their physicochemical properties zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 1c spearman s correlation analysis identified significant monotonic relationships between log kd and perfluoroalkyl chain length nc in all treatments cg r 0 970 p 0 01 pw1 r 0 913 p 0 01 cd1 r 0 742 p 0 01 confirming that hydrophobic effects might be the main sorption mechanisms for pfaas on sediment pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluoroalkyl chain length such as pfpea pfbs pfhpa pfhxs and pfna pfos pfsas showed higher kd because pfsas with sulfonate groups were more hydrophobic than pfcas with carboxylate groups du et al 2014 however no significant differences were confirmed among the different treatments indicating that submerged macrophyte types could not significantly affect pfaas distribution between water and sediment 3 2 2 uptake of pfaas by submerged macrophytes the observed concentrations of individual pfaas in the shoots and roots of submerged macrophytes during the whole experiment are shown in fig s4 concentrations of pfaas in shoots and roots of two submerged macrophytes increased rapidly on days 0 2 and slowly increased to a steady state at the end of the experiment long chained pfaas exhibited a significantly higher affinity for bioaccumulation by submerged macrophytes than short chained pfaas p 0 05 based on the whole plants bioconcentration factors bcfs of short chained pfaas were comparable for the two macrophytes table 1 while bcfs of long chained pfaas for c demersum were significantly higher than those for p wrightii p 0 05 for example the bcfs for pfba were 33 88 1 19 l kg and 22 38 0 07 l kg in p wrightii and c demersum the bcf for pfos in c demersum 992 99 13 04 l kg was approximately five times higher than that in p wrightii the results indicated that c demersum was more suitable to remove long chained pfaas in constructed wetlands than p wrightii moreover a significant perfluoroalkyl chain length dependency was found in the observed log bcfs of pfaas r2 0 7307 p 0 05 fig s5 indicating that uptake of pfaas by submerged macrophytes in constructed wetlands was subjected to the hydrophobicity of pfaas a similar mechanism was observed in agricultural plants and hydroponically aquatic macrophytes gredelj et al 2020 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c in the rooted submerged macrophytes of p wrightii the bcfs of shoots and roots ranged from 32 83 pfba 1060 pfdoa and 59 4 pfba 701 44 pfdoa respectively table 1 indicating the comparable uptake potential of shoots and roots similarly log bcfs of shoots and roots also showed significant correlations with nc shoots r 0 9934 p 0 01 roots r 0 5912 p 0 05 fig s5 suggesting that perfluoroalkyl chain length was a key factor regulating pfaa uptake in both shoots and roots the observed translocation factors tfs varied from 0 55 pfba to 2 86 pfoa table 1 at the end of the experiments pfaas with nc 8 were more preferentially distributed in roots i e tfs 1 while pfaas with nc 8 were more likely to be located in shoots notably the uptake of shoots was mainly via direct uptake from water the translocation of hydrophobic organic contaminants by submerged macrophytes from roots to shoots was much weaker compared to other aquatic plants because of the deficiency of transpiration tao et al 2015 in addition previous studies reported that it is challenging to translocate pfaas in fibrous roots the root type of p wrighti because their developed aerenchyma might make the translocation longer and more tortuous gu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore the observed translocations of pfaas with nc 8 in the present study might be attributed to their preferential absorption to shoots additionally pfaas influence on the growth of submerged macrophytes was observed during the experimental period fig s6 the dry biomass increased from 1 16 to 2 38 g in pw1 1 62 2 90 g in pw2 1 97 5 01 g in cd1 and 1 95 4 44 g in cd2 the growth of the two submerged macrophytes fit the first order kinetics well p 0 05 the first order rate constant k g in pw1 0 08 0 21 was significantly lower than that in pw2 0 14 0 03 in contrast no significant deviations in k g were found between cd1 0 11 0 02 and cd2 0 12 0 03 the results suggested that pfaas could inhibit the growth of p wrightii but not c demersum 3 2 3 bioaccumulation of pfaas by microbiota microbiota grown in aquatic environments can be divided into planktonic microbes biofilm microbes and rhizosphere microbes according to their ecological niches yan et al 2017 biofilms were embedded in the matrix of epss which contained many functional groups such as amine carboxyl and hydroxyl groups these groups were conducive to the sorption of pfaas du et al 2014 vu and wu 2020 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b herein the concentrations of pfaas in planktonic microbes microbes and epss in biofilms and rhizosphere microbes were observed no significant differences between the individual pfaa concentrations except pfunda in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere sediment of p wrighti were observed p 0 05 fig s7 one possible reason might be that the fibrous roots were so well developed and almost overgrew after 24 days of culture that the differences between rhizosphere and non rhizosphere sediment were blurred thus the uptake of pfaas by rhizosphere microbiota was not discussed in the present study the concentrations of pfaas in planktonic microbes ranged from 1 22 to 29 81 µg g dw in cg 3 65 195 98 µg g dw in pw1 and 3 58 177 17 µg g dw in cd1 fig 2 a biofilm microbes bioaccumulated significantly lower pfaa concentrations than planktonic microbes p 0 05 with concentration ranges of 0 02 11 29 µg g dw in pw1 and 0 0004 4 74 µg g dw in cd1 in the epss of biofilms pfaas exhibited concentration ranges of 0 04 1 37 µg g dw in pw1 and 0 14 7 51 µg g dw in cd1 the bcfs of microbiota with different niches are summarized in table s6 bcfs in planktonic microbes were comparable between pw1 598 73 44 182 l kg and cd1 658 54 72 930 l kg regardless of the types of submerged macrophytes bcfs in cg 192 23 12 952 l kg were significantly lower than those in treatments with macrophytes suggesting that the presence of submerged macrophytes could enhance the uptake of pfaas by planktonic microbes the distribution of pfaas in biofilm microbes was in accordance with that in planktonic microbes in addition log bcfs in the biofilm microbes were relatively lower by 1 47 5 06 units than those in planktonic microbes log bcfs based on the whole biofilms including microbes and epss were comparable with those in planktonic microbes and were 0 02 4 36 units higher than those based on biofilm microbes our findings indicated that planktonic microbes and biofilms showed a comparable potential to absorb pfaas and that epss may play a crucial role in bioaccumulating pfaas in biofilms pearson s correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between log bcfs of planktonic microbes and nc in all treatments cg r 0 6678 p 0 05 pw1 r 0 6806 p 0 05 cd1 r 0 9224 p 0 01 fig 2b similar monotonical relationships were also observed between log bcfs of biofilm microbes and nc pw1 r 0 8605 p 0 01 cd1 r 0 7836 p 0 01 fig 2b our results demonstrated that the perfluoroalkyl chain length could regulate pfaa distribution behavior and that hydrophobic bonding might be the key mechanism in controlling the uptake of both planktonic microbes and biofilm microbes similar observations were also reported in the sorption of sediment and the uptake of crops and organisms chen et al 2019a dong et al 2020 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 laboratory sorption experiments argued that the sorption of pfaas on bacteria was more complicated than expected and that the mechanisms were at least concerned about hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 furthermore a strong significant correlation between log bcfs of pfaas by biofilm and nc was only observed in pw1 r 0 9547 p 0 01 but not in cd1 fig 2b only pfaas with nc 8 exhibited a monotonic relationship with nc r 0 9048 p 0 05 in cd1 considering that the log bcfs in biofilm microbes were observed to be regulated by nc the significantly higher affinity of epss to adsorb pfaas with nc 8 in epss might be responsible for the nonsignificant correlation in cd1 similarly nugyen et al recently reported that the sorption of short chained pfaas nc 5 onto soil was not regulated by perfluoroalkyl chain length this process was more likely related to the interactions between ionic groups of pfaas and soil in contrast the sorption of long chained pfaas nc 5 onto soil was significantly regulated by perfluoroalkyl chain length and this process was mainly forced by hydrophobic effects nguyen et al 2020 the adsorption of pfaas on bacteria was reported to be influenced by cell wall structure and hydrophobic and proton active binding sites butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 two main compounds in epss protein and humic like substances are involved in pfoa adsorption yan et al 2021 the aromatic and amide groups of proteins can bind pfoa while the mono force between humic like substances and pfoa was not strong enough to bind pfoa but only attracted pfoa thus it can be speculated that the epss composition determines how pfaas are absorbed and the formation of epss is greatly influenced by the function and structure of the microbial community as well as the nature of the macrophytes on which the biofilms attach flemming et al 2016 qin et al 2019 3 3 mass distribution of pfaas in constructed wetland systems the mass distribution of pfaas in water sediment shoots roots planktonic microbes and biofilms microbes and epss is shown in fig 3 the sum of all percentages ranged from 86 95 to 106 59 which fell at acceptable intervals at the end of the experiment 33 59 76 98 of pfaas could be removed from water in the control group the presence of submerged macrophytes could enhance pfaas removal efficiency and was 36 32 80 93 and 43 12 88 99 in treatments with p wrightii and c demersum respectively pfaas with longer perfluoroalkyl chain lengths were more likely to be removed our results suggested that pfaas can be removed not only by the adsorption of pfaas and the uptake of submerged macrophytes but also by the bioaccumulation of microbiota sediment was identified as a crucial sink adsorbing 29 04 66 43 of pfaas in the control group 23 51 50 09 of pfaas in pw1 and 16 65 52 18 of pfaas in cd1 in p wrightii 0 45 6 59 of pfaas were bioaccumulated in shoots in comparison contributions of its roots were relatively low 0 20 because the biomass of roots was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of shoots 2 28 g dw of shoots 0 09 g dw of roots c demersum showed a better capacity for the uptake of pfaas 0 91 32 03 than p wrightii interestingly considerable amounts of pfaas were adsorbed onto the microbiota although pfaas were resistant to biodegradation indicating that microbiota could compete effectively with sediment adsorption and phytoextraction and that the role of microbiota in bioaccumulating pfaas cannot be ignored in detail planktonic microbes preloaded 0 66 14 67 of pfaas in cg 0 39 20 96 of pfaas in pw1 and 0 23 15 68 of pfaas in cd1 biofilms contributed 0 52 15 03 in treatments with p wrightii and 0 99 26 78 in treatments with c demersum in biofilms pfaas were more likely to be distributed in epss than microbes with contributions of 0 03 7 95 for biofilm microbes and 0 39 14 15 for epss in pw1 and contributions of 0 01 15 68 for biofilm microbes and 0 53 26 77 for epss in cd1 similarly 77 of acenaphthene sanches et al 2017 60 67 of copper lin et al 2020 and 94 of dye mona et al 2011 were removed by eps adsorption suggesting that sorption on epss made outstanding contributions to the bioaccumulation of pfaas in biofilms 3 4 shifts in microbial diversity under pfaa pressure to profile the microbial community structure 922 855 high quality sequences were obtained from the samples of planktonic microbes biofilms sediment and rhizosphere general information about sequencing data the numbers of otus chao1 shannon wiener diversity and richness are displayed in table s5 pcoa revealed variation patterns in microbial community structure among different treatments fig 4 a and b pcoa axis 1 and 2 explained 43 3 and 18 2 of the variability in the water and biofilms respectively the results suggested significant differences in bacterial communities between the treatments with or without spiked pfaas in the sediment and rhizosphere pcoa axis 1 and 2 represented 44 2 and 28 variability respectively the distinctions in microbial community structures in both p wrighti and c demersum became fuzzy when pfaas were spiked into treatments the results suggested that pfaa pollution may drive the microbial community to shift towards the same direction in the sediment and rhizosphere the presence of pfaas and submerged macrophytes could selectively influence the microbial community in which beneficiary microbiota will survive and occupy the dominant states miura et al 2007 yu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 the identified bacterial community compositions and relative abundances are shown in fig 4c e at the phylum and class levels in water and biofilms the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria 53 61 78 51 followed by bacteroidetes 2 41 27 92 cyanobacteria 0 70 17 7 and gemmatimonadetes 0 22 15 40 the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales 15 87 54 36 rhodobacterales 3 95 13 23 and pseudomonadales 0 01 25 93 pfaas increased the relative abundance of acetobacterales and cytophagales in both the water and biofilms in addition pfaas increased the relative abundance of sphingomonadales in the water of pw1 and pseudomonadales in the water of cd1 in the sediment and rhizosphere the dominant phyla were proteobacteria 36 10 75 26 firmicutes 0 28 41 50 and gemmatimonadetes 2 80 11 11 the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales 28 66 64 28 and clostridiales 0 12 41 34 pfaas increased the relative abundance of betaproteobacteriales in pw1 and sbr1031 and betaproteobacteriales in cd1 under the pressure of pfaas increases in the relative abundance of clostridiales anaerolineales and sbr1031 were observed in the rhizosphere of p wrighti furthermore the presence of p wrighti could increase the relative abundance of betaproteobacteriales and sphingomonadales in water as well as the relative abundance of rokubacteriales and sbr1031 in sediment c demersum enhances the proportions of cytophagales in water and rokubacteriales and sbr1031 in sediment the similarity differences of microbial community at the genus level in different treatments are displayed in fig 5 pfaas presence increased the relative abundance of sediminibacterium in the water of both pw1 and cd2 sulfuritalea and thiobacillus in both the sediment and rhizosphere of p wrighti also distinct shifts of pfaas on the relative abundance of some microbiota were observed such as novosphingobium in the water of pw1 devosia niveispirillum flectobacillus and arcicella in the water of cd1 methylophilus in the biofilm of pw1 cyanobium pcc 6307 in the biofilms of cd1 c1 b045 and immundisolibacter in the sediment of pw1 methylophilus in the sediment of cd1 and pseudomonas in the rhizosphere of pw1 our results proposed that bioaccumulation biosorption and uptake played a crucial role in pfaa removal due to pfaas high persistence it is of great importance to identify tolerant microbiota in natural conditions as shown above pfaas and submerged macrophytes presence shifted the relative abundance of some microbial communities indicating their potential to tolerate and accumulate pfaas most of them were in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales in some previous studies sediminibacterium thiobacillus and betaproteobacteriales were identified and characterized as microbes tolerant to pfaas cerro galvez et al 2020 chen et al 2019b li et al 2017 a few pseudomonas strains have been isolated and modified as pfaa biodegrades such as pseudomonas parafulva yab 1 yi et al 2019 and pseudomonas plecoglossicida 2 4 d chetverikov et al 2017 acetobacterales and sphingomonadales were suggested to be related to the degradation of organic contaminants including sulfonamide aromatic hydrocarbons and pahs zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 furthermore previous studies have shown that acetobacterales sphingomonadales pseudomonadales betaproteobacteriales and cytophagales are aerobic bacteria yan et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 the do released by submerged macrophytes may contribute to the dominance of these aerobic bacteria accordingly our results showed that the microbial community s diversity was lower in the treatments with than without submerged macrophytes table s5 but the abundance of pfaa resistant strains was enhanced 4 conclusions our study provided comprehensive insights into the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes by clarifying the removal efficiency of pfaas in simulated systems with two typical submerged macrophytes exploring the possible removal processes by quantifying their contributions excavating the linkage between pfaa properties and their removal and profiling the shifts in microbial community structure in water biofilms sediment and the rhizosphere our results showed that the removal percentages of pfaas in the treatments with p wrightii and c demersum were 0 63 13 37 and 2 53 22 81 higher than those without submerged macrophytes sediment sorption and phytoextraction and the absorption uptake and adsorption of planktonic microbes and biofilms were identified as pfaas main removal routes in comparison to p wrightii c demersum showed a better capacity to remove pfaas by impeding sediment sorption directly bioaccumulating pfaas and enhancing microbiota uptake the sorption bioaccumulation was associated with the perfluoroalkyl chain length except biofilms attached in c demersum suggesting hydrophobic effects might be the key mechanism controlling the removal processes furthermore the presence of pfaas and submerged macrophytes shifted the microbial community structure and the abundance of some strains in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales was increased the present study underlined the considerable role of submerged macrophytes and the microbial community in pfaa removal in aquatic environments and further studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms of the interactions between pfaas and microbiota such as by elucidating how the fundamental differences between planktonic microbes and biofilms as well as the epss excreted by microbiota regulate

17030,the broad application of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas has attracted global concern regarding their adverse environmental effects the possible removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands were excavated and quantified using two typical submerged macrophytes rooted potamogeton wrightii and rootless ceratophyllum demersum our results showed that 33 59 88 99 of pfaas could be removed via not only sediment sorption or phytoextraction but also by the bioaccumulation of microbiota the sediment acts as a vital sink for pfaas preloading 23 51 50 09 and 16 65 52 18 of pfaas in treatments with p wrightii pw1 and c demersum cd1 respectively c demersum showed a better capacity to accumulate pfaas 0 91 32 03 than p wrightii 10 considerable pfaas were observed to be distributed in microbes underlining the non negligible role of microbiota in bioaccumulating pfaas the contributions of planktonic microbes biofilm microbes and extracellular polymeric substances in biofilms were 0 39 20 96 0 03 7 95 and 0 39 14 15 in pw1 and 0 23 15 68 0 01 15 68 and 0 53 26 77 in cd1 respectively the adsorption uptake was significantly correlated with the perfluoroalkyl chain length p 0 05 except for the uptake of biofilms in c demersum furthermore pfaas and submerged macrophytes could decrease the richness of microbiota but increase the relative abundance of some strains in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales our results were helpful for understanding the removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands and their linkages with pfaa properties thus further providing insight into the management and removal of emerging organic contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluoroalkyl acids removal constructed wetland submerged macrophytes microbial community 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas refer to a family of anthropogenic chemicals characterized by perfluoroalkyl moieties cnf2n 1 and a functional group ahrens and bundschuh 2014 wang et al 2017 due to their high surface activity amphiphilicity and thermal and chemical stability liu et al 2019b pi et al 2017 tian et al 2018 pfaas are widely used in industrial and consumer applications mainly as firefighting foams food packaging materials and surfactants schaider et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however pfaas could not be effectively removed by wastewater treatment plants and have been continuously discharged into aquatic environments arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 fang et al 2020 since the first use of pfaas in the 1940s more than 2600 t of pfaas have been discharged into aquatic environments wang et al 2014 2017 it was reported that pfaas concentrations were 20 458 ng l in the effluents of wastewater treatment wuhan china and 4570 70 400 ng l in the receiving water tangxun lake zhou et al 2013 chen et al reported that pfaas maximum concentration was 18 000 ng l in rivers at approximately two fluorochemical manufacturing facilities chen et al 2018 anderson et al reported that individual pfaa s maximum concentration was up to 8970 ng l in surface water near the active u s air force installations anderson et al 2016 a national survey indicated that the total concentrations of pfaas in natural water ranged from 17 ng l malaren lake sweden to 260 ng l chao lake china pan et al 2018 the high persistence potential bioaccumulation and potential adverse environmental effects on the ecological environment and human health have made pfaas globally concerning contaminants as well as an intractable issue with respect to management and remediation chaparro ortega et al 2018 ojo et al 2020 wang et al 2017 constructed wetlands have been promoted to remediate trace persistent organic pollutants as a sustainable and cost effective technology due to their low operating costs and low carbon footprints liu et al 2019a qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however only sparse studies have paid attention to the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands submerged macrophytes are essential compartments in constructed wetlands and play an essential role in removing contaminants including heavy metals antibiotics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs because their fully submerged tissues provided them more opportunities to assimilate contaminates than other species geng et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have elucidated that removing nitrogen and organic pollutants mainly occurs via direct absorption of submerged macrophytes and biodegradation of the concomitant microbiota liu et al 2019a qin et al 2019 xing et al 2020 chi and yang reported that the presence of potamogeton crispus l could enhance the removal of dibutyl phthalate in an aquatic microcosm and their results showed that 17 7 of dibutyl phthalate was transferred to p crispus and 4 8 was removed by biodegradation chi and yang 2012 qin et al observed that vallisneria natans significantly improved the dissipation of pahs in constructed wetlands the improvement was mainly related to the uptake of v natans and the enhancement of biodegradation qin et al 2019 to date information about the bioaccumulation behavior of pfaas has usually been obtained with crops and vegetables and the results indicated that pfaas can be extensively absorbed felizeter et al 2014 gredelj et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c besides it is widely recognized that pfaas are resistant to biodegradation because of their extremely stable bonding between carbon and fluorine atoms thus the contributions of microbiota to detoxifying pfaas were often negligible as found in many previous studies chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a 2020 it was recently reported that pfoa showed a high affinity to adsorb onto the extracellular polymeric substances epss of microbiota butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 yan et al 2021 the physicochemical processes of biodegradation were that contaminants were first adsorbed onto the surface of microbiota that was inundated with epss and then bioaccumulated biodegraded by microbiota flemming et al 2016 geng et al 2019 worms et al 2006 however information about pfaa removal in constructed wetlands especially the contribution of submerged macrophytes and microbiota in removing pfaas and the influence of pfaa properties on the removal processes and thereby shifting the microbial community in water biofilm sediment and rhizosphere is still meager potamogeton wrightii and ceratophyllum demersum are two typical perennial submerged macrophytes dong et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 and have been widely applied to remove nutrients cao et al 2019 xing et al 2020 heavy metals geng et al 2019 peng et al 2008 and organic pollutants tao et al 2015 xiao et al 2020 in constructed wetlands p wrightii represents submerged macrophytes with well developed root systems that can root in sediment while c demersum represents submerged macrophytes without roots that live in water uptake into the former includes exchange with both shoots and roots and absorption into the latter only involves the shoots hence p wrightii and c demersum were selected as representatives to explore pfaas removal by constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes the main objectives of the present study were to 1 explore whether constructed wetlands could remove pfaas with submerged macrophytes 2 clarify the possible removal processes of pfaas by quantifying their removal contributions 3 elucidate the linkage between pfaa properties and their removal processes and 4 profile the shifts in microbial community structure under pfaa pressure we hypothesized that pfaas can be effectively removed by sediment sorption and the uptake of submerged macrophytes and their concomitant microbiota along with shifts in the microbial community and that the physicochemical properties of pfaas would regulate the removal the removal contributions of pfaas in sediment submerged macrophytes and microbiota with different ecological niches such as planktonic microbes biofilms and rhizosphere microbes were first investigated accordingly the removal mechanism in constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes was discussed thus providing a comprehensive understanding of pfaas management and removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents standard pfaas 98 included c4 12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and c4

summarized in table s1 hplc grade methanol acetonitrile ammonium hydroxide ammonium acetate and milli q water were used throughout the study 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted in a greenhouse located at hohai university nanjing china the greenhouse provided the right growing conditions for submerged macrophytes with temperatures of approximately 30 c and shelter from rainwater and atmospheric sedimentation sediments ph 7 49 organic matter 4 63 background pfaa concentration 0 5 ng g dw were collected from changdang lake 119 60 e 31 67 n in the northwestern taihu basin china p wrightii and c demersum aged approximately two months were purchased from local sources in total 60 polypropylene buckets 10 l measuring 22 cm in bottom diameter 26 cm in top diameter and 27 cm in

dechlorinated tap water 20 cm in height p wrightii and c demersum were acclimated for 14 days at a density of 5 seedlings per bucket schematic illustration is shown in fig s1 buckets were divided into five groups cg control group no macrophytes and pfaas pw1 p wrightii and pfaas pw2 p wrightii and no pfaas cd1 c demersum and pfaas and cd2 c demersum and no pfaas individual pfaas have been widely detected in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants and in the receiving river of fluorine chemical plants with concentrations up to thousands ng l arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 chen et al 2018 several previous studied on the uptake of individual pfaa in plants with concentrations of 1 µg l to 80 µg l gredelj et al 2020 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 by applying concentrations little higher than the typical concentration 10 µg l of individual pfaa it is expected to more easily detect the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands all treatments were conducted in triplicate water sediment and macrophyte tissues were collected on days 0 1 2 4 7 and 10 environmental factors including ph dissolved oxygen do and the oxidation reduction potential orp in both water and sediment were recorded along with sampling as listed in table s2 as suggested in a previous study changes in microbial richness diversity and composition can be observed after eight days yu et al 2018 microbial samples were

pfaas analysis for the shoots and roots of submerged plants the extraction methods followed a previous study tian et al 2018 as shown in text s2 the extraction methods of pfaas in water and sediment

shoemaker and tettenhorst 2018 calibration curves were obtained from methanol standards at 0 1 5 10 25 50 and 100 µg l the correlation coefficients of the calibration curve for each pfaa were greater than 0 99 with a relative standard deviation rsd less than 20 each group of 12 samples was analyzed with a procedure blank a solvent blank and a membrane blank pfaas in the blanks were either not detected or below the quantification limits loqs suggesting no background contamination throughout the procedure the limits of detection lods and loqs were defined as signal to noise s n ratios of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively table s4 the method detection limits mdls were derived from the mean concentration and standard deviation of the procedure blanks for target analytes that were not detected mdls were derived from their corresponding lods table s4 in the standard addition tests the target pfaas recoveries in each matrix fell in acceptable intervals 60 140 table s4 2 5 dna extraction and high

relevant to archaea were removed the number of otus chao1 shannon wiener diversity and richness were calculated to show the alpha diversity of the microbiota community beta distance was determined by principal coordinate analysis pcoa hierarchical cluster analysis based on the bray curtis distance was performed to compare the distinction among different treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of pfaas from water the dynamics of pfaa concentrations over time in water are shown in fig s2 most pfaas concentrations remained unchanged until day 2 and then rapidly decreased with time until day 4 while the very long chained pfaas c 10 directly declined in the initial experiments after that the concentrations substantially remained unchanged on days 7 10 at the end of the experiment the lowest concentration in cg was observed in pfdoda 2 30 0 11 µg l followed by pfda 2 79 0 24 µg l and pfunda 2 56 0 26 µg l while the highest concentration was found in pfba 6 64 0 25 µg l fig 1 a a similar trend was observed in pw1 2 30 0 11 µg l for pfdoda 6 64 0 25 µg l for pfba and cd1 1 10 0 11 µg l for pfdoda 5 69 0 25 µg l for pfba these results indicated that pfaas with longer chain lengths were more easily removed from the water the removal percentages of pfaas in cd1 and pw1 were 0 63 13 37 and 2 53 22 81 higher than those in cg suggesting that the presence of submerged macrophytes especially c demersum could enhance the dissipation of pfaas from water 3 2 possible removal processes of pfaas in constructed wetlands 3 2 1 sorption of pfaas to sediment pfaa concentrations in the sediment of all the treatments increased at the beginning of the experiments fig s3 concentrations for most pfaas reached a relatively stable level after seven days of exposure except for the very long chained pfaas c 10 which kept a moderate increase during the whole exposure period at the end of the experiment the pfaas concentrations were 13 72 31 29 ng g dw in cg 11 11 23 67 ng g dw in pw1 and 7 87 24 66 ng g dw in cd1 concentrations of pfcas except pfba and pfpea in different treatments can be sorted as cg pw1 cd1 p 0 05 fig 1b the presence of submerged macrophytes especially c demersum could significantly alleviate the adsorption of pfcas to sediment because the uptake of contaminants from overlying water into shoots could decrease their concentrations in pore water by affecting the exchange balance between overlying water and pore water and the uptake of contaminants from pore water into roots might compete with the adsorption onto sediment diepens et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 long chained pfcas c 8 in sediment exhibited significantly higher concentrations than short chained pfcas p 0 05 for pfos and pfna belonging to pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluoroalkyl moieties the former exhibited significantly higher concentrations p 0 05 similar observations were found between pfhxs and pfhpa the results suggested that the hydrophobicity of pfaas determined their affinity to absorb onto sediment which was in accordance with observations in crops and vegetables gredelj et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c the interactions of pfaas between sediment and water can be profiled by kd chen et al 2019a liu et al 2019b at the end of the experiment the kd values were in the range of 2 38 pfbs 11 22 pfunda l kg 1 90 pfbs 12 08 pfdoda l kg and 2 74 pfba 14 08 pfdoda l kg in cg pw1 and cd1 respectively table 1 pfaas sorption onto sediment was suggested to be determined by the properties of molecules solution and the sorbent groffen et al 2019 higgins and luthy 2006 liu et al 2019b under simulation systems with the same water and sediment the distribution was more likely to depend on their physicochemical properties zhang et al 2019a as shown in fig 1c spearman s correlation analysis identified significant monotonic relationships between log kd and perfluoroalkyl chain length nc in all treatments cg r 0 970 p 0 01 pw1 r 0 913 p 0 01 cd1 r 0 742 p 0 01 confirming that hydrophobic effects might be the main sorption mechanisms for pfaas on sediment pfcas and pfsas with the same perfluoroalkyl chain length such as pfpea pfbs pfhpa pfhxs and pfna pfos pfsas showed higher kd because pfsas with sulfonate groups were more hydrophobic than pfcas with carboxylate groups du et al 2014 however no significant differences were confirmed among the different treatments indicating that submerged macrophyte types could not significantly affect pfaas distribution between water and sediment 3 2 2 uptake of pfaas by submerged macrophytes the observed concentrations of individual pfaas in the shoots and roots of submerged macrophytes during the whole experiment are shown in fig s4 concentrations of pfaas in shoots and roots of two submerged macrophytes increased rapidly on days 0 2 and slowly increased to a steady state at the end of the experiment long chained pfaas exhibited a significantly higher affinity for bioaccumulation by submerged macrophytes than short chained pfaas p 0 05 based on the whole plants bioconcentration factors bcfs of short chained pfaas were comparable for the two macrophytes table 1 while bcfs of long chained pfaas for c demersum were significantly higher than those for p wrightii p 0 05 for example the bcfs for pfba were 33 88 1 19 l kg and 22 38 0 07 l kg in p wrightii and c demersum the bcf for pfos in c demersum 992 99 13 04 l kg was approximately five times higher than that in p wrightii the results indicated that c demersum was more suitable to remove long chained pfaas in constructed wetlands than p wrightii moreover a significant perfluoroalkyl chain length dependency was found in the observed log bcfs of pfaas r2 0 7307 p 0 05 fig s5 indicating that uptake of pfaas by submerged macrophytes in constructed wetlands was subjected to the hydrophobicity of pfaas a similar mechanism was observed in agricultural plants and hydroponically aquatic macrophytes gredelj et al 2020 pi et al 2017 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c in the rooted submerged macrophytes of p wrightii the bcfs of shoots and roots ranged from 32 83 pfba 1060 pfdoa and 59 4 pfba 701 44 pfdoa respectively table 1 indicating the comparable uptake potential of shoots and roots similarly log bcfs of shoots and roots also showed significant correlations with nc shoots r 0 9934 p 0 01 roots r 0 5912 p 0 05 fig s5 suggesting that perfluoroalkyl chain length was a key factor regulating pfaa uptake in both shoots and roots the observed translocation factors tfs varied from 0 55 pfba to 2 86 pfoa table 1 at the end of the experiments pfaas with nc 8 were more preferentially distributed in roots i e tfs 1 while pfaas with nc 8 were more likely to be located in shoots notably the uptake of shoots was mainly via direct uptake from water the translocation of hydrophobic organic contaminants by submerged macrophytes from roots to shoots was much weaker compared to other aquatic plants because of the deficiency of transpiration tao et al 2015 in addition previous studies reported that it is challenging to translocate pfaas in fibrous roots the root type of p wrighti because their developed aerenchyma might make the translocation longer and more tortuous gu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 therefore the observed translocations of pfaas with nc 8 in the present study might be attributed to their preferential absorption to shoots additionally pfaas influence on the growth of submerged macrophytes was observed during the experimental period fig s6 the dry biomass increased from 1 16 to 2 38 g in pw1 1 62 2 90 g in pw2 1 97 5 01 g in cd1 and 1 95 4 44 g in cd2 the growth of the two submerged macrophytes fit the first order kinetics well p 0 05 the first order rate constant k g in pw1 0 08 0 21 was significantly lower than that in pw2 0 14 0 03 in contrast no significant deviations in k g were found between cd1 0 11 0 02 and cd2 0 12 0 03 the results suggested that pfaas could inhibit the growth of p wrightii but not c demersum 3 2 3 bioaccumulation of pfaas by microbiota microbiota grown in aquatic environments can be divided into planktonic microbes biofilm microbes and rhizosphere microbes according to their ecological niches yan et al 2017 biofilms were embedded in the matrix of epss which contained many functional groups such as amine carboxyl and hydroxyl groups these groups were conducive to the sorption of pfaas du et al 2014 vu and wu 2020 yan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b herein the concentrations of pfaas in planktonic microbes microbes and epss in biofilms and rhizosphere microbes were observed no significant differences between the individual pfaa concentrations except pfunda in the rhizosphere and non rhizosphere sediment of p wrighti were observed p 0 05 fig s7 one possible reason might be that the fibrous roots were so well developed and almost overgrew after 24 days of culture that the differences between rhizosphere and non rhizosphere sediment were blurred thus the uptake of pfaas by rhizosphere microbiota was not discussed in the present study the concentrations of pfaas in planktonic microbes ranged from 1 22 to 29 81 µg g dw in cg 3 65 195 98 µg g dw in pw1 and 3 58 177 17 µg g dw in cd1 fig 2 a biofilm microbes bioaccumulated significantly lower pfaa concentrations than planktonic microbes p 0 05 with concentration ranges of 0 02 11 29 µg g dw in pw1 and 0 0004 4 74 µg g dw in cd1 in the epss of biofilms pfaas exhibited concentration ranges of 0 04 1 37 µg g dw in pw1 and 0 14 7 51 µg g dw in cd1 the bcfs of microbiota with different niches are summarized in table s6 bcfs in planktonic microbes were comparable between pw1 598 73 44 182 l kg and cd1 658 54 72 930 l kg regardless of the types of submerged macrophytes bcfs in cg 192 23 12 952 l kg were significantly lower than those in treatments with macrophytes suggesting that the presence of submerged macrophytes could enhance the uptake of pfaas by planktonic microbes the distribution of pfaas in biofilm microbes was in accordance with that in planktonic microbes in addition log bcfs in the biofilm microbes were relatively lower by 1 47 5 06 units than those in planktonic microbes log bcfs based on the whole biofilms including microbes and epss were comparable with those in planktonic microbes and were 0 02 4 36 units higher than those based on biofilm microbes our findings indicated that planktonic microbes and biofilms showed a comparable potential to absorb pfaas and that epss may play a crucial role in bioaccumulating pfaas in biofilms pearson s correlation analysis showed a significant correlation between log bcfs of planktonic microbes and nc in all treatments cg r 0 6678 p 0 05 pw1 r 0 6806 p 0 05 cd1 r 0 9224 p 0 01 fig 2b similar monotonical relationships were also observed between log bcfs of biofilm microbes and nc pw1 r 0 8605 p 0 01 cd1 r 0 7836 p 0 01 fig 2b our results demonstrated that the perfluoroalkyl chain length could regulate pfaa distribution behavior and that hydrophobic bonding might be the key mechanism in controlling the uptake of both planktonic microbes and biofilm microbes similar observations were also reported in the sorption of sediment and the uptake of crops and organisms chen et al 2019a dong et al 2020 du et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 laboratory sorption experiments argued that the sorption of pfaas on bacteria was more complicated than expected and that the mechanisms were at least concerned about hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 furthermore a strong significant correlation between log bcfs of pfaas by biofilm and nc was only observed in pw1 r 0 9547 p 0 01 but not in cd1 fig 2b only pfaas with nc 8 exhibited a monotonic relationship with nc r 0 9048 p 0 05 in cd1 considering that the log bcfs in biofilm microbes were observed to be regulated by nc the significantly higher affinity of epss to adsorb pfaas with nc 8 in epss might be responsible for the nonsignificant correlation in cd1 similarly nugyen et al recently reported that the sorption of short chained pfaas nc 5 onto soil was not regulated by perfluoroalkyl chain length this process was more likely related to the interactions between ionic groups of pfaas and soil in contrast the sorption of long chained pfaas nc 5 onto soil was significantly regulated by perfluoroalkyl chain length and this process was mainly forced by hydrophobic effects nguyen et al 2020 the adsorption of pfaas on bacteria was reported to be influenced by cell wall structure and hydrophobic and proton active binding sites butzen et al 2020 fitzgerald et al 2018 two main compounds in epss protein and humic like substances are involved in pfoa adsorption yan et al 2021 the aromatic and amide groups of proteins can bind pfoa while the mono force between humic like substances and pfoa was not strong enough to bind pfoa but only attracted pfoa thus it can be speculated that the epss composition determines how pfaas are absorbed and the formation of epss is greatly influenced by the function and structure of the microbial community as well as the nature of the macrophytes on which the biofilms attach flemming et al 2016 qin et al 2019 3 3 mass distribution of pfaas in constructed wetland systems the mass distribution of pfaas in water sediment shoots roots planktonic microbes and biofilms microbes and epss is shown in fig 3 the sum of all percentages ranged from 86 95 to 106 59 which fell at acceptable intervals at the end of the experiment 33 59 76 98 of pfaas could be removed from water in the control group the presence of submerged macrophytes could enhance pfaas removal efficiency and was 36 32 80 93 and 43 12 88 99 in treatments with p wrightii and c demersum respectively pfaas with longer perfluoroalkyl chain lengths were more likely to be removed our results suggested that pfaas can be removed not only by the adsorption of pfaas and the uptake of submerged macrophytes but also by the bioaccumulation of microbiota sediment was identified as a crucial sink adsorbing 29 04 66 43 of pfaas in the control group 23 51 50 09 of pfaas in pw1 and 16 65 52 18 of pfaas in cd1 in p wrightii 0 45 6 59 of pfaas were bioaccumulated in shoots in comparison contributions of its roots were relatively low 0 20 because the biomass of roots was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of shoots 2 28 g dw of shoots 0 09 g dw of roots c demersum showed a better capacity for the uptake of pfaas 0 91 32 03 than p wrightii interestingly considerable amounts of pfaas were adsorbed onto the microbiota although pfaas were resistant to biodegradation indicating that microbiota could compete effectively with sediment adsorption and phytoextraction and that the role of microbiota in bioaccumulating pfaas cannot be ignored in detail planktonic microbes preloaded 0 66 14 67 of pfaas in cg 0 39 20 96 of pfaas in pw1 and 0 23 15 68 of pfaas in cd1 biofilms contributed 0 52 15 03 in treatments with p wrightii and 0 99 26 78 in treatments with c demersum in biofilms pfaas were more likely to be distributed in epss than microbes with contributions of 0 03 7 95 for biofilm microbes and 0 39 14 15 for epss in pw1 and contributions of 0 01 15 68 for biofilm microbes and 0 53 26 77 for epss in cd1 similarly 77 of acenaphthene sanches et al 2017 60 67 of copper lin et al 2020 and 94 of dye mona et al 2011 were removed by eps adsorption suggesting that sorption on epss made outstanding contributions to the bioaccumulation of pfaas in biofilms 3 4 shifts in microbial diversity under pfaa pressure to profile the microbial community structure 922 855 high quality sequences were obtained from the samples of planktonic microbes biofilms sediment and rhizosphere general information about sequencing data the numbers of otus chao1 shannon wiener diversity and richness are displayed in table s5 pcoa revealed variation patterns in microbial community structure among different treatments fig 4 a and b pcoa axis 1 and 2 explained 43 3 and 18 2 of the variability in the water and biofilms respectively the results suggested significant differences in bacterial communities between the treatments with or without spiked pfaas in the sediment and rhizosphere pcoa axis 1 and 2 represented 44 2 and 28 variability respectively the distinctions in microbial community structures in both p wrighti and c demersum became fuzzy when pfaas were spiked into treatments the results suggested that pfaa pollution may drive the microbial community to shift towards the same direction in the sediment and rhizosphere the presence of pfaas and submerged macrophytes could selectively influence the microbial community in which beneficiary microbiota will survive and occupy the dominant states miura et al 2007 yu et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 the identified bacterial community compositions and relative abundances are shown in fig 4c e at the phylum and class levels in water and biofilms the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria 53 61 78 51 followed by bacteroidetes 2 41 27 92 cyanobacteria 0 70 17 7 and gemmatimonadetes 0 22 15 40 the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales 15 87 54 36 rhodobacterales 3 95 13 23 and pseudomonadales 0 01 25 93 pfaas increased the relative abundance of acetobacterales and cytophagales in both the water and biofilms in addition pfaas increased the relative abundance of sphingomonadales in the water of pw1 and pseudomonadales in the water of cd1 in the sediment and rhizosphere the dominant phyla were proteobacteria 36 10 75 26 firmicutes 0 28 41 50 and gemmatimonadetes 2 80 11 11 the dominant orders were betaproteobacteriales 28 66 64 28 and clostridiales 0 12 41 34 pfaas increased the relative abundance of betaproteobacteriales in pw1 and sbr1031 and betaproteobacteriales in cd1 under the pressure of pfaas increases in the relative abundance of clostridiales anaerolineales and sbr1031 were observed in the rhizosphere of p wrighti furthermore the presence of p wrighti could increase the relative abundance of betaproteobacteriales and sphingomonadales in water as well as the relative abundance of rokubacteriales and sbr1031 in sediment c demersum enhances the proportions of cytophagales in water and rokubacteriales and sbr1031 in sediment the similarity differences of microbial community at the genus level in different treatments are displayed in fig 5 pfaas presence increased the relative abundance of sediminibacterium in the water of both pw1 and cd2 sulfuritalea and thiobacillus in both the sediment and rhizosphere of p wrighti also distinct shifts of pfaas on the relative abundance of some microbiota were observed such as novosphingobium in the water of pw1 devosia niveispirillum flectobacillus and arcicella in the water of cd1 methylophilus in the biofilm of pw1 cyanobium pcc 6307 in the biofilms of cd1 c1 b045 and immundisolibacter in the sediment of pw1 methylophilus in the sediment of cd1 and pseudomonas in the rhizosphere of pw1 our results proposed that bioaccumulation biosorption and uptake played a crucial role in pfaa removal due to pfaas high persistence it is of great importance to identify tolerant microbiota in natural conditions as shown above pfaas and submerged macrophytes presence shifted the relative abundance of some microbial communities indicating their potential to tolerate and accumulate pfaas most of them were in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales in some previous studies sediminibacterium thiobacillus and betaproteobacteriales were identified and characterized as microbes tolerant to pfaas cerro galvez et al 2020 chen et al 2019b li et al 2017 a few pseudomonas strains have been isolated and modified as pfaa biodegrades such as pseudomonas parafulva yab 1 yi et al 2019 and pseudomonas plecoglossicida 2 4 d chetverikov et al 2017 acetobacterales and sphingomonadales were suggested to be related to the degradation of organic contaminants including sulfonamide aromatic hydrocarbons and pahs zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 furthermore previous studies have shown that acetobacterales sphingomonadales pseudomonadales betaproteobacteriales and cytophagales are aerobic bacteria yan et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 the do released by submerged macrophytes may contribute to the dominance of these aerobic bacteria accordingly our results showed that the microbial community s diversity was lower in the treatments with than without submerged macrophytes table s5 but the abundance of pfaa resistant strains was enhanced 4 conclusions our study provided comprehensive insights into the removal of pfaas in constructed wetlands with submerged macrophytes by clarifying the removal efficiency of pfaas in simulated systems with two typical submerged macrophytes exploring the possible removal processes by quantifying their contributions excavating the linkage between pfaa properties and their removal and profiling the shifts in microbial community structure in water biofilms sediment and the rhizosphere our results showed that the removal percentages of pfaas in the treatments with p wrightii and c demersum were 0 63 13 37 and 2 53 22 81 higher than those without submerged macrophytes sediment sorption and phytoextraction and the absorption uptake and adsorption of planktonic microbes and biofilms were identified as pfaas main removal routes in comparison to p wrightii c demersum showed a better capacity to remove pfaas by impeding sediment sorption directly bioaccumulating pfaas and enhancing microbiota uptake the sorption bioaccumulation was associated with the perfluoroalkyl chain length except biofilms attached in c demersum suggesting hydrophobic effects might be the key mechanism controlling the removal processes furthermore the presence of pfaas and submerged macrophytes shifted the microbial community structure and the abundance of some strains in betaproteobacteriales sphingomonadales and cytophagales was increased the present study underlined the considerable role of submerged macrophytes and the microbial community in pfaa removal in aquatic environments and further studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms of the interactions between pfaas and microbiota such as by elucidating how the fundamental differences between planktonic microbes and biofilms as well as the epss excreted by microbiota regulate

17031,particulate organic carbon poc sources which regulate dissolved organic carbon sediment organic carbon and inorganic carbon via deposition degradation and mineralization play an important role in lake ecosystems linear or bayesian algorithms on isotope and n alkanes have been widely used to identify the source proportion of organic carbon however the applicability of these methods is ambiguous because of the unilateral advantages of each model and trace factors to test the applicability of the various methods for identifying poc sources we analyzed dual isotopes and n alkanes in surface water samples of lake taihu and multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model were used to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous contributions carbon isotope presented a clear advantage in west taihu 21 85 0 78 and southwest taih 22 61 1 35 nitrogen isotope also showed high values in meiliang bay 9 76 0 92 the majority of the lake was dominated by short chain n alkanes except for east taihu lake dominated by medium chain n alkanes and areas with riverine input dominated by long chain n alkanes different principles between the bayesian mixing model based on the markov chain monte carlo algorithm and the multi source mixing model based on linear estimation caused discrepancies in the estimations of source contributions but the fraction of chemical compounds during the migration process and the overlap of potential sources play important role in the inconsistency of results the estimations from the different models were consistent in indicating the dominance of endogenous organic carbon in lake taihu mean of 60 18 20 26 particularly in the north and western regions west taihu meiliang bay and southwest taihu this was likely due to algal aggregation influenced by human activities and climatic factors keywords particulate organic carbon stable isotope n alkanes bayesian mixing model algal blooms 1 introduction lakes are crucial regions for organic carbon migration and transformation le quere et al 2015 tranvik et al 2009 westberry and meredith 2016 particulate organic carbon poc an important fraction of the lacustrine organic carbon pool significantly regulates the dissolved organic carbon sediment organic carbon and inorganic carbon pools via deposition degradation and mineralization behrenfeld et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 tranvik et al 2009 according to its geochemical characteristics poc can be separated into autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon which are associated with phytoplankton primary production and terrestrial organic carbon terre oc from soil erosion respectively young terre oc and autochthonous poc can be easily mineralized to co2 and ch4 by heterotrophy galy et al 2015 in contrast allochthonous aged poc is preferentially trapped in lake sediments and subsequently contributes to the long term carbon cycle battin et al 2008 guillemette et al 2017 aged poc can also be decomposed due to the effect of additional labile organic matter known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 guenet et al 2010 kuzyakov 2010 previous studies have suggested that the priming effect significantly increases the amount of organic carbon mineralization in soil and water by 400 1100 and 10 500 respectively bianchi 2011 guenet et al 2010 large amounts of terre oc and nutrients are transported to lakes via anabatic soil erosion galy et al 2015 leading to enhanced eutrophication and algal blooms paerl 2017 the increasing autochthonous oc from eutrophication and algal blooms changes the poc composition of lakes that were formerly dominated by terre oc this subsequently alters the roles and effects of lake transitions on the global carbon cycle thus changing the poc composition would significantly alter greenhouse gas emissions and organic carbon burial in lakes the flux concentration and pool of poc in rivers lakes and oceans have been widely studied due to their influence on the global carbon cycle huang et al 2017 mcclelland et al 2016 however the limited acknowledgement of poc composition composition of autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon restrains the further application of the poc flux concentration and pool in the global carbon cycle as well as the regulation effect of composition to the poc burial and mineralization gudasz et al 2012 watanabe and kuwae 2015 the composition of poc is complex but some algorithms can be used to estimate organic matter composition the linear mixing source model has been used to identify the relative contributions of potential sources by solving a number of equations dawson and pate 1996 phillips and gregg 2003 it provides a simple and favorable method for quantifying organic carbon and has been widely used in source partitioning xu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 the developed model isosource phillips and gregg 2003 provides a range of feasible solutions making up the perplexity when the number of sources exceeds the number of tracers by more than one layman et al 2012 however the linear mixing source model can provide inaccurate source contributions when considering the source uncertainty occurred in transmission parnell et al 2010 the bayesian algorithm considers the inherent variability in natural systems e g siar parnell et al 2010 mixsir moore and semmens 2008 and mixsiar stock and semmens 2016b to obtain more reliable effects of source separation thus its application for source partitioning is more reasonable these models provide important principles and methods for determining potential source contributions and have been widely applied to estimate the contribution of each endmember dawson and pate 1996 huang et al 2017 parnell et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however choosing the most appropriate method is crucial and it is difficult to treat the results of quantitative research from a more critical perspective it is therefore necessary to fully understand the features and applicability of the various models wang et al 2019 compared the applicability of the three bayesian models siar mixsir and mixsiar but a comparison between the linear model and the bayesian mixing model is still lacking stable isotopes e g carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotopes and biomolecular markers e g n alkanes and fatty acids are verified practical tools for tracing poc sources due to the differences in the molecular structure elementary composition and isotope fractionation of organic carbon alewell et al 2016 machiwa 2010 meisel et al 2011 the different δ13c and δ15n compositions of higher and lower plants induced by isotope fractionation from photosynthesis can be used to distinguish their contributions to organic carbon machiwa 2010 in general the carbon isotope values of terrestrial c3 plants 30 to 20 are more negative than those of terrestrial c4 plants 19 to 9 moreover the δ13c values of endogenous organic matter range between 19 and 22 lopes et al 2013 stuiver 1975 in order to overcome the identification uncertainty from the bacterial and thermal fractionation of δ13c and δ15n the biomolecular marker and its monomer carbon isotope alewell et al 2016 even the elements composition carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus measured by ft ms high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry hertkorn et al 2013 were used as the auxiliary the distribution of carbon chain in n alkanes of organic matter has been used as a source indicator of algae and fungi hydrophytes and terrestrial higher plants which are represented by short n c14 n c20 medium n c20 n c25 and long n c27 n c33 carbon chain respectively ficken et al 2000 sojinu et al 2012 both isotopes and n alkanes are proven indicators of organic carbon composition however these indicators can cause confusion and contradiction because poc sources are complex and controlled by multiple factors it is therefore necessary to use a variety of indicators to comprehensively classify poc in this study dual stable isotope and biomolecular marker techniques were adopted in the bayesian mixing model and multi source mixing model to 1 evaluate the consistency of these models and trace factors and 2 identify the driving factors and spatial temporal variation of autochthonous and allochthonous contributions to poc in the surface water of lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling taihu lake is a large shallow freshwater inland lake with significant eutrophication and abundant algal blooms duan et al 2009 duan et al 2015 the entire lake is connected to 117 rivers most of which flow into the west and north of taihu lake and out of east taihu qin et al 2007 complex hydrodynamic conditions change the composition and distribution of nutrients in taihu lake and the water constituents show obvious spatial heterogeneity between different parts of the lake li et al 2017 based on the spatial heterogeneity of water quality taihu lake is divided into meiliang bay gonghu bay east taihu southwest taihu south taihu west taihu and central taihu fig 1 zhang et al 2017 the northwestern area is typically more polluted and have abundant algal blooms while the southeastern area is generally less polluted qin et al 2007 dong et al 2014 taihu lake is an ideal location for studying the carbon cycle of a typical eutrophic lake the organic carbon sources to the lake are spatially variable due to the spatial heterogeneity of water quality which provides unique conditions for distinguishing of organic carbon sources fifty nine surface water samples from taihu lake were collected during august 1 3 2019 and the sample locations were accurately recorded using a global positioning system gps the water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles washed with hydrochloric acid and filtered immediately through 0 7 µm whatman gf f filters pre combusted at 450 c for 6 h and weighed all filters and water samples were rapidly transferred to the laboratory in ice without light and stored at 2 c in a freezer until further treatment in the laboratory the water samples were analyzed for poc concentrations the natural abundance of δ13c and δ15n n alkane concentrations n c12 n c35 water constituents total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total suspended matter tsm and chlorophyll a chl a water quality tn tp chl a and tsm was measured according to the method described in our previous study huang et al 2017 and the results are shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of n alkanes δ13c and δ15n before laboratory analysis the filters were dried in an oven at 55 c and then weighed the filters were then acidified with hydrochloric acid for 12 h and then weighed after drying in an oven at 55 c poc δ13c and δ15n values were then determined using a thermo mat253 plus li et al 2018 wang et al 2013 carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were expressed in delta notation δ13c δ15n relative to vienna pdb and atmospheric nitrogen respectively and the standard deviations based on replicate measurements for δ13c and δ15n were both approximately 0 05 the n alkanes were extracted using a dichloromethane methanol solution 93 7 v v via microwave extraction and quantified by shimadzu qp2010 plus gc ms liu and liu 2016 the n alkanes were extracted from the filter by microwave extraction 100 c 10 min using a dichloromethane methanol solution 93 7 v v each extract was concentrated to 1 ml by three centrifugations at 30 c with n hexane the concentrated extract was purified by chromatography using 45 ml n hexane and then the eluent with n alkanes was concentrated to 1 ml a shimadzu qp2010 plus gc ms with an agilent hp 5 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 µm was used to quantify the n alkanes the temperature gradually increased from 50 c to 280 c at a rate of 10 c min the injection volume was 1 µl and the flow rate was 1 5 ml min 3 model application and validation 3 1 multi source mixing and bayesian mixing models in this study the multi source mixing model dawson and pate 1996 huang et al 2017 and bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 stock and semmens 2016b were applied to evaluate the relative contributions of endogenous and exogenous poc in the surface water of taihu lake dual stable isotopes n alkanes and their combinations were selected as indicators to estimate model bias and applicability 3 1 1 multi source mixing model multi source mixing model was established using the mass balance equation and expressed as follows 1 c i 1 n c i p i 2 0 p i 1 a n d i 1 n p i 1 where p i is the relative contribution of the ith potential source to the poc in taihu lake and c i is the endmember value for the ith potential source where c is the measured value the model solution will be problematic if the number of sources exceeds the number of tracers by more than one therefore the optimal target equation was used to simulate the potential source contribution huang et al 2017 smith et al 2018 and is expressed as follows 3 m i n c i 1 n c i p i c 2 3 1 2 bayesian mixing model the bayesian mixing model implemented using an r package mixsiar version 3 1 11 consolidates the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform and diversifies the set of available parameterizations stock et al 2018 this model is a logical prior distribution based on a dirichlet distribution and a bayesian framework evans et al 2000 the uncertainty of the endmember is introduced into the calculation and the fractionation factor of the isotope is considered based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm the output of the bayesian model is a probability distribution that is not a specific value and is expressed as the mean standard deviation sd the error structure was set as process error and specify prior was set as uninformative respectively more details regarding the parameters of this model can be found in stock et al 2018 3 2 endmember selection differences in the nitrogen and carbon isotopes of terrestrial plants and algae typically reflect the differences in photosynthesis and assimilation machiwa 2010 compared with other biological compounds n alkanes are more suitable for determining organic matter sources due to their source specificity and strong resistance to bacterial degradation xing et al 2011 in this study δ13c double isotopes δ13c and δ15n and n alkanes were selected as tracers and the double isotopes combined with the terrestrial plant to algae ratio tar were used as another tracer to eliminate misleading effects on the simulation the tar values were normalized as follows 4 t a r t a r t a r 1 5 t a r c 15 c 17 c 19 c 25 c 27 c 29 for this estimate the ranges of potential sources were statistically estimated using sample data from the previous literature table 2 in addition 20 87 was selected as the endogenous endmember of δ13c which is consistent with the δ13c value of microcystis in taihu lake liu et al 2011 moreover 28 27 was considered the average value of the terrestrial endmember which corresponds to the δ13c value of organic matter in inflowing rivers fig 2 similarly 1 70 and 11 26 were considered the values of exogenous and endogenous endmembers of δ15n respectively the n alkanes at sampling points 63 and 78 fig 1 had distinct exogenous characteristics and were treated as the exogenous endmembers while sampling points 14 49 59 and 80 fig 1 had distinct endogenous characteristics and were treated as the endogenous endmembers the characteristics of n alkanes endmembers are shown in fig 3 3 3 model verification and validation 3 3 1 model verification in this study isotopes and n alkanes were used as the parameters in multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model to estimate the potential source contributions of poc in the surface water of taihu the modeled contribution of endogenous poc is shown in fig 4 and the sd of the bayesian simulation is shown in fig 5 based on the differences in model principles and the variety of tracer selections the results of some points showed notable inconsistencies a slightly higher contribution most were 50 of endogenous organic carbon modeled by n alkanes was determined by the bayesian mixing model fig 4 and the lowest sd was also observed in this model fig 5 we observed some extreme results in the multi source mixing model especially in simulations with n alkanes and combining tar with dual isotopes showing 100 or 0 contribution from endogenous poc fig 4 in this study the results with significant deviations were eliminated to modify the estimated contribution and the mean value of the remaining simulation results was used to represent the contribution of endogenous and exogenous poc in the surface water of taihu lake the results from the multi source mixing model with carbon isotope and double isotopes and the bayesian mixing model with carbon isotopes double isotopes and tar combined with double isotopes were selected to estimate the percentage of endogenous and exogenous poc in the taihu surface water the total results and modified results are shown in fig 6 a and the uncertainty of the modified results was significantly reduced the model stability for the modified results significantly improved with a notably lower relative standard deviation rsd 14 33 11 27 than that of the total results 32 01 25 86 fig 6b 3 3 2 representative evaluation of endmembers the complexity of poc sources increases the possibility of heterogeneous inputs which affects the accuracy of the simulation results overlapping signatures of isotopic and carbon number distributions of n alkanes in different species may lead to false distinctions between potential sources the overlap of isotopic values between phytoplankton and terrestrial c3 plants using co2 as a carbon source xu et al 2017 and the confusion between urban sewage agricultural non point source pollution and endogenous organic matter yu et al 2018 both increase the inaccuracy of source allocation isotopes and the combination of double isotopes and tar values were selected as tracers based on the mass balance principle the multi source mixing model considers that the sum of the contributions of each endmember is 100 constraint condition in eq 2 assuming that the endmembers can cover the source of the sample the unconstrained mode of the multi source mixing model constraint condition in eq 2 was removed was adopted to verify the representability of the endmembers no interference from heterogeneous sources can be simply verified when the sum of contributions from potential sources is close to 100 in the unconstrained mode the reasonability of the endmember selection of isotopes and tar values is verified in the unconstrained multi source mixing model which indicates that the sum of endogenous and exogenous contributions is close to 100 fig 7 this proves that it is almost free from the interference of heterogeneous inputs 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of poc stable isotopes and n alkanes the poc concentrations in the surface water corresponding to each sampling point by idw interpolation are shown in fig 8 a in general we observed obvious spatial heterogeneity in surface water poc concentrations with values ranging from 0 47 mg l to 19 72 mg l average of 2 75 2 70 mg l and the most frequently observed values were between 0 47 and 8 60 mg l the highest poc concentrations were observed in southwest taihu mean value of 4 97 5 03 mg l followed by meilang bay west taihu and gonghu bay with average values of 3 22 1 22 2 80 1 27 and 2 57 1 26 mg l respectively the lowest poc values were observed in central taihu average of 1 82 1 31 mg l and east taihu average of 1 05 0 30 mg l due to the absence of river inflow to these regions qin et al 2007 fig 1 notably spatial heterogeneity was most pronounced in southwest taihu minimum of 1 86 mg l maximum of 19 72 mg l which was likely due to the widespread distribution of algae in the surface water xu et al 2019 the surface water δ13c values varied from 27 21 to 19 25 and the mean value was 23 70 1 85 the δ13c values were higher in west taihu 21 85 0 78 southwest taihu 22 61 1 35 and meiliang bay 22 68 1 36 due to the high occurrence of algal blooms embodied as high δ13c values xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2009 fig 8b the lower δ13c values 27 12 0 09 in the eastern region of taihu lake indicate the dominance of terre oc embodied as low δ13c values xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2008 similarly the surface water δ15n values ranged from 1 61 to 11 42 with an average value of 7 07 1 96 this suggests that the organics in taihu lake had mixed terrigenous and algal sources emerson and hedges 1988 which is consistent with the δ13c data results meiliang bay 9 76 0 92 and gonghu bay 8 27 1 00 showed higher δ15n fig 8c due to the influence of algal blooms embodied as high δ15n values emerson and hedges 1988 herczeg et al 2001 the large amount of domestic and industrial wastewater flowing into meiliang bay results in relatively high δ15n values costanzo et al 2005 in contrast the average δ15n value 5 65 1 27 in east taihu was lower than that in other regions due to the predominance of terrestrial organic matter luo et al 2014 the total concentrations of n alkanes n c12 n c35 ranged from 3 87 to 507 15 ng l with a mean value of 63 18 92 12 ng l the relative abundance of short chain n c12 n c20 middle chain n c21 n c25 and long chain n alkanes n c26 n c35 to the total n alkanes are shown in fig 9 we observed notable spatial heterogeneity of the different sources based on the n alkanes composition the concentrations of middle chain n alkanes mean of 56 37 3 65 was higher in east taihu than in other regions blue dashed line in fig 9 indicating the dominance of aquatic plants qin et al 2007 except for east taihu short chain n alkanes were the dominant composition throughout the entire lake region red dashed line in fig 9 in contrast the average concentrations of long chain n alkanes were 30 in most regions except for east taihu table 3 due to the high contribution of algae and photosynthetic bacteria to organic matter short chain n alkanes were the most abundant in west taihu average of 63 81 11 05 table 3 indicating the highest algal aggregation in this region zhang et al 2017 however phytoplankton aggregation is influenced by multiple factors including nutrient stimulation hydrodynamic driving and vegetation structure causing high spatial heterogeneity of organic carbon sources within a region for example the inflowing rivers transport large amounts of terrestrial organic matter to meiliang bay and southwest taihu qin et al 2007 increasing the abundance of long chain n alkanes at sampling sites 78 and 63 black dashed line in fig 9 values of 77 65 and 61 45 respectively gonghu bay had notably higher proportions of short chain n alkanes mean of 48 23 25 31 and sample point 65 had a predominance of middle chain n alkanes blue dashed line in fig 9 value of 48 23 which is consistent with the growth of aquatic macrophytes near the estuary of gonghu bay li et al 2018 central taihu is an open water region that is strongly disturbed by wind li et al 2017 resulting in a mixed distribution of organic carbon of different origins moreover the indexes of n alkane congeners such as tar n c15 n c17 n c19 n c25 n c27 n c29 and l h n c15 n c20 n c21 n c34 can also indicate the same characteristics fang et al 2014 meyers 2003 and the values are shown in table 3 the lowest tar value was observed in east taihu lake average of 0 03 0 01 indicating the lowest organic carbon contribution from higher plants the highest l h value occurred in west taihu 1 65 0 89 which is consistent with the tar value derrien et al 2017 4 2 apportionment of endogenous and exogenous poc the average contribution rate of endogenous poc to the entire lake was 60 18 20 26 which was higher than that of exogenous poc mean of 39 82 20 26 moreover the endogenous poc contribution rate was higher in the north than in the south and higher in the west than in the east fig 10 this is consistent with the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes duan et al 2015 duan et al 2009 specifically west taihu had the highest endogenous poc contribution mean of 77 41 7 41 followed by meiliang bay mean of 75 46 13 59 and southwest taihu mean of 69 17 10 88 likely due to the influence of the southeast summer monsoon and the distribution of rivers li et al 2017 cai et al 2012 duan et al 2009 xu et al 2019 in contrast east taihu had the highest contribution of exogenous poc with an average of 78 20 3 60 compared with other regions both endogenous and exogenous poc contributions were moderate in gonghu bay central taihu and south taihu indicating a mixture of endogenous and exogenous poc 4 3 driving factors of autochthonous and allochthonous contributions as a large and shallow lake endogenous organic carbon mean of 60 18 20 26 plays a dominant role in organic carbon pool of taihu lake which is consistent with intensified human activities and climate warming in recent years and the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes duan et al 2015 duan et al 2009 phytoplankton is an important source of endogenous poc in lake taihu and chl a is considered a suitable indicator of phytoplankton stocks xu et al 2019 the coupled poc and chl a data were used to represent the relationship between phytoplankton organic carbon concentrations cphyto and chl a and the equation can be expressed as cphyto 0 1421 chl a 0 6589 r 2 0 95 n 324 huang et al 2019 in this study we observed a significant positive correlation between endogenous poc and cphyto fig 11 and the estimations of endogenous organic carbon were reliable for the entire lake the western and northern regions had higher endogenous poc contributions compared to the eastern and southern regions as a typical large and shallow eutrophic lake taihu shows spatial differences in native aquatic plants algal blooms inflow outflow rivers lake topography and hydraulic conditions which results in the spatial heterogeneity of potential poc sources nutrient and climate factors are the key parameters affecting endogenous organic carbon in northwest taihu lake as a result massive algal outbreaks occur in summer in response to nutrient supply and climate qin et al 2010 the high correlation between endogenous organic carbon algae driven organic carbon and tn and tp infers the strong influence of nutrients on the dominance of endogenous organic carbon fig 12 the notably higher supply of endogenous organic carbon in meiliang bay west taihu and southwest taihu is closely linked to the high riverine nutrient supply to the lake in this study tn concentrations in west taihu southwest taihu and meiliang bay were 5 76 2 81 5 19 1 35 and 5 26 1 08 mg l respectively and tp concentrations were 0 64 0 27 0 45 0 19 and 0 39 0 14 mg l respectively table 1 rapid urban development in the west and north of the taihu basin wuxi changzhou and yixing increased the riverine input of fertilizers industrial wastewaters and urban domestic sewage to the lake duan et al 2009 resulting in high nutrient accumulation tn and tp in the northwestern region the two northern bays meiliang bay and zhushan bay became the most polluted areas in the lake cai et al 2012 xu et al 2019 which promoted the growth of algae blooms in addition the southeast monsoon influences the taihu lake area in summer cai et al 2012 li et al 2017 resulting in the balloon structure of microcysts abeynayaka et al 2017 this causes algae to migrate to the northwestern region of the lake via the wind enhancing the contribution of endogenous organic carbon according to our estimations the lowest contribution of endogenous poc occurred in east taihu due to insufficient nutrient supply and the growth of aquatic plants east taihu has no river inflow but water flows out through the dapu and xijiang rivers leading to a shortage of nutrients east taihu showed low levels of both tn and tp means of 3 22 0 59 and 0 12 0 08 respectively which restricted algal growth in addition lower tp and suitable water depths provide beneficial growth conditions for aquatic plants the coverage of large underwater and above water plants in west taihu is 73 6 and 18 3 respectively and the dominance of aquatic plants limits the light levels required for algal growth gu et al 2005 phytoplankton growth is limited by insufficient light and low nutrient content table 1 which decreases the contribution of endogenous poc su et al 2016 in addition for central taihu gonghu bay there was a slight endogenic organic carbon advantage as a result of complex hydrodynamic conditions central taihu is a large open water area with shallow water depths wind disturbance causes the distribution of endogenous and exogenous fractions to have no clear dominance sediments are strongly disturbed in the vertical direction under wind speeds greater than 3 7 4 0 m s zheng et al 2015 and organic matter deposited in sediments are resuspended affecting the distribution of organic matter from potential sources 4 4 evaluation and comparison of model results in this study we used different tracers as parameters for multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model and identified the unique characteristics of different simulation methods the bayesian approach employs a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm which more effectively considers all parameters to produce a more realistic posterior distribution of proportional source contributions cooper and krueger 2017 moreover to obtain a more reliable probability distribution and improve the reliability and stability of the analysis results the uncertainty of the endmember is introduced into the calculation stock and semmens 2016a however too many tracer parameters can be problematic the simulation using n alkanes as tracers showed lower sensitivity based on the low standard deviation fig 5 and significant bias results fig 4 this was due to the fact that the source information provided by n c12 n c35 contained a large amount of overlap and interference information leading to a slightly higher contribution of endogenous organic carbon most of which were distributed above 50 fig 4 notably the uncertainty gives weight to the simulation results due to the complexity of nitrogen migration and transformation the potential source value of nitrogen isotopes is often unclear and the uncertainty is much greater than that of carbon isotopes which may lead to more favorable simulation results for carbon isotopes sensitivity analysis results in supporting information show that the smaller uncertainty of nitrogen isotopes improved the correlation between the simulation results and the nitrogen isotopes compared with the bayesian mixing model based on the mcmc algorithm multi source mixing model uses a linear method to allocate the source of organic matter cooper et al 2014 smith et al 2018 due to the lack of uncertainty the selection of endmember values is particularly important for the multi source mixing model unrepresentative endmember values lead to deviations in the simulation results the abundant carbon number of n alkanes provides a variety of information but the complex parameter information also restricts the use of n alkanes in regions with complex organic carbon sources the peak distribution of n alkanes is diversified and the selection of endmembers is particularly important overlapping signatures of the carbon number distribution of n alkanes in different species may lead to false distinctions between potential sources some algae such as diatoms can produce n alkanes dominated by long chains sinninghe damsté et al 1999 in addition n alkanes contaminated by oil and strong bacterial activity with even predominance of carbon short chains can also affect the estimation of allochthonous and autochthonous origin fang et al 2014 han and calvin 1969 the overlap of n alkanes distributions from different types of organisms makes it difficult to distinguish the specific biological sources from mixture n alkanes the n alkanes indicating aquatic plants also have a relatively higher contribution to the higher carbon numbers which leads to an overestimation of terre oc this adds to the difficulty in determining the endmember values due to the differences between isotopes and n alkanes such as oxidation reduction and saturation bianchi and canuel 2011 divarication occurs when different traces are used to indicate autochthonous and allochthonous sources the uniqueness of isotopes and biomarkers was revealed in the multi source mixing model therefore more attention should be placed on the deviation and bias between different tracers when using the multi source mixing model the indication deviation is caused by isotope fractionation during organic matter transfer li et al 2002 yun and ro 2008 organic matter is degraded during the transfer process but n alkanes which are difficult to degrade are preserved and cannot represent the characteristics of the original bulk organic matter derrien et al 2017 xu et al 2017 therefore consistency of the reference indication of isotopes and n alkanes during biogeochemical processes is a precondition for index combinations the uncertainty of isotope endmember values is also a cause of the deviation in the region with higher δ15n value the misleading indication for sewage should be considered the nitrogen isotope composition can infer the difference between aquatic no3 as a nitrogen source and terrestrial plants n2 as a nitrogen source teranes and bernasconi 2000 urban sewage and agricultural non point source pollution δ15n value of 8 5 significantly increases the content of δ15n yu et al 2018 leading to the overestimation of algal organic matter for example the region in taihu lake connected to inflowing rivers which is significantly polluted by fertilizer and sewage from wuxi changzhou and other cities duan et al 2009 the unique of nitrogen isotope values was exposed in multi source mixing model 5 conclusion in this study we coupled stable isotopes with n alkanes using the multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model to estimate autochthonous and allochthonous poc contributions in the surface water of taihu lake the results are summarized as follows 1 the bayesian approach employs an mcmc sampling algorithm which produces more stable source contributions however a tracer containing a variety of information such as n c12 n c35 should be used with care to prevent the confusion caused by excessive parameter inputs moreover caution should be taken when using the multi source mixing model to determine endmember values in areas involving complex organic matter sources as the model uses a linear method to allocate organic matter sources the model revealed the bias of the tracers caused by fractionation and degradation during transportation moreover consistency of the indication significance of isotopes and n alkanes during transfer is a precondition for index combination 2 endogenous poc has a higher contribution rate than exogenous poc during algal blooms in the large and shallow taihu lake moreover endogenous oc is more abundant in the northwestern lake region nutrient accumulation in the northwestern lake area and the influence of the southeast monsoon are the causes for the higher contribution rates of endogenous poc in meiliang bay west taihu lake and southwest taihu lake the growth of aquatic plants and the lack of nutrients resulted in the lowest contribution rate from endogenous poc in east taihu the open water area is disturbed by the wind and the advantage of the endogenous and exogenous of central taihu is not obvious declaration of competing interest

17031,particulate organic carbon poc sources which regulate dissolved organic carbon sediment organic carbon and inorganic carbon via deposition degradation and mineralization play an important role in lake ecosystems linear or bayesian algorithms on isotope and n alkanes have been widely used to identify the source proportion of organic carbon however the applicability of these methods is ambiguous because of the unilateral advantages of each model and trace factors to test the applicability of the various methods for identifying poc sources we analyzed dual isotopes and n alkanes in surface water samples of lake taihu and multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model were used to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous contributions carbon isotope presented a clear advantage in west taihu 21 85 0 78 and southwest taih 22 61 1 35 nitrogen isotope also showed high values in meiliang bay 9 76 0 92 the majority of the lake was dominated by short chain n alkanes except for east taihu lake dominated by medium chain n alkanes and areas with riverine input dominated by long chain n alkanes different principles between the bayesian mixing model based on the markov chain monte carlo algorithm and the multi source mixing model based on linear estimation caused discrepancies in the estimations of source contributions but the fraction of chemical compounds during the migration process and the overlap of potential sources play important role in the inconsistency of results the estimations from the different models were consistent in indicating the dominance of endogenous organic carbon in lake taihu mean of 60 18 20 26 particularly in the north and western regions west taihu meiliang bay and southwest taihu this was likely due to algal aggregation influenced by human activities and climatic factors keywords particulate organic carbon stable isotope n alkanes bayesian mixing model algal blooms 1 introduction lakes are crucial regions for organic carbon migration and transformation le quere et al 2015 tranvik et al 2009 westberry and meredith 2016 particulate organic carbon poc an important fraction of the lacustrine organic carbon pool significantly regulates the dissolved organic carbon sediment organic carbon and inorganic carbon pools via deposition degradation and mineralization behrenfeld et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 tranvik et al 2009 according to its geochemical characteristics poc can be separated into autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon which are associated with phytoplankton primary production and terrestrial organic carbon terre oc from soil erosion respectively young terre oc and autochthonous poc can be easily mineralized to co2 and ch4 by heterotrophy galy et al 2015 in contrast allochthonous aged poc is preferentially trapped in lake sediments and subsequently contributes to the long term carbon cycle battin et al 2008 guillemette et al 2017 aged poc can also be decomposed due to the effect of additional labile organic matter known as the priming effect bianchi 2011 guenet et al 2010 kuzyakov 2010 previous studies have suggested that the priming effect significantly increases the amount of organic carbon mineralization in soil and water by 400 1100 and 10 500 respectively bianchi 2011 guenet et al 2010 large amounts of terre oc and nutrients are transported to lakes via anabatic soil erosion galy et al 2015 leading to enhanced eutrophication and algal blooms paerl 2017 the increasing autochthonous oc from eutrophication and algal blooms changes the poc composition of lakes that were formerly dominated by terre oc this subsequently alters the roles and effects of lake transitions on the global carbon cycle thus changing the poc composition would significantly alter greenhouse gas emissions and organic carbon burial in lakes the flux concentration and pool of poc in rivers lakes and oceans have been widely studied due to their influence on the global carbon cycle huang et al 2017 mcclelland et al 2016 however the limited acknowledgement of poc composition composition of autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon restrains the further application of the poc flux concentration and pool in the global carbon cycle as well as the regulation effect of composition to the poc burial and mineralization gudasz et al 2012 watanabe and kuwae 2015 the composition of poc is complex but some algorithms can be used to estimate organic matter composition the linear mixing source model has been used to identify the relative contributions of potential sources by solving a number of equations dawson and pate 1996 phillips and gregg 2003 it provides a simple and favorable method for quantifying organic carbon and has been widely used in source partitioning xu et al 2019 huang et al 2017 the developed model isosource phillips and gregg 2003 provides a range of feasible solutions making up the perplexity when the number of sources exceeds the number of tracers by more than one layman et al 2012 however the linear mixing source model can provide inaccurate source contributions when considering the source uncertainty occurred in transmission parnell et al 2010 the bayesian algorithm considers the inherent variability in natural systems e g siar parnell et al 2010 mixsir moore and semmens 2008 and mixsiar stock and semmens 2016b to obtain more reliable effects of source separation thus its application for source partitioning is more reasonable these models provide important principles and methods for determining potential source contributions and have been widely applied to estimate the contribution of each endmember dawson and pate 1996 huang et al 2017 parnell et al 2013 wang et al 2019 however choosing the most appropriate method is crucial and it is difficult to treat the results of quantitative research from a more critical perspective it is therefore necessary to fully understand the features and applicability of the various models wang et al 2019 compared the applicability of the three bayesian models siar mixsir and mixsiar but a comparison between the linear model and the bayesian mixing model is still lacking stable isotopes e g carbon δ13c and nitrogen δ15n isotopes and biomolecular markers e g n alkanes and fatty acids are verified practical tools for tracing poc sources due to the differences in the molecular structure elementary composition and isotope fractionation of organic carbon alewell et al 2016 machiwa 2010 meisel et al 2011 the different δ13c and δ15n compositions of higher and lower plants induced by isotope fractionation from photosynthesis can be used to distinguish their contributions to organic carbon machiwa 2010 in general the carbon isotope values of terrestrial c3 plants 30 to 20 are more negative than those of terrestrial c4 plants 19 to 9 moreover the δ13c values of endogenous organic matter range between 19 and 22 lopes et al 2013 stuiver 1975 in order to overcome the identification uncertainty from the bacterial and thermal fractionation of δ13c and δ15n the biomolecular marker and its monomer carbon isotope alewell et al 2016 even the elements composition carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur and phosphorus measured by ft ms high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry hertkorn et al 2013 were used as the auxiliary the distribution of carbon chain in n alkanes of organic matter has been used as a source indicator of algae and fungi hydrophytes and terrestrial higher plants which are represented by short n c14 n c20 medium n c20 n c25 and long n c27 n c33 carbon chain respectively ficken et al 2000 sojinu et al 2012 both isotopes and n alkanes are proven indicators of organic carbon composition however these indicators can cause confusion and contradiction because poc sources are complex and controlled by multiple factors it is therefore necessary to use a variety of indicators to comprehensively classify poc in this study dual stable isotope and biomolecular marker techniques were adopted in the bayesian mixing model and multi source mixing model to 1 evaluate the consistency of these models and trace factors and 2 identify the driving factors and spatial temporal variation of autochthonous and allochthonous contributions to poc in the surface water of lake taihu 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling taihu lake is a large shallow freshwater inland lake with significant eutrophication and abundant algal blooms duan et al 2009 duan et al 2015 the entire lake is connected to 117 rivers most of which flow into the west and north of taihu lake and out of east taihu qin et al 2007 complex hydrodynamic conditions change the composition and distribution of nutrients in taihu lake and the water constituents show obvious spatial heterogeneity between different parts of the lake li et al 2017 based on the spatial heterogeneity of water quality taihu lake is divided into meiliang bay gonghu bay east taihu southwest taihu south taihu west taihu and central taihu fig 1 zhang et al 2017 the northwestern area is typically more polluted and have abundant algal blooms while the southeastern area is generally less polluted qin et al 2007 dong et al 2014 taihu lake is an ideal location for studying the carbon cycle of a typical eutrophic lake the organic carbon sources to the lake are spatially variable due to the spatial heterogeneity of water quality which provides unique conditions for distinguishing of organic carbon sources fifty nine surface water samples from taihu lake were collected during august 1 3 2019 and the sample locations were accurately recorded using a global positioning system gps the water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles washed with hydrochloric acid and filtered immediately through 0 7 µm whatman gf f filters pre combusted at 450 c for 6 h and weighed all filters and water samples were rapidly transferred to the laboratory in ice without light and stored at 2 c in a freezer until further treatment in the laboratory the water samples were analyzed for poc concentrations the natural abundance of δ13c and δ15n n alkane concentrations n c12 n c35 water constituents total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total suspended matter tsm and chlorophyll a chl a water quality tn tp chl a and tsm was measured according to the method described in our previous study huang et al 2017 and the results are shown in table 1 2 2 measurement of n alkanes δ13c and δ15n before laboratory analysis the filters were dried in an oven at 55 c and then weighed the filters were then acidified with hydrochloric acid for 12 h and then weighed after drying in an oven at 55 c poc δ13c and δ15n values were then determined using a thermo mat253 plus li et al 2018 wang et al 2013 carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were expressed in delta notation δ13c δ15n relative to vienna pdb and atmospheric nitrogen respectively and the standard deviations based on replicate measurements for δ13c and δ15n were both approximately 0 05 the n alkanes were extracted using a dichloromethane methanol solution 93 7 v v via microwave extraction and quantified by shimadzu qp2010 plus gc ms liu and liu 2016 the n alkanes were extracted from the filter by microwave extraction 100 c 10 min using a dichloromethane methanol solution 93 7 v v each extract was concentrated to 1 ml by three centrifugations at 30 c with n hexane the concentrated extract was purified by chromatography using 45 ml n hexane and then the eluent with n alkanes was concentrated to 1 ml a shimadzu qp2010 plus gc ms with an agilent hp 5 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 µm was used to quantify the n alkanes the temperature gradually increased from 50 c to 280 c at a rate of 10 c min the injection volume was 1 µl and the flow rate was 1 5 ml min 3 model application and validation 3 1 multi source mixing and bayesian mixing models in this study the multi source mixing model dawson and pate 1996 huang et al 2017 and bayesian mixing model stock et al 2018 stock and semmens 2016b were applied to evaluate the relative contributions of endogenous and exogenous poc in the surface water of taihu lake dual stable isotopes n alkanes and their combinations were selected as indicators to estimate model bias and applicability 3 1 1 multi source mixing model multi source mixing model was established using the mass balance equation and expressed as follows 1 c i 1 n c i p i 2 0 p i 1 a n d i 1 n p i 1 where p i is the relative contribution of the ith potential source to the poc in taihu lake and c i is the endmember value for the ith potential source where c is the measured value the model solution will be problematic if the number of sources exceeds the number of tracers by more than one therefore the optimal target equation was used to simulate the potential source contribution huang et al 2017 smith et al 2018 and is expressed as follows 3 m i n c i 1 n c i p i c 2 3 1 2 bayesian mixing model the bayesian mixing model implemented using an r package mixsiar version 3 1 11 consolidates the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform and diversifies the set of available parameterizations stock et al 2018 this model is a logical prior distribution based on a dirichlet distribution and a bayesian framework evans et al 2000 the uncertainty of the endmember is introduced into the calculation and the fractionation factor of the isotope is considered based on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm the output of the bayesian model is a probability distribution that is not a specific value and is expressed as the mean standard deviation sd the error structure was set as process error and specify prior was set as uninformative respectively more details regarding the parameters of this model can be found in stock et al 2018 3 2 endmember selection differences in the nitrogen and carbon isotopes of terrestrial plants and algae typically reflect the differences in photosynthesis and assimilation machiwa 2010 compared with other biological compounds n alkanes are more suitable for determining organic matter sources due to their source specificity and strong resistance to bacterial degradation xing et al 2011 in this study δ13c double isotopes δ13c and δ15n and n alkanes were selected as tracers and the double isotopes combined with the terrestrial plant to algae ratio tar were used as another tracer to eliminate misleading effects on the simulation the tar values were normalized as follows 4 t a r t a r t a r 1 5 t a r c 15 c 17 c 19 c 25 c 27 c 29 for this estimate the ranges of potential sources were statistically estimated using sample data from the previous literature table 2 in addition 20 87 was selected as the endogenous endmember of δ13c which is consistent with the δ13c value of microcystis in taihu lake liu et al 2011 moreover 28 27 was considered the average value of the terrestrial endmember which corresponds to the δ13c value of organic matter in inflowing rivers fig 2 similarly 1 70 and 11 26 were considered the values of exogenous and endogenous endmembers of δ15n respectively the n alkanes at sampling points 63 and 78 fig 1 had distinct exogenous characteristics and were treated as the exogenous endmembers while sampling points 14 49 59 and 80 fig 1 had distinct endogenous characteristics and were treated as the endogenous endmembers the characteristics of n alkanes endmembers are shown in fig 3 3 3 model verification and validation 3 3 1 model verification in this study isotopes and n alkanes were used as the parameters in multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model to estimate the potential source contributions of poc in the surface water of taihu the modeled contribution of endogenous poc is shown in fig 4 and the sd of the bayesian simulation is shown in fig 5 based on the differences in model principles and the variety of tracer selections the results of some points showed notable inconsistencies a slightly higher contribution most were 50 of endogenous organic carbon modeled by n alkanes was determined by the bayesian mixing model fig 4 and the lowest sd was also observed in this model fig 5 we observed some extreme results in the multi source mixing model especially in simulations with n alkanes and combining tar with dual isotopes showing 100 or 0 contribution from endogenous poc fig 4 in this study the results with significant deviations were eliminated to modify the estimated contribution and the mean value of the remaining simulation results was used to represent the contribution of endogenous and exogenous poc in the surface water of taihu lake the results from the multi source mixing model with carbon isotope and double isotopes and the bayesian mixing model with carbon isotopes double isotopes and tar combined with double isotopes were selected to estimate the percentage of endogenous and exogenous poc in the taihu surface water the total results and modified results are shown in fig 6 a and the uncertainty of the modified results was significantly reduced the model stability for the modified results significantly improved with a notably lower relative standard deviation rsd 14 33 11 27 than that of the total results 32 01 25 86 fig 6b 3 3 2 representative evaluation of endmembers the complexity of poc sources increases the possibility of heterogeneous inputs which affects the accuracy of the simulation results overlapping signatures of isotopic and carbon number distributions of n alkanes in different species may lead to false distinctions between potential sources the overlap of isotopic values between phytoplankton and terrestrial c3 plants using co2 as a carbon source xu et al 2017 and the confusion between urban sewage agricultural non point source pollution and endogenous organic matter yu et al 2018 both increase the inaccuracy of source allocation isotopes and the combination of double isotopes and tar values were selected as tracers based on the mass balance principle the multi source mixing model considers that the sum of the contributions of each endmember is 100 constraint condition in eq 2 assuming that the endmembers can cover the source of the sample the unconstrained mode of the multi source mixing model constraint condition in eq 2 was removed was adopted to verify the representability of the endmembers no interference from heterogeneous sources can be simply verified when the sum of contributions from potential sources is close to 100 in the unconstrained mode the reasonability of the endmember selection of isotopes and tar values is verified in the unconstrained multi source mixing model which indicates that the sum of endogenous and exogenous contributions is close to 100 fig 7 this proves that it is almost free from the interference of heterogeneous inputs 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of poc stable isotopes and n alkanes the poc concentrations in the surface water corresponding to each sampling point by idw interpolation are shown in fig 8 a in general we observed obvious spatial heterogeneity in surface water poc concentrations with values ranging from 0 47 mg l to 19 72 mg l average of 2 75 2 70 mg l and the most frequently observed values were between 0 47 and 8 60 mg l the highest poc concentrations were observed in southwest taihu mean value of 4 97 5 03 mg l followed by meilang bay west taihu and gonghu bay with average values of 3 22 1 22 2 80 1 27 and 2 57 1 26 mg l respectively the lowest poc values were observed in central taihu average of 1 82 1 31 mg l and east taihu average of 1 05 0 30 mg l due to the absence of river inflow to these regions qin et al 2007 fig 1 notably spatial heterogeneity was most pronounced in southwest taihu minimum of 1 86 mg l maximum of 19 72 mg l which was likely due to the widespread distribution of algae in the surface water xu et al 2019 the surface water δ13c values varied from 27 21 to 19 25 and the mean value was 23 70 1 85 the δ13c values were higher in west taihu 21 85 0 78 southwest taihu 22 61 1 35 and meiliang bay 22 68 1 36 due to the high occurrence of algal blooms embodied as high δ13c values xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2009 fig 8b the lower δ13c values 27 12 0 09 in the eastern region of taihu lake indicate the dominance of terre oc embodied as low δ13c values xu et al 2019 zeng et al 2008 similarly the surface water δ15n values ranged from 1 61 to 11 42 with an average value of 7 07 1 96 this suggests that the organics in taihu lake had mixed terrigenous and algal sources emerson and hedges 1988 which is consistent with the δ13c data results meiliang bay 9 76 0 92 and gonghu bay 8 27 1 00 showed higher δ15n fig 8c due to the influence of algal blooms embodied as high δ15n values emerson and hedges 1988 herczeg et al 2001 the large amount of domestic and industrial wastewater flowing into meiliang bay results in relatively high δ15n values costanzo et al 2005 in contrast the average δ15n value 5 65 1 27 in east taihu was lower than that in other regions due to the predominance of terrestrial organic matter luo et al 2014 the total concentrations of n alkanes n c12 n c35 ranged from 3 87 to 507 15 ng l with a mean value of 63 18 92 12 ng l the relative abundance of short chain n c12 n c20 middle chain n c21 n c25 and long chain n alkanes n c26 n c35 to the total n alkanes are shown in fig 9 we observed notable spatial heterogeneity of the different sources based on the n alkanes composition the concentrations of middle chain n alkanes mean of 56 37 3 65 was higher in east taihu than in other regions blue dashed line in fig 9 indicating the dominance of aquatic plants qin et al 2007 except for east taihu short chain n alkanes were the dominant composition throughout the entire lake region red dashed line in fig 9 in contrast the average concentrations of long chain n alkanes were 30 in most regions except for east taihu table 3 due to the high contribution of algae and photosynthetic bacteria to organic matter short chain n alkanes were the most abundant in west taihu average of 63 81 11 05 table 3 indicating the highest algal aggregation in this region zhang et al 2017 however phytoplankton aggregation is influenced by multiple factors including nutrient stimulation hydrodynamic driving and vegetation structure causing high spatial heterogeneity of organic carbon sources within a region for example the inflowing rivers transport large amounts of terrestrial organic matter to meiliang bay and southwest taihu qin et al 2007 increasing the abundance of long chain n alkanes at sampling sites 78 and 63 black dashed line in fig 9 values of 77 65 and 61 45 respectively gonghu bay had notably higher proportions of short chain n alkanes mean of 48 23 25 31 and sample point 65 had a predominance of middle chain n alkanes blue dashed line in fig 9 value of 48 23 which is consistent with the growth of aquatic macrophytes near the estuary of gonghu bay li et al 2018 central taihu is an open water region that is strongly disturbed by wind li et al 2017 resulting in a mixed distribution of organic carbon of different origins moreover the indexes of n alkane congeners such as tar n c15 n c17 n c19 n c25 n c27 n c29 and l h n c15 n c20 n c21 n c34 can also indicate the same characteristics fang et al 2014 meyers 2003 and the values are shown in table 3 the lowest tar value was observed in east taihu lake average of 0 03 0 01 indicating the lowest organic carbon contribution from higher plants the highest l h value occurred in west taihu 1 65 0 89 which is consistent with the tar value derrien et al 2017 4 2 apportionment of endogenous and exogenous poc the average contribution rate of endogenous poc to the entire lake was 60 18 20 26 which was higher than that of exogenous poc mean of 39 82 20 26 moreover the endogenous poc contribution rate was higher in the north than in the south and higher in the west than in the east fig 10 this is consistent with the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes duan et al 2015 duan et al 2009 specifically west taihu had the highest endogenous poc contribution mean of 77 41 7 41 followed by meiliang bay mean of 75 46 13 59 and southwest taihu mean of 69 17 10 88 likely due to the influence of the southeast summer monsoon and the distribution of rivers li et al 2017 cai et al 2012 duan et al 2009 xu et al 2019 in contrast east taihu had the highest contribution of exogenous poc with an average of 78 20 3 60 compared with other regions both endogenous and exogenous poc contributions were moderate in gonghu bay central taihu and south taihu indicating a mixture of endogenous and exogenous poc 4 3 driving factors of autochthonous and allochthonous contributions as a large and shallow lake endogenous organic carbon mean of 60 18 20 26 plays a dominant role in organic carbon pool of taihu lake which is consistent with intensified human activities and climate warming in recent years and the frequent occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic lakes duan et al 2015 duan et al 2009 phytoplankton is an important source of endogenous poc in lake taihu and chl a is considered a suitable indicator of phytoplankton stocks xu et al 2019 the coupled poc and chl a data were used to represent the relationship between phytoplankton organic carbon concentrations cphyto and chl a and the equation can be expressed as cphyto 0 1421 chl a 0 6589 r 2 0 95 n 324 huang et al 2019 in this study we observed a significant positive correlation between endogenous poc and cphyto fig 11 and the estimations of endogenous organic carbon were reliable for the entire lake the western and northern regions had higher endogenous poc contributions compared to the eastern and southern regions as a typical large and shallow eutrophic lake taihu shows spatial differences in native aquatic plants algal blooms inflow outflow rivers lake topography and hydraulic conditions which results in the spatial heterogeneity of potential poc sources nutrient and climate factors are the key parameters affecting endogenous organic carbon in northwest taihu lake as a result massive algal outbreaks occur in summer in response to nutrient supply and climate qin et al 2010 the high correlation between endogenous organic carbon algae driven organic carbon and tn and tp infers the strong influence of nutrients on the dominance of endogenous organic carbon fig 12 the notably higher supply of endogenous organic carbon in meiliang bay west taihu and southwest taihu is closely linked to the high riverine nutrient supply to the lake in this study tn concentrations in west taihu southwest taihu and meiliang bay were 5 76 2 81 5 19 1 35 and 5 26 1 08 mg l respectively and tp concentrations were 0 64 0 27 0 45 0 19 and 0 39 0 14 mg l respectively table 1 rapid urban development in the west and north of the taihu basin wuxi changzhou and yixing increased the riverine input of fertilizers industrial wastewaters and urban domestic sewage to the lake duan et al 2009 resulting in high nutrient accumulation tn and tp in the northwestern region the two northern bays meiliang bay and zhushan bay became the most polluted areas in the lake cai et al 2012 xu et al 2019 which promoted the growth of algae blooms in addition the southeast monsoon influences the taihu lake area in summer cai et al 2012 li et al 2017 resulting in the balloon structure of microcysts abeynayaka et al 2017 this causes algae to migrate to the northwestern region of the lake via the wind enhancing the contribution of endogenous organic carbon according to our estimations the lowest contribution of endogenous poc occurred in east taihu due to insufficient nutrient supply and the growth of aquatic plants east taihu has no river inflow but water flows out through the dapu and xijiang rivers leading to a shortage of nutrients east taihu showed low levels of both tn and tp means of 3 22 0 59 and 0 12 0 08 respectively which restricted algal growth in addition lower tp and suitable water depths provide beneficial growth conditions for aquatic plants the coverage of large underwater and above water plants in west taihu is 73 6 and 18 3 respectively and the dominance of aquatic plants limits the light levels required for algal growth gu et al 2005 phytoplankton growth is limited by insufficient light and low nutrient content table 1 which decreases the contribution of endogenous poc su et al 2016 in addition for central taihu gonghu bay there was a slight endogenic organic carbon advantage as a result of complex hydrodynamic conditions central taihu is a large open water area with shallow water depths wind disturbance causes the distribution of endogenous and exogenous fractions to have no clear dominance sediments are strongly disturbed in the vertical direction under wind speeds greater than 3 7 4 0 m s zheng et al 2015 and organic matter deposited in sediments are resuspended affecting the distribution of organic matter from potential sources 4 4 evaluation and comparison of model results in this study we used different tracers as parameters for multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model and identified the unique characteristics of different simulation methods the bayesian approach employs a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling algorithm which more effectively considers all parameters to produce a more realistic posterior distribution of proportional source contributions cooper and krueger 2017 moreover to obtain a more reliable probability distribution and improve the reliability and stability of the analysis results the uncertainty of the endmember is introduced into the calculation stock and semmens 2016a however too many tracer parameters can be problematic the simulation using n alkanes as tracers showed lower sensitivity based on the low standard deviation fig 5 and significant bias results fig 4 this was due to the fact that the source information provided by n c12 n c35 contained a large amount of overlap and interference information leading to a slightly higher contribution of endogenous organic carbon most of which were distributed above 50 fig 4 notably the uncertainty gives weight to the simulation results due to the complexity of nitrogen migration and transformation the potential source value of nitrogen isotopes is often unclear and the uncertainty is much greater than that of carbon isotopes which may lead to more favorable simulation results for carbon isotopes sensitivity analysis results in supporting information show that the smaller uncertainty of nitrogen isotopes improved the correlation between the simulation results and the nitrogen isotopes compared with the bayesian mixing model based on the mcmc algorithm multi source mixing model uses a linear method to allocate the source of organic matter cooper et al 2014 smith et al 2018 due to the lack of uncertainty the selection of endmember values is particularly important for the multi source mixing model unrepresentative endmember values lead to deviations in the simulation results the abundant carbon number of n alkanes provides a variety of information but the complex parameter information also restricts the use of n alkanes in regions with complex organic carbon sources the peak distribution of n alkanes is diversified and the selection of endmembers is particularly important overlapping signatures of the carbon number distribution of n alkanes in different species may lead to false distinctions between potential sources some algae such as diatoms can produce n alkanes dominated by long chains sinninghe damsté et al 1999 in addition n alkanes contaminated by oil and strong bacterial activity with even predominance of carbon short chains can also affect the estimation of allochthonous and autochthonous origin fang et al 2014 han and calvin 1969 the overlap of n alkanes distributions from different types of organisms makes it difficult to distinguish the specific biological sources from mixture n alkanes the n alkanes indicating aquatic plants also have a relatively higher contribution to the higher carbon numbers which leads to an overestimation of terre oc this adds to the difficulty in determining the endmember values due to the differences between isotopes and n alkanes such as oxidation reduction and saturation bianchi and canuel 2011 divarication occurs when different traces are used to indicate autochthonous and allochthonous sources the uniqueness of isotopes and biomarkers was revealed in the multi source mixing model therefore more attention should be placed on the deviation and bias between different tracers when using the multi source mixing model the indication deviation is caused by isotope fractionation during organic matter transfer li et al 2002 yun and ro 2008 organic matter is degraded during the transfer process but n alkanes which are difficult to degrade are preserved and cannot represent the characteristics of the original bulk organic matter derrien et al 2017 xu et al 2017 therefore consistency of the reference indication of isotopes and n alkanes during biogeochemical processes is a precondition for index combinations the uncertainty of isotope endmember values is also a cause of the deviation in the region with higher δ15n value the misleading indication for sewage should be considered the nitrogen isotope composition can infer the difference between aquatic no3 as a nitrogen source and terrestrial plants n2 as a nitrogen source teranes and bernasconi 2000 urban sewage and agricultural non point source pollution δ15n value of 8 5 significantly increases the content of δ15n yu et al 2018 leading to the overestimation of algal organic matter for example the region in taihu lake connected to inflowing rivers which is significantly polluted by fertilizer and sewage from wuxi changzhou and other cities duan et al 2009 the unique of nitrogen isotope values was exposed in multi source mixing model 5 conclusion in this study we coupled stable isotopes with n alkanes using the multi source mixing model and bayesian mixing model to estimate autochthonous and allochthonous poc contributions in the surface water of taihu lake the results are summarized as follows 1 the bayesian approach employs an mcmc sampling algorithm which produces more stable source contributions however a tracer containing a variety of information such as n c12 n c35 should be used with care to prevent the confusion caused by excessive parameter inputs moreover caution should be taken when using the multi source mixing model to determine endmember values in areas involving complex organic matter sources as the model uses a linear method to allocate organic matter sources the model revealed the bias of the tracers caused by fractionation and degradation during transportation moreover consistency of the indication significance of isotopes and n alkanes during transfer is a precondition for index combination 2 endogenous poc has a higher contribution rate than exogenous poc during algal blooms in the large and shallow taihu lake moreover endogenous oc is more abundant in the northwestern lake region nutrient accumulation in the northwestern lake area and the influence of the southeast monsoon are the causes for the higher contribution rates of endogenous poc in meiliang bay west taihu lake and southwest taihu lake the growth of aquatic plants and the lack of nutrients resulted in the lowest contribution rate from endogenous poc in east taihu the open water area is disturbed by the wind and the advantage of the endogenous and exogenous of central taihu is not obvious declaration of competing interest

17032,a bacterium capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox has been widely found in various environments whereas its industrial application is limited due to the difficulty of cultivation and or enrichment we developed a biological system to produce a high quality nitrate solution for use in hydroponic fertilizer the system was composed of two separate reactors for ammonification and nitrification and was found to have a stable and efficient performance in the conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrate to determine the key microbes involved and better understand the system the microbial communities in the reactors were analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing in combination with a shotgun metagenomic analysis canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria which can only catalyze the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite were detected with negligible relative abundances while a comammox nitrospira related operational taxonomic unit otu dominated the nitrification reactor furthermore the comammox type ammonia monooxygenase was found to be 500 times more highly expressed than the canonical one by quantitative pcr indicating that comammox was the main driver of the stable and efficient ammonia oxidation in the system a microbial co occurrence analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between nitrospira and several otus some of which such as anaerolinea otu have been found to co exist with comammox nitrospira in the biofilms of water treatment systems given that these otus were abundant only on microbe attached carriers in the system their co existence within the biofilm could be beneficial to stabilize the nitrospira abundance possibly by physically preventing oxygen exposure as well as cell spillage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater comammox nitrification ammonification nitrogen cycling hydroponic 1 introduction nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms therefore the nitrogen cycle in which bacteria play a vital role in the conversion of nitrogen compounds is of critical importance for all ecosystems gruber and galloway 2008 kuypers et al 2018 takai 2019 nitrogen acquisition is a rate limiting process for plant growth vance 2001 it has been demonstrated that plant body size is positively correlated with nitrogen incorporation vance 2001 reich et al 2006 nitrogen fertilization is therefore an indispensable process in agriculture socolow 1999 in conventional agriculture organic nitrogen compounds that are applied to soils as fertilizer are degraded into ammonia and subsequently oxidized to nitrate via nitrite by microbes in which the former biological conversion is called ammonification while the latter is called nitrification kuypers et al 2018 although ammonification can be catalyzed by various heterotrophic bacteria nitrification is performed only by a few microbial species called nitrifiers i e ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob takai 2019 in addition to these canonical nitrifiers a single bacterium that can catalyze complete ammonia oxidation comammox has been discovered recently daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 because many plants incorporate nitrogen in the form of nitrate their growth is largely dependent on the capability of these nitrogen converting microbes kuypers et al 2018 in the case of hydroponic cultivation the use of organic nitrogen fertilizer has been shown to inhibit plant growth because of the absence of microbial nitrogen mineralization in the system a nitrogen source therefore needs to be supplied directly in the form of nitrate garland et al 1997 hydroponics is a pragmatic cultivation approach in which the precise control of fertilization is possible therefore the development of a fertilizer that is compatible with hydroponic systems is required shinohara et al 2011 although most fertilizers are chemically manufactured hydroponic fertilizer can in principle be biologically synthesized from organic substances such as proteinous waste from the fish processing industry with a contribution from nitrogen converting microbes the whole process must include at least two distinct biological reactions one is the conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonia while the other is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate consequently multiple functional guilds of microbes need to be involved in natural environments these processes are simultaneously catalyzed by complex microbial communities however there are major difficulties in controlling the microbial communities in engineered system for example although microbial composition is closely linked to community function the abundance of the constituent microbes fluctuates depending on environmental changes sato et al 2019 to avoid dealing with the two biological reactions in one microbiome we developed two separate microbiomes in two independent reactors for synthesizing the high quality nitrate solution as a hydroponic fertilizer one of the reactors was dedicated to ammonification and the other to nitrification fig 1 a the two reactor system contained porous cylindrical carriers to stabilize the microbial community structure and maintain the efficiency of nitrate production by allowing nitrogen converting microbes to colonize the carrier the efficient and stable performance of the system during long term use motivated us to examine which microbes contributed to the system performance and the interaction between them to this end a high throughput sequencing analysis was applied to investigate the microbial community structure during 24 h short interval assessment of one reaction cycle and 70 d long interval assessment of reaction stability operations of the system the key microbes in the system were determined by shotgun metagenomic analysis and the relationship among co existing microbes was inferred using a co occurrence network analysis consequently the participation of key microbes by which the system efficiency was maintained was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration and operating conditions of the hydroponic fertilizer producing system a schematic configuration of the hydroponic fertilizer producing system is shown in fig 1a the system consisted of two reactors a 300 l and b 500 l in volume in which ammonification i e the degradation of organic nitrogen compounds to ammonia and nitrification i e the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite were performed respectively effective volumes of reactor a and b were 200 l and 100 l respectively the seed microbiome for both reactors a and b was obtained by immersing bark compost packed in a cloth bag in the liquid phase of the reactors and was maintained for more than 2 years in the system proteinous wastewater total nitrogen tn concentration approximately 340 mg l 1 was added daily to reactor a at a rate of 200 l day 1 after a 24 h incubation part of the treated wastewater was moved to reactor b at a rate of 100 l day 1 from which the same amount of the nitrate solution that was produced was harvested before the addition of the input from reactor a the two reactors were aerated by an air diffuser located at the bottom of the system and operated at 25 c porous cylindrical carriers φ 5 mm 5 mm length mmpolypropylene taiyousuiken inc saitama japan were added to the two reactors at a rate of 18 by volume the liquid phase of the two reactors was continuously stirred and ph was neutralized during the operation physicochemical parameters such as temperature and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do tn total organic carbon toc and nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the system were monitored as described previously sato et al 2016a 2 2 sampling procedures two series of sample collections were performed one was a 4 h sampling interval that occurred throughout the 24 h operation which was intended to clarify the short term dynamics of the microbial community structures during one reaction cycle and identify the key microbes in the two reactors the other was a 14 d sampling interval that occurred throughout the 70 d operation which examined the long term stability of the nitrogen converting microbiome the 4 h interval experiment was done at days 6 7 of the 70 d operation in the 70 d operation experiment the samples were collected at the end of each 1 d reaction cycle before starting a new reaction cycle in each sampling the liquid phase of the reactor and microbe attached carriers were harvested liquid samples were taken from reactors a 1 ml and b 2 ml respectively these samples were centrifuged and the resulting microbial pellets were used for dna extraction for the carriers one or two carriers if sufficient dna was not extracted from one carrier were used for dna extraction for the samples from both reactors a and b in addition to the two series of the experiments described above i e 24 h and 70 d operation the reactor was operated continuously over a year and on day 486 the carrier of reactor b was collected to analyze the microbial community 2 3 the 16s rrna gene analysis the microbial cell pellets and carriers collected from the nitrate solution producing system were used for the microbial analyses genomic dna was extracted using a direct lysis protocol that includes chemical lysis and bead beating of the cell pellets or the cells attached on the carriers aoyagi et al 2015 noll et al 2005 the extracted dna was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation the contaminated rna was digested with rnase type ii a sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the purified dna was quantified using nanodrop lite thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and used as the template for pcr amplification the 515f and 806r universal primer sets were used to amplify the v4 region of 16s rrna gene using a high fidelity dna polymerase q5 neb ipswich ma usa both primers were modified to contain an illumina adapter region and the reverse primer contained a 12 bp barcode for multiplex sequencing caporaso et al 2012 the dna libraries for the miseq system illumina san diego ca usa were prepared as described previously sato et al 2016b and the paired end sequencing was conducted using the 500 cycle miseq reagent kit v2 the resulting sequence data were deposited in the dna data bank of japan ddbj accession number for raw data dra011087 using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences the microbial community structure was analyzed using the qiime software and greengenes database caporaso et al 2010 as described previously sato et al 2020 the analytical process included phix sequence removal sequence quality filtering phred value score q 30 chimera sequence removal and a phylogenetic analysis as well as a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the calculated weighted unifrac distances lozupone et al 2011 the predominant otus 97 sequence similarity were further determined based on a blast search of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi all samples were sequenced in triplicate excluding the 20 h carrier sample in reactor a of the 24 h operation experiment which was analyzed in duplicate 2 4 shotgun metagenome sequencing to further clarify the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system the 70 d carrier sample in reactor b of the 70 d operation experiment was used for a shotgun metagenomic analysis first dna was extracted from the carrier and then purified as described above a metagenome library for the illumina sequencer was prepared using the kapa hyperplus library preparation kit roche sequencing solutions pleasanton ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the prepared dna was measured using the quant it picogreen dsdna reagent and kit and paired end sequencing was conducted using the miseq system with the 600 cycle miseq reagent kit v3 because the aim of this metagenomic analysis was to confirm the presence of comammox nitrospira i e detection of its 16s rrna genes and the genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase a representative marker gene for ammonia oxidizers we did not use a production scale sequencing platform such as hiseq illumina the resulting sequence data were deposited in the ddbj accession number for raw data dra011088 low quality sequences were trimmed from the metagenomic data using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 with the criteria of a q value 30 and read length 50 b the paired end sequences were de novo assembled using megahit with the default settings li et al 2015 and then binned using metabat with the default settings kang et al 2019 with a bam file generated by aligning paired end sequences on the assemblies using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 to confirm the accuracy of the obtained bins the megahit assemblies were also binned using maxbin2 wu et al 2015 from each bin rrna sequences were detected by ribopicker schmieder et al 2012 using the silva rrna database as a reference quast et al 2013 the open reading frame orf was searched from some contig sequences using the ncbi orffinder https www ncbi nlm nih gov orffinder phylogenetic analyses were performed using mega7 kumar et al 2016 based on the 16s rrna gene and amoa sequences of nitrospira that are available in the ncbi nucleotide database https www ncbi nlm nih gov nucleotide contig coverage was calculated using an in house script based on bam sorted files from a bowtie2 analysis sato et al 2019 2 5 quantitative pcr to examine the existence and the expression level of canonical amoa as well as comammox amoa genes quantitative pcr qpcr was performed the reactor b carriers with microbial cells attached were cryogenically ground and the total rna was extracted from the ground carriers using trizol plus rna purification kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma u s a the genomic dna removal and the complementary dna cdna synthesis were performed using superscript iv vilo master mix with ezdnase enzyme thermo fisher scientific expression levels of the two amoa genes were deteremined by qpcr using the synthesized cdna as a template with the primer set designed for detecting the comammox amoa or the canonical amoa gene table s1 the primers were developed in this study for comammox amoa a gene sequence obtained from shotgun metagenome analysis and three sequences obtained from the comammox amoa clone library primers shown in table s2 were analyzed using primer3plus untergasser et al 2012 to design the primers for qpcr for canonical amoa three gene sequences obtained from ncbi nucleotide database i e nitrosospira multiformis atcc 25196 nc 007614 1 nitrosomonas sp is79a3 nc 015731 1 and nitrosomonas ureae strain nm10 cp013341 1 and four sequences obtained from the canonical amoa clone library primers shown in table s2 shimomura et at 2012 were aligned by clustal w larkin et al 2007 and the primers for the conserved region were designed for qpcr the qpcr efficiency values were 102 1 for comammox amoa and 91 5 for canonical amoa the sequence coverage of the primers were 5 1 for comammox amoa and 54 0 for canonical amoa powerup sybr green master mix thermo fisher scientific and kod sybr qpcr mix toyobo osaka japan were used for qpcr analyses of comammox amoa and canonical amoa respectively the conditions used for the qpcr analyses are summarized in table s1 for exact quantification of the gene copy number standard curves for comammox amoa and canonical amoa were prepared using the plasmid conjugated with the respective amoa gene fragment amplified from the extracted dna from the reactor b carrier the analysis was performed with triplicate samples 2 6 microbial co occurrence network analysis for the microbial network analysis spearman s rank correlations were calculated among the otus detected from the reactor b carriers of the 70 d operation experiment that had a 1 total relative abundance across the 18 samples 0 14 28 42 56 and 70 d in triplicate this filtering step based on the abundance reduced the network complexity allowing a focus on the core community barberán et al 2012 because most of the otus were specifically present in either reactor a or b as well as in either the liquid phase or carrier the use of all abundance data i e in liquid carrier and reactors a b generated pseudo positive correlations hence to focus on the microbial correlation network in the reactor b carriers the other abundance data were eliminated from the calculation in this study a spearman s correlation coefficient ρ of 0 7 and p value of 0 001 were used as criteria to establish a valid co occurrence network among the otus the network analysis was performed in the r environment http www r project org with the hmisc package http cran r project org web packages hmisc and the network was visualized by cytoscape shannon et al 2003 the correlation among the otus detected in the 24 h operation experiment was inferred by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient r based on the relative abundances of otus with sequence reads 5 3 results 3 1 system performance in the reactors of the nitrate solution producing system microbes were observed to successfully colonize the inside of the cylindrical carriers fig 1b the profiles of the toc inorganic carbon ic and tn concentrations during the 24 h operation experiment are shown in fig 1c the toc concentration in reactor a was initially high 1 144 mg l 1 but decreased to approximately 10 of the initial concentration 129 mg l 1 within the first 12 h while at the same time the ic concentration increased from 12 to 203 mg l 1 the tn concentration in reactor a was initially 339 mg l 1 and it decreased slightly to 315 mg l 1 over 24 h these data indicate that the organic nitrogen was effectively converted to ammonia with the majority of the ammonia not being converted to nitrate and subsequently being removed by denitrification if there was an excess incubation period in reactor a the ammonia that was generated could be oxidized to nitrate and removed by denitrifiers reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas via respiration the toc and ic concentrations in reactor b were maintained at low levels 43 61 and 1 7 40 mg l 1 respectively throughout the operation while tn was maintained at a high level 285 292 mg l 1 this also indicated that the nitrate generated in reactor b was not removed by denitrification which occurred when the liquid phase moved from reactor a contained a high concentration of organic matter the ammonium concentration increased from 1 9 to 264 mg n l 1 over 24 h in reactor a which corresponded to 83 7 of the tn at the end of the operation fig 1d suggesting that ammonification progressed efficiently in reactor a in reactor b the nitrate concentration increased from 0 to 252 mg n l 1 over 24 h with this increase the ammonium concentration decreased from 264 to 11 mg n l 1 in reactor b indicating that 95 7 of the inlet ammonium was converted to nitrate the reaction conditions such as temperature substrate concentration and reaction period seemed to be finely tuned in this system the nitrite concentration in reactor b was maintained below the detection limit 0 08 mg n l 1 whereas the ammonium and nitrate concentrations displayed dynamic transitions i e ammonium was immediately converted to nitrate via nitrite because canonical nitrification is catalyzed by the cooperation of two guilds of microbes i e aob aoa and nob nitrite generated by aob aoa via the oxidation of ammonia tended to accumulate in the reaction system as an intermediate product due to the delayed activation of nob which convert nitrite to nitrate therefore the absence of nitrite accumulation implicitly denied the occurrence of canonical nitrification in the system as to the 70 d operation the nitrate concentration in the effluent of the reactor b was monitored and ranged from 192 to 248 mg n l 1 during the operation 3 2 microbial community structure during the 24 h operation period the microbial community structure of the system was analyzed over 24 h at 4 h intervals the pcoa scatter plot of the resulting 16s rrna gene sequence data is shown in fig 2 a the analysis demonstrated that the community structure in the liquid phase changed in both reactors a and b during the operating period the initial position of the plot for the liquid phase of reactor b was similar to that of reactor a but it shifted to a position near the plot of the carrier in reactor b indicating that the microbial community originating from reactor a acclimatized to the situation e g low organic matter concentration in reactor b over 24 h fig 1c in contrast to the liquid phase the plots for the carriers of both reactors a and b showed only minor shifts indicating the high stability of the carrier microbial community structures during the operation the 16s rrna gene sequence data were phylogenetically analyzed at the class fig 2b and genus fig 2c levels as shown in these figures the community structures in the liquid phase drastically changed within 24 h the bacterial class that commonly dominated both reactors was gammaproteobacteria but the constituent genera within this class were distinctly different between the two reactors the predominance of the classes betaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia was a characteristic of reactor a these two classes as well as gammaproteobacteria contain various heterotrophic bacteria that are capable of rapidly degrading organic matter gao et al 2009 vuono et al 2015 the top five genera with the highest abundances in the microbiome of the reactor a carrier were a comamonadaceae genus shown in blue in fig 2c a chitinophagaceae genus light purple chryseobacterium dark blue a pseudomonadaceae genus light yellow and rheinheimera orange which possibly contributed to the ammonification in reactor a the involvement of multiple microbes in ammonification is a reasonable assumption because this process can be catalyzed by most of the heterotrophs whereas one genus belonging to comamonadaceae was predominant in both the liquid phase and carrier in reactor a implying that it made a major contribution in reactor b the top five genera in the carrier were two xanthomonadaceae genera pink and light pink a chitinophagaceae genus light purple an ellin329 a candidate of the alphaproteobacterial order genus light blue and nitrospira red which is capable of nitrite oxidation canonical nitrification is a process catalyzed by aob aoa and nob however no aob aoa related genus was dominant in the reactor b carrier to investigate the populations of these nitrifying microbes in detail the sequence data were further analyzed at the otu level fig 2d the otu results also emphasized the predominance of nitrospira but not aob aoa in the reactor b carrier 3 3 microbial community structure during the 70 d operation period the microbial community structures in the system were analyzed over 70 d at 14 d intervals a pcoa scatter plot of the resulting sequence data fig 3 a showed that in both reactors a and b the community structure in the liquid phase shifted substantially along the experiment while the community in the carriers did not this trend was similar to that observed for the 24 h operation fig 2a this indicates that the microbial community structures of the carriers were stable even during the 70 d operation the phylogenetic analysis fig 3b class level fig c genus level also demonstrated that the microbial community structures of the carrier in both reactors a and b were stable during the 70 d operation the highest relative population was flavobacteriia in the 70 d operation especially in the liquid phase while betaproteobacteria was the highest in the 24 h operation because both the flavobacteriia and betaproteobacteria contain various bacteria capable of ammonification this difference in the dominant microorganisms did not seem to alter the performance of reactor a the five genera with the highest abundances in the reactor a carrier were a comamonadaceae genus shown in blue in fig 3c chryseobacterium light gray a pseudomonadaceae genus light yellow a chitinophagaceae genus light purple and aquimonas dark yellow the five genera with the highest abundances in the reactor b carrier were two xanthomonadaceae genera pink and light pink a chitinophagaceae genus light purple opitutus dark purple and an ellin329 genus light blue while nitrospira red was the sixth most abundant genus four of the top five genera in both reactors a and b were the same as in the 24 h operation experiment strongly suggesting that their contribution to the system performance and the stability of the carrier microbiomes were critical to verify the presence of aob and nob in the system the 16s rrna gene sequence data were phylogenetically analyzed at the otu level fig 3d however as in the 24 h experiment only the presence of nitrospira was observed in the carriers of reactor b although nitrification had been thought to be catalyzed by the coordination of canonical aob and nob recent studies have demonstrated the existence of nitrospira species capable of performing complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria the fact that nitrification occurred in the almost complete absence of aob aoa led us to hypothesize that the nitrospira otus detected in this system can catalyze complete nitrification a blast analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of nitrospira otu 1 implied that this otu is phylogenetically related to comammox nitrospira table s3 however the v4 region sequence of the 16s rrna gene alone was insufficient to confirm the taxonomic identity at the species level thus a shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed to verify the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system 3 4 shotgun metagenomic analysis because nitrospira otu 1 which was predicted to belong to the nitrospira sublineage ii that includes all of the comammox nitrospira spp reported so far koch et al 2019 was predominant in the reactor b carrier of the 70 d sample this carrier sample was used for the shotgun metagenomic analysis the 34 815 354 raw sequences obtained were assembled using megahit after quality filtering by trimmomatic generating 228 016 contigs then the contig sequences were binned using metabat into 17 metagenome bins for all bins rrna gene sequences were searched in the silva rrna database using ribopicker and detected from six bins a blast analysis of the detected rrna sequences in the non redundant nucleotide database suggested that bin 7 was related to the nitrospira sublineage ii whereas the others were not related to nitrifiers thereafter a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of bin 7 with various nitrospira spp including both canonical nob and comammox clearly demonstrating that bin 7 belongs to the comammox clade in the nitrospira sublineage ii fig 4 a the most closely related species was ca nitrospira nitrificans van kessel et al 2015 the results suggest nitrospira had the main role in nitrification in the reactor b next we identified the ammonia monooxygenase gene amoa which encodes the enzyme catalyzing ammonia oxidation the orfs in the contig sequences of bin 7 were predicted using dfast https dfast nig ac jp and also analyzed by blastx using the refseq protein database however no amoa gene was found from bin 7 we therefore focused on finding the amoa gene from all assembly sequences generated by megahit i e using assemblies before binning all metagenome assemblies were analyzed by blastx with a manually curated dataset containing amoa amino acid sequences of both comammox and canonical aob resulting in the detection of one assembly with 96 identity to comammox amoa contig id k141 81156 identity 98 6 alignment length 277 aa host uncultured nitrospira sp accession number vwf18674 1 and two assemblies identical to canonical amoa sequences k141 184304 100 167 aa nitrosospira sp 56 18 ojy07900 1 k141 153359 96 5 201 aa nitrosospira multiformis wp 074703664 1 an orf was detected from the contig k141 81156 using the ncbi orffinder and thus the orf was phylogenetically analyzed against the 14 comammox amoa genes reported so far the resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that the detected amoa orf belonged to clade a comammox to evaluate the possibility that this amoa gene could be included in any metagenome bin the sequence coverage of all contigs was calculated and compared with that of the amoa contig k141 81156 fig 4c with the results indicating a high sequence coverage of the amoa contig 0 0259 in contrast the average sequence coverage of almost all of the bins was much lower than that of the amoa contig the average coverage of 16 bins were 0 01 while that of bin 7 was significantly higher than that of the other contigs 0 0181 p 0 0001 and comparable with that of the amoa contig in addition the megahit assemblies were also binned using another binning tool maxbin2 consequently the two contigs containing the comammox nitrospira 16s rrna gene k141 42230 and the comammox amoa gene k141 81156 respectively were assigned to the same bin these results suggests that the detected amoa gene was most likely derived from the bin 7 related microorganism in addition we examined the existence and expression levels of the comammox amoa as well as canonical amoa genes in the reactor b by quantitative pcr as shown in fig 4d the expression level of comammox amoa was 500 times higher than that of canonical amoa clearly suggesting that comammox nitrospira was the main driver of nitrification in the system 3 5 microbial co occurrence network analysis because the microbiome that efficiently catalyzed nitrification was stably maintained in the reactor b carrier it was hypothesized that the interspecific interactions among the constituent microbes were optimized for balancing the community assembly to obtain further information regarding the enrichment of comammox nitrospira a microbial co occurrence analysis was performed a co occurrence network was constructed based on the relative abundances of 56 major otus with 1 relative abundance in total in the reactor b carriers in the 70 d operation experiment resulting in 51 nodes and 96 edges fig 5 a s1 the relative abundances and phylogenetic information for all 56 otus are summarized in table s4 several clusters consisting of positively interacting otus were identified in the network one of them at the bottom of the network included the comammox related nitrospira otu otu 11867 corresponding to nitrospira otu 1 in fig 3d as well as another nitrospira otu otu 7279 nitrospira otu 8 only the anaerolinea related otu 5811 which was predicted to be anaerobic had a strong positive correlation ρ 0 7 with both nitrospira otus while chujaibacter related otu 1620 and ferruginibacter related otu 11531 had a positive interaction with either of the two nitrospira otus the relative abundances and phylogenetic information for the three otus are summarized in fig 5b the cluster also included the otus belonging to rhizobiales and acidobacteria as well as anaerolinea which had previously been identified in the nitrospira dominated biofilm of a drinking water treatment system palomo et al 2016 implying the importance of their coexistence for maintaining nitrospira related otus in the system to assess this result the correlation coefficients pearson s r between nitrospira otu 1 and each of the 3 330 otus detected in the 24 h operation experiment were calculated based on their relative abundances the anaerolinea related otu 5811 had the strongest positive correlation with nitrospira otu 1 in the 24 h operation experiment fig s2 additionally otu 7768 which was phylogenetically related to otu 11531 both belong to the ferruginibacter shown in blue in fig 5b had the fifth strongest positive correlation with nitrospira otu 1 in the 24 h operation these results emphasized the importance of the coexistence of these otus for nitrospira related otus 4 discussion we developed a system to biologically convert organic nitrogen to nitrate for use as a hydroponic fertilizer the system consisted of two separate reactors one of which was used for catalyzing ammonification reactor a and the other for nitrification reactor b with both having a stable performance during long term use to identify the key microbes and obtain a better understanding of the system efficiency and stability the microbiomes in the two reactors were analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing although the canonical nitrification pathway is catalyzed by two distinct groups of microbes i e aob aoa and nob unexpectedly only a small population relative abundance 0 0075 of aob related otus was found in the nitrification reactor whereas nitrospira related otus were dominant on the microbe attached carriers in the same reactor fig 2d 3d because ammonium was efficiently converted to nitrate fig 1c d the nearly complete absence of aob strongly suggested non use of the canonical pathway in reactor b and led us to hypothesize that comammox nitrospira chiefly contributed to nitrification in the system to evaluate this hypothesis we additionally performed a shotgun metagenomic analysis of the reactor b carrier detecting 17 metagenome bins by metabat a phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna genes in the 17 bins demonstrated that bin 7 which had the highest sequence coverage among the bins 0 018 on average fig 4c belonged to the comammox clade in nitrospira sublineage ii and was closely related to ca n nitrificans fig 4a van kessel et al 2015 although not found in bin 7 or any other bins the comammox amoa gene was identified from the metagenome assemblies with a high sequence coverage 0 0259 fig 4b c whereas the two detected canonical amoa genes had low coverages k141 184304 0 00102 k141 153359 0 00151 while use of another binning tool maxbin2 resulted in the clustering of the two contigs containing the comammox nitrospira 16s rrna gene k141 42230 and the comammox amoa gene k141 81156 respectively in the same bin although our metagenomic analysis did not recover the high quality genome of nitrospira we consider that the nitrification process of our system was driven by comammox nitrospira based on the following results i the low abundance of aob and predominance of the otus belonging to the nitrospira sublineage ii in the nitrification reactor fig 2d 3d ii the identification of bin 7 in which the rrna gene was closely related to those of the comammox clade of nitrospira sublineage ii fig 4a iii the identification of the amoa gene affiliated in clade a of comammox amoa fig 4b iv the comparable high sequence coverages of bin 7 0 0181 and the comammox amoa contig 0 0259 and the low coverage of canonical amoa contigs 0 00102 and 0 00151 fig 4c v substantially higher expression level of the comammox amoa than canonical amoa fig 4d and vi the characteristic profiles of nitrogen compound concentrations i e only a negligible amount of nitrite was detected during nitrification fig 1c d which closely corresponded to the features of nitrification by comammox nitrospira kits et al 2017 because nitrite generated by the oxidation of ammonia can be immediately converted to nitrate intracellularly the nitrification process by comammox is highly efficient compared with the canonical nitrification by aob and nob kits et al 2017 it has also been suggested that comammox produces less nitrous oxide a byproduct abiotically generated during nitrification than will aob caranto and lancastera 2017 kits et al 2019 moreover the affinity of comammox nitrospira towards ammonia is remarkably high compared with aob kits et al 2017 these physiological features of comammox nitrospira possibly contributed to the high efficiency of the nitrification system to fully clarify the detailed metabolism of comammox nitrospira found in this study the use of large scale sequencers such as hiseq is required however given that the purpose of this study was to verify the presence and predominance of comammox nitrospira the above pieces of evidence were considered sufficient the process configuration of our system namely the two separate reactors employing carriers for microbial attachment fig 1a was crucial for the efficient production of nitrate from organic nitrogen compounds ammonification and nitrification were catalyzed by heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively both of which have distinct growth requirements however the simultaneous activation of both reactions is required for the efficient conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrate therefore separation of the reactors is a rational approach the microbiomes of reactors a and b were distinct from each other reflecting the different functions of the two reactors i e ammonification and nitrification fig 2a b 3a b furthermore it was found that the microbial compositions in the liquid phases of both reactors a and b were substantially altered during both short and long term operations whereas those of the carriers remained stable fig 2a 3a moreover after the 70 days of monitoring the system was continued to operate for more than a year and the microbial community in reactor b was analyzed on day 486 which demonstrated that the major members of the microbial community including comamox nitrospira were sufficiently maintained in the carriers fig s3 these results indicate that the application of the carrier successfully stabilized the microbiomes in the system although the microbial communities used in wastewater treatment fluctuate with environmental changes vuono et al 2015 sato et al 2019 sato et al 2020 the carriers used in this study contained an internal biofilm fig 1b the development of which can be advantageous for resident microbes by alleviating exposure to environmental changes as well as by inhibiting the growth of other microbes there have been several reports of nitrifying microbial communities being dominated by comammox nitrospira most of which were found in engineered systems such as drinking water treatment systems palomo et al 2016 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 and wastewater treatment systems camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 through these studies several environmental factors that could shape the comammox dominating microbiome have been proposed one is a low ammonia concentration koch et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 which could be explained by the remarkably high affinity of comammox nitrospira towards ammonia kits et al 2017 another factor is a low oxygen concentration roots et al 2019 the preference of comammox for low oxygen conditions has been predicted previously from kinetic theory and genomic analyses costa et al 2006 lücker et al 2010 lawson and lücker 2018 and has been examined experimentally roots et al 2019 camejo et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 however both the inlet ammonium concentration approximately 250 mg l 1 and do concentration 4 mg l 1 in our system were extremely high compared with previous studies it is unclear if this difference was due the physiology of the nitrospira detected in this study while the biofilm formed inside the cylindrical carrier might reduce the exposure of the nitrifiers to high concentrations of oxygen and ammonium in the system the coexistence and strong positive correlation between the otus of nitrospira and anaerolinea which are predicted to be anaerobic mcilroy et al 2017 were revealed by 16s rrna sequencing and a microbial co occurrence analysis fig 3 5 comammox nitrospira was originally found in biofilms daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and most of the microbiomes in which comammox have subsequently been reported to predominate also occur in biofilms palomo et al 2016 camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 highlighting the likely presence of comammox nitrospira in relatively microaerobic biofilm environments moreover many of the otus identified in the microbial co occurrence analysis were phylogenetically similar to those found in the microbial communities of groundwater fed sand filters table s4 in which nitrospira was dominant and the otus affiliated with rhizobiales burkholderiales acidobacteria anaerolinea and xanthomonadacea were also found gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 given the difficulty of obtaining a pure culture koch et al 2019 fujitani et al 2020 interactions with such microbes in biofilm communities may also support comammox nitrospira proliferation 5 conclusion since its discovery comammox nitrospira has been found in various environments daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 kits et al 2019 koch et al 2019 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 due to its unique metabolic capability industrial applications of comammox have attracted increasing attention although unintentional we successfully developed and stably operated a novel comammox driven nitrification system with highly efficient nitrification performance in terms of practical use dividing the system into two parts i e ammonification and nitrification and using the carriers are considered to be important for stable nitrate production from proteinous wastewater through the complementary use of 16s rrna gene sequencing shotgun metagenomics and a microbial co occurrence analysis we identified the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system and unveiled the ecophysiology of the comammox dominated microbial community although it was not described in this report we have already used the comammox produced nitrate solution as a hydroponic fertilizer for cultivating plants the findings reported here can be used to promote the use of comammox in industrial applications declaration of competing interest several authors on this manuscript

17032,a bacterium capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox has been widely found in various environments whereas its industrial application is limited due to the difficulty of cultivation and or enrichment we developed a biological system to produce a high quality nitrate solution for use in hydroponic fertilizer the system was composed of two separate reactors for ammonification and nitrification and was found to have a stable and efficient performance in the conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrate to determine the key microbes involved and better understand the system the microbial communities in the reactors were analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing in combination with a shotgun metagenomic analysis canonical ammonia oxidizing bacteria which can only catalyze the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite were detected with negligible relative abundances while a comammox nitrospira related operational taxonomic unit otu dominated the nitrification reactor furthermore the comammox type ammonia monooxygenase was found to be 500 times more highly expressed than the canonical one by quantitative pcr indicating that comammox was the main driver of the stable and efficient ammonia oxidation in the system a microbial co occurrence analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between nitrospira and several otus some of which such as anaerolinea otu have been found to co exist with comammox nitrospira in the biofilms of water treatment systems given that these otus were abundant only on microbe attached carriers in the system their co existence within the biofilm could be beneficial to stabilize the nitrospira abundance possibly by physically preventing oxygen exposure as well as cell spillage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater comammox nitrification ammonification nitrogen cycling hydroponic 1 introduction nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms therefore the nitrogen cycle in which bacteria play a vital role in the conversion of nitrogen compounds is of critical importance for all ecosystems gruber and galloway 2008 kuypers et al 2018 takai 2019 nitrogen acquisition is a rate limiting process for plant growth vance 2001 it has been demonstrated that plant body size is positively correlated with nitrogen incorporation vance 2001 reich et al 2006 nitrogen fertilization is therefore an indispensable process in agriculture socolow 1999 in conventional agriculture organic nitrogen compounds that are applied to soils as fertilizer are degraded into ammonia and subsequently oxidized to nitrate via nitrite by microbes in which the former biological conversion is called ammonification while the latter is called nitrification kuypers et al 2018 although ammonification can be catalyzed by various heterotrophic bacteria nitrification is performed only by a few microbial species called nitrifiers i e ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob takai 2019 in addition to these canonical nitrifiers a single bacterium that can catalyze complete ammonia oxidation comammox has been discovered recently daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 because many plants incorporate nitrogen in the form of nitrate their growth is largely dependent on the capability of these nitrogen converting microbes kuypers et al 2018 in the case of hydroponic cultivation the use of organic nitrogen fertilizer has been shown to inhibit plant growth because of the absence of microbial nitrogen mineralization in the system a nitrogen source therefore needs to be supplied directly in the form of nitrate garland et al 1997 hydroponics is a pragmatic cultivation approach in which the precise control of fertilization is possible therefore the development of a fertilizer that is compatible with hydroponic systems is required shinohara et al 2011 although most fertilizers are chemically manufactured hydroponic fertilizer can in principle be biologically synthesized from organic substances such as proteinous waste from the fish processing industry with a contribution from nitrogen converting microbes the whole process must include at least two distinct biological reactions one is the conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonia while the other is the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate consequently multiple functional guilds of microbes need to be involved in natural environments these processes are simultaneously catalyzed by complex microbial communities however there are major difficulties in controlling the microbial communities in engineered system for example although microbial composition is closely linked to community function the abundance of the constituent microbes fluctuates depending on environmental changes sato et al 2019 to avoid dealing with the two biological reactions in one microbiome we developed two separate microbiomes in two independent reactors for synthesizing the high quality nitrate solution as a hydroponic fertilizer one of the reactors was dedicated to ammonification and the other to nitrification fig 1 a the two reactor system contained porous cylindrical carriers to stabilize the microbial community structure and maintain the efficiency of nitrate production by allowing nitrogen converting microbes to colonize the carrier the efficient and stable performance of the system during long term use motivated us to examine which microbes contributed to the system performance and the interaction between them to this end a high throughput sequencing analysis was applied to investigate the microbial community structure during 24 h short interval assessment of one reaction cycle and 70 d long interval assessment of reaction stability operations of the system the key microbes in the system were determined by shotgun metagenomic analysis and the relationship among co existing microbes was inferred using a co occurrence network analysis consequently the participation of key microbes by which the system efficiency was maintained was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration and operating conditions of the hydroponic fertilizer producing system a schematic configuration of the hydroponic fertilizer producing system is shown in fig 1a the system consisted of two reactors a 300 l and b 500 l in volume in which ammonification i e the degradation of organic nitrogen compounds to ammonia and nitrification i e the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite were performed respectively effective volumes of reactor a and b were 200 l and 100 l respectively the seed microbiome for both reactors a and b was obtained by immersing bark compost packed in a cloth bag in the liquid phase of the reactors and was maintained for more than 2 years in the system proteinous wastewater total nitrogen tn concentration approximately 340 mg l 1 was added daily to reactor a at a rate of 200 l day 1 after a 24 h incubation part of the treated wastewater was moved to reactor b at a rate of 100 l day 1 from which the same amount of the nitrate solution that was produced was harvested before the addition of the input from reactor a the two reactors were aerated by an air diffuser located at the bottom of the system and operated at 25 c porous cylindrical carriers φ 5 mm 5 mm length mmpolypropylene taiyousuiken inc saitama japan were added to the two reactors at a rate of 18 by volume the liquid phase of the two reactors was continuously stirred and ph was neutralized during the operation physicochemical parameters such as temperature and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen do tn total organic carbon toc and nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the system were monitored as described previously sato et al 2016a 2 2 sampling procedures two series of sample collections were performed one was a 4 h sampling interval that occurred throughout the 24 h operation which was intended to clarify the short term dynamics of the microbial community structures during one reaction cycle and identify the key microbes in the two reactors the other was a 14 d sampling interval that occurred throughout the 70 d operation which examined the long term stability of the nitrogen converting microbiome the 4 h interval experiment was done at days 6 7 of the 70 d operation in the 70 d operation experiment the samples were collected at the end of each 1 d reaction cycle before starting a new reaction cycle in each sampling the liquid phase of the reactor and microbe attached carriers were harvested liquid samples were taken from reactors a 1 ml and b 2 ml respectively these samples were centrifuged and the resulting microbial pellets were used for dna extraction for the carriers one or two carriers if sufficient dna was not extracted from one carrier were used for dna extraction for the samples from both reactors a and b in addition to the two series of the experiments described above i e 24 h and 70 d operation the reactor was operated continuously over a year and on day 486 the carrier of reactor b was collected to analyze the microbial community 2 3 the 16s rrna gene analysis the microbial cell pellets and carriers collected from the nitrate solution producing system were used for the microbial analyses genomic dna was extracted using a direct lysis protocol that includes chemical lysis and bead beating of the cell pellets or the cells attached on the carriers aoyagi et al 2015 noll et al 2005 the extracted dna was purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation the contaminated rna was digested with rnase type ii a sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the purified dna was quantified using nanodrop lite thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and used as the template for pcr amplification the 515f and 806r universal primer sets were used to amplify the v4 region of 16s rrna gene using a high fidelity dna polymerase q5 neb ipswich ma usa both primers were modified to contain an illumina adapter region and the reverse primer contained a 12 bp barcode for multiplex sequencing caporaso et al 2012 the dna libraries for the miseq system illumina san diego ca usa were prepared as described previously sato et al 2016b and the paired end sequencing was conducted using the 500 cycle miseq reagent kit v2 the resulting sequence data were deposited in the dna data bank of japan ddbj accession number for raw data dra011087 using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences the microbial community structure was analyzed using the qiime software and greengenes database caporaso et al 2010 as

well as a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the calculated weighted unifrac distances lozupone et al 2011 the predominant otus 97 sequence similarity were further determined based on a blast search of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi all samples were sequenced in triplicate excluding the 20 h carrier sample in reactor a of the 24 h operation experiment which was analyzed in duplicate 2 4 shotgun metagenome sequencing to further clarify the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system the 70 d carrier sample in reactor b of the 70 d operation experiment was used for a shotgun metagenomic analysis first dna was extracted from the carrier and then purified as described above a metagenome library for the illumina sequencer was prepared using the kapa hyperplus library preparation kit roche sequencing solutions pleasanton ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the concentration of the prepared dna was measured using the quant it picogreen dsdna reagent and kit and paired end sequencing was conducted using the miseq system with the 600 cycle miseq reagent kit v3 because the aim of this metagenomic analysis was to confirm the presence of comammox nitrospira i e detection of its 16s rrna genes and the genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase a representative marker gene for ammonia oxidizers we did not use a production scale sequencing platform such as hiseq illumina the resulting sequence data were deposited in the ddbj accession number for raw data dra011088 low quality sequences were trimmed from the metagenomic data using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 with the criteria of a q value 30 and read length 50 b the paired end sequences were de novo assembled using megahit with the default settings li et al 2015 and then binned using metabat with the default settings kang et al 2019 with a bam file generated by aligning paired end sequences on the assemblies using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 to confirm the accuracy of the obtained bins the megahit assemblies were also binned using maxbin2 wu et al 2015 from each bin rrna sequences were detected by

existence and the expression level of canonical amoa as well as comammox amoa genes quantitative pcr qpcr was performed the reactor b carriers with microbial cells attached were cryogenically ground

shotgun metagenome analysis and three sequences obtained from the comammox amoa clone library primers shown in table s2 were analyzed using primer3plus untergasser et al 2012 to design the primers for qpcr for canonical amoa three gene sequences obtained from ncbi nucleotide database i e nitrosospira multiformis atcc 25196 nc 007614 1 nitrosomonas sp is79a3 nc 015731 1 and nitrosomonas ureae strain nm10 cp013341 1 and four sequences obtained from the canonical amoa clone library primers shown in table s2 shimomura et at 2012 were aligned by clustal w larkin et al 2007 and the primers for the conserved region were designed for qpcr the qpcr efficiency values were 102 1 for comammox amoa and 91 5 for canonical amoa the sequence coverage of the primers were 5 1 for comammox amoa and 54 0 for canonical amoa powerup sybr green master mix thermo fisher scientific and kod sybr qpcr mix toyobo osaka japan were used for qpcr analyses of comammox amoa and canonical amoa respectively the conditions used for the qpcr analyses are summarized in table s1 for exact quantification of the gene copy number standard curves for comammox amoa and canonical amoa were prepared using the plasmid conjugated with the respective amoa gene fragment amplified from the extracted dna from the reactor b carrier the analysis was performed with triplicate samples 2 6 microbial co occurrence network analysis for the microbial network analysis spearman s rank correlations were calculated among the otus detected from the reactor b carriers of the 70 d operation experiment that had a 1 total relative abundance across the 18 samples 0 14 28 42 56 and 70 d in triplicate this filtering step based on the abundance reduced the network complexity allowing a focus on the core community barberán et al 2012 because most of the otus were specifically present in either reactor a or b as well as in either the liquid phase or carrier the use of all abundance data i e in liquid carrier and reactors a b generated pseudo positive correlations hence to focus on the microbial correlation network in the reactor b carriers the other abundance data were eliminated from the calculation in this study a spearman s correlation coefficient ρ of 0 7 and p value of 0 001 were used as criteria to establish a valid co occurrence network among the otus the network analysis was performed in the r environment http www r project org with the hmisc package http cran r project org web packages hmisc and the network was visualized by cytoscape shannon et al 2003 the correlation among the otus detected in the 24 h operation experiment was inferred by calculating the pearson s correlation coefficient r based on the relative abundances of otus with sequence reads 5 3 results 3 1 system performance in the reactors of the nitrate solution producing system microbes were observed to successfully colonize the inside of the cylindrical carriers fig 1b the profiles of the toc inorganic carbon ic and tn concentrations during the 24 h operation experiment are shown in fig 1c the toc concentration in reactor a was initially high 1 144 mg l 1 but decreased to approximately 10 of the initial concentration 129 mg l 1 within the first 12 h while at the same time the ic concentration increased from 12 to 203 mg l 1 the tn concentration in reactor a was initially 339 mg l 1 and it decreased slightly to 315 mg l 1 over 24 h these data indicate that the organic nitrogen was effectively converted to ammonia with the majority of the ammonia not being converted to nitrate and subsequently being removed by denitrification if there was an excess incubation period in reactor a the ammonia that was generated could be oxidized to nitrate and removed by denitrifiers reducing nitrate to nitrogen gas via respiration the toc and ic concentrations in reactor b were maintained at low levels 43 61 and 1 7 40 mg l 1 respectively throughout the operation while tn was maintained at a high level 285 292 mg l 1 this also indicated that the nitrate generated in reactor b was not removed by denitrification which occurred when the liquid phase moved from reactor a contained a high concentration of organic matter the ammonium concentration increased from 1 9 to 264 mg n l 1 over 24 h in reactor a which corresponded to 83 7 of the tn at the end of the operation fig 1d suggesting that ammonification progressed efficiently in reactor a in reactor b the nitrate concentration increased from 0 to 252 mg n l 1 over 24 h with this increase the ammonium concentration decreased from 264 to 11 mg n l 1 in reactor b indicating that 95 7 of the inlet ammonium was converted to nitrate the reaction conditions such as temperature substrate concentration and reaction period seemed to be finely tuned in this system the nitrite concentration in reactor b was maintained below the detection limit 0 08 mg n l 1 whereas the ammonium and nitrate concentrations displayed dynamic transitions i e ammonium was immediately converted to nitrate via nitrite because canonical nitrification is catalyzed by the cooperation of two guilds of microbes i e aob aoa and nob nitrite generated by aob aoa via the oxidation of ammonia tended to accumulate in the reaction system as an intermediate product due to the delayed activation of nob which convert nitrite to nitrate therefore the absence of nitrite accumulation implicitly denied the occurrence of canonical nitrification in the system as to the 70 d operation the nitrate concentration in the effluent of the reactor b was monitored and ranged from 192 to 248 mg n l 1 during the operation 3 2 microbial community structure during the 24 h operation period the microbial community structure of the system was analyzed over 24 h at 4 h intervals the pcoa scatter plot of the resulting 16s rrna gene sequence data is shown in fig 2 a the analysis demonstrated that the community structure in the liquid phase changed in both reactors a and b during the operating period the initial position of the plot for the liquid phase of reactor b was similar to that of reactor a but it shifted to a position near the plot of the carrier in reactor b indicating that the microbial community originating from reactor a acclimatized to the situation e g low organic matter concentration in reactor b over 24 h fig 1c in contrast to the liquid phase the plots for the carriers of both reactors a and b showed only minor shifts indicating the high stability of the carrier microbial community structures during the operation the 16s rrna gene sequence data were phylogenetically analyzed at the class fig 2b and genus fig 2c levels as shown in these figures the community structures in the liquid phase drastically changed within 24 h the bacterial class that commonly dominated both reactors was gammaproteobacteria but the constituent genera within this class were distinctly different between the two reactors the predominance of the classes betaproteobacteria and flavobacteriia was a characteristic of reactor a these two classes as well as gammaproteobacteria contain various heterotrophic bacteria that are capable of rapidly degrading organic matter gao et al 2009 vuono et al 2015 the top five genera with the highest abundances in the microbiome of the reactor a carrier were a comamonadaceae genus shown in blue in fig 2c a chitinophagaceae genus light purple chryseobacterium dark blue a pseudomonadaceae genus light yellow and rheinheimera orange which possibly contributed to the ammonification in reactor a the involvement of multiple microbes in ammonification is a reasonable assumption because this process can be catalyzed by most of the heterotrophs whereas one genus belonging to comamonadaceae was predominant in both the liquid phase and carrier in reactor a implying that it made a major contribution in reactor b the top five genera in the carrier were two xanthomonadaceae genera pink and light pink a chitinophagaceae genus light purple an ellin329 a candidate of the alphaproteobacterial order genus light blue and nitrospira red which is capable of nitrite oxidation canonical nitrification is a process catalyzed by aob aoa and nob however no aob aoa related genus was dominant in the reactor b carrier to investigate the populations of these nitrifying microbes in detail the sequence data were further analyzed at the otu level fig 2d the otu results also emphasized the predominance of nitrospira but not aob aoa in the reactor b carrier 3 3 microbial community structure during the 70 d operation period the microbial community structures in the system were analyzed over 70 d at 14 d intervals a pcoa scatter plot of the resulting sequence data fig 3 a showed that in both reactors a and b the community structure in the liquid phase shifted substantially along the experiment while the community in the carriers did not this trend was similar to that observed for the 24 h operation fig 2a this indicates that the microbial community structures of the carriers were stable even during the 70 d operation the phylogenetic analysis fig 3b class level fig c genus level also demonstrated that the microbial community structures of the carrier in both reactors a and b were stable during the 70 d operation the highest relative population was flavobacteriia in the 70 d operation especially in the liquid phase while betaproteobacteria was the highest in the 24 h operation because both the flavobacteriia and betaproteobacteria contain various bacteria capable of ammonification this difference in the dominant microorganisms did not seem to alter the performance of reactor a the five genera with the highest abundances in the reactor a carrier were a comamonadaceae genus shown in blue in fig 3c chryseobacterium light gray a pseudomonadaceae genus light yellow a chitinophagaceae genus light purple and aquimonas dark yellow the five genera with the highest abundances in the reactor b carrier were two xanthomonadaceae genera pink and light pink a chitinophagaceae genus light purple opitutus dark purple and an ellin329 genus light blue while nitrospira red was the sixth most abundant genus four of the top five genera in both reactors a and b were the same as in the 24 h operation experiment strongly suggesting that their contribution to the system performance and the stability of the carrier microbiomes were critical to verify the presence of aob and nob in the system the 16s rrna gene sequence data were phylogenetically analyzed at the otu level fig 3d however as in the 24 h experiment only the presence of nitrospira was observed in the carriers of reactor b although nitrification had been thought to be catalyzed by the coordination of canonical aob and nob recent studies have demonstrated the existence of nitrospira species capable of performing complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria the fact that nitrification occurred in the almost complete absence of aob aoa led us to hypothesize that the nitrospira otus detected in this system can catalyze complete nitrification a blast analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of nitrospira otu 1 implied that this otu is phylogenetically related to comammox nitrospira table s3 however the v4 region sequence of the 16s rrna gene alone was insufficient to confirm the taxonomic identity at the species level thus a shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed to verify the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system 3 4 shotgun metagenomic analysis because nitrospira otu 1 which was predicted to belong to the nitrospira sublineage ii that includes all of the comammox nitrospira spp reported so far koch et al 2019 was predominant in the reactor b carrier of the 70 d sample this carrier sample was used for the shotgun metagenomic analysis the 34 815 354 raw sequences obtained were assembled using megahit after quality filtering by trimmomatic generating 228 016 contigs then the contig sequences were binned using metabat into 17 metagenome bins for all bins rrna gene sequences were searched in the silva rrna database using ribopicker and detected from six bins a blast analysis of the detected rrna sequences in the non redundant nucleotide database suggested that bin 7 was related to the nitrospira sublineage ii whereas the others were not related to nitrifiers thereafter a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the full length 16s rrna gene sequences of bin 7 with various nitrospira spp including both canonical nob and comammox clearly demonstrating that bin 7 belongs to the comammox clade in the nitrospira sublineage ii fig 4 a the most closely related species was ca nitrospira nitrificans van kessel et al 2015 the results suggest nitrospira had the main role in nitrification in the reactor b next we identified the ammonia monooxygenase gene amoa which encodes the enzyme catalyzing ammonia oxidation the orfs in the contig sequences of bin 7 were predicted using dfast https dfast nig ac jp and also analyzed by blastx using the refseq protein database however no amoa gene was found from bin 7 we therefore focused on finding the amoa gene from all assembly sequences generated by megahit i e using assemblies before binning all metagenome assemblies were analyzed by blastx with a manually curated dataset containing amoa amino acid sequences of both comammox and canonical aob resulting in the detection of one assembly with 96 identity to comammox amoa contig id k141 81156 identity 98 6 alignment length 277 aa host uncultured nitrospira sp accession number vwf18674 1 and two assemblies identical to canonical amoa sequences k141 184304 100 167 aa nitrosospira sp 56 18 ojy07900 1 k141 153359 96 5 201 aa nitrosospira multiformis wp 074703664 1 an orf was detected from the contig k141 81156 using the ncbi orffinder and thus the orf was phylogenetically analyzed against the 14 comammox amoa genes reported so far the resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that the detected amoa orf belonged to clade a comammox to evaluate the possibility that this amoa gene could be included in any metagenome bin the sequence coverage of all contigs was calculated and compared with that of the amoa contig k141 81156 fig 4c with the results indicating a high sequence coverage of the amoa contig 0 0259 in contrast the average sequence coverage of almost all of the bins was much lower than that of the amoa contig the average coverage of 16 bins were 0 01 while that of bin 7 was significantly higher than that of the other contigs 0 0181 p 0 0001 and comparable with that of the amoa contig in addition the megahit assemblies were also binned using another binning tool maxbin2 consequently the two contigs containing the comammox nitrospira 16s rrna gene k141 42230 and the comammox amoa gene k141 81156 respectively were assigned to the same bin these results suggests that the detected amoa gene was most likely derived from the bin 7 related microorganism in addition we examined the existence and expression levels of the comammox amoa as well as canonical amoa genes in the reactor b by quantitative pcr as shown in fig 4d the expression level of comammox amoa was 500 times higher than that of canonical amoa clearly suggesting that comammox nitrospira was the main driver of nitrification in the system 3 5 microbial co occurrence network analysis because the microbiome that efficiently catalyzed nitrification was stably maintained in the reactor b carrier it was hypothesized that the interspecific interactions among the constituent microbes were optimized for balancing the community assembly to obtain further information regarding the enrichment of comammox nitrospira a microbial co occurrence analysis was performed a co occurrence network was constructed based on the relative abundances of 56 major otus with 1 relative abundance in total in the reactor b carriers in the 70 d operation experiment resulting in 51 nodes and 96 edges fig 5 a s1 the relative abundances and phylogenetic information for all 56 otus are summarized in table s4 several clusters consisting of positively interacting otus were identified in the network one of them at the bottom of the network included the comammox related nitrospira otu otu 11867 corresponding to nitrospira otu 1 in fig 3d as well as another nitrospira otu otu 7279 nitrospira otu 8 only the anaerolinea related otu 5811 which was predicted to be anaerobic had a strong positive correlation ρ 0 7 with both nitrospira otus while chujaibacter related otu 1620 and ferruginibacter related otu 11531 had a positive interaction with either of the two nitrospira otus the relative abundances and phylogenetic information for the three otus are summarized in fig 5b the cluster also included the otus belonging to rhizobiales and acidobacteria as well as anaerolinea which had previously been identified in the nitrospira dominated biofilm of a drinking water treatment system palomo et al 2016 implying the importance of their coexistence for maintaining nitrospira related otus in the system to assess this result the correlation coefficients pearson s r between nitrospira otu 1 and each of the 3 330 otus detected in the 24 h operation experiment were calculated based on their relative abundances the anaerolinea related otu 5811 had the strongest positive correlation with nitrospira otu 1 in the 24 h operation experiment fig s2 additionally otu 7768 which was phylogenetically related to otu 11531 both belong to the ferruginibacter shown in blue in fig 5b had the fifth strongest positive correlation with nitrospira otu 1 in the 24 h operation these results emphasized the importance of the coexistence of these otus for nitrospira related otus 4 discussion we developed a system to biologically convert organic nitrogen to nitrate for use as a hydroponic fertilizer the system consisted of two separate reactors one of which was used for catalyzing ammonification reactor a and the other for nitrification reactor b with both having a stable performance during long term use to identify the key microbes and obtain a better understanding of the system efficiency and stability the microbiomes in the two reactors were analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing although the canonical nitrification pathway is catalyzed by two distinct groups of microbes i e aob aoa and nob unexpectedly only a small population relative abundance 0 0075 of aob related otus was found in the nitrification reactor whereas nitrospira related otus were dominant on the microbe attached carriers in the same reactor fig 2d 3d because ammonium was efficiently converted to nitrate fig 1c d the nearly complete absence of aob strongly suggested non use of the canonical pathway in reactor b and led us to hypothesize that comammox nitrospira chiefly contributed to nitrification in the system to evaluate this hypothesis we additionally performed a shotgun metagenomic analysis of the reactor b carrier detecting 17 metagenome bins by metabat a phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna genes in the 17 bins demonstrated that bin 7 which had the highest sequence coverage among the bins 0 018 on average fig 4c belonged to the comammox clade in nitrospira sublineage ii and was closely related to ca n nitrificans fig 4a van kessel et al 2015 although not found in bin 7 or any other bins the comammox amoa gene was identified from the metagenome assemblies with a high sequence coverage 0 0259 fig 4b c whereas the two detected canonical amoa genes had low coverages k141 184304 0 00102 k141 153359 0 00151 while use of another binning tool maxbin2 resulted in the clustering of the two contigs containing the comammox nitrospira 16s rrna gene k141 42230 and the comammox amoa gene k141 81156 respectively in the same bin although our metagenomic analysis did not recover the high quality genome of nitrospira we consider that the nitrification process of our system was driven by comammox nitrospira based on the following results i the low abundance of aob and predominance of the otus belonging to the nitrospira sublineage ii in the nitrification reactor fig 2d 3d ii the identification of bin 7 in which the rrna gene was closely related to those of the comammox clade of nitrospira sublineage ii fig 4a iii the identification of the amoa gene affiliated in clade a of comammox amoa fig 4b iv the comparable high sequence coverages of bin 7 0 0181 and the comammox amoa contig 0 0259 and the low coverage of canonical amoa contigs 0 00102 and 0 00151 fig 4c v substantially higher expression level of the comammox amoa than canonical amoa fig 4d and vi the characteristic profiles of nitrogen compound concentrations i e only a negligible amount of nitrite was detected during nitrification fig 1c d which closely corresponded to the features of nitrification by comammox nitrospira kits et al 2017 because nitrite generated by the oxidation of ammonia can be immediately converted to nitrate intracellularly the nitrification process by comammox is highly efficient compared with the canonical nitrification by aob and nob kits et al 2017 it has also been suggested that comammox produces less nitrous oxide a byproduct abiotically generated during nitrification than will aob caranto and lancastera 2017 kits et al 2019 moreover the affinity of comammox nitrospira towards ammonia is remarkably high compared with aob kits et al 2017 these physiological features of comammox nitrospira possibly contributed to the high efficiency of the nitrification system to fully clarify the detailed metabolism of comammox nitrospira found in this study the use of large scale sequencers such as hiseq is required however given that the purpose of this study was to verify the presence and predominance of comammox nitrospira the above pieces of evidence were considered sufficient the process configuration of our system namely the two separate reactors employing carriers for microbial attachment fig 1a was crucial for the efficient production of nitrate from organic nitrogen compounds ammonification and nitrification were catalyzed by heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively both of which have distinct growth requirements however the simultaneous activation of both reactions is required for the efficient conversion of organic nitrogen to nitrate therefore separation of the reactors is a rational approach the microbiomes of reactors a and b were distinct from each other reflecting the different functions of the two reactors i e ammonification and nitrification fig 2a b 3a b furthermore it was found that the microbial compositions in the liquid phases of both reactors a and b were substantially altered during both short and long term operations whereas those of the carriers remained stable fig 2a 3a moreover after the 70 days of monitoring the system was continued to operate for more than a year and the microbial community in reactor b was analyzed on day 486 which demonstrated that the major members of the microbial community including comamox nitrospira were sufficiently maintained in the carriers fig s3 these results indicate that the application of the carrier successfully stabilized the microbiomes in the system although the microbial communities used in wastewater treatment fluctuate with environmental changes vuono et al 2015 sato et al 2019 sato et al 2020 the carriers used in this study contained an internal biofilm fig 1b the development of which can be advantageous for resident microbes by alleviating exposure to environmental changes as well as by inhibiting the growth of other microbes there have been several reports of nitrifying microbial communities being dominated by comammox nitrospira most of which were found in engineered systems such as drinking water treatment systems palomo et al 2016 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 and wastewater treatment systems camejo et al 2017 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 through these studies several environmental factors that could shape the comammox dominating microbiome have been proposed one is a low ammonia concentration koch et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 which could be explained by the remarkably high affinity of comammox nitrospira towards ammonia kits et al 2017 another factor is a low oxygen concentration roots et al 2019 the preference of comammox for low oxygen conditions has been predicted previously from kinetic theory and genomic analyses costa et al 2006 lücker et al 2010 lawson and lücker 2018 and has been examined experimentally roots et al 2019 camejo et al 2017 palomo et al 2018 however both the inlet ammonium concentration approximately 250 mg l 1 and do concentration 4 mg l 1 in our system were extremely high compared with previous studies it is unclear if this difference was due the physiology of the nitrospira detected in this study while the biofilm formed inside the cylindrical carrier might reduce the exposure of the nitrifiers to high concentrations of oxygen and ammonium in the system the coexistence and strong positive correlation between the otus of nitrospira and anaerolinea which are predicted to be anaerobic mcilroy et al 2017 were revealed by 16s rrna sequencing and a microbial co occurrence analysis fig 3 5 comammox nitrospira was originally found in biofilms daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 and most of the microbiomes in which comammox have subsequently been reported to predominate also occur in biofilms palomo et al 2016 camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 highlighting the likely presence of comammox nitrospira in relatively microaerobic biofilm environments moreover many of the otus identified in the microbial co occurrence analysis were phylogenetically similar to those found in the microbial communities of groundwater fed sand filters table s4 in which nitrospira was dominant and the otus affiliated with rhizobiales burkholderiales acidobacteria anaerolinea and xanthomonadacea were also found gülay et al 2016 palomo et al 2016 given the difficulty of obtaining a pure culture koch et al 2019 fujitani et al 2020 interactions with such microbes in biofilm communities may also support comammox nitrospira proliferation 5 conclusion since its discovery comammox nitrospira has been found in various environments daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 camejo et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 gülay et al 2019 kits et al 2019 koch et al 2019 roots et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 due to its unique metabolic capability industrial applications of comammox have attracted increasing attention although unintentional we successfully developed and stably operated a novel comammox driven nitrification system with highly efficient nitrification performance in terms of practical use dividing the system into two parts i e ammonification and nitrification and using the carriers are considered to be important for stable nitrate production from proteinous wastewater through the complementary use of 16s rrna gene sequencing shotgun metagenomics and a microbial co occurrence analysis we identified the presence of comammox nitrospira in the system and unveiled the ecophysiology of the comammox dominated microbial community although it was not described in this report we have already used the comammox produced nitrate solution as a hydroponic fertilizer for cultivating plants the findings reported here can be used to promote the use of comammox in industrial applications declaration of competing interest several authors on this manuscript

17033,while the ubiquitous presence of comammox in engineered systems provides the foundation of developing a novel biological nitrogen removal process factors contributing to the comammox dynamics in engineered systems have not been well resolved here we investigate the long term effects of ten different antibiotics on microbial community dynamics in activated sludge and the results show that both types and concentrations of antibiotics affect the taxonomic composition of nitrifiers including comammox ammonia oxidizing bacteria and canonical nitrite oxidizing bacteria specifically phylogenetically different comammox nitrospira were selectively enriched by four types of antibiotics i e ampicillin kanamycin lincomycin and trimethoprim comparative genomic analysis of the four newly identified comammox clade a nitrospira revealed that the comammox enriched by antibiotics shared the conserved key metabolic potentials such as carbon fixation complete ammonia oxidation and utilization of hydrogen as alternative electron donors among the known comammox organisms comammox strains enriched in this study also encoded genes involved in formate and cyanate metabolism that were recently reported in comammox clade a organisms from wastewater treatment systems our findings highlight that the comammox in activated sludge ecosystems possess high metabolic versatility than previously recognized and could be selectively enriched by some antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords comammox nitrospira antibiotics activated sludge metabolic versatility 1 introduction nitrification has been long thought to be mediated by two distinct microbial guilds ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers that respectively oxidize ammonia to nitrite and further oxidize nitrite to nitrate kuypers et al 2018 stein and klotz 2016 the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which convert ammonia to nitrate by a single microorganism further expanded our understanding of nitrification process to date all the reported comammox belong to nitrospira lineage ii daims et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the kinetic analysis of a comammox nitrospira confirmed their highly oligotrophic lifestyle kits et al 2017 which is in line with the ubiquitous distribution of comammox nitrospira in substrate limited ammonia environments such as coastal water xia et al 2018 acidic soils hu and he 2017 takahashi et al 2020 soils with low ammonium concentration he et al 2021 and drinking water systems fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 wang et al 2017 genetic potentials for energy metabolisms in the recovered comammox genomes and metagenome assembled genomes mags further supported their oligotrophic lifestyle daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 while comammox nitrospira were widespread and appeared to be a dominant nitrifier in oligotrophic environments comammox nitrospira have been identified in wastewater treatment systems under a relatively high concentration of ammonium however they generally displayed a lower abundance than canonical ammonia oxidizers chao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b roots et al 2019 reported that the comammox nitrospira could be enriched as the dominant ammonia oxidizers in a low dissolved oxygen nitrification reactor after more than 200 days operation cotto et al 2020 revealed that comammox could be found in full scale nitrogen removal systems with long solids retention times and attached growth phase in addition to the genetic abundance the ammonia oxidation activities of comammox nitrospira in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps were confirmed by in situ transcriptomic analysis yang et al 2020 the potential contribution of comammox to nitrification in drinking water fowler et al 2018 and wastewater treatment systems cotto et al 2020 suggested that the comammox driven community would be applied as an alternative energy efficient nitrification process by reducing aeration requirement however it remains poorly understood how comammox nitrospira can be selectively enriched from the complex microbial communities in wastewater treatment systems the profound and rapid effects of antibiotics on microbial communities have been observed from numerous ecosystems ranging from engineered systems annavajhala et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019a to natural systems baquero et al 2008 and human microbiome bokulich et al 2016 tamburini et al 2016 given the feature that antibiotics could simplify the taxonomic compositions in complex ecosystems various antibiotics have been used to purify and isolate microorganisms including ammonia oxidizing microorganisms lebedeva et al 2013 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria daims et al 2015 palatinszky et al 2015 we therefore hypothesize that comammox may also respond differently to antibiotics here we study our previous reported metagenomes of activated sludge as treated with 10 antibiotics i e ampicillin amp cephalexin cel chloramphenicol chl ciprofloxacin cip erythromycin ery kanamycin kan lincomycin lin sulfamethazine smz tetracycline tet and trimethoprim tmp under different concentrations the results show that amp kan lin and tmp selectively enrich comammox in as notably comammox nitrospira populations respond differently to the types and concentrations of antibiotics and show divergent dynamic patterns moreover genomic analyses of comammox recovered from the as ecosystems further confirmed that comammox nitrospira from wastewater treatment systems which might adapt to relatively eutrophic conditions appear to have high metabolic versatility 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples and metagenomic sequencing the studied as samples have been used in our previous projects to investigate how high antibiotic selection pressure shapes antibiotics resistance gene and mobility gene profiles in as ecosystem zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2020 the seed as and wastewater were collected from a local municipal wwtp in south china shenzhen china the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt of the source as aeration tank were 8 h and 5 6 days respectively briefly bench scale reactors with a working volume of 500 ml were initially inoculated with 50 ml as collected from the municipal wwtp the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel the real wastewater with total nitrogen tn concentration of 48 mg l was filtered using glass fiber membrane 0 22 µm pore size millipore usa to exclude the influence of microorganisms then trace elements for microbial growth and antibiotics were added to the filtered real wastewater to get the synthetic antibiotic wastewater the total organic carbon concentration and ph of this wastewater were maintained at approximately 50 mg l and 7 4 respectively these bench scale reactors were operated at room temperature 25 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 rpm during the whole experiment for aeration and mixing concentrations of different antibiotics used in the batch experiments were stepwise increased from initial concentration 20 or 30 mg l to final concentration table s1 if efficient antibiotic degradation was observed the liquid in each reactor was replaced with the same volume of synthetic antibiotic wastewater as the main organic carbon source however if no antibiotic degradation was observed the same procedure was also conducted to provide basic nutrients for microbial growth the concentration of antibiotics that were efficiently biodegraded was increased to a final concentration as shown in table s1 while those that were not obviously biodegraded were increased to a final concentration of 50 mg l the as samples taken from different experiment stages with different dosing concentrations of antibiotics table s1 for the shotgun sequencing were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform to generate 150 bp paired end reads with 350 bp insert size 2 2 sequence processing metagenomic sequencing of the 59 as samples table s1 generated approximately 933 2 gbp sequence data after quality control the clean reads average quality score 30 were screened against the manually constructed database of alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase amoa and alpha subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase pmoa amino acid sequences following our previous study wang et al 2017 to identify the amoa like sequences of comammox and canonical ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom the average coverage of amoa gene was estimated by the recruited amoa like sequences and further normalized to copy per gbp sequence data according to the comammox amoa gene abundance control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp that showed a relatively high abundance of comammox were further selected for metagenome assembly and genome binning the clean reads were co assembled using the clc s de novo assembly algorithm clc genomics workbench v6 04 clcbio qiagen with a k mer of 35 and a minimum scaffold length of 1 kbp a two dimensional coverage binning approach albertsen et al 2013 was used to retrieve the metagenome assembled genomes mags of the microorganisms from the as metagenomes completeness of the recovered mags was estimated using checkm v 1 0 7 parks et al 2015 the recovered mags of microorganisms in as were dereplicated using drep v2 4 0 with an ani cutoff of 99 and minimum completeness of 50 the relative abundance of the dereplicated mags across different as samples was estimated using coverm v0 4 0 https github com wwood coverm with default parameters the average amino acid identity aai and average nucleotide identity ani between newly recovered comammox nitrospira mags and reported comammox genome mags were determined using comparem v 0 0 23 https github com dparks1134 comparem and fastani v1 2 jain et al 2018 with default parameters respectively a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse v1 0 segata et al 2011 method was used to determine the microorganisms most likely to explain differences between the antibiotics i e amp kan lin and tmp affected microbial communities 2 3 genome annotation open reading frames orfs were predicted in the assembled scaffolds using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 all recovered comammox nitrospira mags were uploaded to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 for the preliminary reconstruction of metabolic traits also the mags were submitted to the integrated microbial genomes expert review img er markowitz et al 2009 system for comprehensive genome annotation completeness of kegg metabolic modules of the recovered mags was estimated by the annotate and classify functions of enrichm v0 5 0 https github com geronimp enrichm completeness of key metabolic modules such as amino acid nitrogen and vitamin metabolisms were manually curated according to the identified reaction steps and genes encoding key enzymes of the given metabolic module the predicted orfs of bacterial mags were used as queries in blastp camacho et al 2009 search against the structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg database v 2 0 with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 yin et al 2018 all the putative antibiotic resistance genes args hits were filtered at the cutoffs of identity 80 and query coverage 70 2 4 phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic assignment ammonia monooxygenase amo subunit alpha amoa beta amob and gamma amoc sequences of reported comammox nitrospira were collected for amo phylogenetic analysis amoa and amob amino acid sequences and amoc genes were aligned using muscle v3 8 31 edgar 2004 besides previously reported cyanase amino acid sequences were collected from ncbi public database to construct a phylogenetic tree of cyanase the phylogenetic trees of amino acid alignments and nucleotide alignments were inferred using fasttree v2 1 11 under the wag and gtr models respectively with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity a set of 120 bacterial maker genes from selected reference genomes and the dereplicated mags were classified using the identify module from gtdb tk v0 2 1 parks et al 2018 the identified marker genes were then aligned and concatenated using the align module from gtdb tk parks et al 2018 fasttree v2 1 11 price et al 2009 was then used to infer a genome tree based on the concatenated alignment of the identified markers genes under the wag gamma model all the genome trees were imported into itol letunic and bork 2016 for visualization and formatting 2 5 comparative genomic analysis principal coordinates analysis pcoa of microbial metabolic features was used to explore the metabolic variability in bacteria that were significantly selected by different antibiotics briefly a matrix regarding the completeness of kegg metabolic modules was summarized based on the annotation results the metabolic module that displayed completeness of 70 was considered as an incomplete pathway 3 results 3 1 selective enrichment of ammonia oxidizers by antibiotics the metagenomic screen revealed a distinct dynamic pattern of amoa like sequences in the metagenomes of as treated with different antibiotics suggesting that aom members responded differently to antibiotics fig 1 only comammox and aob amoa like sequences were identified in these as metagenomes indicating that aoa populations were not key players in the investigated as although a slight increase of comammox was observed at the early stage of the control group aob were found to be the most dominant aom in both seed sludge and control group without antibiotic treatment specifically these ten antibiotics can be assigned into three categories linked to the differentiation of comammox and aob dynamics aob were the most dominant aom in the as treated with cel and tet in contrast comammox in as treated with amp kan lin and tmp once clearly outnumbered aob especially considering the average of 2 5 copies of amoa gene per aob genome and 1 copy of amoa gene per comammox genome horak et al 2018 chl cip ery and smz inhibited both comammox and aob besides the antibiotic type antibiotic concentration is another driving force shaping aom communities in as samples for example the relative abundance of comammox increased in the as samples that were continuously treated with relatively low concentrations of amp and lin while the further treatment with higher antibiotic concentrations inhibited the growth of comammox fig 1 and table s1 the relative abundances of comammox and aob correlated positively with the increasing concentrations of kan and tet respectively on the other hand tmp did not inhibit aob and comammox under the studied concentrations it should be noted however that the dynamics of aom were interpreted in view of relative abundance which cannot indicate the changes of absolute cell numbers in as microbial communities therefore the observed enrichment is a relative enrichment of given aom under the treatment of antibiotics 3 2 recovery of comammox clade a nitrospira metagenomic analysis of control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp recovered 302 bacterial mags table s2 including six comammox nitrospira mags the comammox mags retrieved from the control as and lin treated samples are almost identical aai 99 99 to the mag retrieved from the tmp treated samples the mag with the best genome quality was then retained for the downstream analyses these comammox nitrospira were provisionally named nitrospira sp amp bin1 nitrospira sp kan bin1 nitrospira sp kan bin2 and nitrospira sp ctrl lin tmp bin1 three of them i e kan bin1 kan bin2 and ctrl lin tmp bin1 are high quality genomes based on the previously proposed standard for mags table 1 bowers et al 2017 the pairwise comparison of the newly recovered comammox mags with 28 previously reported comammox nitrospira genomes showed that the maximum ani values for these genomes were far below the defined species cutoff of 95 table s3 jain et al 2018 indicating that these four newly recovered comammox mags are novel species however aai values between these newly recovered mags and several previously reported comammox genomes were above the defined species cutoff of 85 aai luo et al 2014 according to the inferred phylogenetic tree of amoa fig 2 and amob amino acid sequences figure s1 these four newly recovered comammox nitrospira were affiliated with the comammox clade a in line with the previous studies the alpha subunit of nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nxra and amoc genes from the same comammox nitrospira do not form a monophyletic group figures s2 and s3 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 3 3 antibiotics select phylogenetically distant comammox nitrospira in addition to the different temporal dynamic patterns of aom shaped by antibiotics fig 1 the trees inferred by amoa amino acid sequences fig 2 and genome figure s4 both revealed that the different antibiotics might select phylogenetically distinct comammox nitrospira the comammox in control lin and tmp treated as are identical ctrl lin tmp bin1 but distant to the comammox nitrospira enriched in as treated with amp amp bin1 and kan kan bin1 and kan bin2 amp bin1 and kan bin1 showed a close phylogenetic relationship and belonged to the same monophyletic group which includes nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrosa and ca nitrospira nitrificans two phylogenomic different comammox nitrospira i e kan bin1 and kan bin2 were simultaneously enriched by kan after 3 month treatment however the further treatment of kan with increased concentration enabled kan bin1 to outcompete kan bin2 and became the most abundant comammox with a relative abundance of 2 8 figure s4 the most abundant comammox ctrl lin tmp bin1 in control as and as treated with lin and tmp was a rare population in the as treated with amp and kan table s5 indicating the selective enrichment of comammox by different antibiotics interestingly the relative abundance of abundant comammox in tmp treated samples only slightly changed with time while the canonical nob tmp bin3 and aob fig 1 displayed a remarkable increase 3 4 conserved metabolic features of the newly recovered comammox nitrospira comammox selected by antibiotics may perform complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate as evidenced by the identified gene sets for ammonia oxidation amo k10944 10946 and hao k10535 and nitrite oxidation nxr k00370 and k00371 table s4 despite the absence of amoc gene in kan bin2 this comammox nitrospira contains all the other key genes involved in ammonia oxidation suggesting that the amoc gene was not binned into mag because of the multicopy of amoc genes in comammox nitrospira as expected these four comammox clade a nitrospira encoded rh type ammonia transporters k06580 that are found in most β aob and reported to have high ammonium uptake capacity weidinger et al 2007 in addition to ammonia the four comammox nitrospira also have genes encoding urease k01428 and k01430 except kan bin2 urease accessory protein uref k03188 ureg k03189 ured k03190 and related urea transport system k11959 11963 indicating the capability to use urea as exogenous ammonia these four comammox nitrospira contain group 3b nife hydrogenase and related factors for hydrogenase maturation k03605 and k04656 except ctrl lin tmp bin1 which was in line with the previously reported comammox clade a genomes palomo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 like other canonical and comammox nitrospira genes for key enzymes involved in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca daims et al 2015 daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 such as atp citrate lyase k15230 and k15231 pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase k00169 00172 fumarate reductase k00239 00241 were identified in the four comammox nitrospira mags suggesting that these newly recovered comammox organisms also fix co2 via rtca also complete glycolysis gluconeogenesis and non oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were identified in these newly recovered comammox mags ctrl lin tmp bin1 contained the complete tricarboxylic acid cycle tca pathway while gene encoding 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase k00164 was not identified in the other three comammox mags which might be due to the incompleteness of these three mags table 1 as for the response to environmental stress these newly recovered comammox nitrospira also encoded genes for reactive oxygen stress defense such as superoxide dismutase sod k04564 peroxiredoxin k03564 and hemoglobin k06886 furthermore kan bin2 also showed the potential to detoxify arsenite by encoding genes for arsenite k03325 transporters and arsenate reductase k03741 and k00537 that have been found in other comammox nitrospira and several sublineage ii nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 copper resistance protein copb k07233 copc k07156 and copd k07245 associated with higher copper tolerance or increased copper uptake were identified in the newly recovered comammox mags which may be in line with the requirement of copper related ammonia monooxygenase poghosyan et al 2019 3 5 high functional diversity of comammox nitrospira in wastewater treatment systems consistent with other reported comammox nitrospira daims et al 2015 daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 genes related to complex i v of electron transport chain were identified in the newly recovered comammox mags the comammox mag ctrl lin tmp bin1 encoded genes of cytochrome bd complex cydab genes k00425 and k00426 which have been identified in canonical nitrospira except cg24 d palomo et al 2018 and comammox clade a genomes except ca nitrospira nitrosa despite the absence of genes related to cydab in the other three comammox nitrospira genes encoding subunit ii of cytochrome c oxidase cbb3 type ccop k00406 were found in these comammox organisms and showed high identities 82 3 90 8 with a homolog ccop from ca nitrospira nitrosa that recovered from a bioreactor the newly recovered comammox nitrospira showed metabolic potentials to utilize various organic substrates one comammox nitrospira kan bin2 contained genes encoding nadp dependent formate dehydrogenase alpha subunit fdha k05299 formate dehydrogenase major subunit fdog k00123 and assembly factor fdhd k02379 these genes involved in formate metabolism have just been reported in two comammox nitrospira i e nitrospira sp rca and ca nitrospira sp lk70 recovered from terrestrial subsurface poghosyan et al 2019 and full scale activated sludge systems yang et al 2020 respectively genes for 4 oxalocrotonate tautomerase k01821 identified in comammox clade b which was involved in the conversion of aromatic compounds to intermediates for the tca cycle were identified in one comammox clade a mag i e kan bin2 the best hit identity of 88 1 of this gene to comammox nitrospira was identified in a recently reported comammox clade b genome nitrospira sp cg24a palomo et al 2018 it has been reported that canonical nob lucker et al 2010 starkenburg et al 2006 several strains from aoa kitzinger et al 2019 palatinszky et al 2015 and anammox bacteria ganesh et al 2018 could utilize cyanate under the catalysis of cyanate hydratase cyanase genomic analyses of three recently reported comammox clade a members further revealed that some of this complete ammonia oxidizer might possess the capability to utilize cyanate as an energy source and convert cyanate via ammonia to nitrate yang et al 2020 intriguingly two comammox mags kan bin2 and ctrl lin tmp bin1 also encoded the cyanase genes cyns k01725 ctrl lin tmp bin1 cyanase genes showed close phylogenetic relationships with a homolog from one clade a comammox lk70 yang et al 2020 recovered from a full scale activated sludge system the cyanase gene identified in kan bin2 by contrast was most similar to gene from one comammox clade a nitrospira nitrospira sp rbc069 spasov et al 2020 recovered from a full scale rotating biological contactor rbc the comammox cyanase amino acid sequences appear to form a sister lineage of the genus nitrospira fig 3 similar to the previously reported comammox encoded cyns the two comammox in the present study also lacked genes encoding traditional cyanate transporters cynabd the cyanate diffusion through biological membranes might enable bacteria to utilize extracellular cyanate moreover genes for nitrate nitrite transporter nark k02575 identified in the comammox might act as cyanate transporter palatinszky et al 2015 3 6 microbial community specific patterns shaped by antibiotics considering the differential dynamics of comammox nitrospira under the treatment of antibiotics we further studied whether these comammox organisms encoded args associated with the resistance to different antibiotics the gene annotation result revealed that no specific arg was identified in any of these newly recovered comammox nitrospira suggesting that the antibiotics might create different ecological niches and select distinct bacterial communities such differential community compositions then selectively enriched comammox nitrospira via microbial interactions we then studied whether and how microbial communities differ across as treated with different antibiotics the 302 bacterial mags recovered from control and antibiotics treated as metagenomes represented the majority of the microbial community recruiting an average of 65 0 of the shotgun reads table s5 although the bacterial mags recovered from the control group were included this genome catalog only represented 8 8 of the seed sludge community indicating that the operation of the lab scale reactors cannot fully simulate the condition of full scale wwtps compared with the control group antibiotics created distinct environmental niches and selected the rare populations that could adapt to the external disturbance statistical analysis lefse v1 0 further identified 17 19 9 27 and 20 bacteria that were significantly enriched in the control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp fig 4 respectively the statistically different populations identified in a given antibiotics treated as sample exhibited apparent niche specificity after long term treatment 5 months representing 40 3 of the recovered microbial communities but only accounted for 10 1 of the recovered communities in other antibiotics treated samples table s5 microbial communities of as treated with the same antibiotics generally clustered together except lin and were highly divergent from the control sludge community suggesting antibiotic treatment is a key factor that shaped the microbial assemblages fig 5 a moreover the higher similarities between parallel as microbial communities except kan suggested the reproducibility between biological replicates phylogenetic analysis revealed that the significantly enriched populations from as microbial communities treated with different antibiotics displayed distinct taxonomic compositions fig 4 the dominant bacteria average relative abundance 2 0 in as microbial communities treated with amp prot amp 45 54 60 92 and 98 kan prot kan 30 73 and 75 and tmp prot tmp 41 68 and 107 were affiliated with the proteobacteria fig 4 and table s6 but within different genera table s6 in contrast the dominant bacteria in the control group and lin treated as samples showed taxonomically diverse and were affiliated with the proteobacteria and bacteroidota moreover most of the dominant bacteria within the microbial community treated with antibiotics were phylogenetically clustered for example most of the dominant bacteria in amp kan lin treated as were affiliated with burkholderiaceae thauera and rudaea respectively in addition to the taxonomic diversity kegg metabolic module based comparison of these statistically different bacteria fig 5b showed the metabolic diversity of the communities selected by antibiotics several dominant bacteria in the control prot ctrl 44 and 40 and amp prot amp 45 and 54 and kan treated as prot kan 73 and 75 shared similar traits at the global metabolic scale and clustered together but were highly divergent from the dominant bacteria in lin prot lin 97 99 100 and 101 and tmp treated prot tmp 107 and 68 samples specifically these abundant bacteria significantly enriched in as treated with amp and kan tend to process more metabolic pathways involved in saccharide polyol lipid peptide amino acid metabolisms and transport than the dominant bacteria in lin and tmp treated as figure s5 besides the convergent pattern of these dominant bacteria the other microbial community members in particular for the relatively low abundant populations selected by antibiotics revealed divergence in the metabolic traits fig 5b as reported in our previous works zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a these antibiotics showed selective effects on comammox exhibited different removal characteristics nearly all amp and lin could be biodegraded at different stages while kan and tmp were hardly biodegraded in the reactors except the adsorption process found in kan treated as at the first stage 20 mg l genes encoding multidrug efflux transporters were identified in these abundant bacteria with average relative abundances 0 5 indicating that the abundant microorganisms might adopt a set of strategies to respond to the addition of antibiotics table s7 however the genes that were specifically related to the resistance to amp kan lin or tmp were not identified in these microorganisms noteworthy approximately 80 of bacteria carrying args were rare populations with average relative abundances 0 5 across all the as samples in addition to numbers of genes for drug efflux pumps genes specifically related to the resistance to amp beta lactamase bla kan aminoglycoside n acetyltransferases aada aac 2 i aph 3 i aph 6 i lin erythromycin ribosome methylase erm and tmp trimethoprim resistant dihydrofolate reductase dfr could be found in some of these low abundant mags table s7 these bacteria encoding args specific to the supplied antibiotics were however not significantly enriched in the corresponding antibiotics treated as microbial communities besides comammox nitrospira five aob nitrosomonas mags and five canonical nob nitrospira mags were recovered from the as metagenomes confirmed the coexistence of comammox nitrospira with other canonical nitrifying organisms long term treatment of amp and tmp selectively enriched two different dominant aob i e prot amp 66 and prot tmp 68 respectively however these two aob were nearly undetectable in the control samples in which another two aob prot ctrl 64 and 65 were significantly enriched table s5 for example prot tmp 68 was almost undetectable in the control samples and as treated with amp and kan relative abundance 0 1 it whereas became the most abundant bacteria with a relative abundance of 6 6 after approximately 5 month treatment of tmp table s5 also this selective enrichment was observed regarding the dominant nob in the as samples treated with different antibiotics table s5 these results suggested that the canonical nitrifiers also respond differently to antibiotics 4 discussion 4 1 selective pressure of antibiotics on microbial community assembly how comammox nitrospira could be selectively enriched by abiotic factors is critical in ecological studies of comammox organisms our study of microbial communities in as systems treated with 10 different antibiotics suggested that antibiotics could be a driving force to enrich comammox in the previous works daims et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2013 palatinszky et al 2015 antibiotics that are active against gram positive bacteria e g vancomycin penicillin g gram negative bacteria e g kanamycin or both gram positive and negative bacteria e g bacitracin and ampicillin were used to further simplify the primary enrichments of aob or aoa communities although antibiotics have been demonstrated to have adverse effects on the abundance and activity of aob in soil and biological wastewater treatment systems schauss et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 the low concentration of antibiotics could enhance the nitrification process in biofilm reactor and sludge system campos et al 2001 xia et al 2019 a recently published work demonstrated that low concentration of lin µg l could be co metabolically biotransformed by aoa and comammox zhou et al 2021 marker genes of aom and community analyses in the present study revealed that both antibiotic types and concentrations differentiated the dynamic pattern of these functional microorganisms compared with the seed sludge and the control group it is notable that kan and tmp enriched comammox from the complex microbial communities fig 1 besides amp and lin could selectively enrich comammox over canonical aob under low concentrations remarkable inhibition of aob and comammox by chl cip ery and smz also suggested that the effects of antibiotics on aom are divergent from each other besides the dynamic pattern of aom analysis of microbial communities further demonstrated that antibiotics specifically shaped microbial assemblages which was consistent with the observations of antibiotics shaping microbial compositions in natural ecosystems and human gut cleary et al 2016 yassour et al 2016 such differential treatment of antibiotics may create different ecological dependencies as evidenced by the divergent nitrogen cycle related microorganisms and microbial community structures figs 4 and 5a while the dominant populations did not contain args specific to the studied antibiotics these microorganisms might actively export antibiotics out of the cell using multidrug efflux pumps and achieve resistance to antibiotics the args identified in a notable number of low abundant bacteria indicated that rare populations might be of critical importance in developing the microbial community in the biological samples treated with antibiotics furthermore the antibiotics that selected the dominant microorganisms with similar metabolic potentials i e amp and kan also enriched comammox species sharing close phylogenetically relationships and metabolic potentials figs 2 and 5b suggesting that antibiotics could expedite the formation of entrenched microbiota with a complex community specific interaction 4 2 metabolic diversity of comammox nitrospira to date all the known comammox belong to nitrospira lineage ii as expected the newly recovered comammox nitrospira in the present study shared key metabolic potentials such as complete ammonia oxidation microaerophilic related rtca carbon fixation utilization of hydrogen and urea with previously reported comammox clade a members daims et al 2016 koch et al 2015 poghosyan et al 2019 ushiki et al 2018 some features such as the utilization of organic components and fermentation reported in some canonical nob species were also found in this novel nitrifier palomo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 a dozen of comammox nitrospira mags have so far been reported in wastewater treatment systems including rotating biological contactors and activated sludge systems genomic analysis of the newly recovered mags in the present study together with the previously reported comammox nitrospira from wastewater treatment systems spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 suggested that comammox clade a exhibit higher functional diversity than previously recognized while most of the reported comammox clade a nitrospira contain genes for cytochrome bd like heme copper oxidase genes for subunits of c family oxygen reductases ccop identified in the newly recovered comammox suggested that some comammox may evolve alternative complex iv associated with low oxygen level aerobic respiration the potential of formate uptake and oxidation were once identified in nitrospira moscoviensis and comammox clade b koch et al 2015 palomo et al 2018 our comammox mag kan bin1 and the two recently reported comammox nitrospira nitrospira sp rca and ca nitrospira sp lk70 poghosyan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 together confirmed that comammox clade a if not all may also use formate as an alternative electron donor besides the identified gene related to carbon metabolism oxalocrotonate tautomerase in the recovered comammox clade a mag kan bin2 further suggested the broader distribution of some metabolic potentials conserved in comammox clade b than previously anticipated distinct cyanase genes identified in comammox clade a mags greatly changed the taxonomic diversity of ammonia oxidizers that could utilize cyanate as alternative substrates for ammonia oxidation spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 interestingly all these reported comammox with high metabolic versatility were identified in wastewater treatment systems suggesting that such versatility should be advantageous for the comammox in the complex biofilm and as ecosystems particularly considering the high organic contents of influent microbial diversity and biomass density in these ecosystems daims et al 2006 as the activities of microbial community members and nitrogen concentrations in the bench scale reactors were not studied in the present study it remains unknown whether these newly retrieved comammox nitrospira play important roles in the nitrogen removal process more studies will be needed to investigate the activity of comammox in wastewater treatment systems and validate the functional diversity revealed by genome centric analysis 5 conclusion this study sheds light on how comammox could be enriched in complex as ecosystems under the treatment of antibiotics which could guide the future enrichment of comammox from environmental samples comammox clade a nitrospira in the as could be selectively enriched by amp kan lin and tmp these antibiotics specifically shaped microbial assemblages that selectively enriched phylogenetically distant comammox nitrospira via yet unknown microbial interactions such findings will be applied to get lab scale enrichment of comammox community which might be required to investigate how comammox respond to changes in operational conditions and evaluate the role of comammox nitrospira for nitrification under different conditions subsequently operational strategies to maximize the activity of comammox nitrospira in biological wastewater treatment systems could be developed moreover our findings demonstrated that wastewater treatment systems might be a unique ecological niche harboring comammox nitrospira with high metabolic versatility the present study provides a clue to further investigate the feasibility of using comammox enriched communities as a promising option for nitrogen removal from wastewater data availability the bacterial mags recovered in the present study have been deposited at ncbi under bioproject accession number prjna694732

17033,while the ubiquitous presence of comammox in engineered systems provides the foundation of developing a novel biological nitrogen removal process factors contributing to the comammox dynamics in engineered systems have not been well resolved here we investigate the long term effects of ten different antibiotics on microbial community dynamics in activated sludge and the results show that both types and concentrations of antibiotics affect the taxonomic composition of nitrifiers including comammox ammonia oxidizing bacteria and canonical nitrite oxidizing bacteria specifically phylogenetically different comammox nitrospira were selectively enriched by four types of antibiotics i e ampicillin kanamycin lincomycin and trimethoprim comparative genomic analysis of the four newly identified comammox clade a nitrospira revealed that the comammox enriched by antibiotics shared the conserved key metabolic potentials such as carbon fixation complete ammonia oxidation and utilization of hydrogen as alternative electron donors among the known comammox organisms comammox strains enriched in this study also encoded genes involved in formate and cyanate metabolism that were recently reported in comammox clade a organisms from wastewater treatment systems our findings highlight that the comammox in activated sludge ecosystems possess high metabolic versatility than previously recognized and could be selectively enriched by some antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords comammox nitrospira antibiotics activated sludge metabolic versatility 1 introduction nitrification has been long thought to be mediated by two distinct microbial guilds ammonia oxidizers and nitrite oxidizers that respectively oxidize ammonia to nitrite and further oxidize nitrite to nitrate kuypers et al 2018 stein and klotz 2016 the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 which convert ammonia to nitrate by a single microorganism further expanded our understanding of nitrification process to date all the reported comammox belong to nitrospira lineage ii daims et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the kinetic analysis of a comammox nitrospira confirmed their highly oligotrophic lifestyle kits et al 2017 which is in line with the ubiquitous distribution of comammox nitrospira in substrate limited ammonia environments such as coastal water xia et al 2018 acidic soils hu and he 2017 takahashi et al 2020 soils with low ammonium concentration he et al 2021 and drinking water systems fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 pinto et al 2016 wang et al 2017 genetic potentials for energy metabolisms in the recovered comammox genomes and metagenome assembled genomes mags further supported their oligotrophic lifestyle daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 while comammox nitrospira were widespread and appeared to be a dominant nitrifier in oligotrophic environments comammox nitrospira have been identified in wastewater treatment systems under a relatively high concentration of ammonium however they generally displayed a lower abundance than canonical ammonia oxidizers chao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b roots et al 2019 reported that the comammox nitrospira could be enriched as the dominant ammonia oxidizers in a low dissolved oxygen nitrification reactor after more than 200 days operation cotto et al 2020 revealed that comammox could be found in full scale nitrogen removal systems with long solids retention times and attached growth phase in addition to the genetic abundance the ammonia oxidation activities of comammox nitrospira in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps were confirmed by in situ transcriptomic analysis yang et al 2020 the potential contribution of comammox to nitrification in drinking water fowler et al 2018 and wastewater treatment systems cotto et al 2020 suggested that the comammox driven community would be applied as an alternative energy efficient nitrification process by reducing aeration requirement however it remains poorly understood how comammox nitrospira can be selectively enriched from the complex microbial communities in wastewater treatment systems the profound and rapid effects of antibiotics on microbial communities have been observed from numerous ecosystems ranging from engineered systems annavajhala et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2019a to natural systems baquero et al 2008 and human microbiome bokulich et al 2016 tamburini et al 2016 given the feature that antibiotics could simplify the taxonomic compositions in complex ecosystems various antibiotics have been used to purify and isolate microorganisms including ammonia oxidizing microorganisms lebedeva et al 2013 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria daims et al 2015 palatinszky et al 2015 we therefore hypothesize that comammox may also respond differently to antibiotics here we study our previous reported metagenomes of activated sludge as treated with 10 antibiotics i e ampicillin amp cephalexin cel chloramphenicol chl ciprofloxacin cip erythromycin ery kanamycin kan lincomycin lin sulfamethazine smz tetracycline tet and trimethoprim tmp under different concentrations the results show that amp kan lin and tmp selectively enrich comammox in as notably comammox nitrospira populations respond differently to the types and concentrations of antibiotics and show divergent dynamic patterns moreover genomic analyses of comammox recovered from the as ecosystems further confirmed that comammox nitrospira from wastewater treatment systems which might adapt to relatively eutrophic conditions appear to have high metabolic versatility 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge samples and metagenomic sequencing the studied as samples have been used in our previous projects to investigate how high antibiotic selection pressure shapes antibiotics resistance gene and mobility gene profiles in as ecosystem zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2020 the seed as and wastewater were collected from a local municipal wwtp in south china shenzhen china the hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt of the source as aeration tank were 8 h and 5 6 days respectively briefly bench scale reactors with a working volume of 500 ml were initially inoculated with 50 ml as collected from the municipal wwtp the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel the real wastewater with total nitrogen tn concentration of 48 mg l was filtered using glass fiber membrane 0 22 µm pore size millipore usa to exclude the influence of microorganisms then trace elements for microbial growth and antibiotics were added to the filtered real wastewater to get the synthetic antibiotic wastewater the total organic carbon concentration and ph of this wastewater were maintained at approximately 50 mg l and 7 4 respectively these bench scale reactors were operated at room temperature 25 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 rpm during the whole experiment for aeration and mixing concentrations of different antibiotics used in the batch experiments were stepwise increased from initial concentration 20 or 30 mg l to final concentration table s1 if efficient antibiotic degradation was observed the liquid in each reactor was replaced with the same volume of synthetic antibiotic wastewater as the main organic carbon source however if no antibiotic degradation was observed the same procedure was also conducted to provide basic nutrients for microbial growth the concentration of antibiotics that were efficiently biodegraded was increased to a final concentration as shown in table s1 while those that were not obviously biodegraded were increased to a final concentration of 50 mg l the as samples taken from different experiment stages with different dosing concentrations of antibiotics table s1 for the shotgun sequencing were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform to generate 150 bp paired end reads with 350 bp insert size 2 2 sequence processing metagenomic sequencing of the 59 as samples table s1 generated approximately 933 2 gbp sequence data after quality control the clean reads average quality score 30 were screened against the manually constructed database of alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase amoa and alpha subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase pmoa amino acid sequences following our previous study wang et al 2017 to identify the amoa like sequences of comammox and canonical ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom the average coverage of amoa gene was estimated by the recruited amoa like sequences and further normalized to copy per gbp sequence data according to the comammox amoa gene abundance control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp that showed a relatively high abundance of comammox were further selected for metagenome assembly and genome binning the clean reads were co assembled using the clc s de novo assembly algorithm clc genomics workbench v6 04 clcbio qiagen with a k mer of 35 and a minimum scaffold length of 1 kbp a two dimensional coverage binning approach albertsen et al 2013 was used to retrieve the metagenome assembled genomes mags of the microorganisms from the as metagenomes completeness of the recovered mags was estimated using checkm v 1 0 7 parks et al 2015 the recovered mags of microorganisms in as were dereplicated using drep v2 4 0 with an ani cutoff of 99 and minimum completeness of 50 the relative abundance of the dereplicated mags across different as samples was estimated using coverm v0 4 0 https github com wwood coverm with default parameters the average amino acid identity aai and average nucleotide identity ani between newly recovered comammox nitrospira mags and reported comammox genome mags were determined using comparem v 0 0 23 https github com dparks1134 comparem and fastani v1 2 jain et al 2018 with default parameters respectively a linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse v1 0 segata et al 2011 method was used to determine the microorganisms most likely to explain differences between the antibiotics i e amp kan lin and tmp affected microbial communities 2 3 genome annotation open reading frames orfs were predicted in the assembled scaffolds using prodigal v2 6 3 hyatt et al 2010 all recovered comammox nitrospira mags were uploaded to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 for the preliminary reconstruction of metabolic traits also the mags were submitted to the integrated microbial genomes expert review img er markowitz et al 2009 system for comprehensive genome annotation completeness of kegg metabolic modules of the recovered mags was estimated by the annotate and classify functions of enrichm v0 5 0 https github com geronimp enrichm completeness of key metabolic modules such as amino acid nitrogen and vitamin metabolisms were manually curated according to the identified reaction steps and genes encoding key enzymes of the given metabolic module the predicted orfs of bacterial mags were used as queries in blastp camacho et al 2009 search against the structured antibiotic resistance genes sarg database v 2 0 with an e value cutoff of 1e 10 yin et al 2018 all the putative antibiotic resistance genes args hits were filtered at the cutoffs of identity 80 and query coverage 70 2 4 phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic assignment ammonia monooxygenase amo subunit alpha amoa beta amob and gamma amoc sequences of reported comammox nitrospira were collected for amo phylogenetic analysis amoa and amob amino acid sequences and amoc genes were aligned using muscle v3 8 31 edgar 2004 besides previously reported cyanase amino acid sequences were collected from ncbi public database to construct a phylogenetic tree of cyanase the phylogenetic trees of amino acid alignments and nucleotide alignments were inferred using fasttree v2 1 11 under the wag and gtr models respectively with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity a set of 120 bacterial maker genes from selected reference genomes and the dereplicated mags were classified using the identify module from gtdb tk v0 2 1 parks et al 2018 the identified marker genes were then aligned and concatenated using the align module from gtdb tk parks et al 2018 fasttree v2 1 11 price et al 2009 was then used to infer a genome tree based on the concatenated alignment of the identified markers genes under the wag gamma model all the genome trees were imported into itol letunic and bork 2016 for visualization and formatting 2 5 comparative genomic analysis principal coordinates analysis pcoa of microbial metabolic features was used to explore the metabolic variability in bacteria that were significantly selected by different antibiotics briefly a matrix regarding the completeness of kegg metabolic modules was summarized based on the annotation results the metabolic module that displayed completeness of 70 was considered as an incomplete pathway 3 results 3 1 selective enrichment of ammonia oxidizers by antibiotics the metagenomic screen revealed a distinct dynamic pattern of amoa like sequences in the metagenomes of as treated with different antibiotics suggesting that aom members responded differently to antibiotics fig 1 only comammox and aob amoa like sequences were identified in these as metagenomes indicating that aoa populations were not key players in the investigated as although a slight increase of comammox was observed at the early stage of the control group aob were found to be the most dominant aom in both seed sludge and control group without antibiotic treatment specifically these ten antibiotics can be assigned into three categories linked to the differentiation of comammox and aob dynamics aob were the most dominant aom in the as treated with cel and tet in contrast comammox in as treated with amp kan lin and tmp once clearly outnumbered aob especially considering the average of 2 5 copies of amoa gene per aob genome and 1 copy of amoa gene per comammox genome horak et al 2018 chl cip ery and smz inhibited both comammox and aob besides the antibiotic type antibiotic concentration is another driving force shaping aom communities in as samples for example the relative abundance of comammox increased in the as samples that were continuously treated with relatively low concentrations of amp and lin while the further treatment with higher antibiotic concentrations inhibited the growth of comammox fig 1 and table s1 the relative abundances of comammox and aob correlated positively with the increasing concentrations of kan and tet respectively on the other hand tmp did not inhibit aob and comammox under the studied concentrations it should be noted however that the dynamics of aom were interpreted in view of relative abundance which cannot indicate the changes of absolute cell numbers in as microbial communities therefore the observed enrichment is a relative enrichment of given aom under the treatment of antibiotics 3 2 recovery of comammox clade a nitrospira metagenomic analysis of control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp recovered 302 bacterial mags table s2 including six comammox nitrospira mags the comammox mags retrieved from the control as and lin treated samples are almost identical aai 99 99 to the mag retrieved from the tmp treated samples the mag with the best genome quality was then retained for the downstream analyses these comammox nitrospira were provisionally named nitrospira sp amp bin1 nitrospira sp kan bin1 nitrospira sp kan bin2 and nitrospira sp ctrl lin tmp bin1 three of them i e kan bin1 kan bin2 and ctrl lin tmp bin1 are high quality genomes based on the previously proposed standard for mags table 1 bowers et al 2017 the pairwise comparison of the newly recovered comammox mags with 28 previously reported comammox nitrospira genomes showed that the maximum ani values for these genomes were far below the defined species cutoff of 95 table s3 jain et al 2018 indicating that these four newly recovered comammox mags are novel species however aai values between these newly recovered mags and several previously reported comammox genomes were above the defined species cutoff of 85 aai luo et al 2014 according to the inferred phylogenetic tree of amoa fig 2 and amob amino acid sequences figure s1 these four newly recovered comammox nitrospira were affiliated with the comammox clade a in line with the previous studies the alpha subunit of nitrite oxidoreductase nxr nxra and amoc genes from the same comammox nitrospira do not form a monophyletic group figures s2 and s3 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 3 3 antibiotics select phylogenetically distant comammox nitrospira in addition to the different temporal dynamic patterns of aom shaped by antibiotics fig 1 the trees inferred by amoa amino acid sequences fig 2 and genome figure s4 both revealed that the different antibiotics might select phylogenetically distinct comammox nitrospira the comammox in control lin and tmp treated as are identical ctrl lin tmp bin1 but distant to the comammox nitrospira enriched in as treated with amp amp bin1 and kan kan bin1 and kan bin2 amp bin1 and kan bin1 showed a close phylogenetic relationship and belonged to the same monophyletic group which includes nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrosa and ca nitrospira nitrificans two phylogenomic different comammox nitrospira i e kan bin1 and kan bin2 were simultaneously enriched by kan after 3 month treatment however the further treatment of kan with increased concentration enabled kan bin1 to outcompete kan bin2 and became the most abundant comammox with a relative abundance of 2 8 figure s4 the most abundant comammox ctrl lin tmp bin1 in control as and as treated with lin and tmp was a rare population in the as treated with amp and kan table s5 indicating the selective enrichment of comammox by different antibiotics interestingly the relative abundance of abundant comammox in tmp treated samples only slightly changed with time while the canonical nob tmp bin3 and aob fig 1 displayed a remarkable increase 3 4 conserved metabolic features of the newly recovered comammox nitrospira comammox selected by antibiotics may perform complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate as evidenced by the identified gene sets for ammonia oxidation amo k10944 10946 and hao k10535 and nitrite oxidation nxr k00370 and k00371 table s4 despite the absence of amoc gene in kan bin2 this comammox nitrospira contains all the other key genes involved in ammonia oxidation suggesting that the amoc gene was not binned into mag because of the multicopy of amoc genes in comammox nitrospira as expected these four comammox clade a nitrospira encoded rh type ammonia transporters k06580 that are found in most β aob and reported to have high ammonium uptake capacity weidinger et al 2007 in addition to ammonia the four comammox nitrospira also have genes encoding urease k01428 and k01430 except kan bin2 urease accessory protein uref k03188 ureg k03189 ured k03190 and related urea transport system k11959 11963 indicating the capability to use urea as exogenous ammonia these four comammox nitrospira contain group 3b nife hydrogenase and related factors for hydrogenase maturation k03605 and k04656 except ctrl lin tmp bin1 which was in line with the previously reported comammox clade a genomes palomo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 like other canonical and comammox nitrospira genes for key enzymes involved in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca daims et al 2015 daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 such as atp citrate lyase k15230 and k15231 pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase k00169 00172 fumarate reductase k00239 00241 were identified in the four comammox nitrospira mags suggesting that these newly recovered comammox organisms also fix co2 via rtca also complete glycolysis gluconeogenesis and non oxidative pentose phosphate pathways were identified in these newly recovered comammox mags ctrl lin tmp bin1 contained the complete tricarboxylic acid cycle tca pathway while gene encoding 2 oxoglutarate dehydrogenase k00164 was not identified in the other three comammox mags which might be due to the incompleteness of these three mags table 1 as for the response to environmental stress these newly recovered comammox nitrospira also encoded genes for reactive oxygen stress defense such as superoxide dismutase sod k04564 peroxiredoxin k03564 and hemoglobin k06886 furthermore kan bin2 also showed the potential to detoxify arsenite by encoding genes for arsenite k03325 transporters and arsenate reductase k03741 and k00537 that have been found in other comammox nitrospira and several sublineage ii nitrospira poghosyan et al 2019 copper resistance protein copb k07233 copc k07156 and copd k07245 associated with higher copper tolerance or increased copper uptake were identified in the newly recovered comammox mags which may be in line with the requirement of copper related ammonia monooxygenase poghosyan et al 2019 3 5 high functional diversity of comammox nitrospira in wastewater treatment systems consistent with other reported comammox nitrospira daims et al 2015 daims et al 2016 palomo et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2019 spasov et al 2020 van kessel et al 2015 yang et al 2020 genes related to complex i v of electron transport chain were identified in the newly recovered comammox mags the comammox mag ctrl lin tmp bin1 encoded genes of cytochrome bd complex cydab genes k00425 and k00426 which have been identified in canonical nitrospira except cg24 d palomo et al 2018 and comammox clade a genomes except ca nitrospira nitrosa despite the absence of genes related to cydab in the other three comammox nitrospira genes encoding subunit ii of cytochrome c oxidase cbb3 type ccop k00406 were found in these comammox organisms and showed high identities 82 3 90 8 with a homolog ccop from ca nitrospira nitrosa that recovered from a bioreactor the newly recovered comammox nitrospira showed metabolic potentials to utilize various organic substrates one comammox nitrospira kan bin2 contained genes encoding nadp dependent formate dehydrogenase alpha subunit fdha k05299 formate dehydrogenase major subunit fdog k00123 and assembly factor fdhd k02379 these genes involved in formate metabolism have just been reported in two comammox nitrospira i e nitrospira sp rca and ca nitrospira sp lk70 recovered from terrestrial subsurface poghosyan et al 2019 and full scale activated sludge systems yang et al 2020 respectively genes for 4 oxalocrotonate tautomerase k01821 identified in comammox clade b which was involved in the conversion of aromatic compounds to intermediates for the tca cycle were identified in one comammox clade a mag i e kan bin2 the best hit identity of 88 1 of this gene to comammox nitrospira was identified in a recently reported comammox clade b genome nitrospira sp cg24a palomo et al 2018 it has been reported that canonical nob lucker et al 2010 starkenburg et al 2006 several strains from aoa kitzinger et al 2019 palatinszky et al 2015 and anammox bacteria ganesh et al 2018 could utilize cyanate under the catalysis of cyanate hydratase cyanase genomic analyses of three recently reported comammox clade a members further revealed that some of this complete ammonia oxidizer might possess the capability to utilize cyanate as an energy source and convert cyanate via ammonia to nitrate yang et al 2020 intriguingly two comammox mags kan bin2 and ctrl lin tmp bin1 also encoded the cyanase genes cyns k01725 ctrl lin tmp bin1 cyanase genes showed close phylogenetic relationships with a homolog from one clade a comammox lk70 yang et al 2020 recovered from a full scale activated sludge system the cyanase gene identified in kan bin2 by contrast was most similar to gene from one comammox clade a nitrospira nitrospira sp rbc069 spasov et al 2020 recovered from a full scale rotating biological contactor rbc the comammox cyanase amino acid sequences appear to form a sister lineage of the genus nitrospira fig 3 similar to the previously reported comammox encoded cyns the two comammox in the present study also lacked genes encoding traditional cyanate transporters cynabd the cyanate diffusion through biological membranes might enable bacteria to utilize extracellular cyanate moreover genes for nitrate nitrite transporter nark k02575 identified in the comammox might act as cyanate transporter palatinszky et al 2015 3 6 microbial community specific patterns shaped by antibiotics considering the differential dynamics of comammox nitrospira under the treatment of antibiotics we further studied whether these comammox organisms encoded args associated with the resistance to different antibiotics the gene annotation result revealed that no specific arg was identified in any of these newly recovered comammox nitrospira suggesting that the antibiotics might create different ecological niches and select distinct bacterial communities such differential community compositions then selectively enriched comammox nitrospira via microbial interactions we then studied whether and how microbial communities differ across as treated with different antibiotics the 302 bacterial mags recovered from control and antibiotics treated as metagenomes represented the majority of the microbial community recruiting an average of 65 0 of the shotgun reads table s5 although the bacterial mags recovered from the control group were included this genome catalog only represented 8 8 of the seed sludge community indicating that the operation of the lab scale reactors cannot fully simulate the condition of full scale wwtps compared with the control group antibiotics created distinct environmental niches and selected the rare populations that could adapt to the external disturbance statistical analysis lefse v1 0 further identified 17 19 9 27 and 20 bacteria that were significantly enriched in the control as and as treated with amp kan lin and tmp fig 4 respectively the statistically different populations identified in a given antibiotics treated as sample exhibited apparent niche specificity after long term treatment 5 months representing 40 3 of the recovered microbial communities but only accounted for 10 1 of the recovered communities in other antibiotics treated samples table s5 microbial communities of as treated with the same antibiotics generally clustered together except lin and were highly divergent from the control sludge community suggesting antibiotic treatment is a key factor that shaped the microbial assemblages fig 5 a moreover the higher similarities between parallel as microbial communities except kan suggested the reproducibility between biological replicates phylogenetic analysis revealed that the significantly enriched populations from as microbial communities treated with different antibiotics displayed distinct taxonomic compositions fig 4 the dominant bacteria average relative abundance 2 0 in as microbial communities treated with amp prot amp 45 54 60 92 and 98 kan prot kan 30 73 and 75 and tmp prot tmp 41 68 and 107 were affiliated with the proteobacteria fig 4 and table s6 but within different genera table s6 in contrast the dominant bacteria in the control group and lin treated as samples showed taxonomically diverse and were affiliated with the proteobacteria and bacteroidota moreover most of the dominant bacteria within the microbial community treated with antibiotics were phylogenetically clustered for example most of the dominant bacteria in amp kan lin treated as were affiliated with burkholderiaceae thauera and rudaea respectively in addition to the taxonomic diversity kegg metabolic module based comparison of these statistically different bacteria fig 5b showed the metabolic diversity of the communities selected by antibiotics several dominant bacteria in the control prot ctrl 44 and 40 and amp prot amp 45 and 54 and kan treated as prot kan 73 and 75 shared similar traits at the global metabolic scale and clustered together but were highly divergent from the dominant bacteria in lin prot lin 97 99 100 and 101 and tmp treated prot tmp 107 and 68 samples specifically these abundant bacteria significantly enriched in as treated with amp and kan tend to process more metabolic pathways involved in saccharide polyol lipid peptide amino acid metabolisms and transport than the dominant bacteria in lin and tmp treated as figure s5 besides the convergent pattern of these dominant bacteria the other microbial community members in particular for the relatively low abundant populations selected by antibiotics revealed divergence in the metabolic traits fig 5b as reported in our previous works zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2019a these antibiotics showed selective effects on comammox exhibited different removal characteristics nearly all amp and lin could be biodegraded at different stages while kan and tmp were hardly biodegraded in the reactors except the adsorption process found in kan treated as at the first stage 20 mg l genes encoding multidrug efflux transporters were identified in these abundant bacteria with average relative abundances 0 5 indicating that the abundant microorganisms might adopt a set of strategies to respond to the addition of antibiotics table s7 however the genes that were specifically related to the resistance to amp kan lin or tmp were not identified in these microorganisms noteworthy approximately 80 of bacteria carrying args were rare populations with average relative abundances 0 5 across all the as samples in addition to numbers of genes for drug efflux pumps genes specifically related to the resistance to amp beta lactamase bla kan aminoglycoside n acetyltransferases aada aac 2 i aph 3 i aph 6 i lin erythromycin ribosome methylase erm and tmp trimethoprim resistant dihydrofolate reductase dfr could be found in some of these low abundant mags table s7 these bacteria encoding args specific to the supplied antibiotics were however not significantly enriched in the corresponding antibiotics treated as microbial communities besides comammox nitrospira five aob nitrosomonas mags and five canonical nob nitrospira mags were recovered from the as metagenomes confirmed the coexistence of comammox nitrospira with other canonical nitrifying organisms long term treatment of amp and tmp selectively enriched two different dominant aob i e prot amp 66 and prot tmp 68 respectively however these two aob were nearly undetectable in the control samples in which another two aob prot ctrl 64 and 65 were significantly enriched table s5 for example prot tmp 68 was almost undetectable in the control samples and as treated with amp and kan relative abundance 0 1 it whereas became the most abundant bacteria with a relative abundance of 6 6 after approximately 5 month treatment of tmp table s5 also this selective enrichment was observed regarding the dominant nob in the as samples treated with different antibiotics table s5 these results suggested that the canonical nitrifiers also respond differently to antibiotics 4 discussion 4 1 selective pressure of antibiotics on microbial community assembly how comammox nitrospira could be selectively enriched by abiotic factors is critical in ecological studies of comammox organisms our study of microbial communities in as systems treated with 10 different antibiotics suggested that antibiotics could be a driving force to enrich comammox in the previous works daims et al 2015 lebedeva et al 2013 palatinszky et al 2015 antibiotics that are active against gram positive bacteria e g vancomycin penicillin g gram negative bacteria e g kanamycin or both gram positive and negative bacteria e g bacitracin and ampicillin were used to further simplify the primary enrichments of aob or aoa communities although antibiotics have been demonstrated to have adverse effects on the abundance and activity of aob in soil and biological wastewater treatment systems schauss et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 the low concentration of antibiotics could enhance the nitrification process in biofilm reactor and sludge system campos et al 2001 xia et al 2019 a recently published work demonstrated that low concentration of lin µg l could be co metabolically biotransformed by aoa and comammox zhou et al 2021 marker genes of aom and community analyses in the present study revealed that both antibiotic types and concentrations differentiated the dynamic pattern of these functional microorganisms compared with the seed sludge and the control group it is notable that kan and tmp enriched comammox from the complex microbial communities fig 1 besides amp and lin could selectively enrich comammox over canonical aob under low concentrations remarkable inhibition of aob and comammox by chl cip ery and smz also suggested that the effects of antibiotics on aom are divergent from each other besides the dynamic pattern of aom analysis of microbial communities further demonstrated that antibiotics specifically shaped microbial assemblages which was consistent with the observations of antibiotics shaping microbial compositions in natural ecosystems and human gut cleary et al 2016 yassour et al 2016 such differential treatment of antibiotics may create different ecological dependencies as evidenced by the divergent nitrogen cycle related microorganisms and microbial community structures figs 4 and 5a while the dominant populations did not contain args specific to the studied antibiotics these microorganisms might actively export antibiotics out of the cell using multidrug efflux pumps and achieve resistance to antibiotics the args identified in a notable number of low abundant bacteria indicated that rare populations might be of critical importance in developing the microbial community in the biological samples treated with antibiotics furthermore the antibiotics that selected the dominant microorganisms with similar metabolic potentials i e amp and kan also enriched comammox species sharing close phylogenetically relationships and metabolic potentials figs 2 and 5b suggesting that antibiotics could expedite the formation of entrenched microbiota with a complex community specific interaction 4 2 metabolic diversity of comammox nitrospira to date all the known comammox belong to nitrospira lineage ii as expected the newly recovered comammox nitrospira in the present study shared key metabolic potentials such as complete ammonia oxidation microaerophilic related rtca carbon fixation utilization of hydrogen and urea with previously reported comammox clade a members daims et al 2016 koch et al 2015 poghosyan et al 2019 ushiki et al 2018 some features such as the utilization of organic components and fermentation reported in some canonical nob species were also found in this novel nitrifier palomo et al 2018 yang et al 2020 a dozen of comammox nitrospira mags have so far been reported in wastewater treatment systems including rotating biological contactors and activated sludge systems genomic analysis of the newly recovered mags in the present study together with the previously reported comammox nitrospira from wastewater treatment systems spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 suggested that comammox clade a exhibit higher functional diversity than previously recognized while most of the reported comammox clade a nitrospira contain genes for cytochrome bd like heme copper oxidase genes for subunits of c family oxygen reductases ccop identified in the newly recovered comammox suggested that some comammox may evolve alternative complex iv associated with low oxygen level aerobic respiration the potential of formate uptake and oxidation were once identified in nitrospira moscoviensis and comammox clade b koch et al 2015 palomo et al 2018 our comammox mag kan bin1 and the two recently reported comammox nitrospira nitrospira sp rca and ca nitrospira sp lk70 poghosyan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 together confirmed that comammox clade a if not all may also use formate as an alternative electron donor besides the identified gene related to carbon metabolism oxalocrotonate tautomerase in the recovered comammox clade a mag kan bin2 further suggested the broader distribution of some metabolic potentials conserved in comammox clade b than previously anticipated distinct cyanase genes identified in comammox clade a mags greatly changed the taxonomic diversity of ammonia oxidizers that could utilize cyanate as alternative substrates for ammonia oxidation spasov et al 2020 yang et al 2020 interestingly all these reported comammox with high metabolic versatility were identified in wastewater treatment systems suggesting that such versatility should be advantageous for the comammox in the complex biofilm and as ecosystems particularly considering the high organic contents of influent microbial diversity and biomass density in these ecosystems daims et al 2006 as the activities of microbial community members and nitrogen concentrations in the bench scale reactors were not studied in the present study it remains unknown whether these newly retrieved comammox nitrospira play important roles in the nitrogen removal process more studies will be needed to investigate the activity of comammox in wastewater treatment systems and validate the functional diversity revealed by genome centric analysis 5 conclusion this study sheds light on how comammox could be enriched in complex as ecosystems under the treatment of antibiotics which could guide the future enrichment of comammox from environmental samples comammox clade a nitrospira in the as could be selectively enriched by amp kan lin and tmp these antibiotics specifically shaped microbial assemblages that selectively enriched phylogenetically distant comammox nitrospira via yet unknown microbial interactions such findings will be applied to get lab scale enrichment of comammox community which might be required to investigate how comammox respond to changes in operational conditions and evaluate the role of comammox nitrospira for nitrification under different conditions subsequently operational strategies to maximize the activity of comammox nitrospira in biological wastewater treatment systems could be developed moreover our findings demonstrated that wastewater treatment systems might be a unique ecological niche harboring comammox nitrospira with high metabolic versatility the present study provides a clue to further investigate the feasibility of using comammox enriched communities as a promising option for nitrogen removal from wastewater data availability the bacterial mags recovered in the present study have been deposited at ncbi under bioproject accession number prjna694732

17034,along with the rise of biological active granular activated carbon bgac filtration as advanced treatment technology for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents the mathematical representation of such systems is gaining increasing importance this work introduces a model that describes the performance of bgac filters for dissolved organic carbon doc removal from a wwtp effluent the doc removal within bgac filters is accomplished by two mechanisms adsorptive removal and biological transformation an appropriate representation of the adsorptive removal requires the doc to be divided into fictive fractions according to its adsorbability likewise a further doc classification according to its biodegradability is necessary modeling a bgac filter then becomes a multi component adsorption problem with the simultaneous occurrence of doc degradation within a biofilm for dealing with this modeling task this work integrated the ideal adsorbed solution ias theory into a traditional biofilm model compatible with the activated sludge model asm framework for the description of the adsorption dynamics a freundlich isotherm for the equilibrium and a pseudo first order model for the kinetics were selected the biofilm consisted of heterotrophic bacteria able to oxidize doc using oxygen as electron acceptor the correctness of the model was evaluated using experimental data from a pilot plant the predicted doc breakthrough curve satisfactorily fitted the experimental measurements for empty bed contact times ebct of 6 12 24 and 33 min moreover the model predicted the relationship between ebct doc removal and bgac filter lifespan the developed model is the first that combines multi component adsorption and biofilm kinetics in a wastewater treatment context

established treatment technology in the drinking water sector with the emergence of more stringent discharge regulations for wastewater the implementation of gac filters as advanced treatment for micropollutants and dissolved organic carbon doc removal from municipal wastewater has become more important an interesting feature of gac filters is the development of a biofilm on the gac surface and their transition to biologically activate gac filters bgac filters several studies for wastewater applications have demonstrated that the presence of such a biofilm may enhance the overall doc removal as well as the removal of individual micropollutants fundneider et al 2021b reungoat et al 2011 xing et al 2008 yapsakli and çeçen 2010 mass transfer processes in gac filters adsorption equilibria and kinetics have been extensively researched several models intending to predict the behavior of gac filters for removing organic substances have been published chang and rittmann 1987 presented a model able to describe the removal of a single component in a bgac filter later on kim and min 1993 developed and compared two different modeling approaches for the removal of dissolved organic matter in a biofiltration system chaudhary et al 2003 presented a model for wastewater that successfully implemented the equation of state theory to predict the multi component adsorption the model also accounts for biodegradation in a simplified manner and was capable to represent the experimental data of a bgac filter fed with synthetic wastewater more recently shim et al 2004 proposed a new modeling approach for wastewater that included the backwashing of biomass from the gac filter bed in a single component system the interactions between wastewater biofilm gac and the processes occurring within are intricate and component specific which makes mathematical modeling of such a multi component systems challenging from the adsorption point of view there are several models capable to describe the adsorption behavior of complex mixtures the ideal adsorbed solution ias theory first introduced by radke and prausnitz 1972 continues to be one of the most frequently used approaches to describe adsorption in a multi solute system as the theory can be applied in combination with any single solute adsorption isotherm the ias theory or extensions of it have been implemented along with conventional breakthrough models nowotny et al 2007 modeled the competitive adsorption between a set of micropollutants and the background organic matter presented in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent similarly worch 2010 compared two model approaches capable of predicting breakthrough curves of multi component systems specifically the competition for adsorption between micropollutants and natural organic matter nom in drinking water treatment pürschel et al 2014 in turn applied the same concept for modeling the nom removal in anion exchange resins schideman et al 2006 proposed a model with three fictive components for natural waters this model is capable to describe several competition phenomena between nom and micropollutants nevertheless the models proposed in all these studies do not account for biofilm growth onto the adsorber surface thereby neglecting the influence of the biological processes on the filter performance especially after long term operation although the mechanisms and the basic mathematical principles are well known for biological and adsorption processes a comprehensive modeling approach that incorporates both of these concepts is still lacking the modeling practice in the wastewater field is widely dominated by the activated sludge model asm framework and there is agreement about the need of extending the current framework to include physicochemical models as for instance adsorption batstone et al 2012 however until now a standardized methodology for introducing adsorption processes into the asm framework is not available this paper presents a mathematical model capable of describing bgac filtration as advanced treatment stage for doc removal in a municipal wwtp to the best of our knowledge our model is the first attempt to combine a multi component adsorption approach with a biofilm model the model was developed to be compatible to the asm framework and is therefore easy to implement and replicate 2 model development figure 1 a shows a schematic representation of a bgac filter and its main features the model describes the flow of wastewater through a fixed bed filter filled with gac the gac particles are considered to be a rectangular prism instead of a sphere and their surface is able to support the growth of a biofilm in the same way adsorbed components qi are considered unavailable for the biological reactions and can be desorbed only if the concentration gradient reverses in the x axis mechanical dispersion in the x axis was not taken into consideration figure 1b shows the model s x axis divided into three different compartments bulk phase biofilm and gac that are linked through diffusive mass transport the mass transfer resistances are connected in series and include the diffusion from the bulk phase to the biofilm through a liquid boundary layer within the biofilm and within the gac particle the vertical dashed lines in the figure mark points on the x axis these points indicate the location of the interfaces between compartments and their corresponding abbreviations in the specific case of biodegradable substances the consumption within the biofilm is also considered as a simplification of the mass transfer phenomena the concentration of qi is assumed to be homogeneous in the gac particle and to be located exclusively at the end of the gac compartment at x r this means that the surface diffusion is not considered and equation 1 holds 1 q i x 0 finally figure 1b also shows that the model uses several dissolved components differentiated according to their adsorbability and biodegradability si u and si b whereas for the adsorbed phase a lumped variable for the total adsorbed doc concentration qt is introduced the dissolved and adsorbed variables are related through a multi component equilibrium isotherm the system is a non steady state system due to the accumulation of adsorbed doc in the gac and the continuous growth of biofilm 2 1 fractionation of the influent the model is meant for predicting the behavior of the doc concentrations during bgac treatment similar to the chemical oxygen demand cod fractionation in asm type models henze et al 2006 the first step in developing this model was a fractionation of the doc therefore the doc was divided into several fictive fractions according to its biodegradability and adsorbability this step is the one that allows the model to describe a multicomponent adsorption initially the doc was divided into two fractions depending on its biodegradability biodegradable and non biodegradable subscript b refers to the biodegradable fractions whereas subscript u refers to the non biodegradable ones according to this classification the model has two types of dissolved state variables si b and si u likewise the doc can also be divided into fictive fractions according to its absorbability as described in the work of johannsen and worch 1994 using this adsorption analysis the adsana software version 1 5 was developed worch 2016 adsana fits experimental data to a multicomponent freundlichisotherm based on the ias theory for the fractionation of doc in municipal wwtp effluents the use of five fictive fractions is suggested fundneider et al 2021b as result of the fractionations the influent doc in our model is represented by 10 different state variables since both the biodegradable and non biodegradable doc were also classified according to their adsorbability 2 2 mass balances to completely describe the gac system an individual mass balance for the dissolved and adsorbed components is required in the same way a single mass balance for each model compartment bp bf and gac on the x axis is needed equation 2 shows the mass balance for the dissolved components in the bulk phase 2 s i b p t v y s i b p y d b p i 2 s i b p x 2 the right hand side of the equation 2 shows the advection term along the y axis filter depth and the diffusion through the liquid boundary layer to be solved equation 2 needs an initial condition one boundary condition for the y axis and two for the x axis the initial condition the boundary condition for the y axis and one for the x axis are given by si bp t 0 x y si bp t x y 0 si bp t x 0 y si 0 respectively the second boundary condition on the x axis corresponds to the mass transfer at the interface between bulk phase and biofilm surface i e the liquid boundary layer x bl it can be described as follows 3 d b p i s i b p x d b p i l b l s i b p s i b l the area relevant to this boundary condition is the one from the biofilm abf equation 4 describes the mass balance in the biofilm for the dissolved components 4 s i b f t d b f d g a c 2 s i b f x 2 v i b i o γ i b i o where γ i b i o is the biodegradation rate and the v i b i o is the respective stoichiometric parameter alongside with biodegradation equation 4 includes the mass entering the biofilm from the liquid boundary layer as well as the mass leaving to the gac equation 4 requires an initial condition and two boundary conditions for the x axis we assume that at the beginning of the operation the biofilm is free from any substance si and hence the initial condition reads si bf t 0 x y 0 the first boundary condition at x bl describes the flux of si entering the biofilm 5 d b p i s i b f x η b f d b p i l f s i b l s i b f as equation 5 states the diffusion coefficient for the biofilm is lesser than in the bulk phase and is decreased by an empirical factor ηbf the area relevant to this boundary condition is the one from the biofilm the second boundary condition is found at the interface between the biofilm and the gac x bf and is written in equation 6 6 d b p i s i b f x ε p τ d p i r g s i b f s i r here the diffusion has to be related to the porosity of the gac particle and decreased by a tortuosity factor which reflects the heterogeneity of the gac pores the corresponding area to this boundary condition is thus internal gac surface agac finally equation 7 shows the mass balance of the dissolved components in the gac 7 s i g a c t d g a c 2 s i g a c x 2 v i a d γ i a d v i d e s γ i d e s γ i a d γ i d e s are the adsorption and desorption rates the terms v i a d v i d e s correspond to adsorption and desorption stoichiometric parameters equation 7 is associated with one initial condition and two boundary conditions on the x axis similarly to the mass balance in the biofilm it is assumed that the gac does not content any substance si at the beginning of the operation and hence si gac t 0 x y 0 given that the gac and biofilm have a common interface the boundary condition described in equation 6 must also be valid for equation 7 the end of the gac compartment x r corresponds to an impermeable limit and the second boundary condition should satisfy equation 8 8 s i g a c d x 0 given that adsorbed components appear only in the gac compartment the mass balance has to be conducted only in this compartment as shown in equation 9 9 q i t t v i d e s q γ i d e s v i a d q γ a d here the rates γ i a d γ i d e s are the same as in the equation 7 however the stoichiometric parameters are specific for the adsorbed components and thereby different from the ones of the dissolved components 2 3 adsorption equilibrium and kinetics the mass balances in the gac compartment equations 7 and 9 require a kinetic expression that gives γ ad i e the rate at which adsorption occurs the pseudo first order pfo model as described in guo and wang 2019 was used to describe the adsorption kinetics equation 10 shows the pfo expression 10 γ i a d k p f o q i e q i t where q i e is the adsorbed concentration of a component i at equilibrium and q i t at a given time t the pfo model requires also an expression capable of predicting the adsorption equilibrium in accordance to the fractionation methodology the freundlich isotherm was selected to describe the adsorption equilibrium of the doc fractions onto the activated carbon equation 11 is the mathematical expression of the isotherm 11 q i e k f i s i e n f where k f i is the freundlich constant and n f is the freundlich exponent in the case of the adsorbable components instead of an individual qi mdoc mac our model uses a lumped parameter qt mdoc mac that represents the total adsorbed doc concentration equation 10 thus becomes 12 γ a d k p f o q t e q t t in order to calculate qt a multicomponent isotherm has to be applied for this purpose and according to the influent fractionation methodology we selected the approach proposed by the ias theory qt is given by single component adsorbed concentrations qi 0 calculated at a specific spreading pressure φ mi mac which corresponds to the φ of the multicomponent system additionally the mass fraction of the adsorbed components zi is also required the original ias theory defines zi as the molar fraction of the adsorbed components however in this work the mass fraction for the components are fictive and the exact molar masses are unknown equation 13 shows the expression used for calculating qt 13 q t i 1 n z i q i b u 0 1 in order to solve equation 13 the ias theory has to be combined with the freundlich isotherm equation 11 assuming a constant φ and the same nf for all the single solute isotherms we obtain equation 14 14 φ 1 n f i 1 n s i b u k f i 1 n f n f after calculating the spreading pressure it is possible to compute the term zi as described in equation 15 15 z i s i φ n f k f i 1 n f for calculating the multicomponent isotherm both biodegradable and non biodegradable components are treated as one according to their adsorbability e g sg b and sg u are considered as one fraction 2 4 desorption kinetics analogous to the case of the adsorption kinetics a first order kinetic rate is applied to describe the adsorbed components back into the bulk phase as presented in sutikno and himmelstein 1983 16 γ d e s k d e s ε p ρ p i 1 n s i e i 1 n s i t where s i e is the concentration of a component i at equilibrium and s i t at a given time t in correspondence to the lumped parameter qt the algebraic summation of the dissolved components has to be used for the calculation of the desorption rate 2 5 biological growth the model assumes a simplified biofilm that is formed by only one microbial species which is capable of degrading doc using oxygen as electron acceptor biodegradation takes places within a multi layer biofilm and follows a monod type growth equation microbial growth and biodegradation in the bulk phase were neglected biomass decay follows a first order kinetic and biomass detaches according to the biofilm detachment approach implemented in the process unit trickling filter of the simulation software sumo19 dynamita 2020 unlike other conventional biofilm models this approach assumes a constant biofilm thickness lf during the whole operation period and lets the biomass concentration increase until a maximal concentration xhb sp is reached afterwards detachment starts and xhb equals xhb sp until the end of the operation equation 17 shows the mathematical description of the processes involved in the biological growth as implemented in sumo19 x h b t 0 l f μ m a x s i b s i b k a f f i b h b d l f k a t t r d e t l b l a b f x h b where 17 r d e t 1 1 e x h b x h b s p although at the beginning of the operation gac does not have biofilm on the surface the model assumes that biofilm is present on the external gac surface from t 0 onwards the biodegradation rate presented in the mass balance of the dissolved components in the biofilm equation 4 corresponds to the term associated to the consumption of si and thus equation 18 holds 18 γ b i o μ m a x s i b s i b k a f f i 2 6 stoichiometric parameters on the one hand the stoichiometric coefficient v i b i o is the same for all the biodegradable components si b and links the microbial growth of the heterotrophic biomass xhb with the consumption of doc as electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor 19 v i b i o 1 y h b i on the other hand v i ad and v i ad q link the concentration of the adsorbed components qt with the concentration of the dissolved ones si as the model assumes that the adsorption takes place in the pores of the gac for the transformation of qt into si the gac material density ρ m and its particle porosity ε p are required in addition to that zi is used for the allocation of the lumped adsorbed variable qt to each individual si 20 v i a d z i ρ m 1 ε p ε p the parameter v i des can be similarly defined as v i ad in equation 20 however v i des must be positive which indicates an increase in the dissolved concentration as v i ad q and v i des q link qt directly with itself they equal one however v i des q must be positive which indicates a decrease in the adsorbed concentration 2 7 asm framework implementation analogous to an asm model the rates of all the transformation processes taking place in the system equations 11 15 and 17 can be summarized in a petersen matrix as shown in tables 1 and 2 traditionally asm models use cod as basic unit however due to the low concentration that characterizes wwtp effluents total organic carbon toc is the preferred parameter for determining the organic matter content our model in consequence uses toc instead of cod and follows the methodology proposed in henze et al 2006 3 model implementation the model was implemented using the developing platform offered by sumo19 dynamita 2020 a new process model was generated based on the petersen matrix presented in tables 1 and 2 additionally the existing process unit trickling filter was modified so it can be employed as a bgac filter in the original trickling filter process unit the filter is divided into three compartments along the y axis and likewise the biofilm is divided into n number of layers along the x axis for modeling the advective transport the vertical compartmentalization was kept as in the original unit whereas a further layer in the direction of the x axis was added to represent the gac the gac layer acts as supporting material of the biofilm and only adsorption and desorption processes take place within it as mentioned in section 2 2 agac and abf were differentiated and implemented in the corresponding mass transport processes the biofilm model incorporated in the original process unit tricking filter was maintained the section 2 5 explains the basic principles of this particular biofilm model values of the biofilm parameters were however adapted to the specific simulated system table 3 summarizes the input parameters used in the modified process unit as showed in the sumo19 interface a comprehensive description of the kinetic parameters and the process unit parameter used in the model as well as the characteristics of the gac are available in table i of the supplementary material 4 model evaluation experimental data collected at the pilot plant described in fundneider 2020 were used to evaluate the developed model the pilot plant treated the effluent of a conventional municipal wwtp the performance of the plant for advanced removal of doc and organic micropolluntants was tested over a period of approximately three years the pilot plant consisted of six gac filters all of which showed evidence of biofilm formation and biological doc removal the average doc influent concentration to the bgac filters was 6 5 0 8 g m3 for all the bgac filters the filters operated with different gac types pre treatments and ebcts for the evaluation of the model the data from the filter that operated with hydraffin ar donau carbon pile cloth media filtration mecana umwelttechnik gmbh and membrane filtration pall corporation as pre treatment and ebct ranging between 6 and 33 min were selected the root mean square error rmse was used as indicator of the goodness of fit of the model predictions the rmse is defined in equation 21 21 j 0 j n y j y j 2 n 2 where ŷj is the jth experimental observation yj is the jth model prediction and n is the number of observations as first step for this modeling exercise the doc of the wwtp effluent was fractionated into five fictive fractions using the adsorption analysis software adsana version 1 5 worch 2016 table 4 summarizes the freundlich coefficients selected for the fractionation and defines the doc fractions implemented in the model it is important to note that the fractionation resulted from an isotherm analysis and thereby it is specific not only for the wastewater but also for the gac type used in the filter in the same way the biodegradable fraction was determined using the results derived from degradation experiments conducted by fundneider et al 2021b the authors found that approximately 20 of the total wwtp effluent s doc could be biologically removed by a pre adapted biomass combining these results with those from the absorption analysis table 4 we obtained the fractionation for the wwtp effluent i e the influent to the bgac filters as shown in table 5 after fractionation the model was tested with a bgac filter simulated as described in table 3 with an ebct of 24 min the kinetic constants of both adsorption and desorption kpfo and kdes processes were varied until a good qualitative agreement between the simulated and experimental data was obtained i e until the rmse had the lowest possible value and the shapes of the breakthrough curves experimental and simulated coincided the biofilm thickness lf was estimated similarly and was set to a value of 5 µm which falls into the expected range accorded to the literature 0 2 to 16 µm speitel et al 1987 to validate the fitted parameters two further bgac filters were simulated with ebcts of 6 12 and 33 min figure 2 is a first visual inspection of the goodness of fit of the model it compares the results delivered by the model at four different ebcts for the ebtc of 6 min a slight overestimation of the effluent doc concentration is observed however the shape of the predicted breakthrough curve represents the experimental results well and yields a rmse of 1 0 for ebcts equal to 12 and 24 min the simulated doc concentration follows the trend of the experimental data yet a difference between modeled and experimental data can be observed between days 30 and 120 rmse was 0 9 for these two ebcts for an ebct of 33 min the deviation between experimental and modeling results during the starting phase becomes more severe nevertheless afterwards a good fit is obtained the poorer overall fit of the model for an ebct of 33 min is reflected in a rmse of 1 4 given that lf is a constant and biomass concentration is almost negligible at the beginning of the operation see figure i in the supplementary material the observed deviations between simulated and measured data suggest an anomaly in the adsorptive removal modeling rather than in the modeling of the biological processes a possible explanation for this behavior is that the pfo kinetic model does not adequately describe the initial stage of the adsorption it has been shown that for complex systems a mixed order model might better describe the adsorption kinetics rather than a simplified pfo model guo and wang 2019 moreover a pseudo second order kinetic model is believed to be more appropriate in periods when a rapid change in the concentration in the bulk phase due to the adsorption occurs as for instance in the initial adsorption stages marczewski 2010 likewise yao and chen 2015 demonstrated for single solute systems that in the early stages the adsorption follows a pso like kinetic rate whereas at the late stages a pfo like kinetic rate applies it was not possible in the analyzed pilot plant to differentiate between the adsorptive removed doc and the biologically removed doc this makes the determination of suitable adsorption kinetics difficult the determination of the adsorption kinetics had to be based on assumptions and relied on a fitting procedure thus further research is required to improve the model performance during the initial adsorption stages for all the evaluated ebcts approximately 20 of the total doc is removed neither by biological nor by adsorptive processes and it breaks through shortly after the beginning of the operation first operation day subsequently the concentration gradually increases and after a certain time depending on the ebct it flattens out due to the biological activity in both experimental and simulated data the filters continue removing doc even after the gac is saturated figures 2e to 2g illustrate the effect of the ebct on the doc removal and the filter lifespan the longer the ebct the better the removal and the later the filters become saturated i e the longer they can stay in operation fundneider et al 2021a depending on the operational stage of the bgac filter each of the removal mechanisms adsorption or biodegradation contributes to a different extent to the overall observed doc removal at the beginning when no biofilm is present on the gac surface the overall removal relies completely on the adsorption once the biofilm is fully developed and the gac is not still saturated both mechanisms take part in the doc removal the relative contribution of adsorption decreases as the gac saturates and consequently the relative contribution of biodegradation increases in the end when the gac reaches saturation doc is removed only through biodegradation the estimation of these contributions could not be conducted experimentally nevertheless the model is able to provide this differentiation figure ii in the supplementary material depicts the predicted relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to the overall removal for all evaluated ebcts in order to prove the rationality of the model structure the breakthrough curves of the individual fictive doc fractions were analyzed the ratio between the effluent concentration si and the initial concentration si 0 si si 0 was used for a better visualization of the results figures 3 a to 3e depict the modelled si si 0 for each doc fraction at an exemplary ebct of 24 min figure 3a shows the non adsorbable doc fractions sn u und sn b it is clear that sn u is completely inert and flows through the bgac filter intact in contrast sn b is not removed initially but from approximately day 150 onwards it starts being consumed by the biofilm day 150 corresponds to the time when the biomass concentration xhb reaches the selected xhb sp i e the biofilm reaches the steady state figure i in the supplementary material shows the development of xhb in the biofilm for all the evaluate ebcts the time at which the biofilm is fully developed xhb xhb sp for each ebct can clearly be recognized in this figure figures 3b and 3c illustrate the poorly and moderately adsorbable fractions sp u sp b sm u sm b and figure 3d and 3e the good and very good adsorbable fractions sg u sg b svg u svg b similarly to figure 3a the point at which the biological removal starts can be recognized as well as the strong effect of the temperature on the biological removal when the temperature decreases the biological removal decreases along with it the occurrence of desorption is also recognizable in figures 3a to 3e when the si si0 ratio takes values higher than one if the gac is nearly saturated and the influent concentration decreases desorption will occur as shown in the petersen matrix tables 2 and 3 the desorption dynamics depend on the lumped adsorbed concentration qt which results in an equal desorption rate for all the doc fractions however desorption stoichiometry depends on the adsorbed mass fraction zi which is particular for each doc fraction this in turn causes that the good adsorbable doc fractions svg u svg b sg u sg b tend to desorb more than the poorly adsorbable ones sm u sm b sp u sp b the dependency on zi also guarantees that the non adsorbable doc fractions do not desorb as it is to be expected finally figure 3f illustrates the breakthrough curves of the total biodegradable stotal b and the total non biodegradable stotal u doc fractions for the simulated systems fundneider 2020 was able to experimentally observe the influence of the temperature on the removal of biodegradable organic micropollutants however temperature effect on the total doc breakthrough curve was not as pronounced this was also the case of the modeling results as figure 3f displays animation 1 shows the advective diffusive fronts for the total doc in the bgac filters operated at the ebcts of 6 12 24 and 33 min in the color maps shown in animation 1a the y axis corresponds to the filter depth and the x axis to the model structure explained in figure 1 the color at any x y coordinate in the plots indicates the ratio between the doc concentration at this coordinate sdoc x y and its corresponding influent concentration sdoc 0 x 0 y 0 red represents a ratio of 1 no doc removal while dark green a ratio of 0 complete doc removal additionally animation 1b and 1c show the progression of the doc influent concentration and water temperature over an operation period of 700 days respectively these two plots help to visualize how sudden influent concentration and temperature changes affect the model behavior animation 2 is built in the same manner as animation 1a and serves as a complement to it animation 2 shows the advective diffusive fronts of the non adsorbable and biodegradable sn b and the very good adsorbable and non biodegradable svg u doc fractions in animation 2 for the sn b fraction it can be seen that regardless of the ebct no removal occurs within the filter and thus in every location sn b sn b0 equals one in contrast once the biomass concentration in the biofilm reaches xhb sp the biological removal begins and sn b sn b0 starts decreasing animation 2 shows that the shorter the ebct the earlier the biological removal starts however after biofilm establishment for the short ebcts 6 and 12 min higher sn b sn b0 are observed than for the long ebcts 24 and 33 min short ebcts constrain the adsorptive removal and therefore more doc is available for the biofilm formation in the early stages however once the biofilm is fully developed the effect of the longer contact time between biofilm and substrate becomes dominating and causes a higher biological removal at longer ebcts this confirms the experimentally observed influence of the ebct on the biological removal a longer ebct promotes biodegradation due to the longer exposure of the biofilm to the substrate terry and summers 2018 this effect can be also observed for all the other biodegradable fractions si b yet not as clearly as for the sn b for which the effect of the adsorption is suppressed the advective diffusive fronts for the svg u fraction showcase several other effects firstly an ebct equal to 6 min results in no further removal of this fraction once the adsorptive capacity of the carbon is depleted within the filter as it is to be expected for a non biodegradable doc fraction secondly as already described before bgac filters operated at longer ebcts until a certain maximum ebct better utilize the gac adsorption capacity and have therefore longer lifespans fundneider et al 2021a finally and most interesting desorption can be easily inspected as mentioned before desorption can be recognized by the increase of si si 0 above one when the doc influent concentration see animation 1 abruptly decreases and again recovers it forces the si si 0 to become higher than one this is due to the temporary reversion of the concentration profiles on the x axis between the bulk phase and the biofilm surface and the consequent dissolution of already adsorbed doc back into the bulk phase proportionally to this dissolution qt decreases and some adsorption capacity is virtually regained thus immediately afterwards si si 0 decreases anew and the regained qt is used animation 2 displays a precise example of this phenomenon for the bgac filter with an ebct of 6 min in the period between day 120 and 160 it is important to highlight that experimentally desorption is a highly complex phenomenon which depends on various parameters and processes that are not include in the present model nevertheless the overall outcome of desorptive processes is well represented by the modeling approach described in this contribution the good agreement between the experimental and modeling results indicates that the assumptions made in regard to biofilm and adsorption dynamics mass transfer processes and doc fractionation are plausible and apply for the analyzed process conditions moreover this model sets the basis for potential further extensions which would be able to predict the removal of individual organic micropolluntants and other remaining macropollutants as for instance nh4 no2 and no3 5 conclusions the model presented in this contribution is the first attempt of implementing a multicomponent adsorption process in combination with biofilm degradation into the asm framework the developed model is capable of reproducing the doc breakthrough curve of a bgac filter as advanced treatment for a wwtp effluent the fractionation of the influent according to its biodegradability and adsorbability makes the model more flexible and insightful it also allows the future incorporation of specific fractions e g individual organic micropollutants the implementation of the ias theory along with the use of a lumped state variable qt for the adsorbed components is a good approximation for modeling complex multicomponent mixtures as in the case of wwtp effluents this work shows how to combine this approach within a kinetic biofilm model the simplified microbial community is able to accurately predict the doc consumption moreover the assumptions regarding the mass transfer phenomena are able to represent the system the model accurately predicts the influence of the determinant parameter ebct on the doc breakthrough curves its effect on both adsorptive and biological removal is observed further research regarding the adsorption kinetic rate its implementation and parameters is still required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17034,along with the rise of biological active granular activated carbon bgac filtration as advanced treatment technology for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents the mathematical representation of such systems is gaining increasing importance this work introduces a model that describes the performance of bgac filters for dissolved organic carbon doc removal from a wwtp effluent the doc removal within bgac filters is accomplished by two mechanisms adsorptive removal and biological transformation an appropriate representation of the adsorptive removal requires the doc to be divided into fictive fractions according to its adsorbability likewise a further doc classification according to its biodegradability is necessary modeling a bgac filter then becomes a multi component adsorption problem with the simultaneous occurrence of doc degradation within a biofilm for dealing with this modeling task this work integrated the ideal adsorbed solution ias theory into a traditional biofilm model compatible with the activated sludge model asm framework for the description of the adsorption dynamics a freundlich isotherm for the equilibrium and a pseudo first order model for the kinetics were selected the biofilm consisted of heterotrophic bacteria able to oxidize doc using oxygen as electron acceptor the correctness of the model was evaluated using experimental data from a pilot plant the predicted doc breakthrough curve satisfactorily fitted the experimental measurements for empty bed contact times ebct of 6 12 24 and 33 min moreover the model predicted the relationship between ebct doc removal and bgac filter lifespan the developed model is the first that combines multi component adsorption and biofilm kinetics in a wastewater treatment context

established treatment technology in the drinking water sector with the emergence of more stringent discharge regulations for wastewater the implementation of gac filters as advanced treatment for micropollutants and dissolved organic carbon doc removal from municipal wastewater has become more important an interesting feature of gac filters is the development of a biofilm on the gac surface and their transition to biologically activate gac filters bgac filters several studies for wastewater applications have demonstrated that the presence of such a biofilm may enhance the overall doc removal as well as the removal of individual micropollutants fundneider et al 2021b reungoat et al 2011 xing et al 2008 yapsakli and çeçen 2010 mass transfer processes in gac filters adsorption equilibria and kinetics have been extensively researched several models intending to predict the behavior of gac filters for removing organic substances have been published chang and rittmann 1987 presented a model able to describe the removal of a single component in a bgac filter later on kim and min 1993 developed and compared two different modeling approaches for the removal of dissolved organic matter in a biofiltration system chaudhary et al 2003 presented a model for wastewater that successfully implemented the equation of state theory to predict the multi component adsorption the model also accounts for biodegradation in a simplified manner and was capable to represent the experimental data of a bgac filter fed with synthetic wastewater more recently shim et al 2004 proposed a new modeling approach for wastewater that included the backwashing of biomass from the gac filter bed in a single component system the interactions between wastewater biofilm gac and the processes occurring within are intricate and component specific which makes mathematical modeling of such a multi component systems challenging from the adsorption point of view there are several models capable to describe the adsorption behavior of complex mixtures the ideal adsorbed solution ias theory first introduced by radke and prausnitz 1972 continues to be one of the most frequently used approaches to describe adsorption in a multi solute system as the theory can be applied in combination with any single solute adsorption isotherm the ias theory or extensions of it have been implemented along with conventional breakthrough models nowotny et al 2007 modeled the competitive adsorption between a set of micropollutants and the background organic matter presented in a wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent similarly worch 2010 compared two model approaches capable of predicting breakthrough curves of multi component systems specifically the competition for adsorption between micropollutants and natural organic matter nom in drinking water treatment pürschel et al 2014 in turn applied the same concept for modeling the nom removal in anion exchange resins schideman et al 2006 proposed a model with three fictive components for natural waters this model is capable to describe several competition phenomena between nom and micropollutants nevertheless the models proposed in all these studies do not account for biofilm growth onto the adsorber surface thereby neglecting the influence of the biological processes on the filter performance especially after long term operation although the mechanisms and the basic mathematical principles are well known for biological and adsorption processes a comprehensive modeling approach that incorporates both of these concepts is still lacking the modeling practice in the wastewater field is widely dominated by the activated sludge model asm framework and there is agreement about the need of extending the current framework to include physicochemical models as for instance adsorption batstone et al 2012 however until now a standardized methodology for introducing adsorption processes into the asm framework is not available this paper presents a mathematical model capable of describing bgac filtration as advanced treatment stage for doc removal in a municipal wwtp to the best of our knowledge our model is the first attempt to combine a multi component adsorption approach with a biofilm model the model was developed to be compatible to the asm framework and is therefore easy to implement and replicate 2 model development figure 1 a shows a schematic representation of a bgac filter and its main features the model describes the flow of wastewater through a fixed bed filter filled with gac the gac particles are considered to be a rectangular prism instead of a sphere and their surface is able to support the growth of a biofilm in the same way adsorbed components qi are considered unavailable for the biological reactions and can be desorbed only if the concentration gradient reverses in the x axis mechanical dispersion in the x axis was not taken into consideration figure 1b shows the model s x axis divided into three different compartments bulk phase biofilm and gac that are linked through diffusive mass transport the mass transfer resistances are connected in series and include the diffusion from the bulk phase to the biofilm through a liquid boundary layer within the biofilm and within the gac particle the vertical dashed lines in the figure mark points on the x axis these points indicate the location of the interfaces between compartments and their corresponding abbreviations in the specific case of biodegradable substances the consumption within the biofilm is also considered as a simplification of the mass transfer phenomena the concentration of qi is assumed to be homogeneous in the gac particle and to be located exclusively at the end of the gac compartment at x r this means that the surface diffusion is not considered and equation 1 holds 1 q i x 0 finally figure 1b also shows that the model uses several dissolved components differentiated according to their adsorbability and biodegradability si u and si b whereas for the adsorbed phase a lumped variable for the total adsorbed doc concentration qt is introduced the dissolved and adsorbed variables are related through a multi component equilibrium isotherm the system is a non steady state system due to the accumulation of adsorbed doc in the gac and the continuous growth of biofilm 2 1 fractionation of the influent the model is meant for predicting the behavior of the doc concentrations during bgac treatment similar to the chemical oxygen demand cod fractionation in asm type models henze et al 2006 the first step in developing this model was a fractionation of the doc therefore the doc was divided into several fictive fractions according to its biodegradability and adsorbability this step is the one that allows the model to describe a multicomponent adsorption initially the doc was divided into two fractions depending on its biodegradability biodegradable and non biodegradable subscript b refers to the biodegradable fractions whereas subscript u refers to the non biodegradable ones according to this classification the model has two types of dissolved state variables si b and si u likewise the doc can also be divided into fictive fractions according to its absorbability as described in the work of johannsen and worch 1994 using this adsorption analysis the adsana software version 1 5 was developed worch 2016 adsana fits experimental data to a multicomponent freundlichisotherm based on the ias theory for the fractionation of doc in municipal wwtp effluents the use of five fictive fractions is suggested fundneider et al 2021b as result of the fractionations the influent doc in our model is represented by 10 different state variables since both the biodegradable and non biodegradable doc were also classified according to their adsorbability 2 2 mass balances to completely describe the gac system an individual mass balance for the dissolved and adsorbed components is required in the same way a single mass balance for each model compartment bp bf and gac on the x axis is needed equation 2 shows the mass balance for the dissolved components in the bulk phase 2 s i b p t v y s i b p y d b p i 2 s i b p x 2 the right hand side of the equation 2 shows the advection term along the y axis filter depth and the diffusion through the liquid boundary layer to be solved equation 2 needs an initial condition one boundary condition for the y axis and two for the x axis the initial condition the boundary condition for the y axis and one for the x axis are given by si bp t 0 x y si bp t x y 0 si bp t x 0 y si 0 respectively the second boundary condition on the x axis corresponds to the mass transfer at the interface between bulk phase and biofilm surface i e the liquid boundary layer x bl it can be described as follows 3 d b p i s i b p x d b p i l b l s i b p s i b l the area relevant to this boundary condition is the one from the biofilm abf equation 4 describes the mass balance in the biofilm for the dissolved components 4 s i b f t d b f d g a c 2 s i b f x 2 v i b i o γ i b i o where γ i b i o is the biodegradation rate and the v i b i o is the respective stoichiometric parameter alongside with biodegradation equation 4 includes the mass entering the biofilm from the liquid boundary layer as well as the mass leaving to the gac equation 4 requires an initial condition and two boundary conditions for the x axis we assume that at the beginning of the operation the biofilm is free from any substance si and hence the initial condition reads si bf t 0 x y 0 the first boundary condition at x bl describes the flux of si entering the biofilm 5 d b p i s i b f x η b f d b p i l f s i b l s i b f as equation 5 states the diffusion coefficient for the biofilm is lesser than in the bulk phase and is decreased by an empirical factor ηbf the area relevant to this boundary condition is the one from the biofilm the second boundary condition is found at the interface between the biofilm and the gac x bf and is written in equation 6 6 d b p i s i b f x ε p τ d p i r g s i b f s i r here the diffusion has to be related to the porosity of the gac particle and decreased by a tortuosity factor which reflects the heterogeneity of the gac pores the corresponding area to this boundary condition is thus internal gac surface agac finally equation 7 shows the mass balance of the dissolved components in the gac 7 s i g a c t d g a c 2 s i g a c x 2 v i a d γ i a d v i d e s γ i d e s γ i a d γ i d e s are the adsorption and desorption rates the terms v i a d v i d e s correspond to adsorption and desorption stoichiometric parameters equation 7 is associated with one initial condition and two boundary conditions on the x axis similarly to the mass balance in the biofilm it is assumed that the gac does not content any substance si at the beginning of the operation and hence si gac t 0 x y 0 given that the gac and biofilm have a common interface the boundary condition described in equation 6 must also be valid for equation 7 the end of the gac compartment x r corresponds to an impermeable limit and the second boundary condition should satisfy equation 8 8 s i g a c d x 0 given that adsorbed components appear only in the gac compartment the mass balance has to be conducted only in this compartment as shown in equation 9 9 q i t t v i d e s q γ i d e s v i a d q γ a d here the rates γ i a d γ i d e s are the same as in the equation 7 however the stoichiometric parameters are specific for the adsorbed components and thereby different from the ones of the dissolved components 2 3 adsorption equilibrium and kinetics the mass balances in the gac compartment equations 7 and 9 require a kinetic expression that gives γ ad i e the rate at which adsorption occurs the pseudo first order pfo model as described in guo and wang 2019 was used to describe the adsorption kinetics equation 10 shows the pfo expression 10 γ i a d k p f o q i e q i t where q i e is the adsorbed concentration of a component i at equilibrium and q i t at a given time t the pfo model requires also an expression capable of predicting the adsorption equilibrium in accordance to the fractionation methodology the freundlich isotherm was selected to describe the adsorption equilibrium of the doc fractions onto the activated carbon equation 11 is the mathematical expression of the isotherm 11 q i e k f i s i e n f where k f i is the freundlich constant and n f is the freundlich exponent in the case of the adsorbable components instead of an individual qi mdoc mac our model uses a lumped parameter qt mdoc mac that represents the total adsorbed doc concentration equation 10 thus becomes 12 γ a d k p f o q t e q t t in order to calculate qt a multicomponent isotherm has to be applied for this purpose and according to the influent fractionation methodology we selected the approach proposed by the ias theory qt is given by single component adsorbed concentrations qi 0 calculated at a specific spreading pressure φ mi mac which corresponds to the φ of the multicomponent system additionally the mass fraction of the adsorbed components zi is also required the original ias theory defines zi as the molar fraction of the adsorbed components however in this work the mass fraction for the components are fictive and the exact molar masses are unknown equation 13 shows the expression used for calculating qt 13 q t i 1 n z i q i b u 0 1 in order to solve equation 13 the ias theory has to be combined with the freundlich isotherm equation 11 assuming a constant φ and the same nf for all the single solute isotherms we obtain equation 14 14 φ 1 n f i 1 n s i b u k f i 1 n f n f after calculating the spreading pressure it is possible to compute the term zi as described in equation 15 15 z i s i φ n f k f i 1 n f for calculating the multicomponent isotherm both biodegradable and non biodegradable components are treated as one according to their adsorbability e g sg b and sg u are considered as one fraction 2 4 desorption kinetics analogous to the case of the adsorption kinetics a first order kinetic rate is applied to describe the adsorbed components back into the bulk phase as presented in sutikno and himmelstein 1983 16 γ d e s k d e s ε p ρ p i 1 n s i e i 1 n s i t where s i e is the concentration of a component i at equilibrium and s i t at a given time t in correspondence to the lumped parameter qt the algebraic summation of the dissolved components has to be used for the calculation of the desorption rate 2 5 biological growth the model assumes a simplified biofilm that is formed by only one microbial species which is capable of degrading doc using oxygen as electron acceptor biodegradation takes places within a multi layer biofilm and follows a monod type growth equation microbial growth and biodegradation in the bulk phase were neglected biomass decay follows a first order kinetic and biomass detaches according to the biofilm detachment approach implemented in the process unit trickling filter of the simulation software sumo19 dynamita 2020 unlike other conventional biofilm models this approach assumes a constant biofilm thickness lf during the whole operation period and lets the biomass concentration increase until a maximal concentration xhb sp is reached afterwards detachment starts and xhb equals xhb sp until the end of the operation equation 17 shows the mathematical description of the processes involved in the biological growth as implemented in sumo19 x h b t 0 l f μ m a x s i b s i b k a f f i b h b d l f k a t t r d e t l b l a b f x h b where 17 r d e t 1 1 e x h b x h b s p although at the beginning of the operation gac does not have biofilm on the surface the model assumes that biofilm is present on the external gac surface from t 0 onwards the biodegradation rate presented in the mass balance of the dissolved components in the biofilm equation 4 corresponds to the term associated to the consumption of si and thus equation 18 holds 18 γ b i o μ m a x s i b s i b k a f f i 2 6 stoichiometric parameters on the one hand the stoichiometric coefficient v i b i o is the same for all the biodegradable components si b and links the microbial growth of the heterotrophic biomass xhb with the consumption of doc as electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor 19 v i b i o 1 y h b i on the other hand v i ad and v i ad q link the concentration of the adsorbed components qt with the concentration of the dissolved ones si as the model assumes that the adsorption takes place in the pores of the gac for the transformation of qt into si the gac material density ρ m and its particle porosity ε p are required in addition to that zi is used for the allocation of the lumped adsorbed variable qt to each individual si 20 v i a d z i ρ m 1 ε p ε p the parameter v i des can be similarly defined as v i ad in equation 20 however v i des must be positive which indicates an increase in the dissolved concentration as v i ad q and v i des q link qt directly with itself they equal one however v i des q must be positive which indicates a decrease in the adsorbed concentration 2 7 asm framework implementation analogous to an asm model the rates of all the transformation processes taking place in the system equations 11 15 and 17 can be summarized in a petersen matrix as shown in tables 1 and 2 traditionally asm models use cod as basic unit however due to the low concentration that characterizes wwtp effluents total organic carbon toc is the preferred parameter for determining the organic matter content our model in consequence uses toc instead of cod and follows the methodology proposed in henze et al 2006 3 model implementation the model was implemented using the developing platform offered by sumo19 dynamita 2020 a new process model was generated based on the petersen matrix presented in tables 1 and 2 additionally the existing process unit trickling filter was modified so it can be employed as a bgac filter in the original trickling filter process unit the filter is divided into three compartments along the y axis and likewise the biofilm is divided into n number of layers along the x axis for modeling the advective transport the vertical compartmentalization was kept as in the original unit whereas a further layer in the direction of the x axis was added to represent the gac the gac layer acts as supporting material of the biofilm and only adsorption and desorption processes take place within it as mentioned in section 2 2 agac and abf were differentiated and implemented in the corresponding mass transport processes the biofilm model incorporated in the original process unit tricking filter was maintained the section 2 5 explains the basic principles of this particular biofilm model values of the biofilm parameters were however adapted to the specific simulated system table 3 summarizes the input parameters used in the modified process unit as showed in the sumo19 interface a comprehensive description of the kinetic parameters and the process unit parameter used in the model as well as the characteristics of the gac are available in table i of the supplementary material 4 model evaluation experimental data collected at the pilot plant described in fundneider 2020 were used to evaluate the developed model the pilot plant treated the effluent of a conventional municipal wwtp the performance of the plant for advanced removal of doc and organic micropolluntants was tested over a period of approximately three years the pilot plant consisted of six gac filters all of which showed evidence of biofilm formation and biological doc removal the average doc influent concentration to the bgac filters was 6 5 0 8 g m3 for all the bgac filters the filters operated with different gac types pre treatments and ebcts for the evaluation of the model the data from the filter that operated with hydraffin ar donau carbon pile cloth media filtration mecana umwelttechnik gmbh and membrane filtration pall corporation as pre treatment and ebct ranging between 6 and 33 min were selected the root mean square error rmse was used as indicator of the goodness of fit of the model predictions the rmse is defined in equation 21 21 j 0 j n y j y j 2 n 2 where ŷj is the jth experimental observation yj is the jth model prediction and n is the number of observations as first step for this modeling exercise the doc of the wwtp effluent was fractionated into five fictive fractions using the adsorption analysis software adsana version 1 5 worch 2016 table 4 summarizes the freundlich coefficients selected for the fractionation and defines the doc fractions implemented in the model it is important to note that the fractionation resulted from an isotherm analysis and thereby it is specific not only for the wastewater but also for the gac type used in the filter in the same way the biodegradable fraction was determined using the results derived from degradation experiments conducted by fundneider et al 2021b the authors found that approximately 20 of the total wwtp effluent s doc could be biologically removed by a pre adapted biomass combining these results with those from the absorption analysis table 4 we obtained the fractionation for the wwtp effluent i e the influent to the bgac filters as shown in table 5 after fractionation the model was tested with a bgac filter simulated as described in table 3 with an ebct of 24 min the kinetic constants of both adsorption and desorption kpfo and kdes processes were varied until a good qualitative agreement between the simulated and experimental data was obtained i e until the rmse had the lowest possible value and the shapes of the breakthrough curves experimental and simulated coincided the biofilm thickness lf was estimated similarly and was set to a value of 5 µm which falls into the expected range accorded to the literature 0 2 to 16 µm speitel et al 1987 to validate the fitted parameters two further bgac filters were simulated with ebcts of 6 12 and 33 min figure 2 is a first visual inspection of the goodness of fit of the model it compares the results delivered by the model at four different ebcts for the ebtc of 6 min a slight overestimation of the effluent doc concentration is observed however the shape of the predicted breakthrough curve represents the experimental results well and yields a rmse of 1 0 for ebcts equal to 12 and 24 min the simulated doc concentration follows the trend of the experimental data yet a difference between modeled and experimental data can be observed between days 30 and 120 rmse was 0 9 for these two ebcts for an ebct of 33 min the deviation between experimental and modeling results during the starting phase becomes more severe nevertheless afterwards a good fit is obtained the poorer overall fit of the model for an ebct of 33 min is reflected in a rmse of 1 4 given that lf is a constant and biomass concentration is almost negligible at the beginning of the operation see figure i in the supplementary material the observed deviations between simulated and measured data suggest an anomaly in the adsorptive removal modeling rather than in the modeling of the biological processes a possible explanation for this behavior is that the pfo kinetic model does not adequately describe the initial stage of the adsorption it has been shown that for complex systems a mixed order model might better describe the adsorption kinetics rather than a simplified pfo model guo and wang 2019 moreover a pseudo second order kinetic model is believed to be more appropriate in periods when a rapid change in the concentration in the bulk phase due to the adsorption occurs as for instance in the initial adsorption stages marczewski 2010 likewise yao and chen 2015 demonstrated for single solute systems that in the early stages the adsorption follows a pso like kinetic rate whereas at the late stages a pfo like kinetic rate applies it was not possible in the analyzed pilot plant to differentiate between the adsorptive removed doc and the biologically removed doc this makes the determination of suitable adsorption kinetics difficult the determination of the adsorption kinetics had to be based on assumptions and relied on a fitting procedure thus further research is required to improve the model performance during the initial adsorption stages for all the evaluated ebcts approximately 20 of the total doc is removed neither by biological nor by adsorptive processes and it breaks through shortly after the beginning of the operation first operation day subsequently the concentration gradually increases and after a certain time depending on the ebct it flattens out due to the biological activity in both experimental and simulated data the filters continue removing doc even after the gac is saturated figures 2e to 2g illustrate the effect of the ebct on the doc removal and the filter lifespan the longer the ebct the better the removal and the later the filters become saturated i e the longer they can stay in operation fundneider et al 2021a depending on the operational stage of the bgac filter each of the removal mechanisms adsorption or biodegradation contributes to a different extent to the overall observed doc removal at the beginning when no biofilm is present on the gac surface the overall removal relies completely on the adsorption once the biofilm is fully developed and the gac is not still saturated both mechanisms take part in the doc removal the relative contribution of adsorption decreases as the gac saturates and consequently the relative contribution of biodegradation increases in the end when the gac reaches saturation doc is removed only through biodegradation the estimation of these contributions could not be conducted experimentally nevertheless the model is able to provide this differentiation figure ii in the supplementary material depicts the predicted relative contributions of adsorption and biodegradation to the overall removal for all evaluated ebcts in order to prove the rationality of the model structure the breakthrough curves of the individual fictive doc fractions were analyzed the ratio between the effluent concentration si and the initial concentration si 0 si si 0 was used for a better visualization of the results figures 3 a to 3e depict the modelled si si 0 for each doc fraction at an exemplary ebct of 24 min figure 3a shows the non adsorbable doc fractions sn u und sn b it is clear that sn u is completely inert and flows through the bgac filter intact in contrast sn b is not removed initially but from approximately day 150 onwards it starts being consumed by the biofilm day 150 corresponds to the time when the biomass concentration xhb reaches the selected xhb sp i e the biofilm reaches the steady state figure i in the supplementary material shows the development of xhb in the biofilm for all the evaluate ebcts the time at which the biofilm is fully developed xhb xhb sp for each ebct can clearly be recognized in this figure figures 3b and 3c illustrate the poorly and moderately adsorbable fractions sp u sp b sm u sm b and figure 3d and 3e the good and very good adsorbable fractions sg u sg b svg u svg b similarly to figure 3a the point at which the biological removal starts can be recognized as well as the strong effect of the temperature on the biological removal when the temperature decreases the biological removal decreases along with it the occurrence of desorption is also recognizable in figures 3a to 3e when the si si0 ratio takes values higher than one if the gac is nearly saturated and the influent concentration decreases desorption will occur as shown in the petersen matrix tables 2 and 3 the desorption dynamics depend on the lumped adsorbed concentration qt which results in an equal desorption rate for all the doc fractions however desorption stoichiometry depends on the adsorbed mass fraction zi which is particular for each doc fraction this in turn causes that the good adsorbable doc fractions svg u svg b sg u sg b tend to desorb more than the poorly adsorbable ones sm u sm b sp u sp b the dependency on zi also guarantees that the non adsorbable doc fractions do not desorb as it is to be expected finally figure 3f illustrates the breakthrough curves of the total biodegradable stotal b and the total non biodegradable stotal u doc fractions for the simulated systems fundneider 2020 was able to experimentally observe the influence of the temperature on the removal of biodegradable organic micropollutants however temperature effect on the total doc breakthrough curve was not as pronounced this was also the case of the modeling results as figure 3f displays animation 1 shows the advective diffusive fronts for the total doc in the bgac filters operated at the ebcts of 6 12 24 and 33 min in the color maps shown in animation 1a the y axis corresponds to the filter depth and the x axis to the model structure explained in figure 1 the color at any x y coordinate in the plots indicates the ratio between the doc concentration at this coordinate sdoc x y and its corresponding influent concentration sdoc 0 x 0 y 0 red represents a ratio of 1 no doc removal while dark green a ratio of 0 complete doc removal additionally animation 1b and 1c show the progression of the doc influent concentration and water temperature over an operation period of 700 days respectively these two plots help to visualize how sudden influent concentration and temperature changes affect the model behavior animation 2 is built in the same manner as animation 1a and serves as a complement to it animation 2 shows the advective diffusive fronts of the non adsorbable and biodegradable sn b and the very good adsorbable and non biodegradable svg u doc fractions in animation 2 for the sn b fraction it can be seen that regardless of the ebct no removal occurs within the filter and thus in every location sn b sn b0 equals one in contrast once the biomass concentration in the biofilm reaches xhb sp the biological removal begins and sn b sn b0 starts decreasing animation 2 shows that the shorter the ebct the earlier the biological removal starts however after biofilm establishment for the short ebcts 6 and 12 min higher sn b sn b0 are observed than for the long ebcts 24 and 33 min short ebcts constrain the adsorptive removal and therefore more doc is available for the biofilm formation in the early stages however once the biofilm is fully developed the effect of the longer contact time between biofilm and substrate becomes dominating and causes a higher biological removal at longer ebcts this confirms the experimentally observed influence of the ebct on the biological removal a longer ebct promotes biodegradation due to the longer exposure of the biofilm to the substrate terry and summers 2018 this effect can be also observed for all the other biodegradable fractions si b yet not as clearly as for the sn b for which the effect of the adsorption is suppressed the advective diffusive fronts for the svg u fraction showcase several other effects firstly an ebct equal to 6 min results in no further removal of this fraction once the adsorptive capacity of the carbon is depleted within the filter as it is to be expected for a non biodegradable doc fraction secondly as already described before bgac filters operated at longer ebcts until a certain maximum ebct better utilize the gac adsorption capacity and have therefore longer lifespans fundneider et al 2021a finally and most interesting desorption can be easily inspected as mentioned before desorption can be recognized by the increase of si si 0 above one when the doc influent concentration see animation 1 abruptly decreases and again recovers it forces the si si 0 to become higher than one this is due to the temporary reversion of the concentration profiles on the x axis between the bulk phase and the biofilm surface and the consequent dissolution of already adsorbed doc back into the bulk phase proportionally to this dissolution qt decreases and some adsorption capacity is virtually regained thus immediately afterwards si si 0 decreases anew and the regained qt is used animation 2 displays a precise example of this phenomenon for the bgac filter with an ebct of 6 min in the period between day 120 and 160 it is important to highlight that experimentally desorption is a highly complex phenomenon which depends on various parameters and processes that are not include in the present model nevertheless the overall outcome of desorptive processes is well represented by the modeling approach described in this contribution the good agreement between the experimental and modeling results indicates that the assumptions made in regard to biofilm and adsorption dynamics mass transfer processes and doc fractionation are plausible and apply for the analyzed process conditions moreover this model sets the basis for potential further extensions which would be able to predict the removal of individual organic micropolluntants and other remaining macropollutants as for instance nh4 no2 and no3 5 conclusions the model presented in this contribution is the first attempt of implementing a multicomponent adsorption process in combination with biofilm degradation into the asm framework the developed model is capable of reproducing the doc breakthrough curve of a bgac filter as advanced treatment for a wwtp effluent the fractionation of the influent according to its biodegradability and adsorbability makes the model more flexible and insightful it also allows the future incorporation of specific fractions e g individual organic micropollutants the implementation of the ias theory along with the use of a lumped state variable qt for the adsorbed components is a good approximation for modeling complex multicomponent mixtures as in the case of wwtp effluents this work shows how to combine this approach within a kinetic biofilm model the simplified microbial community is able to accurately predict the doc consumption moreover the assumptions regarding the mass transfer phenomena are able to represent the system the model accurately predicts the influence of the determinant parameter ebct on the doc breakthrough curves its effect on both adsorptive and biological removal is observed further research regarding the adsorption kinetic rate its implementation and parameters is still required declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
