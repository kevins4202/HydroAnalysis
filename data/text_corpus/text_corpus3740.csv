18700,the formation potential of contaminants diffusing from cross linked polyethylene pe x pipes and their impact on the odour of drinking water was determined three types of pe x material pe xa pe xb and pe xc were extensively assessed by performing migration tests following en 1420 and en 12873 1 migration waters were analysed for their threshold odour number ton the same samples were investigated by two gas chromatography mass spectrometry methods screening and olfactometry most of the pe x materials failed the german regulation of ton 2 for cold water and ton 4 for warm water pe

and 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 dtbq were the most often detected substances leaching from the tested plastic materials however no odour was perceived for most of these substances methyl tert

environment agency umweltbundesamt 1 introduction cross linked polyethylene pe x pipes are increasingly used in household installations for the distribution of drinking water because of their flexibility durability corrosion resistance thermal stability and high tensile strength three methods are used to chemically bond cross link ethylene hydrocarbon chains one to another pe xa pipes are cross linked with organic peroxides in this process free radicals of the added peroxide initiate the cross linking for the production of pe xb pipes silanes are used and pe xc pipes are cross linked by irradiation processes baur et al 2013 despite many advantages the polyethylene materials were soon identified as a major contributors to the deterioration of taste and odour in drinking water anselme et al 1985 consequently the quality of pipes and others final products has been extensively investigated with standardised test methods rigal 1992 the european standard en 1420 2015 describes the preparation of migration waters leachates defined as test waters which have been in contact with test pieces under specific conditions and the procedure to determine the threshold odour number ton and the threshold flavour number tfn this standard includes a procedure for the qualification of the panel members to determine the threshold numbers rapp and günther 2015 the european drinking water directive dwd 98 83 ec 1998 states as requirements for odour and taste that drinking water shall be acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change shall occur to ensure this the german environment agency s uba guideline for hygienic assessment of organic materials in contact with drinking water ktw guideline 2016 requires a ton 2 and 4 for results of tests according to en 1420 in cold and warm water respectively these values are sufficiently low to ensure that the drinking water is free from odour when the tested products are in real use however past studies reported ton levels measured in migration waters from pe x pipes ranging from 0 to 128 ton skjevrak et al 2003 koch 2004 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 several number of research groups have investigated the release and origin of substances from plastic pipes adversely impacting drinking water odour and chemical quality a summary is given by whelton and nguyen 2013 an important class of substances that migrate into drinking water are reaction products of antioxidants stabilizers antioxidants are intentionally added to protect the material against oxidative degradation during its production processing final use and recycling pitteloud and dubs 1994 brocca et al 2002 identified ten substances migrating from pe pipes which show similarities with used antioxidants today these substances are known under the designation arvin i to x bertoldo and ciardelli 2004 and löschner et al 2011 proposed the reaction paths for the formation of some of them substances frequently identified in migration water include 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 dtbq iii 2 4 di tert butylphenol 2 4 dtbp iv 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde vi 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy acetophenone vii 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione viii and 3 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxyphenyl methyl propanoate ix also known as metilox anselme et al 1985 1986 carthorne et al 1990 brocca et al 2002 skjevrak et al 2003 koch 2004 löschner et al 2011 ryssel et al 2015 however it is unclear to which extend these are causative for off flavour perceived in drinking water despite the use of stabilizers oxidative degradation of the polymer can occur and will yield low molecular mass ketones aldehydes alcohols and carboxylic acids iring and tüdös 1990 andersson et al 2005 in addition to these degradation products residual monomers oligomers or other starting substances can leach into drinking water skjevrak et al 2003 lund et al 2011 anselme et al 1985 carried out a study to identify the substances causing odour in high density polyethylene hd pe pipes by applying gas chromatography gc with olfactometric detection and identified 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht 3 hexen 2 one 1 2 4 trimethyl 5 methyl ethylenbenzene and 1 2 4 trimethyl 5 isopropylbenzene as odourous compounds in the migration waters of pe pipes villberg et al 1997 combined gc coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms with olfactory detection gc ms od to investigate hd pe granules and chiefly characterised the compounds causing the off flavours as carbonyls aldehydes ketones and esters with odours described as sweet glue solvent mushroom or aldehydic lund et al 2011 qualified the odour of migration water in contact with pe x pipes as solvent like or plastic like and discussed methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as a substance causing off flavours of pe x pipes for the long term behaviour of these pipes the authors suspect that substances produced by biofilms in the pipes may also contribute to the odour recognised durand and dietrich 2007 identified ethyl tert butyl ether etbe as a contributor to the chemical solvent like odour of pe xb pipes kelley et al 2014 found that mtbe and etbe might be present in the migration water of different pe x types in concentrations above their odour detection thresholds however an odour was still perceived when these two substances were not present indicating that other substances are responsible for the odour together these studies show that only few substances were investigated for their off flavour in pe pipes today no one can say if the chemicals such as arvin viii or ix and many more also contribute to the odour degradation for which the measured concentrations can be quite significant so far there is no study reporting olfactory data specific to pe xa pe xb and pe xc this emphasises the need for a comprehensive and systematic study of specific pe x materials regarding causes of taste and odour perceived in the migration water this study investigated pipe samples from all three of the widely used pe x materials the objectives were 1 to determine the ton values measured in migration water exposed for 10 and 31 days to the pe x materials 2 to determine the compounds migrating from the different pipes in the drinking water by applying a gc ms screening method and in parallel to these tests 3 to evaluate the specific substances responsible for the odour in the migration waters by testing the migration water from the same pe x pipes with gc ms od and 4 to compare the results with a sensory test undertaken by a panel of 7 11 people 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in total 36 pipes from different material available for domestic plumbing system hd pe polyethylene of raised temperature resistance pe rt pe xa pe xb pe xc polypropylene pp polybutylene pb and polyvinyl chloride pvc were purchased on the local german market all of these pipes were certified by national certifying bodies depending on the inner diameter of the tested pipes three to five segments of similar length were necessary to prepare the required volume for the preparation of the migrating waters 2 2 dimensions of pe x pipes five pe x pipes were extensively investigated in this study some of them are multilayer pipes the designated pe x material is the inner layer which is in contact with the drinking water the dimension of the monolayer pe xa pipe was 20 mm 2 8 mm corresponding to an inner diameter i d of 14 4 mm the ratio between surface and water volume s v is 27 8 dm 1 the length of the test pieces was 3 m both pe xb materials have a dimension of 20 mm 2 0 mm corresponding to an inner diameter of 16 0 mm s v is 25 0 dm 1 and length of the test pieces was between 2 5 and 3 m the dimension of pe xc 1 was 20 mm 2 5 mm with an i d 15 0 mm the s v corresponds to 26 7 dm 1 and the length of the testes pieces was between two and 3 m the dimension of pe xc 2 was 20 mm 2 25 mm corresponding to an inner diameter of 15 5 mm and the s v 25 8 dm 1 the length of the test pieces was between 2 5 and 3 m all pe xb pipes and pe xc pipes have an aluminium layer which can be regarded as total barrier so that the outer layers will not impact the water quality which is in contact with the inner layers 2 3 preparation of the migration waters the migration waters were prepared according to en 1420 2015 and en 12873 1 2003 following the sequence presented in table 1 after a pre treatment procedure of flushing the migration procedure is carried out as follows for the ton test pieces are put in contact with unchlorinated drinking water for 72 h at 23 c cold water test and for 24 h at 60 c warm water test as shown in table 1 some migration periods lasted longer 96 h for cold water test 72 h for warm water test these migration waters were not used for analysis for the gc ms analyses the pipe segments were filled with freshly prepared ultrapure test water at the end of each migration period the migration waters obtained from the different pipe segments were directly transferred into cleaned glass bottles for the ton determination the gc ms screening and the gc ms od analyses for each next migration period test pieces were refilled with unchlorinated drinking water for the ton or with ultrapure water for the gc ms analyses blanks were also similarly prepared to check for any eventual external contamination 2 4 threshold odour number ton ton values of each water sample blank and migration waters were determined in accordance with en 1622 2006 using a dilution factor x 2 for the concentrations of the successive dilutions paired series of dilutions 200 ml each were presented in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks and the unforced choice test was performed using a minimum of 5 panellists the determined ton corresponds to the geometric mean of the strongest dilutions which were correctly identified by the individual panellist the panel used for the determination of the ton values was qualified for odour testing following en 1420 2015 blank waters should be free from odour in order to validate the test 2 5 gas chromatography mass spectrometry screening method semi quantitative the analytical procedure followed en 15768 2008 allowing the detection and the semi quantification of contaminants leaching from organic material migration water samples were extracted twice with dichloromethane at ph 2 and ph 10 after injection of nine isotopically labelled internal standards d6 benzene d5 chlorobenzene d21 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol d21 bht d34 hexadecane d8 naphthalene d10 phenanthrene d5 phenol d10 p xylene sigma aldrich germany and d62 squalane chemos germany the four extracts were then combined and dried over sodium sulphate an injection standard d10 1 methylnaphthalene campro scientific germany was added and the extract was reduced to a final volume of approximately 500 μl by evaporation provided that the loss of the most volatile standard d6 benzene was not more than 50 the technique used for the extraction was considered satisfactory the samples were finally transferred to an auto sampler vial and analysed with an agilent 6890 gc coupled to an agilent 5973 ms agilent technologies germany a volume of 1 μl was injected splitless at 250 c and separated by a db 5 ms column 60 m 0 25 mm x 0 25 μm with a helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the initial oven temperature was of 35 c and held for 4 min followed by an 8 c per minute temperature ramp to 300 c and held for 20 min the ms ionization was operated in scan mode over an m z range of 35 650 chemical identification was based on the national institute for standards and technology nist version 2 0 d agilent technologies germany given that the screening method focuses on all substances potentially detectable with the gc ms individual calibrations and limits of detection were not established therefore the concentrations determined with this screening method are given as semi quantitative and do not correspond to the exact concentrations hence they are used as an indication for the kinetics of formation potential substances that matched the quality of the computer aided library were verified with individual standards when available 2 6 surface area to volume ratio s v the surface area to volume ratio s v of the test pipe sample and the contact time used in the migration test according to en 12873 1 2003 differ from the real use of the end products in practice therefore the concentrations determined in the migration tests are converted to the maximal estimated concentration at the consumer s tap ctap following 1 ctap fc x cmeasured s v x t where fc is the factor of conversion for pipes with id 80 mm internal plumbing system here fc 20 d dm cmeasured is the concentration measured according to en 12873 1 2003 s v is the surface area to volume ratio in the test setup and t is the duration of the migration period in days the conversion factors are defined by uba in its ktw guideline and were harmonised between france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom 2 7 stir bar sorptive extraction gc ms od the compounds were extracted in parallel from three 100 ml migration water samples with polydimethylsiloxane pdms coated stir bars 20 mm 1 mm the stir bars called twisters are commercially available gerstel germany each sample was placed in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask with 30 g analytical grade sodium chloride nacl merck germany and stirred with a twister for 5 h at room temperature at 700 rpm after extraction each twister was rinsed with ultra pure water dried on a kimtech science precision wipe kimberly clark usa introduced into a glass thermal desorption tube and placed in a thermal desorption unit tdu analysis was performed on a 7890 gc combined with a 5975 mass selective detector msd agilent technologies germany and an olfactory detection port odp 3 gerstel germany the gc ms od system was confirmed with a tdu gerstel germany and a cooled injection system cis 4 gerstel germany the operating conditions were as follows to increase the sensitivity the three twisters of the sample aliquots were subsequently thermally desorbed in the splitless mode by programming the tdu from 40 c held for 0 5 min followed by a 120 c per minute temperature ramp to 220 c and held 10 min the desorbed solutes were cryofocused in the cis on a tenax 2 6 diphenyl p phenylene oxide trap at 40 c after desorption of the twisters the cis was programmed to 280 c at a rate of 12 c per second held 3 min injection was in splitless mode the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml min the compounds where separated on a 30 m 0 25 mm x 1 μm vf5ms capillary column varian usa the gc oven was programmed from 40 c 0 5 min to 60 c 0 1 min at a rate of 5 c per minute then to 165 c 0 1 min at a rate of 10 c per minute then to 300 c 5 min at a rate of 20 c per minute a splitter was placed at the end of the analytical column and the flow of the eluate was splited at the ratio of 1 1 so that the separated compounds reached both detectors msd and odp simultaneously permitting a comparison of both signals the msd was processed in full scan mode over an m z range of 13 300 amu a trained analyst was positioned at the end of the odp as human detector sensing with her nose each separated compound eluted by the gc column the aims of the analysts were to detect the presence of odour active compounds odour present or not to measure the duration of the odour activity beginning to end to describe the quality of the odour perceived and to quantify its intensity olfactograms were generated from the data input of the analyst by the odp software substances detected by both the msd and the analyst at the end of the odp were identified by their mass spectral data using a nist 11 mass spectral library agilent technologies germany to confirm these findings most of the chemicals thus identified were also verified with individual standards 3 results and discussion 3 1 pipe survey the results shown in fig 1 a and b show whether the tested pipes meet the hypothetical criteria ton 2 ton 4 ton 8 and ton 16 used respectively as pass fail criteria in different member states of the eu if the pipes failed the expected criteria within the first 10 days the products were then additionally tested for up to 31 days products that met the expected requirement of ton 2 ton 4 ton 8 and ton 16 within the first 10 days were not encompassed in the results of the 31st day the ton values for many of the pipes tested are high even after 31 days of exposure however the materials showed clear differences the cross linked pe pipes especially the pe xb pipes gave the highest ton values and many of these pipes do even not meet the maximal hypothetical criterion of ton 16 after 31 days consequently most of these products even the certified ones fail the german requirement and this is in line with the results of a round robin test that german testing institutions carried out with different certified products turković et al 2016 this highlights the need for a sound study of the pe x material in contact with drinking water other material such as hd pe pe rt pp pb and pvc were not further studied here as their ton values complied at least with ton 16 after 31 days of testing 3 2 threshold odour number ton of specific pe xa pe xb and pe xc pipes five representative pe x pipes one pe xa two pe xb and two pe xc were extensively investigated see 2 2 the ton values in the migration waters of the cold water test 23 c ranged from 5 0 to 83 and from 2 6 to 27 for the 10th day 3rd migration period and the 31st day 9th migration period respectively fig 2 the highest values were found for the pipes made of pe xb followed by pe xc and pe xa the warm water test 60 c showed considerable variation between the pe x material with ton values ranging from 3 6 to 279 for the 10th day 7th migration and from 1 3 to 45 for the 31st day 22nd migration with the highest value determined for the pe xb pipes also fig 3 the results of the warm water test are considerably higher than the ones for the cold water test except for the tested pipe made of pe xa for which the results of the warm water test are even lower than for the cold water test all the ton values decreased in the extended test both when processed with cold and with warm water previous studies skjevrak et al 2003 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 reported ton up to 75 in migration waters kept at room temperature or at 55 c however the pe x material investigated in our test showed significantly greater odour levels than those found in other studies the results also mean that all tested pipes fail the current german certification requirement of ton 2 and ton 4 for the cold and warm water test respectively institutions issuing the test reports for this certification also performed additional studies and confirmed non compliance of products on the market turković et al 2016 hence we suspect the product samples provided to the certifying institutions to have been specifically optimised for achieving certification this is possible e g by applying a post treatment step such as the exposure to air or water of higher temperatures for pe xb post treatment is necessary to obtain the desired crosslinking and for the other pe x grades it is exclusively applied to reduce the content of volatile substances in the material which cause the off flavours perceived in the distributed drinking water the present results together with those quoted above indicate that this post treatment may be skipped or at least reduced in routine production probably to save costs these results emphasise the need for proper inspection of the production facilities in the certification process and the guaranty that the institutions performing the tests for certification receive randomly chosen products from regular production 3 3 detection of selected contaminants from pe x material with gc ms screening analysis of the migration waters with the gc ms screening detected and semi quantified more than 50 compounds here we focus on selected contaminants also detected with the olfactory method gc ms od 3 3 1 potential release of contaminants from the pe xa pipe the migration waters of the pe xa pipe showed identified contaminants only detected in low concentrations the substances identified are tert butyl isopropyl ether 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone 2 6 dtbq 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione tert butyl isopropyl ether showed the highest concentration with 1 4 μg l in warm water and only for pe xa few studies koch 2004 lund et al 2011 reported contaminants specific to pe xa in which they detected 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione 5 methyl 2 hexanone and 2 6 dtbq the highest concentrations were found in the warm water test but the highest ton value was determined in the cold water test which indicates that the substances detected by gc ms analysis do not necessarily correspond to the substances impacting the odour 3 3 2 potential release of contaminants from the pe xb pipes five contaminants 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol 1 octanol 2 4 dtbp 3 5 di tert butyl hydroxybenzaldehyde and metilox were detected in all tests carried out with pe xb pipes pe xb 1 and pe xb 2 figs 4 and 5 with similar concentrations for the two pipes but no obvious trends of release concentrations of some of the substances decreased over time whereas the substances with the highest concentrations metilox and 2 4 dtbp showed rather constant patterns two of these five contaminants i e 1 octanol and 2 4 dtbp are often reported in the literature with concentrations up to 16 μg l and 5 μg l respectively skjevrak et al 2003 koch 2004 löschner et al 2011 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 ryssel et al 2015 in addition to these substances we also found 2 6 dtbq at a constant level and 2 2 5 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran in the warm water test of both pipes as well as 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde in water from both pipes methyl octanoate and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione for the cold and warm water test of pe xb 1 and in the warm water test of pe xb 2 löschner et al 2011 and kelley et al 2014 also reported 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione in the migration water from pe xb pipes finally we found additional contaminants which were material specific such as methyl hexanoate for pe xb 1 2 methyl 2 butanol and tert amyl methyl ether for pe xb 2 of which the last two were verified with individual standards while as expected the release of chemicals increased considerably with increasing temperature the concentration ratio of individual compounds measured in cold water to the one measure in warm water varied considerably i e by a factor ranging from 4 to 56 interestingly contaminants most released in warm water are not necessarily the ones found in cold water for example in the cold water test of pe xb 1 metilox is the compound determined at the highest concentration fig 4 a while in the warm water test it is 2 4 dtbp fig 4 b 3 3 3 potential release of contaminants from the pe xc pipes both pe xc pipes show similar release patterns figs 6 and 7 with 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dion and tert butyl acetate dominating with a decreasing trend over time indicating that their migration is limited by the diffusion of these substances in the material tert butyl acetate was only found for pe xc pipes and seems to be specific to this material the other substances show a constant release over time with the highest concentrations seen for 2 6 dtbq 0 4 μg l for the cold water test and 5 μg l for the warm water test followed by 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde the linear trend of their release indicates that their migration is dominated by the solubility of the substances in water these two substances are often reported in the literature as being two of the most frequently quantified compounds among the leachable substances from pe x pipes ryssel et al 2015 however this contrasts with our results showing higher concentrations for 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione and tert butyl acetate in addition to these compounds 2 tert butylphenol was detected in warm water from pe xc 1 fig 6 b and in cold and warm water from pe xc 2 fig 7 a and b 2 4 dtbp was only detected in warm water with similar levels for both materials while 2 hexanone was also measured in cold water in contact with pe xc 2 in warm water in contact with pe xc 2 we found 3 3 dimethyl 2 butanone 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol and traces of metilox this is in line with the findings of ryssel et al 2015 who detected levels of metilox up to 0 6 μg l in migration water from pe xc pipes overall the concentrations found for pe xc pipes are lower than for the pe xb pipes however the release specifically of 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dion is similar for both materials 3 3 4 origin of the contaminants in the present study four of the ten arvin substances were detected iii 2 6 dtbq iv 2 4 dtbp vi 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde and ix metilox their occurrence can have diverse reasons decomposition or reaction products of additives antioxidants reaction products formed during polymerization or cross binding impurities present in the materials 2 4 dtbp which was detected in pe xb und pe xc is an intermediate for the production of phosphite and phosphonite based anti oxidants like antioxidant 168 and may be an impurity of the additive pitteloud and dubs 1994 löschner et al 2011 proposed that the substance could also be formed by hydrolysis of the antioxidant 168 metilox detected mainly in pe xb is an intermediate for the production of the antioxidants 1010 and 1076 pitteloud and dubs 1994 and can also be a residual during the production of these antioxidants metilox is even used as additive irganox 1300 but it is not included in the european union list of the commission regulation on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food eu commission regulation 2011 metilox is also believed to be hydrolysed in its acid form which in a secondary reaction could be oxidized in 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione 2 6 dtbq and 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde found as migration substances from all materials can both be degradation products from the antioxidant bht 5 methyl 2 hexanone was detected only in migration water from pe xa and is a resin solvent kelley et al 2014 three substances are specific to pe xb 1 octanol which might be used as a manufacturing aid 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol and 2 2 5 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran are reaction products which might be formed during the cross binding process tert butyl acetate is specific to pe xc pipes and is a reaction product of vinyl acetate a substance used in the formulation 3 4 odour detection at this stage it remains unclear whether the substances found in the screening correlate with the ton values and we cannot conclude whether the contaminants are responsible for the odour perceived in the migration waters therefore additional analysis with the gc ms od method was carried out to understand the origin for these odours 3 4 1 detection with gc ms od method ten specific odours characterised the individual contaminants ethereal fresh solvent sweet fruity floral unsavoury pungent aromatics and chemical tables 2 4 for some of the contaminants no odour was perceived from pe xa material table 2 13 contaminants were detected with a specific odour for example 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone and 2 6 dtbq gave a sweet perception while the odour description of 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde was pungent this is in line with the findings of villberg et al 1997 who concluded that off flavour substances are carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes or ketones from pe xb table 3 11 contaminants were responsible for fresh ethereal unsavory sweet solvent aromatics pungent and chemical odour for example 2 methyl 2 butanol was perceived unsavoury while 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol was sweet one study durand and dietrich 2007 reported that pe xb contribute to a drinking water with a chemical solvent odour perceived as sweet or bitter with a strong burning sensation for pe xc table 4 14 contaminants contribute to an etheral solvent fruity sweet floral unsavoury chemical and pungent perception 3 4 2 confirmation of correlation odour concentration with odour sensory test because the samples were highly concentrated the amount of odour causing contaminants assessed may not correspond to the amount really leaching from the material and consequently they may have a different impact on the value of ton for a realistic scenario some contaminants were prepared individually in purified water and diluted at 1 μg l 10 μg l and 75 μg l for an odour sensory test with a panel of 7 11 people in addition the same experiment was carried out with a mixture solution specific to each material the results are presented in tables 2 4 for the analysis of pe xa less than 50 of the panellist were able to smell 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone 2 6 dtbq and 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde at a concentration below or equal to 10 μg l at 75 μg l most of the panellists did smell the contaminants except 2 6 dtbq perception differs between the panellists some gave a sweet note to 5 methyl 2 hexanone which is also the odour perceived with the gc ms od while 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde was perceived as fishy or slightly sweet panellists perceived mtbe at a concentration of 5 8 μg l en 1420 2015 by comparing the mixture solution with and without mtbe more than 50 of the panellists could detect an odour in all of the diluted solution while they did not detect it in the solution without mtbe therefore we can conclude that mtbe is one of the contaminants responsible for the malodorous perception in migration water from the pe xa pipe at a low concentration this is line with the findings of lund et al 2011 who reported mtbe as being a substance causing off flavours of pe x pipes mtbe is a very volatile molecule which cannot be detected with the gc ms screening method in migration water from pe xb 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol and 2 methyl 2 butanol were smelt additionally to 2 6dtbq und 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde although the ton value defined previously showed a significant odourous problem for this type of pipes the four contaminants and the mixture solution smelt here were detected by less than 50 of the panellists at concentration below or equal to 10 μg l however not all of the contaminants could be individually tested by the panel and other substances such as tert amyl methyl ether 2 2 2 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran toluene or xylene could also be responsible for the high ton value some of the substances such as toluene or xylene were not detected in the gc ms screening method table 3 in migration water from pe xc 67 of the panellists detected an odour for 2 tert butylphenol at a concentration of 10 μg l result of the mixture solution showed that most of the panellists perceived an odour at a concentration of 1 μg l interestingly a number of substances such as 2 4 dtbp metilox and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione which were found at higher concentrations with gc ms screening do not seem to be responsible for odour problems in drinking water therefore this results emphasises the complexity of chemicals leaching from household plumbing system materials and how difficult it is to assess their sensory characteristics 4 conclusions the pe x materials investigated showed significant high ton values in cold and warm migration waters which also means that most of the tested products failed the german requirement of ton 2 and ton 4 in cold and warm water respectively even if these products were certified the release of contaminants from pe xb material

18700,the formation potential of contaminants diffusing from cross linked polyethylene pe x pipes and their impact on the odour of drinking water was determined three types of pe x material pe xa pe xb and pe xc were extensively assessed by performing migration tests following en 1420 and en 12873 1 migration waters were analysed for their threshold odour number ton the same samples were investigated by two gas chromatography mass spectrometry methods screening and olfactometry most of the pe x materials failed the german regulation of ton 2 for cold water and ton 4 for warm water pe

and 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 dtbq were the most often detected substances leaching from the tested plastic materials however no odour was perceived for most of these substances methyl tert

environment agency umweltbundesamt 1 introduction cross linked polyethylene pe x pipes are increasingly used in household installations for the distribution of drinking water because of their flexibility durability corrosion resistance thermal stability and high tensile strength three methods are used to chemically bond cross link ethylene hydrocarbon chains one to another pe xa pipes are cross linked with organic peroxides in this process free radicals of the added peroxide initiate the cross linking for the production of pe xb pipes silanes are used and pe xc pipes are cross linked by irradiation processes baur et al 2013 despite many advantages the polyethylene materials were soon identified as a major contributors to the deterioration of taste and odour in drinking water anselme et al 1985 consequently the quality of pipes and others final products has been extensively investigated with standardised test methods rigal 1992 the european standard en 1420 2015 describes the preparation of migration waters leachates defined as test waters which have been in contact with test pieces under specific conditions and the procedure to determine the threshold odour number ton and the threshold flavour number tfn this standard includes a procedure for the qualification of the panel members to determine the threshold numbers rapp and günther 2015 the european drinking water directive dwd 98 83 ec 1998 states as requirements for odour and taste that drinking water shall be acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change shall occur to ensure this the german environment agency s uba guideline for hygienic assessment of organic materials in contact with drinking water ktw guideline 2016 requires a ton 2 and 4 for results of tests according to en 1420 in cold and warm water respectively these values are sufficiently low to ensure that the drinking water is free from odour when the tested products are in real use however past studies reported ton levels measured in migration waters from pe x pipes ranging from 0 to 128 ton skjevrak et al 2003 koch 2004 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 several number of research groups have investigated the release and origin of substances from plastic pipes adversely impacting drinking water odour and chemical quality a summary is given by whelton and nguyen 2013 an important class of substances that migrate into drinking water are reaction products of antioxidants stabilizers antioxidants are intentionally added to protect the material against oxidative degradation during its production processing final use and recycling pitteloud and dubs 1994 brocca et al 2002 identified ten substances migrating from pe pipes which show similarities with used antioxidants today these substances are known under the designation arvin i to x bertoldo and ciardelli 2004 and löschner et al 2011 proposed the reaction paths for the formation of some of them substances frequently identified in migration water include 2 6 di tert butyl p benzoquinone 2 6 dtbq iii 2 4 di tert butylphenol 2 4 dtbp iv 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde vi 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy acetophenone vii 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5

2004 löschner et al 2011 ryssel et al 2015 however it is unclear to which extend these are causative for off flavour perceived in drinking water despite the use of stabilizers oxidative degradation of the polymer can occur and will yield low molecular mass ketones aldehydes alcohols and carboxylic acids iring and tüdös 1990 andersson et al 2005 in addition to these degradation products residual monomers oligomers or other starting substances can leach into drinking water skjevrak et al 2003 lund et al 2011 anselme et al 1985 carried out a study to identify the substances causing odour in high density polyethylene hd pe pipes by applying gas chromatography gc with olfactometric detection and identified 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol bht 3 hexen 2 one 1 2 4 trimethyl 5 methyl ethylenbenzene and 1 2 4 trimethyl 5 isopropylbenzene as odourous compounds in the migration waters of pe pipes villberg et al 1997 combined gc coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms with olfactory detection gc ms od to investigate hd pe granules and chiefly characterised the compounds causing the off flavours as carbonyls aldehydes ketones and esters with odours described as sweet glue solvent mushroom or aldehydic lund et al 2011 qualified the odour of migration water in contact with pe x pipes as solvent like or plastic like and discussed methyl tert butyl ether mtbe as a substance causing off flavours of pe x pipes for the long term behaviour of these pipes the authors suspect that substances produced by biofilms in the pipes may also contribute to the odour recognised durand and dietrich 2007 identified ethyl tert butyl ether etbe as a contributor to the chemical solvent like odour of pe xb pipes kelley et al 2014 found that mtbe and etbe might be present in the migration water of different pe x types in concentrations above their odour detection thresholds however an odour was still perceived when these two substances were not present indicating that other substances are responsible for the odour together these studies show that only few substances were investigated for their off flavour in pe pipes today no one can say if the chemicals such as arvin viii or ix and many more also contribute to the odour degradation for which the measured concentrations can be quite significant so far there is no study reporting olfactory data specific to pe xa pe xb and pe xc this emphasises the need for a comprehensive and systematic study of specific pe x materials regarding causes of taste and odour perceived in the migration water this study investigated pipe samples from all three of the widely used pe x materials the objectives were 1 to determine the ton values measured in migration water exposed for 10 and 31 days to the pe x materials 2 to determine the compounds migrating from the different pipes in the drinking water by applying a gc ms screening method and in parallel to these tests 3 to evaluate the specific substances responsible for the odour in the migration waters by testing the migration water from the same pe x pipes with gc ms od and 4 to compare the results with a sensory test undertaken by a panel of 7 11 people 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials in total 36 pipes from different material available for domestic plumbing system hd pe polyethylene of raised temperature resistance pe rt pe xa pe xb pe xc polypropylene pp polybutylene pb and polyvinyl chloride pvc were purchased on the local german market all of these pipes were certified by national certifying bodies depending on the inner diameter of the tested pipes three to five segments of similar length were necessary to prepare the required volume for the preparation of the migrating waters 2 2 dimensions of pe x pipes five pe x pipes were extensively investigated in this study some of them are multilayer pipes the designated pe x material is the inner layer which is in contact with the drinking water the dimension of the monolayer pe xa pipe was 20 mm 2 8 mm corresponding to an inner diameter i d of 14 4 mm the ratio between surface and water volume s v is 27 8 dm 1 the length of the test pieces was 3 m both pe xb materials have a dimension of 20 mm 2 0 mm corresponding to an inner diameter of 16 0 mm s v is 25 0 dm 1 and length of the test pieces was between 2 5 and 3 m the dimension of pe xc 1 was 20 mm 2 5 mm with an i d 15 0 mm the s v corresponds to 26 7 dm 1 and the length of the testes pieces was between two and 3 m the dimension of pe xc 2 was 20 mm 2 25 mm corresponding to an inner diameter of 15 5 mm and the s v 25 8 dm 1 the length of the test pieces was between 2 5 and 3 m all pe xb pipes and pe xc pipes have an aluminium layer which can be regarded as total barrier so that the outer layers will not impact the water quality which is in contact with the inner layers 2 3 preparation of the migration waters the migration waters were prepared according to en 1420 2015 and en 12873 1 2003 following the sequence presented in table 1 after a pre treatment procedure of flushing the migration procedure is carried out as follows for the ton test pieces are put in contact with unchlorinated drinking water for 72 h at 23 c cold water test and for 24 h at 60 c warm water test as shown in table 1 some migration periods lasted longer 96 h for cold water test 72 h for warm water test these migration waters were not used for analysis for the gc ms analyses the pipe segments were filled with freshly prepared ultrapure test water at the end of each migration period the migration waters obtained from the different pipe segments were directly transferred into cleaned glass bottles for the ton determination the gc ms screening and the gc ms od analyses for each next migration period test pieces were refilled with unchlorinated drinking water for the ton or with ultrapure water for the gc ms analyses blanks were also similarly prepared to check for any eventual external contamination 2 4 threshold odour number ton ton values of each water sample blank and migration waters were determined in accordance with en 1622 2006 using a dilution factor x 2 for the concentrations of the successive dilutions paired series of dilutions 200 ml each were presented in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks and the unforced choice test was performed using a minimum of 5 panellists the determined ton corresponds to the geometric mean of the strongest dilutions which were correctly identified by the individual panellist the panel used for the determination of the ton values was qualified for odour testing following en 1420 2015 blank waters should be free from odour in order to validate the test 2 5 gas chromatography mass spectrometry screening method semi quantitative the analytical procedure followed en 15768 2008 allowing the detection and the semi quantification of contaminants leaching from organic material migration water samples were extracted twice with dichloromethane at ph 2 and ph 10 after injection of nine isotopically labelled internal standards d6 benzene d5 chlorobenzene d21 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol d21 bht d34 hexadecane d8 naphthalene d10 phenanthrene d5 phenol d10 p xylene sigma aldrich germany and d62 squalane chemos germany the four extracts were then combined and dried over sodium sulphate an injection standard d10 1 methylnaphthalene campro scientific germany was added and the extract was reduced to a final volume of approximately 500 μl by evaporation provided that the loss of the most volatile standard d6 benzene was not more than 50 the technique used for the extraction was considered satisfactory the samples were finally transferred to an auto sampler vial and analysed with an agilent 6890 gc coupled to an agilent 5973 ms agilent technologies germany a volume of 1 μl was injected splitless at 250 c and separated by a db 5 ms column 60 m 0 25 mm x 0 25 μm with a helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the initial oven temperature was of 35 c and held for 4 min followed by an 8 c per minute temperature ramp to 300 c and held for 20 min the ms ionization was operated in scan mode over an m z range of 35 650 chemical identification was based on the national institute for standards and technology nist version 2 0 d agilent technologies germany given that the screening method focuses on all substances potentially detectable with the gc ms individual calibrations and limits of detection were not established therefore the concentrations determined with this screening method are given as semi quantitative and do not correspond to the exact concentrations hence they are used as an indication for the kinetics of formation potential substances that matched the quality of the computer aided library were verified with individual standards when available 2 6 surface area to volume ratio s v the surface area to volume ratio s v of the test pipe sample and the contact time used in the migration test according to en 12873 1 2003 differ from the real use of the end products in practice therefore the concentrations determined in the migration tests are converted to the maximal estimated concentration at the consumer s tap ctap following 1 ctap fc x cmeasured s v x t where fc is the factor of conversion for pipes with id 80 mm internal plumbing system here fc 20 d dm cmeasured is the concentration measured according to en 12873 1 2003 s v is the surface area to volume ratio in the test setup and t is the duration of the migration period in days the conversion factors are defined by uba in its ktw guideline and were harmonised between france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom 2 7 stir bar sorptive extraction gc ms od the compounds were extracted in parallel from three 100 ml migration water samples with polydimethylsiloxane pdms coated stir bars 20 mm 1 mm the stir bars called twisters are commercially available gerstel germany each sample was placed in a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask with 30 g analytical grade sodium chloride nacl merck germany and stirred with a twister for 5 h at room temperature at 700 rpm after extraction each twister was rinsed with ultra pure water dried on a kimtech science precision wipe kimberly clark usa introduced into a glass thermal desorption tube and placed in a thermal desorption unit tdu analysis was performed on a 7890 gc combined with a 5975 mass selective detector msd agilent technologies germany and an olfactory detection port odp 3 gerstel germany the gc ms od system was confirmed with a tdu gerstel germany and a cooled injection system cis 4 gerstel germany the operating conditions were as follows to increase the sensitivity the three twisters of the sample aliquots were subsequently thermally desorbed in the splitless mode by programming the tdu from 40 c held for 0 5 min followed by a 120 c per minute temperature ramp to 220 c and held 10 min the desorbed solutes were cryofocused in the cis on a tenax 2 6 diphenyl p phenylene oxide trap at 40 c after desorption of the twisters the cis was programmed to 280 c at a rate of 12 c per second held 3 min injection was in splitless mode the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml min the compounds where separated on a 30 m 0 25 mm x 1 μm vf5ms capillary column varian usa the gc oven was programmed from 40 c 0 5 min to 60 c 0 1 min at a rate of 5 c per minute then to 165 c 0 1 min at a rate of 10 c per minute then to 300 c 5 min at a rate of 20 c per minute a splitter was placed at the end of the analytical column and the flow of the eluate was splited at the ratio of 1 1 so that the separated compounds reached both detectors msd and odp simultaneously permitting a comparison of both signals the msd was processed in full scan mode over an m z range of 13 300 amu a trained analyst was positioned at the end of the odp as human detector sensing with her nose each separated compound eluted by the gc column the aims of the analysts were to detect the presence of odour active compounds odour present or not to measure the duration of the odour activity beginning to end to describe the quality of the odour perceived and to quantify its intensity olfactograms were generated from the data input of the analyst by the odp software substances detected by both the msd and the analyst at the end of the odp were identified by their mass spectral data using a nist 11 mass spectral library agilent technologies germany to confirm these findings most of the chemicals thus identified were also verified with individual standards 3 results and discussion 3 1 pipe survey the results shown in fig 1 a and b show whether the tested pipes meet the hypothetical criteria ton 2 ton 4 ton 8 and ton 16 used respectively as pass fail criteria in different member states of the eu if the pipes failed the expected criteria within the first 10 days the products were then additionally tested for up to 31 days products that met the expected requirement of ton 2 ton 4 ton 8 and ton 16 within the first 10 days were not encompassed in the results of the 31st day the ton values for many of the pipes tested are high even after 31 days of exposure however the materials showed clear differences the cross linked pe pipes especially the pe xb pipes gave the highest ton values and many of these pipes do even not meet the maximal hypothetical criterion of ton 16 after 31 days consequently most of these products even the certified ones fail the german requirement and this is in line with the results of a round robin test that german testing institutions carried out with different certified products turković et al 2016 this highlights the need for a sound study of the pe x material in contact with drinking water other material such as hd pe pe rt pp pb and pvc were not further studied here as their ton values complied at least with ton 16 after 31 days of testing 3 2 threshold odour number ton of specific pe xa pe xb and pe xc pipes five representative pe x pipes one pe xa two pe xb and two pe xc were extensively investigated see 2 2 the ton values in the migration waters of the cold water test 23 c ranged from 5 0 to 83 and from 2 6 to 27 for the 10th day 3rd migration period and the 31st day 9th migration period respectively fig 2 the highest values were found for the pipes made of pe xb followed by pe xc and pe xa the warm water test 60 c showed considerable variation between the pe x material with ton values ranging from 3 6 to 279 for the 10th day 7th migration and from 1 3 to 45 for the 31st day 22nd migration with the highest value determined for the pe xb pipes also fig 3 the results of the warm water test are considerably higher than the ones for the cold water test except for the tested pipe made of pe xa for which the results of the warm water test are even lower than for the cold water test all the ton values decreased in the extended test both when processed with cold and with warm water previous studies skjevrak et al 2003 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 reported ton up to 75 in migration waters kept at room temperature or at 55 c however the pe x material investigated in our test showed significantly greater odour levels than those found in other studies the results also mean that all tested pipes fail the current german certification requirement of ton 2 and ton 4 for the cold and warm water test respectively institutions issuing the test reports for this certification also performed additional studies and confirmed non compliance of products on the market turković et al 2016 hence we suspect the product samples provided to the certifying institutions to have been specifically optimised for achieving certification this is possible e g by applying a post treatment step such as the exposure to air or water of higher temperatures for pe xb post treatment is necessary to obtain the desired crosslinking and for the other pe x grades it is exclusively applied to reduce the content of volatile substances in the material which cause the off flavours perceived in the distributed drinking water the present results together with those quoted above indicate that this post treatment may be skipped or at least reduced in routine production probably to save costs these results emphasise the need for proper inspection of the production facilities in the certification process and the guaranty that the institutions performing the tests for certification receive randomly chosen products from regular production 3 3 detection of selected contaminants from pe x material with gc ms screening analysis of the migration waters with the gc ms screening detected and semi quantified more than 50 compounds here we focus on selected contaminants also detected with the olfactory method gc ms od 3 3 1 potential release of contaminants from the pe xa pipe the migration waters of the pe xa pipe showed identified contaminants only detected in low concentrations the substances identified are tert butyl isopropyl ether 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone 2 6 dtbq 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione tert butyl isopropyl ether showed the highest concentration with 1 4 μg l in warm water and only for pe xa few studies koch 2004 lund et al 2011 reported contaminants specific to pe xa in which they detected 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione 5 methyl 2 hexanone and 2 6 dtbq the highest concentrations were found in the warm water test but the highest ton value was determined in the cold water test which indicates that the substances detected by gc ms analysis do not necessarily correspond to the substances impacting the odour 3 3 2 potential release of contaminants from the pe xb pipes five contaminants 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol 1 octanol 2 4 dtbp 3 5 di tert butyl hydroxybenzaldehyde and metilox were detected in all tests carried out with pe xb pipes pe xb 1 and pe xb 2 figs 4 and 5 with similar concentrations for the two pipes but no obvious trends of release concentrations of some of the substances decreased over time whereas the substances with the highest concentrations metilox and 2 4 dtbp showed rather constant patterns two of these five contaminants i e 1 octanol and 2 4 dtbp are often reported in the literature with concentrations up to 16 μg l and 5 μg l respectively skjevrak et al 2003 koch 2004 löschner et al 2011 lund et al 2011 kelley et al 2014 ryssel et al 2015 in addition to these substances we also found 2 6 dtbq at a constant level and 2 2 5 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran in the warm water test of both pipes as well as 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde in water from both pipes methyl octanoate and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione for the cold and warm water test of pe xb 1 and in the warm water test of pe xb 2 löschner et al 2011 and kelley et al 2014 also reported 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione in the migration water from pe xb pipes finally we found additional contaminants which were material specific such as methyl hexanoate for pe xb 1 2 methyl 2 butanol and tert amyl methyl ether for pe xb 2 of which the last two were verified with individual standards while as expected the release of chemicals increased considerably with increasing temperature the concentration ratio of individual compounds measured in cold water to the one measure in warm water varied considerably i e by a factor ranging from 4 to 56 interestingly contaminants most released in warm water are not necessarily the ones found in cold water for example in the cold water test of pe xb 1 metilox is the compound determined at the highest concentration fig 4 a while in the warm water test it is 2 4 dtbp fig 4 b 3 3 3 potential release of contaminants from the pe xc pipes both pe xc pipes show similar release patterns figs 6 and 7 with 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dion and tert butyl acetate dominating with a decreasing trend over time indicating that their migration is limited by the diffusion of these substances in the material tert butyl acetate was only found for pe xc pipes and seems to be specific to this material the other substances show a constant release over time with the highest concentrations seen for 2 6 dtbq 0 4 μg l for the cold water test and 5 μg l for the warm water test followed by 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde the linear trend of their release indicates that their migration is dominated by the solubility of the substances in water these two substances are often reported in the literature as being two of the most frequently quantified compounds among the leachable substances from pe x pipes ryssel et al 2015 however this contrasts with our results showing higher concentrations for 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione and tert butyl acetate in addition to these compounds 2 tert butylphenol was detected in warm water from pe xc 1 fig 6 b and in cold and warm water from pe xc 2 fig 7 a and b 2 4 dtbp was only detected in warm water with similar levels for both materials while 2 hexanone was also measured in cold water in contact with pe xc 2 in warm water in contact with pe xc 2 we found 3 3 dimethyl 2 butanone 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl alcohol and traces of metilox this is in line with the findings of ryssel et al 2015 who detected levels of metilox up to 0 6 μg l in migration water from pe xc pipes overall the concentrations found for pe xc pipes are lower than for the pe xb pipes however the release specifically of 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dion is similar for both materials 3 3 4 origin of the contaminants in the present study four of the ten arvin substances were detected iii 2 6 dtbq iv 2 4 dtbp vi 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde and ix metilox their occurrence can have diverse reasons decomposition or reaction products of additives antioxidants reaction products formed during polymerization or cross binding impurities present in the materials 2 4 dtbp which was detected in pe xb und pe xc is an intermediate for the production of phosphite and phosphonite based anti oxidants like antioxidant 168 and may be an impurity of the additive pitteloud and dubs 1994 löschner et al 2011 proposed that the substance could also be formed by hydrolysis of the antioxidant 168 metilox detected mainly in pe xb is an intermediate for the production of the antioxidants 1010 and 1076 pitteloud and dubs 1994 and can also be a residual during the production of these antioxidants metilox is even used as additive irganox 1300 but it is not included in the european union list of the commission regulation on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food eu commission regulation 2011 metilox is also believed to be hydrolysed in its acid form which in a secondary reaction could be oxidized in 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione 2 6 dtbq and 3 5 di tert hydroxybenzaldehyde found as migration substances from all materials can both be degradation products from the antioxidant bht 5 methyl 2 hexanone was detected only in migration water from pe xa and is a resin solvent kelley et al 2014 three substances are specific to pe xb 1 octanol which might be used as a manufacturing aid 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol and 2 2 5 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran are reaction products which might be formed during the cross binding process tert butyl acetate is specific to pe xc pipes and is a reaction product of vinyl acetate a substance used in the formulation 3 4 odour detection at this stage it remains unclear whether the substances found in the screening correlate with the ton values and we cannot conclude whether the contaminants are responsible for the odour perceived in the migration waters therefore additional analysis with the gc ms od method was carried out to understand the origin for these odours 3 4 1 detection with gc ms od method ten specific odours characterised the individual contaminants ethereal fresh solvent sweet fruity floral unsavoury pungent aromatics and chemical tables 2 4 for some of the contaminants no odour was perceived from pe xa material table 2 13 contaminants were detected with a specific odour for example 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone and 2 6 dtbq gave a sweet perception while the odour description of 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde was pungent this is in line with the findings of villberg et al 1997 who concluded that off flavour substances are carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes or ketones from pe xb table 3 11 contaminants were responsible for fresh ethereal unsavory sweet solvent aromatics pungent and chemical odour for example 2 methyl 2 butanol was perceived unsavoury while 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol was sweet one study durand and dietrich 2007 reported that pe xb contribute to a drinking water with a chemical solvent odour perceived as sweet or bitter with a strong burning sensation for pe xc table 4 14 contaminants contribute to an etheral solvent fruity sweet floral unsavoury chemical and pungent perception 3 4 2 confirmation of correlation odour concentration with odour sensory test because the samples were highly concentrated the amount of odour causing contaminants assessed may not correspond to the amount really leaching from the material and consequently they may have a different impact on the value of ton for a realistic scenario some contaminants were prepared individually in purified water and diluted at 1 μg l 10 μg l and 75 μg l for an odour sensory test with a panel of 7 11 people in addition the same experiment was carried out with a mixture solution specific to each material the results are presented in tables 2 4 for the analysis of pe xa less than 50 of the panellist were able to smell 5 methyl 2 hexanone acetophenone 2 6 dtbq and 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde at a concentration below or equal to 10 μg l at 75 μg l most of the panellists did smell the contaminants except 2 6 dtbq perception differs between the panellists some gave a sweet note to 5 methyl 2 hexanone which is also the odour perceived with the gc ms od while 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde was perceived as fishy or slightly sweet panellists perceived mtbe at a concentration of 5 8 μg l en 1420 2015 by comparing the mixture solution with and without mtbe more than 50 of the panellists could detect an odour in all of the diluted solution while they did not detect it in the solution without mtbe therefore we can conclude that mtbe is one of the contaminants responsible for the malodorous perception in migration water from the pe xa pipe at a low concentration this is line with the findings of lund et al 2011 who reported mtbe as being a substance causing off flavours of pe x pipes mtbe is a very volatile molecule which cannot be detected with the gc ms screening method in migration water from pe xb 3 methyl 3 buten 1 ol and 2 methyl 2 butanol were smelt additionally to 2 6dtbq und 3 5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde although the ton value defined previously showed a significant odourous problem for this type of pipes the four contaminants and the mixture solution smelt here were detected by less than 50 of the panellists at concentration below or equal to 10 μg l however not all of the contaminants could be individually tested by the panel and other substances such as tert amyl methyl ether 2 2 2 5 tetramethyltetrahydrofuran toluene or xylene could also be responsible for the high ton value some of the substances such as toluene or xylene were not detected in the gc ms screening method table 3 in migration water from pe xc 67 of the panellists detected an odour for 2 tert butylphenol at a concentration of 10 μg l result of the mixture solution showed that most of the panellists perceived an odour at a concentration of 1 μg l interestingly a number of substances such as 2 4 dtbp metilox and 7 9 di tert butyl 1 oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8 dione which were found at higher concentrations with gc ms screening do not seem to be responsible for odour problems in drinking water therefore this results emphasises the complexity of chemicals leaching from household plumbing system materials and how difficult it is to assess their sensory characteristics 4 conclusions the pe x materials investigated showed significant high ton values in cold and warm migration waters which also means that most of the tested products failed the german requirement of ton 2 and ton 4 in cold and warm water respectively even if these products were certified the release of contaminants from pe xb material

18701,the photo fenton process application to eliminate carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae an antibiotic resistant priority pathogen was evaluated initially reagents concentration effect was tested and under suitable conditions 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 complete bacteria inactivation by action of hydroxyl radical and uva plus hydrogen peroxide was achieved at 120 min the process presented a strong residual disinfecting effect when light was turned off at only 20 min besides the cultivability of treated k pneumoniae in a selective medium containing carbapenem antibiotics was considered bla kpc gene responsible for the resistance evolution was also assessed the bacteria response to carbapenem antibiotics was higher as the treatment time increased in turn bla kpc gene remained when k pneumoniae was completely inactivated 120 min nevertheless treatment times longer than 120 min diminished bla kpc presence finally the photo fenton process and its modifications citric acid addition or persulfate anion instead hydrogen peroxide were applied to a real hospital wastewater in colombia in such complex matrix the conventional photo fenton system reached a moderate disinfection 3 5 log units at 300 min meanwhile in presence of citric acid total inactivation was completed at the same time interestingly the h2o2 substitution by persulfate strongly accelerated the microorganism elimination achieving the 6 log units reduction after only 60 min of process action thus the effective elimination of k pneumoniae from water by the modified photo fenton evidenced the potential applicability of this process to limit the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords water disinfection photochemical process residual action of treatment resistant bacteria elimination advanced oxidation process 1 introduction nowadays antibiotic resistant bacteria arb represent a serious concern to human health in fact diseases produced by these microorganisms are rising up worldwide bell 2003 dai et al 2012 world health organization who has classified bacterial resistance as one of the greatest threats of public health in the 21st century who 2014 arb microorganisms with singular structural features production of extracellular polymers alteration of membrane lipids and cell aggregation that make them very resistant to several treatments as the case of klebsiella pneumoniae venieri et al 2016 demand particular attention indeed k pneumoniae kpc producing is one of the most important virulent and opportunist antibiotic resistant pathogens kpc producing bacteria are often multi drug resistant including last resort therapeutic options such as carbapenem antibiotics deleo et al 2014 livermore et al 2013 a main source of arb e g carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae and antibiotic resistant genes arg are effluents from hospitals chitnis et al 2000 hocquet et al 2016 it is recognized that in many low income countries e g colombia hospital wastewaters without any previous treatment reach superficial and ground waters rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 also it is well known the inability of conventional systems used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp to eliminate arb and arg indeed biological processes may contribute to both the generation of arb and horizontal transfer of arg between bacteria communities rizzo et al 2013 thus as hospital wastewaters and wwtp effluents end up into the environment they can promote antibiotic resistance proliferation and as a consequence the spreading of uncontrollable infections on the other hand classical processes such as chlorination show high disinfecting ability on arb but they have low action on arg yuan et al 2015 additionally chlorination based systems lead to formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps with potential negative health effects furst et al 2018 hrudey 2009 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 which limits such systems application also water treatment using uvc irradiation has been applied exhibiting strong action on arb nevertheless the results indicate that uvc is limited in its ability to destroy arg and other disinfection processes should be explored mckinney and pruden 2012 promising alternatives to eliminate both arb and arg are the advanced oxidation processes aop e g photo fenton which are based on the production and utilization of radical species photo fenton process which comprises the interaction of iron ions with hydrogen peroxide and light fe2 3 h2o2 light have shown to be a useful system for the elimination of problematic microorganisms e g bacteria fungi protozoa and viruses giannakis et al 2017 marjanovic et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2015 rubio et al 2013 interestingly the performance of photo fenton process can be significantly improved by addition of organic acids or the substitution of hydrogen peroxide by other radical sources marjanovic et al 2018 villegas guzman et al 2017b in recent researches photo fenton process has been successfully applied to treat water containing antibiotic resistant bacteria giannakis et al 2018a however this system has not been utilized for elimination of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae which has resistance to last resort therapeutic options in addition under our knowledge the disinfection of hospital wastewater containing arb has not been tested furthermore the previous works did not consider the process improvement through addition of citric acid or the substitution of hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion in this work the treatment of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae and its arg using the photo fenton process at near neutral ph was evaluated initially the suitable reagents concentrations for elimination of the resistant k pneumoniae were established through variations of ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide amounts the involvement of direct photolysis h2o2 fenton fe2 h2o2 reaction and uva combined with h2o2 in the bacteria inactivation was determined besides the residual effect of the treatment when light is switched off and the response of treated k pneumoniae to carbapenem antibiotics were assessed furthermore the evolution of resistance gene during and after the microorganism inactivation was followed also photo fenton process was applied to eliminate the resistant bacteria from a real effluent a hospital wastewater previously bio treated finally the initial photo fenton system was modified by the addition of citric acid or by replacing hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion to enhance the k pneumoniae elimination in such complex matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents hydrogen peroxide sodium persulfate sodium chloride potassium chloride ammonium molybdate glucose kjeldahl catalyst nitric acid boric acid hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid stannous chloride plate count agar pca isopropanol and ethanol were purchased from merck ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and potassium iodide were provided by panreac all the solutions were prepared with ultra pure millipore milli q water chromogenic agar chromid carba was obtained from biomérieux reagents for conventional pcr and q pcr ssofasttmevagreen supermix were purchased from bioline and bio rad respectively carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae kpc producing was obtained from the microbial strain collections of microba group from universidad de antioquia medellín colombia the bacteria belong to clonal complex 258 and st512 harboring the bla kpc3 gene 2 2 reaction system experiments were performed in a homemade aluminum reflective reactor equipped with a set of five opaluz uva lamps 20 w each one with main emission at 365 nm the actual intensity provided by the system was 3 9 w m 2 this was determined using a solar pma2000 radiometer water samples 150 ml placed in beakers under magnetic stirring were illuminated before treatment the samples were inoculated by adding 1500 μl of a stock solution of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae to obtain 106 cfu ml 1 of initial bacteria concentration the initial experiments were developed in distilled water the final experiments were carried out in a hospital wastewater from tumaco nariño colombia previously bio treated as indicated in text sm1 each disinfection experiment was carried out at least by duplicate thus the average of measurements and their corresponding standard deviations error bars in the plots were reported 2 3 analyses the disinfecting action of process was measured by cell viability count on petri dishes plastic 9 cm diameter containing pca successive dilutions were made using a saline solution with 8 g l 1 nacl and 0 8 g l 1 kcl to ensure countable numbers on the plates the plates were incubated at 37 c for 18 24 h for the colonies counting evolution of hydrogen peroxide was monitored by measurement of absorbance at 420 nm using a uv5 mettler toledo spectrophotometer after the reaction of sample 1000 μl previously filtered using 0 45 μm mesh to remove microorganisms with titanium oxysulfate 1 2 1000 μl prepared according to eisenberg 1943 persulfate evolution was estimated by iodometry method by adding an aliquot of 600 μl of sample previously filtered using 0 45 μm mesh into a quartz cell containing 1350 μl of potassium iodide 0 1 m and 50 μl of ammonium molybdate 0 01 m after 10 min of reaction the absorbance at 350 nm was measured with a uv5 mettler toledo spectrophotometer soluble iron was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a shimadzu aa 7000 instrument prior to analysis the sample 50 ml was filtered 0 22 μm mesh followed by addition of 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid then the liquid was heated until evaporation of 20 ml and the residue was completed at 50 ml with distilled water to carry out the measurement in the instrument residual effect of process on bacteria was monitored by samples storage in 1 5 ml eppendorf caps in dark at room temperature during 24 and 48 h of treatment after storage cell viability was determined by colonies counting in pca petri dishes the response to carbapenem antibiotics of bacteria after a defined treatment time was estimated according to our previous work serna galvis et al 2018 the ratio r between the cfu in chromid carba which typically contains 3 mg of carbapenems antibiotics non specified by the manufacturer and cfu in pca was calculated eq 1 as an indicator of the response of treated bacteria to carbapenem antibiotics 1 r cfu ml 1 in chromid carba cfu ml 1 in pca for pcr analyses the dna extraction was carried out as follows samples of 6 ml were sonicated during 90 min in an e15h emasonic instrument pure isopropanol 4500 μl was added to the samples and subsequently centrifuged the supernatant was discarded then ethanol 70 v v 4500 μl was added samples with ethanol were also exposed to centrifugation process and the supernatants were discarded finally the obtained dna was rehydrated during 1 h to 65 c adding a dna rehydration solution of genomic dna purification kit from wizard the detection of bla kpc3 gene which encodes for the carbapenems resistance was carried using conventional pcr and q pcr according to protocol described by poirel et al 2017 a ssofasttmevagreen supermix instrument was used to detect the dna product in qpcr for the bio treated hospital wastewater ph was measured directly using an ab15 accumet basic ph meter conductivity was determined by direct measurement using a lab945 si analytics conductimeter absorbance at 365 nm of the water sample was established by direct measurement using a uv5 mettler toledo spectrophotometer dissolved organic carbon doc was measured in a shimadzu toc l analyzer doc was determined by catalytic oxidation at 680 c using high purity compressed air as a carrying gas and a non dispersive infrared detector calibration curve for the doc analysis was prepared with standard glucose solutions total solids were determined by

methods 4500 p a sample of hww 50 ml was submitted to digestion with sulfo nitric acidic mixture after digestion the reactive phosphorous was determined by a spectrophotometric method reaction with ammonium molybdate stannous chloride and absorbance measurement at 690 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe ii h2o2 ratio on inactivation of the antibiotic resistant k pneumoniae to establish suitable concentrations of reagents for the elimination of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae ferrous ion at 1 2 and 5 mg l 1 and hydrogen peroxide at 25 and 50 mg l 1 were initially considered fig 1 presents the remaining bacterial population after 60 min of treatment for the variations of reagents it can be observed that using 1 mg l 1 and 25 mg l 1 of ferrous ion and h2o2 respectively a very high amount of k pneumoniae persisted i e a low inactivation was observed when ferrous ion concentration was augmented to 2 mg l 1 the bacteria cultivability was decreased to 1 5 log units however the increasing of hydrogen peroxide concentration from 25 to 50 mg l 1 remaining fe2 at 2 mg l 1 did not provide a considerably improvement in the bacterial inactivation meanwhile when 5 mg l 1 of ferrous ions and 50 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide were used the lowest remaining bacterial population was observed which means that such reagents concentrations induced the highest disinfection the little inactivation at the lowest iron ii and hydrogen peroxide concentrations could be associated to morphological factors of k pneumoniae this bacterium exhibits a prominent capsule paczosa and mecsas 2016 which exerts a protective action on the microorganism against attacks of the hydroxyl radical generated by photo fenton process thus it is required a superior amount of radicals to produce a faster inactivation indeed the increasing of iron ii and hydrogen peroxide concentrations may induce a higher formation of hydroxyl radicals ho eqs 2 and 3 and consequently the bacteria inactivation is augmented as evidenced in fig 1 nevertheless it should be remarked that very high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or iron could limit photo fenton process efficiency due to scavenging effects on radicals eqs 4 and 5 giannakis et al 2016a considering the results in fig 1 concentrations of 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 equivalent to an 1 10 ratio in mg l 1 of fe2 h2o2 are the suitable conditions for disinfection of water containing the resistant bacteria interestingly a previous work on disinfection by photo fenton process has also shown that an 1 10 ratio in mg l 1 of fe2 h2o2 presents a good performance for e coli elimination from water rubio et al 2013 therefore in this research the subsequent experiments were developed using 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 at this point it can be indicated that the variation in concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 presented in fig 1 is the first approach to found the suitable conditions of the treatment however to establish optimal conditions surface response methodology should be carried out which involves more levels of the variables i e experimental design and is a useful tool to systematically study disinfection processes huang et al 2018 this is an interesting topic to be considered in future works about inactivation of arb by photo fenton process 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 3 fe3 h2o uva fe2 ho h 4 h2o2 ho h2o hoo 5 fe2 ho fe3 oh 3 2 establishing the participation of the process components on bacteria inactivation in photo fenton process subsystems such as uva light h2o2 fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 and uva combined with h2o2 uva h2o2 can be involved in the bacteria elimination giannakis et al 2016a 2016b therefore the action of such subsystems on the k pneumoniae was determined and compared with photo fenton fig 2 a it can be noted that the photo fenton process required 120 min to completely inactivate the bacteria whereas in the same period uva alone had no significant disinfecting effect the combination uva h2o2 did not show a considerable bacteria inactivation after 120 min of treatment interestingly at 180 min of treatment this subsystem decreased 2 7 log units of k pneumoniae in turn the sole action of hydrogen peroxide eliminated 2 1 log units after 180 min of contact with the resistant bacteria figure sm1 it is well known that uva light alone is able to induce both direct action on dna or enzymes and indirect promoting internal oxidative processes damages to bacteria giannakis et al 2016b however such damages are cumulative and they are mainly reflected after long periods of bacteria exposure to uva irradiation or under high radiation intensities giannakis et al 2016a this explains the low inactivation of k pneumoniae by the use of the sole light action fig 2a figure sm1 depicts the disinfecting action of the h2o2 alone on k pneumoniae as seen it was observed a moderate bacteria inactivation the h2o2 is a conventional oxidizing agent e 1 4 v it is less powerful than ho utilized in microorganisms disinfection processes giannakis et al 2016b indeed it is reported that hydrogen peroxide promotes the lipid peroxidation of cells siddique et al 2012 inducing cytoplasm membrane damages raffellini et al 2011 furthermore h2o2 can penetrate cells imlay 2011 spuhler et al 2010 promoting an internal oxidative stress halliwell and aruoma 1991 spuhler et al 2010 which may explain the disinfection by h2o2 alone figure sm1 under our experimental conditions a hydrogen peroxide homolysis by the light action to produce radicals is not possible as shown in figure sm2 the uva lamp emission spectrum has no intersection with h2o2 absorption but the h2o2 in the surroundings of the bacteria can diffuse through membranes which is supported by the consumption of hydrogen peroxide in the uva h2o2 system fig 2b the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into the cell plus light irradiation could induce internal photo fenton reaction giannakis et al 2016b in addition to direct action of h2o2 as a consequence after 180 min k pneumoniae population was decreased 2 7 log units using the uva h2o2 subsystem fig 2a on the other hand the fe2 h2o2 combination fenton system presented a significant bacteria inactivation in the first 20 min of treatment but after this time the process reached a plateau in the fenton system the interaction between ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radical is very fast eq 2 k 53 76 l mol 1 s 1 but the regeneration of iron ii is significantly slower eq 6 k 10 6 10 2 l mol 1 s 1 pignatello et al 2006 for this reason after the initial step eq 2 the production of radicals is low and consequently the disinfection is practically stopped this fact was confirmed by the evolution of h2o2 fig 2b which exhibited a fast initial decreasing but after 90 min the h2o2 consumption was stopped in contrast to the fenton system the uva in the photo fenton process accelerates the fe2 regeneration and this increases the amount of hydroxyl radical available eq 3 to attack the bacteria indeed photo fenton process had the highest h2o2 consumption fig 2b confirming the superior production of ho promoted by the uva light addition to the fenton system consequently a complete k pneumoniae elimination was obtained by photo fenton 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 hoo h considering all the above results in fig 2c is summarized the possible k pneumoniae inactivation routes which are detailed as follows a uva action on the internal constituents e g dna and enzymes which promotes cell dysfunctions giannakis et al 2016b however under work conditions uva effects would be more evident at very high treatment times b external oxidizing action by hydrogen peroxide which can induce damages on bacteria membrane decreasing the microorganism population figure sm1 c internal effects of h2o2 hydrogen peroxide can penetrate bacteria and interact with uva and metals in cytosol as iron and copper porcheron et al 2013 producing ho inside cell which inactivates k pneumoniae fig 2a d the combination fe2 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 uva which generates hydroxyl radical externally due the high oxidizing power of ho such species induce strong damages on bacteria which is reflected by high bacteria inactivation even at short treatment periods fig 2a it should be mentioned that in photo fenton system the a b and c routes are also plausible at this point it can be indicated that although the h2o2 uva h2o2 and fenton components are able to promote bacteria inactivations photo fenton system had the best ability for eliminating the resistant bacteria our results are consistent with literature on inactivation of microorganisms in water by photo fenton process giannakis et al 2016c moncayo lasso et al 2009 rubio et al 2013 there it is also reported that the combination fe2 h2o2 light is more efficient than light h2o2 for water disinfection due to the high ability of the photo fenton system to produce hydroxyl radical moreover it can be indicated that similar to non resistant bacteria the considered carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae was effectively inactivated by the ho action this highlights the applicability and good performance of photo fenton process to eliminate both non resistant bacteria and arb from water 3 3 evaluation of residual action of process on bacteria after the discussion of subsystems role on bacteria elimination the residual action of the photo fenton system i e the continuation of the disinfecting action when uva light is switched off on treated k pneumoniae was established fig 3 the residual effects were analyzed at 20 and 60 min of treatment also the control experiment no treatment 0 min in fig 3 was carried out the control test shows that even after 2880 min 48 h without water treatment the bacterial population remained unchanged this means that k pneumoniae is not affected by osmotic pressure exerted by the aqueous medium spuhler et al 2010 however at only 20 min of photo fenton application and after 1440 min 24 h of irradiation cessation the process had a strong residual effect this indicates that k pneumoniae inactivation was completed under dark conditions similarly an intense residual effect was observed when bacteria cells were exposed to photo fenton process during 60 min fig 3 the above results can be rationalized considering that the radicals generated by photo fenton strongly injured the bacteria before the light switch off and some processes continued in dark hydroxyl radical can attack the external cellular constituents e g proteins sugars or lipids of k pneumoniae and enhance the permeability of bacteria spuhler et al 2010 thus injured bacteria are vulnerable and under dark conditions fenton process produced by residual iron and hydrogen peroxide and h2o2 can complete the microorganism inactivation the residual fenton reagents can generate disinfecting species ho eq 2 and hoo eq 6 which may attack the antibiotic resistant k pneumoniae in dark furthermore residual h2o2 could penetrate easier the injured bacteria and because of its oxidizing ability hydrogen peroxide can react with inner bacterial bio molecules this reagent can also induce fenton process within the cell giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2013 from fig 3 it can be also noted that at 120 min of photo fenton application when the bacterial population is decreased to zero and the uva irradiation is ceased there was no a recovery of the bacteria even after 48 h in dark i e bacteria regrowth was no observed from this two aspects can be highlighted the residual reagents continued exerting a disinfecting role and the processes induced irreparable damages to k pneumoniae ndounla et al 2013 thus the results of this section reveal that the combination of pretreatment with photo fenton plus the residual effects of hydrogen peroxide and iron avoid the bacteria recovery giannakis et al 2018a 2018b it is worthy to indicate that similar to above results for carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae residual effects and no regrowth during treatment by photo fenton process of others arb antibiotic resistant e coli and s aureus have been observed giannakis et al 2018a 2018b in fact it has been reported that when light is turned off after a given treatment time damages are very severe and hindered the ability of bacteria to multiply leading to the population decreasing additionally the non regrowth after total inactivation of the arb is also related to irreversible changes produced in the cells this demonstrates the efficiency of photo fenton system for the elimination of arb as carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae even if the light is switched off at short treatment periods 3 4 evolution of bacteria response to carbapenem antibiotics and action of process on resistance gene to analyze the response of k pneumoniae to carbapenem antibiotics during photo fenton process the r value was determined as indicated in section 2 3 fig 4 a compares the response at three points of treatment 0 20 and 60 min before the process application i e 0 min as expected the r value was one which indicates that the carbapenem antibiotics in the specific media culture had no effect on bacteria meanwhile for the other two treatment times 20 and 60 min the r values were lower than one also it can be observed that the r value of the treated bacteria was lower as the time increased this means that the susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics e g ertapenem imipenem and meropenem of the k pneumoniae submitted to photo fenton is increased with the treatment time therefore it can be proposed that the aop injured the bacteria and as a consequence the k pneumoniae growth in culture media with antibiotics was lower than in the conventional agar pca valero et al 2017 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes have been effective for eliminating diverse types of antibiotic resistant bacteria however the resistance may remain even after treatment giannakis et al 2018a serna galvis et al 2018 additionally dead bacteria can transfer the genes encoding for antibiotic resistance to environmental microorganisms promoting the resistance spread ferro et al 2017 venieri et al 2016 hence during treatment of arb the evolution of such genes should be followed to evaluate the fate of bla kpc gene which encodes the carbapenem resistance in the considered k pneumoniae during and after the bacteria elimination by photo fenton process pcr was initially used to amplify such gene fig 4b depicts evolution of bla kpc gene at different treatment times 0 60 120 and 240 min the signal intensity associated to the gene is decreased with the process application time suggesting the degradation of bla kpc by photo fenton then to confirm the process action on the gene q pcr was used and the cycle threshold ct was determined fig 4c ct parameter is an indicator of relative gene concentration in the pcr reaction and its value is inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample thermo fisher scientific 2016 from fig 4c it can be observed that ct increased in the course of treatment confirming the results obtained by conventional pcr at this point it must be indicated that although the microorganism was completely inactivated after 120 min of treatment fig 2 the gene encoding for antibiotic resistance remained at such time indeed the gene was not totally degraded even after 240 min of photo fenton action fig 4b which suggests that resistance transference is still plausible thus under our working conditions treatment times higher than 240 min are required to guarantee the complete bla kpc degradation the treatment action on arg is a positive fact which has been also evidenced in a previous paper about the application of photo fenton for treating another arb e coli giannakis et al 2018a this points out that due to the non selectivity of photo fenton process it has activity on diverse arg which could limit the antibiotic resistances proliferation 3 5 homologous photo fenton system and application of the process to a complex matrix due to the efficiency of disinfection by photo fenton is dependent on the water matrix giannakis et al 2016a the ability of this process to eliminate k pneumoniae from a real complex matrix a bio treated hospital wastewater global characteristics are presented in table sm1 was tested as depicted in fig 5 after 300 min of photo fenton application this system reduced 3 5 log units of the initial bacteria population the bacteria inactivation in the complex water was slower than in distilled water fig 2 as the hydroxyl radicals generated in the process are not selective and they can also react with the organic compounds doc 9 65 mgc l 1 and inorganic anions conductivity 193 5 μs cm 1 in the matrix affecting the k pneumoniae elimination therefore to improve disinfecting action of the process in the real hospital wastewater some modifications to the initial photo fenton system could be considered it has been reported that in photo fenton system short chain organic acids such as oxalic tartaric or citric have enhancing effects on the inactivation of bacteria in waters villegas guzman et al 2017a 2017b additionally the substitution of h2o2 by s2o8 2 or hso5 have shown to be an efficient alternative for water decontamination marjanovic et al 2018 thus as strategies to improve accelerate elimination of k pneumoniae in the real matrix the initial photo fenton system was modified considering 1 the addition of citric acid and 2 the replacement of the peroxide by the persulfate s2o8 2 from fig 5a is observed that in the presence of only 9 μm of citric acid pf citac the k pneumoniae population was decreased to zero after 300 min of treatment i e the acid addition significantly enhanced the bacteria inactivation meanwhile the substitution of h2o2 by s2o8 2 pf ps strongly accelerated the disinfection process requiring only 60 min to completely eliminate the bacteria in the complex water control experiments for k pneumoniae in the presence of citric acid 9 μm showed that 300 min of interaction with such substance had no disinfecting effect figure sm3 it is known that the citric acid is a very good complexing agent of iron and this acid has a special affinity towards ferric ion silva et al 2009 at near neutral ph the interaction of iron with citric acid produces soluble ferric complexes species with a high formation constant k 2 0 106 hamm et al 1954 which can limit the fe3 precipitation as ferric hydroxides villegas guzman et al 2017b 2017a this fact was corroborated by the measurement of soluble iron in aqueous media which evidenced that in the photo fenton system in presence of citric acid the iron in solution can be found in a higher concentration than in its absence figure sm4 on the other hand literature reports that the complexes of citric acid with ferric ion are photoactive species and the light can regenerate the ferrous ion through a ligand to metal charge transference lmct mechanism eq 7 also the interaction with light could produce other disinfecting species mainly superoxide radical anion o2 from the reaction between the oxidized citrate ligand citrate2 and molecular oxygen o2 eq 8 giannakis et al 2016b villegas guzman et al 2017b therefore the improvement in elimination of resistant k pneumoniae by the addition of citric acid could be attributed to its ability to keep more soluble iron in the aqueous system figure sm4 plus an effective regeneration of fe2 favoring the iron catalytic cycle and the production of another radicals e g o2 7 fe3 citrate complex uva fe2 citrate2 8 citrate2 o2 product co2 o2 regarding the hydrogen peroxide replacement by persulfate it must be indicated that this anion is efficiently activated by fe2 to produce sulfate radical anion so4 eq 9 matzek and carter 2016 however it is not enough to explain the fast bacteria inactivation associated to the replacement of h2o2 by s2o8 2 fig 5 hence to better understand such effect on k pneumoniae disinfection by the pf ps system the process was applied in distilled water as seen in fig 5b a very fast inactivation was found the distilled water was completely disinfected at only 1 min of treatment complementary experiments using uva and persulfate uva ps system which has a low radical production for treating k pneumoniae in distilled water did not show a significant disinfection even after 5 min fig 5b which allowed to discard a significant role of the uva ps subsystem furthermore under pf ps the ph in our system decreased from 6 5 to 4 0 thus a control experiment at ph 4 0 was performed figure sm5 which evidenced that k pneumoniae is not inactivated by the acidic medium 9 fe2 s2o8 2 fe3 so4 2 so4 interestingly a comparison of k pneumoniae treatment in distilled water also showed the superiority of pf ps over conventional photo fenton for inactivation of this resistant microorganism figure sm6a indeed the following of h2o2 and ps evolution during these treatments figure sm6b revealed that radical precursor i e persulfate or hydrogen peroxide consumption in the pf ps process was very much faster than in normal photo fenton this suggests the pf ps has a higher production of radicals than the non modified photo fenton which would explain the best performance of pf ps process for k pneumoniae elimination fig 5a and sm6a also it should be considered that persulfate anion has a higher oxidizing ability e 2 12 v than hydrogen peroxide e 1 76 v then s2o8 2 can promote a higher direct oxidative action than h2o2 in fact persulfate ps eliminated 4 log units of the bacteria concentration during 60 min figure sm7 while h2o2 decreased 2 1 log units the k pneumoniae population after 180 min of treatment figure sm1 besides we must take into account that sulfate radical has a half life time 30 40 μs which is longer than for hydroxyl radical 10 3 μs olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 and so4 has shown to be more selective than ho mahdi ahmed et al 2012 thus pf ps process could be less affected by matrix than non modified photo fenton additionally a previous work about the treatment of pathogenic e coli by persulfate activated with iron showed that so4 induced the loss cell viability faster than ho the sulfate radical feature was related with its high selective reactivity with electron rich moieties on external components of bacteria wordofa et al 2017 this could also be the case of k pneumoniae which has a prominent capsule that coats the cell a polysaccharide and uronic acid matrix paczosa and mecsas 2016 highly susceptible to oxidation by the sulfate radical the california state university 2018 then in the real water sulfate radicals may induce more damages than hydroxyl radicals to the bacteria and as a result faster k pneumoniae elimination is observed by action of the pf ps process fig 5a 4 conclusions the photo fenton system under suitable conditions of reagents concentrations even in complex matrices such as hospital wastewaters led to the total inactivation of the carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae interestingly after short periods of treatment bacterial inactivation continued upon dark conditions by action of residual h2o2 and the fenton reaction also the injured bacteria by the process action gained susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics besides a prolongation of treatment time after bacteria inactivation was required to decrease the bla kpc presence on the other hand the treatment of k pneumoniae in a real wastewater was significantly accelerated by the addition of citric acid as enhancer of iron catalytic cycle or by replacement of hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion a so4 source which is more selective with a longer half life than ho finally this work represents a guide for future applications of photo fenton toward the inactivation of other arb in complex waters using diverse intensification ways such as the use of iron complexing agents or alternative oxidants to hydrogen peroxide acknowledgments the authors thank the financial support from colciencias project no

18701,the photo fenton process application to eliminate carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae an antibiotic resistant priority pathogen was evaluated initially reagents concentration effect was tested and under suitable conditions 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 complete bacteria inactivation by action of hydroxyl radical and uva plus hydrogen peroxide was achieved at 120 min the process presented a strong residual disinfecting effect when light was turned off at only 20 min besides the cultivability of treated k pneumoniae in a selective medium containing carbapenem antibiotics was considered bla kpc gene responsible for the resistance evolution was also assessed the bacteria response to carbapenem antibiotics was higher as the treatment time increased in turn bla kpc gene remained when k pneumoniae was completely inactivated 120 min nevertheless treatment times longer than 120 min diminished bla kpc presence finally the photo fenton process and its modifications citric acid addition or persulfate anion instead hydrogen peroxide were applied to a real hospital wastewater in colombia in such complex matrix the conventional photo fenton system reached a moderate disinfection 3 5 log units at 300 min meanwhile in presence of citric acid total inactivation was completed at the same time interestingly the h2o2 substitution by persulfate strongly accelerated the microorganism elimination achieving the 6 log units reduction after only 60 min of process action thus the effective elimination of k pneumoniae from water by the modified photo fenton evidenced the potential applicability of this process to limit the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords water disinfection photochemical process residual action of treatment resistant bacteria elimination advanced oxidation process 1 introduction nowadays antibiotic resistant bacteria arb represent a serious concern to human health in fact diseases produced by these microorganisms are rising up worldwide bell 2003 dai et al 2012 world health organization who has classified bacterial resistance as one of the greatest threats of public health in the 21st century who 2014 arb microorganisms with singular structural features production of extracellular polymers alteration of membrane lipids and cell aggregation that make them very resistant to several treatments as the case of klebsiella pneumoniae venieri et al 2016 demand particular attention indeed k pneumoniae kpc producing is one of the most important virulent and opportunist antibiotic resistant pathogens kpc producing bacteria are often multi drug resistant including last resort therapeutic options such as carbapenem antibiotics deleo et al 2014 livermore et al 2013 a main source of arb e g carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae and antibiotic resistant genes arg are effluents from hospitals chitnis et al 2000 hocquet et al 2016 it is recognized that in many low income countries e g colombia hospital wastewaters without any previous treatment reach superficial and ground waters rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 also it is well known the inability of conventional systems used in wastewater treatment plants wwtp to eliminate arb and arg indeed biological processes may contribute to both the generation of arb and horizontal transfer of arg between bacteria communities rizzo et al 2013 thus as hospital wastewaters and wwtp effluents end up into the environment they can promote antibiotic resistance proliferation and as a consequence the spreading of uncontrollable infections on the other hand classical processes such as chlorination show high disinfecting ability on arb but they have low action on arg yuan et al 2015 additionally chlorination based systems lead to formation of chlorinated disinfection by products dbps with potential negative health effects furst et al 2018 hrudey 2009 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 which limits such systems application also water treatment using uvc irradiation has been applied exhibiting strong action on arb nevertheless the results indicate that uvc is limited in its ability to destroy arg and other disinfection processes should be explored mckinney and pruden 2012 promising alternatives to eliminate both arb and arg are the advanced oxidation processes aop e g photo fenton which are based on the production and utilization of radical species photo fenton process which comprises the interaction of iron ions with hydrogen peroxide and light fe2 3 h2o2 light have shown to be a useful system for the elimination of problematic microorganisms e g bacteria fungi protozoa and viruses giannakis et al 2017 marjanovic et al 2018 ruales lonfat et al 2015 rubio et al 2013 interestingly the performance of photo fenton process can be significantly improved by addition of organic acids or the substitution of hydrogen peroxide by other radical sources marjanovic et al 2018 villegas guzman et al 2017b in recent researches photo fenton process has been successfully applied to treat water containing antibiotic resistant bacteria giannakis et al 2018a however this system has not been utilized for elimination of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae which has resistance to last resort therapeutic options in addition under our knowledge the disinfection of hospital wastewater containing arb has not been tested furthermore the previous works did not consider the process improvement through addition of citric acid or the substitution of hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion in this work the treatment of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae and its arg using the photo fenton process at near neutral ph was evaluated initially the suitable reagents concentrations for elimination of the resistant k pneumoniae were established through variations of ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide amounts the involvement of direct photolysis h2o2 fenton fe2 h2o2 reaction and uva combined with h2o2 in the bacteria inactivation was determined besides the residual effect of the treatment when light is switched off and the response of treated k pneumoniae to carbapenem antibiotics were assessed furthermore the evolution of resistance gene during and after the microorganism inactivation was followed also photo fenton process was applied to eliminate the resistant bacteria from a real effluent a hospital wastewater previously bio treated finally the initial photo fenton system was modified by the addition of citric acid or by replacing hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion to enhance the k pneumoniae elimination in such complex matrix 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents hydrogen peroxide sodium persulfate sodium chloride potassium chloride ammonium molybdate glucose kjeldahl catalyst nitric acid boric acid hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid stannous chloride plate count agar pca isopropanol and ethanol were purchased from merck ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and potassium iodide were provided by panreac all the solutions were prepared with ultra pure millipore milli q water chromogenic agar chromid carba was obtained from biomérieux reagents for conventional pcr and q pcr ssofasttmevagreen supermix were purchased from bioline and bio rad respectively carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae kpc producing was obtained from the microbial strain collections of microba group from universidad de antioquia medellín colombia the bacteria belong to clonal complex 258 and st512 harboring the bla kpc3 gene 2 2 reaction system experiments were performed in a homemade aluminum reflective reactor equipped with a set of five opaluz uva lamps 20 w each one with main emission at 365 nm the actual intensity provided by the system was 3 9 w m 2 this was determined using a solar pma2000 radiometer water samples 150 ml placed in beakers under magnetic stirring were illuminated before treatment the samples were inoculated by adding 1500 μl of a stock solution of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae to obtain 106 cfu ml 1 of initial bacteria concentration the initial experiments were developed in distilled water the final experiments were carried out in a hospital wastewater from tumaco nariño colombia previously bio treated as indicated in text sm1 each disinfection experiment was carried out at least by duplicate thus the average of measurements and their corresponding standard deviations error bars in the plots were reported 2 3 analyses the disinfecting action of process was measured by cell viability count on petri dishes plastic 9 cm diameter containing pca successive dilutions were made using a saline solution with 8 g l 1 nacl and 0 8 g l 1 kcl to ensure countable numbers on the plates the plates were incubated at 37 c for 18 24 h for the colonies counting evolution of hydrogen peroxide was monitored by measurement of absorbance at 420 nm using a uv5 mettler toledo spectrophotometer after the reaction of sample 1000 μl previously filtered using 0 45 μm mesh to remove microorganisms with titanium oxysulfate 1 2 1000 μl prepared according to eisenberg 1943 persulfate evolution was estimated by iodometry method by adding an aliquot of 600 μl of sample previously filtered using 0 45 μm mesh into a quartz cell containing 1350 μl of potassium iodide 0 1 m and 50 μl of ammonium molybdate 0 01 m after 10 min of reaction the absorbance at 350 nm was measured with a uv5 mettler toledo spectrophotometer soluble iron was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a shimadzu aa 7000 instrument prior to analysis the sample 50 ml was filtered 0 22 μm mesh followed by addition of 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid then the liquid was heated until evaporation of 20 ml and the residue was completed at 50 ml with distilled water to carry out the measurement in the instrument residual effect of process on bacteria was monitored by samples storage in 1 5 ml eppendorf caps in dark at room temperature during 24 and 48 h of treatment after storage cell viability was determined by colonies counting in pca petri dishes the response to carbapenem antibiotics of bacteria after a defined treatment time was estimated according to our previous work serna galvis et al 2018 the ratio r between the cfu in chromid carba which typically contains 3 mg of carbapenems antibiotics non specified by the manufacturer and cfu in pca was calculated eq 1 as an indicator of the response of treated bacteria to carbapenem antibiotics 1 r cfu ml 1 in chromid carba cfu ml 1 in pca for pcr analyses the dna extraction was carried out as follows samples of 6 ml were sonicated during 90 min in an e15h emasonic instrument pure isopropanol 4500 μl was added to the samples and subsequently centrifuged the supernatant was discarded then ethanol 70 v v 4500 μl was added samples with ethanol were also exposed to centrifugation process and the supernatants were discarded finally the obtained dna was rehydrated during 1 h to 65 c adding a dna rehydration solution of genomic dna purification kit from wizard the detection of bla kpc3 gene which encodes for the carbapenems resistance was carried using conventional pcr and q pcr according to protocol described by poirel et al 2017 a ssofasttmevagreen supermix instrument was used to detect the dna product in qpcr for the bio treated hospital wastewater ph was measured directly using an ab15 accumet basic ph meter conductivity was determined by direct measurement using a lab945 si analytics conductimeter absorbance at 365 nm of the water sample was established by

methods 4500 p a sample of hww 50 ml was submitted to digestion with sulfo nitric acidic mixture after digestion the reactive phosphorous was determined by a spectrophotometric method reaction with ammonium molybdate stannous chloride and absorbance measurement at 690 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe ii h2o2 ratio on inactivation of the antibiotic resistant k pneumoniae to establish suitable concentrations of reagents for the elimination of carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae ferrous ion at 1 2 and 5 mg l 1 and hydrogen peroxide at 25 and 50 mg l 1 were initially considered fig 1 presents the remaining bacterial population after 60 min of treatment for the variations of reagents it can be observed that using 1 mg l 1 and 25 mg l 1 of ferrous ion and h2o2 respectively a very high amount of k pneumoniae persisted i e a low inactivation was observed when ferrous ion concentration was augmented to 2 mg l 1 the bacteria cultivability was decreased to 1 5 log units however the increasing of hydrogen peroxide concentration from 25 to 50 mg l 1 remaining fe2 at 2 mg l 1 did not provide a considerably improvement in the bacterial inactivation meanwhile when 5 mg l 1 of ferrous ions and 50 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide were used the lowest remaining bacterial population was observed which means that such reagents concentrations induced the highest disinfection the little inactivation at the lowest iron ii and hydrogen peroxide concentrations could be associated to morphological factors of k pneumoniae this bacterium exhibits a prominent capsule paczosa and mecsas 2016 which exerts a protective action on the microorganism against attacks of the hydroxyl radical generated by photo fenton process thus it is required a superior amount of radicals to produce a faster inactivation indeed the increasing of iron ii and hydrogen peroxide concentrations may induce a higher formation of hydroxyl radicals ho eqs 2 and 3 and consequently the bacteria inactivation is augmented as evidenced in fig 1 nevertheless it should be remarked that very high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or iron could limit photo fenton process efficiency due to scavenging effects on radicals eqs 4 and 5 giannakis et al 2016a considering the results in fig 1 concentrations of 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 equivalent to an 1 10 ratio in mg l 1 of fe2 h2o2 are the suitable conditions for disinfection of water containing the resistant bacteria interestingly a previous work on disinfection by photo fenton process has also shown that an 1 10 ratio in mg l 1 of fe2 h2o2 presents a good performance for e coli elimination from water rubio et al 2013 therefore in this research the subsequent experiments were developed using 5 mg l 1 of fe2 and 50 mg l 1 of h2o2 at this point it can be indicated that the variation in concentrations of fe2 and h2o2 presented in fig 1 is the first approach to found the suitable conditions of the treatment however to establish optimal conditions surface response methodology should be carried out which involves more levels of the variables i e experimental design and is a useful tool to systematically study disinfection processes huang et al 2018 this is an interesting topic to be considered in future works about inactivation of arb by photo fenton process 2 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 3 fe3 h2o uva fe2 ho h 4 h2o2 ho h2o hoo 5 fe2 ho fe3 oh 3 2 establishing the participation of the process components on bacteria inactivation in photo fenton process subsystems such as uva light h2o2 fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 and uva combined with h2o2 uva h2o2 can be involved in the bacteria elimination giannakis et al 2016a 2016b therefore the action of such subsystems on the k pneumoniae was determined and compared with photo fenton fig 2 a it can be noted that the photo fenton process required 120 min to completely inactivate the bacteria whereas in the same period uva alone had no significant disinfecting effect the combination uva h2o2 did not show a considerable bacteria inactivation after 120 min of treatment interestingly at 180 min of treatment this subsystem decreased 2 7 log units of k pneumoniae in turn the sole action of hydrogen peroxide eliminated 2 1 log units after 180 min of contact with the resistant bacteria figure sm1 it is well known that uva light alone is able to induce both direct action on dna or enzymes and indirect promoting internal oxidative processes damages to bacteria giannakis et al 2016b however such damages are cumulative and they are mainly reflected after long periods of bacteria exposure to uva irradiation or under high radiation intensities giannakis et al 2016a this explains the low inactivation of k pneumoniae by the use of the sole light action fig 2a figure sm1 depicts the disinfecting action of the h2o2 alone on k pneumoniae as seen it was observed a moderate bacteria inactivation the h2o2 is a conventional oxidizing agent e 1 4 v it is less powerful than ho utilized in microorganisms disinfection processes giannakis et al 2016b indeed it is reported that hydrogen peroxide promotes the lipid peroxidation of cells siddique et al 2012 inducing cytoplasm membrane damages raffellini et al 2011 furthermore h2o2 can penetrate cells imlay 2011 spuhler et al 2010 promoting an internal oxidative stress halliwell and aruoma 1991 spuhler et al 2010 which may explain the disinfection by h2o2 alone figure sm1 under our experimental conditions a hydrogen peroxide homolysis by the light action to produce radicals is not possible as shown in figure sm2 the uva lamp emission spectrum has no intersection with h2o2 absorption but the h2o2 in the surroundings of the bacteria can diffuse through membranes which is supported by the consumption of hydrogen peroxide in the uva h2o2 system fig 2b the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide into the cell plus light irradiation could induce internal photo fenton reaction giannakis et al 2016b in addition to direct action of h2o2 as a consequence after 180 min k pneumoniae population was decreased 2 7 log units using the uva h2o2 subsystem fig 2a on the other hand the fe2 h2o2 combination fenton system presented a significant bacteria inactivation in the first 20 min of treatment but after this time the process reached a plateau in the fenton system the interaction between ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radical is very fast eq 2 k 53 76 l mol 1 s 1 but the regeneration of iron ii is significantly slower eq 6 k 10 6 10 2 l mol 1 s 1 pignatello et al 2006 for this reason after the initial step eq 2 the production of radicals is low and consequently the disinfection is practically stopped this fact was confirmed by the evolution of h2o2 fig 2b which exhibited a fast initial decreasing but after 90 min the h2o2 consumption was stopped in contrast to the fenton system the uva in the photo fenton process accelerates the fe2 regeneration and this increases the amount of hydroxyl radical available eq 3 to attack the bacteria indeed photo fenton process had the highest h2o2 consumption fig 2b confirming the superior production of ho promoted by the uva light addition to the fenton system consequently a complete k pneumoniae elimination was obtained by photo fenton 6 fe3 h2o2 fe2 hoo h considering all the above results in fig 2c is summarized the possible k pneumoniae inactivation routes which are detailed as follows a uva action on the internal constituents e g dna and enzymes which promotes cell dysfunctions giannakis et al 2016b however under work conditions uva effects would be more evident at very high treatment times b external oxidizing action by hydrogen peroxide which can induce damages on bacteria membrane decreasing the microorganism population figure sm1 c internal effects of h2o2 hydrogen peroxide can penetrate bacteria and interact with uva and metals in cytosol as iron and copper porcheron et al 2013 producing ho inside cell which inactivates k pneumoniae fig 2a d the combination fe2 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 uva which generates hydroxyl radical externally due the high oxidizing power of ho such species induce strong damages on bacteria which is reflected by high bacteria inactivation even at short treatment periods fig 2a it should be mentioned that in photo fenton system the a b and c routes are also plausible at this point it can be indicated that although the h2o2 uva h2o2 and fenton components are able to promote bacteria inactivations photo fenton system had the best ability for eliminating the resistant bacteria our results are consistent with literature on inactivation of microorganisms in water by photo fenton process giannakis et al 2016c moncayo lasso et al 2009 rubio et al 2013 there it is also reported that the combination fe2 h2o2 light is more efficient than light h2o2 for water disinfection due to the high ability of the photo fenton system to produce hydroxyl radical moreover it can be indicated that similar to non resistant bacteria the considered carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae was effectively inactivated by the ho action this highlights the applicability and good performance of photo fenton process to eliminate both non resistant bacteria and arb from water 3 3 evaluation of residual action of process on bacteria after the discussion of subsystems role on bacteria elimination the residual action of the photo fenton system i e the continuation of the disinfecting action when uva light is switched off on treated k pneumoniae was established fig 3 the residual effects were analyzed at 20 and 60 min of treatment also the control experiment no treatment 0 min in fig 3 was carried out the control test shows that even after 2880 min 48 h without water treatment the bacterial population remained unchanged this means that k pneumoniae is not affected by osmotic pressure exerted by the aqueous medium spuhler et al 2010 however at only 20 min of photo fenton application and after 1440 min 24 h of irradiation cessation the process had a strong residual effect this indicates that k pneumoniae inactivation was completed under dark conditions similarly an intense residual effect was observed when bacteria cells were exposed to photo fenton process during 60 min fig 3 the above results can be rationalized considering that the radicals generated by photo fenton strongly injured the bacteria before the light switch off and some processes continued in dark hydroxyl radical can attack the external cellular constituents e g proteins sugars or lipids of k pneumoniae and enhance the permeability of bacteria spuhler et al 2010 thus injured bacteria are vulnerable and under dark conditions fenton process produced by residual iron and hydrogen peroxide and h2o2 can complete the microorganism inactivation the residual fenton reagents can generate disinfecting species ho eq 2 and hoo eq 6 which may attack the antibiotic resistant k pneumoniae in dark furthermore residual h2o2 could penetrate easier the injured bacteria and because of its oxidizing ability hydrogen peroxide can react with inner bacterial bio molecules this reagent can also induce fenton process within the cell giannakis et al 2016b ndounla et al 2013 from fig 3 it can be also noted that at 120 min of photo fenton application when the bacterial population is decreased to zero and the uva irradiation is ceased there was no a recovery of the bacteria even after 48 h in dark i e bacteria regrowth was no observed from this two aspects can be highlighted the residual reagents continued exerting a disinfecting role and the processes induced irreparable damages to k pneumoniae ndounla et al 2013 thus the results of this section reveal that the combination of pretreatment with photo fenton plus the residual effects of hydrogen peroxide and iron avoid the bacteria recovery giannakis et al 2018a 2018b it is worthy to indicate that similar to above results for carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae residual effects and no regrowth during treatment by photo fenton process of others arb antibiotic resistant e coli and s aureus have been observed giannakis et al 2018a 2018b in fact it has been reported that when light is turned off after a given treatment time damages are very severe and hindered the ability of bacteria to multiply leading to the population decreasing additionally the non regrowth after total inactivation of the arb is also related to irreversible changes produced in the cells this demonstrates the efficiency of photo fenton system for the elimination of arb as carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae even if the light is switched off at short treatment periods 3 4 evolution of bacteria response to carbapenem antibiotics and action of process on resistance gene to analyze the response of k pneumoniae to carbapenem antibiotics during photo fenton process the r value was determined as indicated in section 2 3 fig 4 a compares the response at three points of treatment 0 20 and 60 min before the process application i e 0 min as expected the r value was one which indicates that the carbapenem antibiotics in the specific media culture had no effect on bacteria meanwhile for the other two treatment times 20 and 60 min the r values were lower than one also it can be observed that the r value of the treated bacteria was lower as the time increased this means that the susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics e g ertapenem imipenem and meropenem of the k pneumoniae submitted to photo fenton is increased with the treatment time therefore it can be proposed that the aop injured the bacteria and as a consequence the k pneumoniae growth in culture media with antibiotics was lower than in the conventional agar pca valero et al 2017 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes have been effective for eliminating diverse types of antibiotic resistant bacteria however the resistance may remain even after treatment giannakis et al 2018a serna galvis et al 2018 additionally dead bacteria can transfer the genes encoding for antibiotic resistance to environmental microorganisms promoting the resistance spread ferro et al 2017 venieri et al 2016 hence during treatment of arb the evolution of such genes should be followed to evaluate the fate of bla kpc gene which encodes the carbapenem resistance in the considered k pneumoniae during and after the bacteria elimination by photo fenton process pcr was initially used to amplify such gene fig 4b depicts evolution of bla kpc gene at different treatment times 0 60 120 and 240 min the signal intensity associated to the gene is decreased with the process application time suggesting the degradation of bla kpc by photo fenton then to confirm the process action on the gene q pcr was used and the cycle threshold ct was determined fig 4c ct parameter is an indicator of relative gene concentration in the pcr reaction and its value is inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample thermo fisher scientific 2016 from fig 4c it can be observed that ct increased in the course of treatment confirming the results obtained by conventional pcr at this point it must be indicated that although the microorganism was completely inactivated after 120 min of treatment fig 2 the gene encoding for antibiotic resistance remained at such time indeed the gene was not totally degraded even after 240 min of photo fenton action fig 4b which suggests that resistance transference is still plausible thus under our working conditions treatment times higher than 240 min are required to guarantee the complete bla kpc degradation the treatment action on arg is a positive fact which has been also evidenced in a previous paper about the application of photo fenton for treating another arb e coli giannakis et al 2018a this points out that due to the non selectivity of photo fenton process it has activity on diverse arg which could limit the antibiotic resistances proliferation 3 5 homologous photo fenton system and application of the process to a complex matrix due to the efficiency of disinfection by photo fenton is dependent on the water matrix giannakis et al 2016a the ability of this process to eliminate k pneumoniae from a real complex matrix a bio treated hospital wastewater global characteristics are presented in table sm1 was tested as depicted in fig 5 after 300 min of photo fenton application this system reduced 3 5 log units of the initial bacteria population the bacteria inactivation in the complex water was slower than in distilled water fig 2 as the hydroxyl radicals generated in the process are not selective and they can also react with the organic compounds doc 9 65 mgc l 1 and inorganic anions conductivity 193 5 μs cm 1 in the matrix affecting the k pneumoniae elimination therefore to improve disinfecting action of the process in the real hospital wastewater some modifications to the initial photo fenton system could be considered it has been reported that in photo fenton system short chain organic acids such as oxalic tartaric or citric have enhancing effects on the inactivation of bacteria in waters villegas guzman et al 2017a 2017b additionally the substitution of h2o2 by s2o8 2 or hso5 have shown to be an efficient alternative for water decontamination marjanovic et al 2018 thus as strategies to improve accelerate elimination of k pneumoniae in the real matrix the initial photo fenton system was modified considering 1 the addition of citric acid and 2 the replacement of the peroxide by the persulfate s2o8 2 from fig 5a is observed that in the presence of only 9 μm of citric acid pf citac the k pneumoniae population was decreased to zero after 300 min of treatment i e the acid addition significantly enhanced the bacteria inactivation meanwhile the substitution of h2o2 by s2o8 2 pf ps strongly accelerated the disinfection process requiring only 60 min to completely eliminate the bacteria in the complex water control experiments for k pneumoniae in the presence of citric acid 9 μm showed that 300 min of interaction with such substance had no disinfecting effect figure sm3 it is known that the citric acid is a very good complexing agent of iron and this acid has a special affinity towards ferric ion silva et al 2009 at near neutral ph the interaction of iron with citric acid produces soluble ferric complexes species with a high formation constant k 2 0 106 hamm et al 1954 which can limit the fe3 precipitation as ferric hydroxides villegas guzman et al 2017b 2017a this fact was corroborated by the measurement of soluble iron in aqueous media which evidenced that in the photo fenton system in presence of citric acid the iron in solution can be found in a higher concentration than in its absence figure sm4 on the other hand literature reports that the complexes of citric acid with ferric ion are photoactive species and the light can regenerate the ferrous ion through a ligand to metal charge transference lmct mechanism eq 7 also the interaction with light could produce other disinfecting species mainly superoxide radical anion o2 from the reaction between the oxidized citrate ligand citrate2 and molecular oxygen o2 eq 8 giannakis et al 2016b villegas guzman et al 2017b therefore the improvement in elimination of resistant k pneumoniae by the addition of citric acid could be attributed to its ability to keep more soluble iron in the aqueous system figure sm4 plus an effective regeneration of fe2 favoring the iron catalytic cycle and the production of another radicals e g o2 7 fe3 citrate complex uva fe2 citrate2 8 citrate2 o2 product co2 o2 regarding the hydrogen peroxide replacement by persulfate it must be indicated that this anion is efficiently activated by fe2 to produce sulfate radical anion so4 eq 9 matzek and carter 2016 however it is not enough to explain the fast bacteria inactivation associated to the replacement of h2o2 by s2o8 2 fig 5 hence to better understand such effect on k pneumoniae disinfection by the pf ps system the process was applied in distilled water as seen in fig 5b a very fast inactivation was found the distilled water was completely disinfected at only 1 min of treatment complementary experiments using uva and persulfate uva ps system which has a low radical production for treating k pneumoniae in distilled water did not show a significant disinfection even after 5 min fig 5b which allowed to discard a significant role of the uva ps subsystem furthermore under pf ps the ph in our system decreased from 6 5 to 4 0 thus a control experiment at ph 4 0 was performed figure sm5 which evidenced that k pneumoniae is not inactivated by the acidic medium 9 fe2 s2o8 2 fe3 so4 2 so4 interestingly a comparison of k pneumoniae treatment in distilled water also showed the superiority of pf ps over conventional photo fenton for inactivation of this resistant microorganism figure sm6a indeed the following of h2o2 and ps evolution during these treatments figure sm6b revealed that radical precursor i e persulfate or hydrogen peroxide consumption in the pf ps process was very much faster than in normal photo fenton this suggests the pf ps has a higher production of radicals than the non modified photo fenton which would explain the best performance of pf ps process for k pneumoniae elimination fig 5a and sm6a also it should be considered that persulfate anion has a higher oxidizing ability e 2 12 v than hydrogen peroxide e 1 76 v then s2o8 2 can promote a higher direct oxidative action than h2o2 in fact persulfate ps eliminated 4 log units of the bacteria concentration during 60 min figure sm7 while h2o2 decreased 2 1 log units the k pneumoniae population after 180 min of treatment figure sm1 besides we must take into account that sulfate radical has a half life time 30 40 μs which is longer than for hydroxyl radical 10 3 μs olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 and so4 has shown to be more selective than ho mahdi ahmed et al 2012 thus pf ps process could be less affected by matrix than non modified photo fenton additionally a previous work about the treatment of pathogenic e coli by persulfate activated with iron showed that so4 induced the loss cell viability faster than ho the sulfate radical feature was related with its high selective reactivity with electron rich moieties on external components of bacteria wordofa et al 2017 this could also be the case of k pneumoniae which has a prominent capsule that coats the cell a polysaccharide and uronic acid matrix paczosa and mecsas 2016 highly susceptible to oxidation by the sulfate radical the california state university 2018 then in the real water sulfate radicals may induce more damages than hydroxyl radicals to the bacteria and as a result faster k pneumoniae elimination is observed by action of the pf ps process fig 5a 4 conclusions the photo fenton system under suitable conditions of reagents concentrations even in complex matrices such as hospital wastewaters led to the total inactivation of the carbapenem resistant k pneumoniae interestingly after short periods of treatment bacterial inactivation continued upon dark conditions by action of residual h2o2 and the fenton reaction also the injured bacteria by the process action gained susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics besides a prolongation of treatment time after bacteria inactivation was required to decrease the bla kpc presence on the other hand the treatment of k pneumoniae in a real wastewater was significantly accelerated by the addition of citric acid as enhancer of iron catalytic cycle or by replacement of hydrogen peroxide by persulfate anion a so4 source which is more selective with a longer half life than ho finally this work represents a guide for future applications of photo fenton toward the inactivation of other arb in complex waters using diverse intensification ways such as the use of iron complexing agents or alternative oxidants to hydrogen peroxide acknowledgments the authors thank the financial support from colciencias project no

18702,the influence of dendrimer on the bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in saturated porous media quartz sand was investigated in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm 3 5g and 4g poly amido amine pamam dendrimer was employed as negatively and positively charged dendrimer respectively three dendrimer concentrations 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l were considered in present study we found that regardless of the solution chemistry ionic strength and ion types and dendrimer concentrations the presence of negatively charged pamam 3 5g in suspensions enhanced bacterial transport and inhibited their deposition in quartz sand while the presence of positive charged pamam 4g yet induced the opposite effects decreased bacterial transport and increased their deposition in quartz sand the increased repulsive force between cell and quartz sand due to the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto both cell and sand surfaces the competition deposition sites as well as the steric repulsion via the suspended pamam 3 5g drove to the increased bacterial transport with pamam 3 5g copresent in suspensions in quartz sand while the reduced repulsive force between cell and quartz sand induced by the chemical heterogeneity on both cell and sand surfaces due to the adsorption of positive charged pamam 4g increased bacterial retention in quartz sand with copresence of pamam 4g 10 μg l and 1 mg l in suspensions steric repulsion due to the presence of great amount of suspended pamam 4g yet lead to the enhanced bacterial transport with furthering increasing pamam 4g to 10 mg l relative to the lower pamam 4g concentration graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport dendrimer deposition sites xdlvo steric effect 1 introduction with radially symmetric molecules of well defined homogeneous and monodisperse structure the nano sized dendrimers typically contain a symmetric core an inner and an outer shell abbasi et al 2014 more than 200 kinds of dendrimers including modification have been synthesized on the basis of different cores such as poly amido amine pamam dendrimer conti et al 2014 gerard et al 2013 poly prophylenimine ppi dendrimer chisholm et al 2009 poly ether imine petim dendrimer lakshminarayanan et al 2013 ullas et al 2014 different types of dendrimers were found to have their own unique physical chemical and biological properties such as polyvalency chemical stability as well as solubility abbasi et al 2014 due to the distinctive nanoscale architecture size and high surface functional density tomalia 2005 dendrimers have steadily been applied in different fields including polymer chemistry newkome and shreiner 2010 walter and malkoch 2012 nanomedicine cheng et al 2011 sevenson and tomalia 2012 biomaterials lee et al 2005 villaraza et al 2010 and wastewater treatment reymond et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 specifically they showed great potentials in drug delivery madaan et al 2014 tissue engineering joshi and grinstaff 2008 bio imaging liu et al 2015 catalysis caminade et al 2016 cancer therapy wolinsky and grinstaff 2008 and adsorbents for heavy metals and dyes barakat et al 2013 han et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 pamam are the firstly synthesized and commercially available dendrimers taghavi pourianazar et al 2014 due to the nanoscale size relatively compact molecular structure and the great amount of functional groups pamam dendrimers have become one of the newest type of nanoscaled macromolecular delivery devices wolinsky and grinstaff 2008 the increasing generations branches would alter the size shape as well as the flexibility of pamam bhalgat and roberts 2000 mansfield and klushin 1993 the structure of pamam molecules begins with a central group of ethanediamine labeled as the core once the core polymerize a monomer with carboxy cooh as the end group which means pamam growth a half generation whereas with amino nh2 as the end group on the base of the half generation which is regarded as an integrate generation as pamam dendrimers grow through generation 1 to 10 their sizes would increase from 1 1 to 12 4 nm tomalia et al 1990 with the increase of generation the end groups of dendrimers will fold back toward the center as a consequence of hydrogen bonding between interior protonated tertiary amines and surface primary amines astruc et al 2010 sevenson and tomalia 2012 due to the advantages of surface properties and structures pamam have been widely utilized in medical and wastewater treatment for instance due to the huge inner spaces and end functional groups pamam or modified pamam were regarded as drug genes containers abbasi et al 2014 reymond et al 2013 likewise they have been anticipated as promising adsorbents for the removal and analytical extraction of different pollutants e g heavy metals and organic pollutants from water sajid et al 2018 the widely applications increased the risk of pamam releasing into natural aquatic systems moreover many previous studies found that dendrimers could interact with cells mainly through electrostatic force especially with charged dendrimers gonzalez garcia et al 2017 shcharbin et al 2017 sun et al 2016 other types of interactions such as van der waals forces h bonding and hydrophobic interactions were also found to be present between pamam and protein one major component of extracellular polymer substances of cells shcharbin et al 2017 thus once pamam were released into natural environment they might interact with bacteria and thus affect their fate and transport behaviors fully understanding the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria in porous media is important for a wide range of applications such as protection the drinking water supplies from bacterial contamination successfully implementation of riverbank filtration and in situ bioremediation of contaminated soil groundwater sayler and ripp 2000 weiss et al 2005 although more and more studies recently have started to focus on investigating the effects of co present colloids such as humic acid chowdhury et al 2015 yang et al 2012a 2016 clay particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012b zhao et al 2012 natural engineered nanoparticles battin et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2012a yang et al 2013 plastic particles he et al 2018 as well as contaminants with emerging concerns wu et al 2017 2018 on the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media however the influence of pamam one of widely used dendrimers with different surface charge on the cell transport has not been examined and required investigation hence the effects and mechanisms of pamams containing different surface functional groups or properties on the bacterial transport behaviors in quartz sand were explored according to the different dendrimer generations integrate generations of pamam has amino groups nh2 on their surface while carboxy groups cooh on surface at half generations in addition the structure of low pamam generation 4g is open flat and asymmetric whereas the periphery of pamam becomes globular and densely with the increase of generation specifically cationic pamam 4g with the smallest 3 dimensional structure can be used for encapsulating different compounds by the hydrophobic empty spaces in the inner region which increased their application potentials than other generations bai et al 2013 barakat et al 2013 taghavi pourianazar et al 2014 thus pamam 4g 4 5 nm and has an ethylenediamine core 2 carbon core with 64 external amino functional groups was taken to be the representative of positively charged pamam to investigate the influence on bacteria transport while pamam 3 5g 4 0 nm and has an ethylenediamine core 2 carbon core with 64 external carboxyl functional groups was chosen to be the representative of negatively charged pamam due to the same number of termini groups on the surface different concentration gradients of pamam 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l have been considered the bacteria escherichia coli transport experiments both with and without pamam were conducted in different solution conditions nacl and cacl2 mechanisms controlling bacterial transport in porous media by pamam were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria and pamam suspension preparation gram negative e coli bl21 was utilized as model cells and its influent concentrations for all the transport experiments were set to be 1 5 107 10 cells ml more information that about cultivation and harvest processes of bacteria regarding and why we employed this influent cell concentration were given in the supplementary materials the concentrations of pamam 3 5g and 4g sigma aldrich st louis usa solutions were set to be 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l according to the experiment conditions respectively details about pamam stock solution preparation can be found in supplementary materials the zeta potentials and the sizes of bacteria together with zeta potentials of quartz sand surfaces both with either pamam 3 5g or pamam 4g in all salt solutions 10 and 25 mm nacl and 1 2 and 5 mm cacl2 ph 6 3 were determined by zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk table s1 and table s2 2 2 column experiments cylindrical plexiglass columns length of 10 cm and inner diameter of 2 cm were wet packed with cleaned quartz sand ultrapure with 99 80 sio2 417 600 μm and the detailed packing protocol was in supplementary materials the packed porous media was firstly pre equilibrated with 10 pore volumes pvs salt solutions at experimental ionic strengths and ph which was followed by the injection of 3 pvs of bacterial suspensions either with or without pamam suspensions and then 5 pvs of bacteria free salt solution to elute the unattached cells column experiments were performed in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions at ph 6 3 the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 4 m day 0 37 ml min using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa to represent fluid velocities in coarse aquifer sediments forced gradient conditions or engineered filtration systems the effluents during the transport experiments were collected to yield the breakthrough curves and the retained bacteria in 10 segments of porous media each 1 cm long were analyzed to yield the retained profiles the details are given in supplementary materials the mass recovery for each bacteria transport experiments was in table s3 2 3 calculation of xdlvo interaction the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory including lifshitz van der waals lw electrostatic double layer forces interactions el and lewis acid base ab were utilized to calculate the energy interaction between bacteria and surfaces johanson et al 2012 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 the detailed calculation process were provided in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pamam 3 5g to investigate whether pamam 3 5g would influence bacterial transport behaviors in quartz sand the e coli transport experiments either with or without pamam 3 5g in suspensions were conducted in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 mm and 5 mm figs 1 and 2 since the zeta potentials of both bacteria and sand at higher ionic strength were less negative relative to those at lower ionic strength tables s1 and s2 the interaction force between bacteria and sand at higher ionic strength thus were less repulsive relative to lower ionic strength in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fig s1 as a result the cell breakthrough plateau decreased with increasing ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 1 and 2 the lower bacterial mobility with increasing ionic strengths was well recognized previously he et al 2018 wu et al 2018 more importantly the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions increased bacteria transport in quartz sand under all investigated ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions illustrated by the higher bacteria breakthrough plateaus with pamam 3 5g relative to those without pamam 3 5g for example in 10 mm nacl solution approximate 73 9 of cell broke through the column with the absence of pamam 3 5g whereas around 81 2 of cell passed the columns with the presence of pamam 3 5g at the concentration of 10 μg l moreover the enhanced cell transport by the copresence of pamam 3 5g was more significant benjamini hochberg adjusted p 0 00047 0 012 kruskal wallis test r software v 3 5 0 with the increase of the pamam concentrations in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for example the bacterial breakthrough curves with the presence of 3 5g in suspensions in 10 mm nacl solutions were 81 2 84 4 and 92 5 respectively at 10 μg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l respectively obviously under all ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the transport of bacteria was enhanced with pamam 3 5g in suspensions and the degree of enhancement was also sensitive to pamam 3 5g concentrations with the largest enhancement at the highest pamam 3 5g concentrations the enhanced bacterial transport with the copresence of substances such as humic acid yang et al 2012a 2016 negative charged proteins wu et al 2018 nutrients han et al 2013 and pollutants with emerging concerns he et al 2018 wu et al 2016 2017 has also been observed previously the bacterial retained profiles in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions were also acquired figs 1 and 2 right as expected the retained cell profiles in the absence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions at higher ionic strengths figs 1d and 2d open squares were higher relative to those at lower ionic strengths figs 1b and 2b open squares the amounts of deposited bacteria in the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions were lower than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g in all salt solutions meanwhile the amounts of retained cells on quartz sand decreased with increasing pamam 3 5g concentrations close inspection of the retained profiles showed that no significant difference in the shape of the retained profiles was present for e coli with and without pamam 3 5g even with different concentrations the observation demonstrated that although the copresence of pamam 3 5g inhibited the bacterial retention in porous media yet it did not affect the shape of bacterial retained profiles in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions colloid size was found to have correlation with transport behaviors of the colloids with decreased transport for larger colloids cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however dynamic light scattering dls results showed pamam 3 5g did not affect the cell sizes as indicted by the equivalent bacterial sizes both with and without pamam 3 5g table s1 the enhanced bacterial transport observed with pamam 3 5g copresent in suspensions would not be caused by the alteration in cell sizes the surface charge of both colloid and porous media due to the adsorption of organic matters e g humic acid proteins perfluorooctanoic acid onto their surfaces has been previously reported to affect colloid transport behaviors chowdhury et al 2012a jiang et al 2012 johnson and logan 1996 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions might also alter the surface charge of bacteria and quartz sand via adsorption onto their surfaces to testify adsorption experiments of pamam 3 5g 1 mg l was taken as the representative concentration on both bacteria fig s2 and quartz sand surfaces fig s3 were conducted detailed procedures of the adsorption experiments were provided in supplementary materials the adsorption of pamam 3 5g on both cell and quartz sand surfaces did occur figs s1 and s2 specifically we found that in 25 mm nacl solutions approximate 18 and 6 of pamam 3 5g adsorbed onto both bacteria and quartz sand respectively the pamam 3 5g adsorption might alter the surface charge of both cell and sand to testify the zeta potentials of both bacteria table s1 and quartz sand table s2 both with and without pamam 3 5g under all the experimental conditions were acquired due to the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto their surfaces the absolute zeta potential values of both e coli and quartz sand with pamam 3 5g in suspensions were greater relative to those without pamam 3 5g under all examined solution conditions which would theoretically predict an increased bacterial transport due to the increased repulsive electrostatic force between cell and quartz sand to directly determine the change of interaction forces between bacteria and quartz sand by the copresence of pamam 3 5g the xdlvo energy interactions between cell and sand both with and without pamam 3 5g in suspensions thus were calculated fig s4 the total interaction force between bacteria and sand with pamam 3 5g were more repulsive than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g in all tested salt solutions theoretically supporting the greater bacterial mobility with pamam 3 5g in suspensions than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g under all the experimental conditions figs 1 and 2 it was worth noting that the interaction forces were similar at different pamam 3 5g concentrations which indicated that the concentration of 3 5g has no significant influence on the interaction force profiles between cell and sand other mechanisms thus would control the enhanced bacterial transport with the increase of pamam 3 5g concentrations competition of the deposition sites by the co presence of colloids was proved to be one of the mechanisms enhancing bacterial transport in porous media wu et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2012a to investigate whether pamam 3 5g would also compete the deposition sites with bacteria extra bacterial transport experiments with quartz sand pre covered by 1 mg l pamam 3 5g were conducted in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions in all tested solution conditions breakthrough curves for columns pretreated with pamam 3 5g and without pamam 3 5g in cell suspensions were higher and the retained profiles were lower than those of individual cell transport without pamam 3 5g pretreatment fig 3 clearly sites competition by pamam 3 5g would lead to the greater cell mobility with pamam 3 5g in suspensions moreover the bacterial breakthrough curves only involving with pre covering sand by pamam 3 5g were lower than with pamam 3 5g in cell suspensions yet without pre covering sand by pamam 3 5g clearly competition for deposition sites by pamam 3 5g was not the only mechanism enhancing bacteria transport many previous studies found that suspended organic matters in suspensions could prevent colloids from contacting the quartz sand and resulted in the decreased deposition by steric hindrance effect foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012a due to the small sizes nano scaled pamam more than 4 64 1013 particles ml 10 μg l table s5 were present in suspensions which is at least six orders of magnitude higher than bacteria 1 5 107 cells ml under the experimental conditions according to the adsorption experiments less than 30 and 10 of 3 5g adsorbed onto cell and quartz sand surfaces in 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively since only a small portion of pamam 3 5g adsorbed onto cell and quartz sand surfaces large amounts of suspended pamam 3 5g thus remained in suspensions these great amount of suspended pamam 3 5g particles would occupy the spaces between bacteria and quartz sand and prevent bacteria from attaching on quartz sand surfaces inhibiting bacterial deposition onto quartz sand surfaces via the steric hindrance effect as a result increased transport of bacteria in the copresence of pamam 3 5g was observed 3 2 effect of pamam 4g as stated above negatively charged pamam 3 5g enhanced bacteria transport in quartz sand under all investigated solution conditions to understand whether positively charged pamam 4g would also affect bacterial transport and deposition behaviors the results of e coli transport experiments in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions with pamam 4g were compared with those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 similar as the experiments with pamam 3 5g in suspensions three concentration gradients of 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l were also considered for pamam 4g unlike those observed for pamam 3 5g the breakthrough curves of bacteria with pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 left solid symbols in suspensions were lower than those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 left open symbols regardless of pamam concentrations under all investigated salt solution conditions exception was in 5 mm cacl2 solutions with 10 mg l pamam for instance in 10 mm nacl solutions nearly 73 9 of bacteria eluted out from the column with the absence of pamam 4g while approximate 57 8 of bacteria broke through the columns with 10 μg l pamam 4g clearly under the majority investigated conditions the presence of pamam 4g decreased bacterial transport in quartz sand the decreased bacterial transport with the presence of positive charge of hematite yang et al 2016 and protein wu et al 2018 have also been reported previously moreover increasing concentration of pamam 4g to 1 mg l induced larger effect on the inhibition of cell transport in porous media the lower breakthrough curves with relatively high concentration of pamam 4g in suspensions indicated that similar to pamam 3 5g the concentration of pamam 4g also affect transport of cells in porous media however it should be noted that further increasing the concentration of pamam 4g to 10 mg l yet increased cell transport relative to that of 1 mg l in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the observations indicated that pamam 4g decreased the bacterial transport behaviors yet the degree of inhibition was sensitive to the concentration of pamam 4g furthermore with 10 mg l pamam 4g copresent in suspensions the effluent cell concentrations that broke through the columns increased with increasing injection duration pore volumes which differed from those of steady state breakthrough plateau with lower pamam 4g concentrations or without the presence of pamam 4g the observation suggested that unlike lower pamam 4g concentrations the presence of 10 mg l pamam 4g could reduce the cell deposition rate coefficient during the transport process contrary to the breakthrough curves the bacterial retained profiles with pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 right solid symbols were higher than those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 right open symbols in both nacl and cacl2 solutions exception was in 5 mm cacl2 solutions with 10 mg l pamam for instance 51 0 and 65 1 of cells deposited on sand surface without pamam 4g in suspensions in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively whereas the retained cell percentages increased to around 92 6 and 95 6 with 1 mg l pamam 4g in suspensions respectively meanwhile the retained amount of cells on quartz sand increased with the increase of pamam 4g concentrations from 10 μg l to 1 mg l further increasing the concentration of pamam 4g to 10 mg l yet lowered the overall amounts of e coli retained columns under all solution conditions although different cell deposition behaviors were obtained by the copresence of pamam 4g at diverse concentrations similar shape of bacterial retained profiles yet were observed for experiments either with or without pamam 4g in suspensions under all solution conditions the observation indicated that although the pamam 4g increased the retention of bacteria in columns yet they do not affect the shape of the retained profiles as stated above colloid sizes were found to have correlation with the transport behavior of the colloids cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however dls measurement results table s1 revealed that the presence of pamam 4g did not induce significant alteration of cell sizes under all ionic strength conditions in two types of salt solutions clearly bacterial size was not a contributor led to the decreased cell transport observed with the copresence of pamam 4g the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto cell surfaces would affect their surface properties including zeta potential contact angles and hamaker constant the detailed information about determination of contact angles and calculation of hamaker constant were provided in supplementary materials to testify whether pamam 4g would also adsorb onto e coli surfaces adsorption experiments were conducted in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as the representative conditions fig s2 we found that pamam 4g did adsorb onto surfaces of bacteria under the examined solution conditions for instance in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions around 20 and 38 of pamam 4g adsorbed on cell surfaces respectively according to fig s5 approximately 41 and 82 of cell surfaces were covered by pamam 4g in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the detailed calculation protocol was given in the supplementary materials the partial cell surfaces covered by pamam 4g led to the alteration of bacterial chemical heterogeneity which would theoretically influence the cell transport via the change of electrostatic repulsive interaction with quartz sand to verify zeta potentials table s1 and contact angles table s4 were determined since pamam 4g adsorbed onto cell surfaces zeta potentials of bacterial shifted to positively charged with the copresence of pamam 4g the reversed surface charge of bacteria to positive would theoretically predict a decreased cell transport by reducing repulsion between cell and quartz sand with pamam 4g in suspensions in addition to the change of zeta potentials hamaker constant detailed examination was provided in supplementary materials would also be influenced by the adsorption of pamam 4g on cell surfaces which might affect the interaction energy xdlvo interactions of cell with quartz sand herein to directly determine whether the interaction forces was changed by the copresence of pamam 4g the xdlvo energy interactions both with and without pamam 4g in suspensions at all 4g concentrations were calculated fig 6 the total interaction force with pamam 4g were less repulsive than those in the absence of pamam 4g in both nacl and cacl2 solutions clearly the interaction force with quartz sand was decreased due to the adsorption of pamam 4g onto bacterial surfaces the decreased bacterial transport thus was obtained figs 4 and 5 however interaction force became more repulsive with increasing pamam 4g concentrations which theoretically would predict the increased cell transport with the increase of pamam 4g concentrations although the xdlvo results could explain the relatively increased cell transport with increasing concentration of pamam 4g from 1 to 10 mg l yet they were inconsistent with the inhibited cell transport with the increase of concentration of pamam 4g from 10 μg l to 1 mg l thus other mechanisms would control the cell transport behavior under different concentration gradients the interaction of colloids or organic matters with porous media could also influence the bacterial transport behaviors foppen et al 2006 wu et al 2017 2018 yang et al 2016 to figure out whether the adsorption of the positively charged pamam 4g onto quartz sand would occur pamam 4g adsorption experiments were conducted in two representative solutions in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions approximately 7 47 of pamam 4g adsorbed on quartz sand in 25 mm nacl while the percentage of was 8 82 in 5 mm cacl2 solutions according to fig s6 about 35 and 70 of sand surfaces were covered by adsorbed pamam 4g in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively indicating the incomplete coverage of sand surface under all the experimental conditions with the copresence of 1 mg l pamam 4g many previous studies reported that the adsorbed positively charged organic matters would provide extra attractive sites for cell attachment on porous media driving to the greater bacterial retention in columns dong et al 2014 kim et al 2008 thus to further investigate the influence of adsorbed pamam 4g on cell deposition extra experiments with pre equilibrating the columns with 3 pvs of 1 mg l pamam 4g prior to the injection of bacterial suspensions in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions were conducted as expected lower breakthrough curves relative to those without pretreatment of sand by pamam 4g were observed for the quartz sand pre covered by pamam 4g fig 7 the results suggested that adsorption of pamam 4g on quartz sand could attract more bacteria attachment via providing extra positive sites for cell clearly as well as the chemical heterogeneity of cell surfaces the chemical heterogeneity on quartz sand surfaces resulted from the adsorption of pamam 4g also have contributed to the inhibited bacteria transport with pamam 4g in suspensions the chemical heterogeneity on either colloid or the collector surfaces has also found to greatly affect the deposition of colloids cai et al 2016 wu et al 2018 it is worth pointing out that comparing with lower concentrations of pamam 4g i e 10 μg l after the injection of bacteria suspensions with the copresence of pamam 4g into columns it would be much sooner faster for the sand surfaces to be covered by pamam 4g due to great chances of collisions between pamam 4g and quartz sand with higher concentrations of pamam 4g i e 1 and 10 mg l thus the chemical heterogeneity on the surfaces could be formed relatively much faster and their amount would be relatively greater as indicated by more positively zeta potentials of quartz sand table s2 at relatively higher pamam concentrations i e 1 and 10 mg l as a result inhibited cell transport with the increase of concentration of pamam 4g from 10 μg l to 1 mg l was obtained however the cell transport increased with increasing concentration of pamam 4g from 1 to 10 mg l which suggested other mechanisms would also affect the cell transport behavior with the copresence of highest concentrations of pamam 4g similar as pamam 3 5g the number of pamam 4g are also at least six orders magnitude larger than much those of cells in suspensions table s5 the great amount of suspended pamam 4g could prevent bacteria from attaching on quartz sand via steric effect which would theoretically enhance bacteria transport however decreased cell transport behaviors were observed under all tested solution conditions with the copresence of pamam 4g in suspensions relative to that without pamam 4g we deduce that the decreased electrostatic repulsion was the dominant contributor to the inhibited cell transport at 10 μg l and 1 mg l relative to those without 4g in suspensions as the concentration of pamam 4g increased up to 10 mg l steric repulsion might also become an important mechanism controlling the cell transport and deposition behaviors in comparison with 1 mg l pamam 4g in suspensions due to the significantly increase of pamam quantity as stated above charge heterogeneity on the quartz sand surfaces by the adsorption of pamam 4g would be formed much faster with the increasing pamam 4g concentrations especially for 10 mg l pamam 4g which would attract more and faster deposition of bacteria and led to the lower effluent cell concentrations during the beginning of transport experiments the first pore volume with copresence of 10 mg l pamam 4g as the continuous injection of bacteria the probability for bacteria to come close to the quartz sand and then deposition onto quartz sand would be greatly decreased due to the steric hindrance effect induced by the relatively larger amount of suspended pamam 4g of 10 mg l than other lower concentrations thus the sharp increased effluent cell concentrations with increased pore volumes were observed with the copresence of 10 mg l pamam 4g under all examined solution conditions clearly the alteration in electrostatic interaction drove to the change of bacterial transport behavior under all the experimental conditions with all the pamam 4g concentrations especially with lower concentrations in addition to electrostatic interaction steric hindrance effect induced by the increased quantities of pamam 4g would also contribute the changed bacterial transport behaviors at the largest pamam 4g concentration 10 mg l 4 conclusion the effects of the negatively 3 5g as the representative and positively 4g as the representative charged pamam on the transport and deposition of bacteria were investigated under different solution conditions ion valence and ionic strength and pamam concentrations the core results showed that negatively charged pamam 3 5g would increase the transport and the enhanced cell transport was more obvious with the increase of pamam concentrations under all the experimental conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the addition of pamam 3 5g in suspensions increased the repulsion both electrostatic repulsive interaction and steric repulsion between cell and quartz sand and partially competed with bacteria for the deposition sites on the quartz sand surfaces resulting in the increased bacterial transport in contrast the presence of positively charged pamam 4g with three concentrations decreased cell transport and increased their deposition under all the experimental conditions the adsorption of pamam 4g onto both cell and quartz sand surfaces reduced repulsive interactions between cell and sand and thus inhibited bacterial transport behaviors steric hindrance effect due to the presence of great amount of suspended pamam 4g with the increase of concentration to 10 mg l also played an important role in bacterial transport and deposition behaviors the results showed that pamam with different terminal groups would drive to distinct bacterial transport behaviors in porous media with enhanced transport with negatively charged pamam yet decreased cell transport with the copresence of positive charged pamam declaration of

18702,the influence of dendrimer on the bacterial transport and deposition behaviors in saturated porous media quartz sand was investigated in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 and 5 mm 3 5g and 4g poly amido amine pamam dendrimer was employed as negatively and positively charged dendrimer respectively three dendrimer concentrations 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l were considered in present study we found that regardless of the solution chemistry ionic strength and ion types and dendrimer concentrations the presence of negatively charged pamam 3 5g in suspensions enhanced bacterial transport and inhibited their deposition in quartz sand while the presence of positive charged pamam 4g yet induced the opposite effects decreased bacterial transport and increased their deposition in quartz sand the increased repulsive force between cell and quartz sand due to the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto both cell and sand surfaces the competition deposition sites as well as the steric repulsion via the suspended pamam 3 5g drove to the increased bacterial transport with pamam 3 5g copresent in suspensions in quartz sand while the reduced repulsive force between cell and quartz sand induced by the chemical heterogeneity on both cell and sand surfaces due to the adsorption of positive charged pamam 4g increased bacterial retention in quartz sand with copresence of pamam 4g 10 μg l and 1 mg l in suspensions steric repulsion due to the presence of great amount of suspended pamam 4g yet lead to the enhanced bacterial transport with furthering increasing pamam 4g to 10 mg l relative to the lower pamam 4g concentration graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport dendrimer deposition sites xdlvo steric effect 1 introduction with radially symmetric molecules of well defined homogeneous and monodisperse structure the nano sized dendrimers typically contain a symmetric core an inner and an outer shell abbasi et al 2014 more than 200 kinds of dendrimers including modification have been synthesized on the basis of different cores such as poly amido amine pamam dendrimer conti et al 2014 gerard et al 2013 poly prophylenimine ppi dendrimer chisholm et al 2009 poly ether imine petim dendrimer lakshminarayanan et al 2013 ullas et al 2014 different types of dendrimers were found to have their own unique physical chemical and biological properties such as polyvalency chemical stability as well as solubility abbasi et al 2014 due to the distinctive nanoscale architecture size and high surface functional density tomalia 2005 dendrimers have steadily been applied in different fields including polymer chemistry newkome and shreiner 2010 walter and malkoch 2012 nanomedicine cheng et al 2011 sevenson and tomalia 2012 biomaterials lee et al 2005 villaraza et al 2010 and wastewater treatment reymond et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 specifically they showed great potentials in drug delivery madaan et al 2014 tissue engineering joshi and grinstaff 2008 bio imaging liu et al 2015 catalysis caminade et al 2016 cancer therapy wolinsky and grinstaff 2008 and adsorbents for heavy metals and dyes barakat et al 2013 han et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 pamam are the firstly synthesized and commercially available dendrimers taghavi pourianazar et al 2014 due to the nanoscale size relatively compact molecular structure and the great amount of functional groups pamam dendrimers have become one of the newest type of nanoscaled macromolecular delivery devices wolinsky and grinstaff 2008 the increasing generations branches would alter the size shape as well as the flexibility of pamam bhalgat and roberts 2000 mansfield and klushin 1993 the structure of pamam molecules begins with a central group of ethanediamine labeled as the core once the core polymerize a monomer with carboxy cooh as the end group which means pamam growth a half generation whereas with amino nh2 as the end group on the base of the half generation which is regarded as an integrate generation as pamam dendrimers grow through generation 1 to 10 their sizes would increase from 1 1 to 12 4 nm tomalia et al 1990 with the increase of generation the end groups of dendrimers will fold back toward the center as a consequence of hydrogen bonding between interior protonated tertiary amines and surface primary amines astruc et al 2010 sevenson and tomalia 2012 due to the advantages of surface properties and structures pamam have been widely utilized in medical and wastewater treatment for instance due to the huge inner spaces and end functional groups pamam or modified pamam were regarded as drug genes containers abbasi et al 2014 reymond et al 2013 likewise they have been anticipated as promising adsorbents for the removal and analytical extraction of different pollutants e g heavy metals and organic pollutants from water sajid et al 2018 the widely applications increased the risk of pamam releasing into natural aquatic systems moreover many previous studies found that dendrimers could interact with cells mainly through electrostatic force especially with charged dendrimers gonzalez garcia et al 2017 shcharbin et al 2017 sun et al 2016 other types of interactions such as van der waals forces h bonding and hydrophobic interactions were also found to be present between pamam and protein one major component of extracellular polymer substances of cells shcharbin et al 2017 thus once pamam were released into natural environment they might interact with bacteria and thus affect their fate and transport behaviors fully understanding the transport and deposition behaviors of bacteria in porous media is important for a wide range of applications such as protection the drinking water supplies from bacterial contamination successfully implementation of riverbank filtration and in situ bioremediation of contaminated soil groundwater sayler and ripp 2000 weiss et al 2005 although more and more studies recently have started to focus on investigating the effects of co present colloids such as humic acid chowdhury et al 2015 yang et al 2012a 2016 clay particles vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 yang et al 2012b zhao et al 2012 natural engineered nanoparticles battin et al 2009 chowdhury et al 2012a yang et al 2013 plastic particles he et al 2018 as well as contaminants with emerging concerns wu et al 2017 2018 on the fate and transport of bacteria in porous media however the influence of pamam one of widely used dendrimers with different surface charge on the cell transport has not been examined and required investigation hence the effects and mechanisms of pamams containing different surface functional groups or properties on the bacterial transport behaviors in quartz sand were explored according to the different dendrimer generations integrate generations of pamam has amino groups nh2 on their surface while carboxy groups cooh on surface at half generations in addition the structure of low pamam generation 4g is open flat and asymmetric whereas the periphery of pamam becomes globular and densely with the increase of generation specifically cationic pamam 4g with the smallest 3 dimensional structure can be used for encapsulating different compounds by the hydrophobic empty spaces in the inner region which increased their application potentials than other generations bai et al 2013 barakat et al 2013 taghavi pourianazar et al 2014 thus pamam 4g 4 5 nm and has an ethylenediamine core 2 carbon core with 64 external amino functional groups was taken to be the representative of positively charged pamam to investigate the influence on bacteria transport while pamam 3 5g 4 0 nm and has an ethylenediamine core 2 carbon core with 64 external carboxyl functional groups was chosen to be the representative of negatively charged pamam due to the same number of termini groups on the surface different concentration gradients of pamam 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l have been considered the bacteria escherichia coli transport experiments both with and without pamam were conducted in different solution conditions nacl and cacl2 mechanisms controlling bacterial transport in porous media by pamam were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria and pamam suspension preparation gram negative e coli bl21 was utilized as model cells and its influent concentrations for all the transport experiments were set to be 1 5 107 10 cells ml more information that about cultivation and harvest processes of bacteria regarding and why we employed this influent cell concentration were given in the supplementary materials the concentrations of pamam 3 5g and 4g sigma aldrich st louis usa solutions were set to be 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l according to the experiment conditions respectively details about pamam stock solution preparation can be found in supplementary materials the zeta potentials and the sizes of bacteria together with zeta potentials of quartz sand surfaces both with either pamam 3 5g or pamam 4g in all salt solutions 10 and 25 mm nacl and 1 2 and 5 mm cacl2 ph 6 3 were determined by zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk table s1 and table s2 2 2 column experiments cylindrical plexiglass columns length of 10 cm and inner diameter of 2 cm were wet packed with cleaned quartz sand ultrapure with 99 80 sio2 417 600 μm and the detailed packing protocol was in supplementary materials the packed porous media was firstly pre equilibrated with 10 pore volumes pvs salt solutions at experimental ionic strengths and ph which was followed by the injection of 3 pvs of bacterial suspensions either with or without pamam suspensions and then 5 pvs of bacteria free salt solution to elute the unattached cells column experiments were performed in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions at ph 6 3 the suspension and salt solutions were injected in an up flow orientation at 4 m day 0 37 ml min using a syringe pump harvard phd 2000 harvard apparatus inc holliston usa to represent fluid velocities in coarse aquifer sediments forced gradient conditions or engineered filtration systems the effluents during the transport experiments were collected to yield the breakthrough curves and the retained bacteria in 10 segments of porous media each 1 cm long were analyzed to yield the retained profiles the details are given in supplementary materials the mass recovery for each bacteria transport experiments was in table s3 2 3 calculation of xdlvo interaction the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory including lifshitz van der waals lw electrostatic double layer forces interactions el and lewis acid base ab were utilized to calculate the energy interaction between bacteria and surfaces johanson et al 2012 wang et al 2011 wu et al 2016 the detailed calculation process were provided in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pamam 3 5g to investigate whether pamam 3 5g would influence bacterial transport behaviors in quartz sand the e coli transport experiments either with or without pamam 3 5g in suspensions were conducted in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 solutions 1 2 mm and 5 mm figs 1 and 2 since the zeta potentials of both bacteria and sand at higher ionic strength were less negative relative to those at lower ionic strength tables s1 and s2 the interaction force between bacteria and sand at higher ionic strength thus were less repulsive relative to lower ionic strength in both nacl and cacl2 solutions fig s1 as a result the cell breakthrough plateau decreased with increasing ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions figs 1 and 2 the lower bacterial mobility with increasing ionic strengths was well recognized previously he et al 2018 wu et al 2018 more importantly the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions increased bacteria transport in quartz sand under all investigated ionic strengths in both nacl and cacl2 solutions illustrated by the higher bacteria breakthrough plateaus with pamam 3 5g relative to those without pamam 3 5g for example in 10 mm nacl solution approximate 73 9 of cell broke through the column with the absence of pamam 3 5g whereas around 81 2 of cell passed the columns with the presence of pamam 3 5g at the concentration of 10 μg l moreover the enhanced cell transport by the copresence of pamam 3 5g was more significant benjamini hochberg adjusted p 0 00047 0 012 kruskal wallis test r software v 3 5 0 with the increase of the pamam concentrations in both nacl and cacl2 solutions for example the bacterial breakthrough curves with the presence of 3 5g in suspensions in 10 mm nacl solutions were 81 2 84 4 and 92 5 respectively at 10 μg l 1 mg l and 10 mg l respectively obviously under all ionic strength conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the transport of bacteria was enhanced with pamam 3 5g in suspensions and the degree of enhancement was also sensitive to pamam 3 5g concentrations with the largest enhancement at the highest pamam 3 5g concentrations the enhanced bacterial transport with the copresence of substances such as humic acid yang et al 2012a 2016 negative charged proteins wu et al 2018 nutrients han et al 2013 and pollutants with emerging concerns he et al 2018 wu et al 2016 2017 has also been observed previously the bacterial retained profiles in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions were also acquired figs 1 and 2 right as expected the retained cell profiles in the absence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions at higher ionic strengths figs 1d and 2d open squares were higher relative to those at lower ionic strengths figs 1b and 2b open squares the amounts of deposited bacteria in the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions were lower than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g in all salt solutions meanwhile the amounts of retained cells on quartz sand decreased with increasing pamam 3 5g concentrations close inspection of the retained profiles showed that no significant difference in the shape of the retained profiles was present for e coli with and without pamam 3 5g even with different concentrations the observation demonstrated that although the copresence of pamam 3 5g inhibited the bacterial retention in porous media yet it did not affect the shape of bacterial retained profiles in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions colloid size was found to have correlation with transport behaviors of the colloids with decreased transport for larger colloids cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however dynamic light scattering dls results showed pamam 3 5g did not affect the cell sizes as indicted by the equivalent bacterial sizes both with and without pamam 3 5g table s1 the enhanced bacterial transport observed with pamam 3 5g copresent in suspensions would not be caused by the alteration in cell sizes the surface charge of both colloid and porous media due to the adsorption of organic matters e g humic acid proteins perfluorooctanoic acid onto their surfaces has been previously reported to affect colloid transport behaviors chowdhury et al 2012a jiang et al 2012 johnson and logan 1996 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 the presence of pamam 3 5g in suspensions might also alter the surface charge of bacteria and quartz sand via adsorption onto their surfaces to testify adsorption experiments of pamam 3 5g 1 mg l was taken as the representative concentration on both bacteria fig s2 and quartz sand surfaces fig s3 were conducted detailed procedures of the adsorption experiments were provided in supplementary materials the adsorption of pamam 3 5g on both cell and quartz sand surfaces did occur figs s1 and s2 specifically we found that in 25 mm nacl solutions approximate 18 and 6 of pamam 3 5g adsorbed onto both bacteria and quartz sand respectively the pamam 3 5g adsorption might alter the surface charge of both cell and sand to testify the zeta potentials of both bacteria table s1 and quartz sand table s2 both with and without pamam 3 5g under all the experimental conditions were acquired due to the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto their surfaces the absolute zeta potential values of both e coli and quartz sand with pamam 3 5g in suspensions were greater relative to those without pamam 3 5g under all examined solution conditions which would theoretically predict an increased bacterial transport due to the increased repulsive electrostatic force between cell and quartz sand to directly determine the change of interaction forces between bacteria and quartz sand by the copresence of pamam 3 5g the xdlvo energy interactions between cell and sand both with and without pamam 3 5g in suspensions thus were calculated fig s4 the total interaction force between bacteria and sand with pamam 3 5g were more repulsive than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g in all tested salt solutions theoretically supporting the greater bacterial mobility with pamam 3 5g in suspensions than those in the absence of pamam 3 5g under all the experimental conditions figs 1 and 2 it was worth noting that the interaction forces were similar at different pamam 3 5g concentrations which indicated that the concentration of 3 5g has no significant influence on the interaction force profiles between cell and sand other mechanisms thus would control the enhanced bacterial transport with the increase of pamam 3 5g concentrations competition of the deposition sites by the co presence of colloids was proved to be one of the mechanisms enhancing bacterial transport in porous media wu et al 2016 2017 yang et al 2012a to investigate whether pamam 3 5g would also compete the deposition sites with bacteria extra bacterial transport experiments with quartz sand pre covered by 1 mg l pamam 3 5g were conducted in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions in all tested solution conditions breakthrough curves for columns pretreated with pamam 3 5g and without pamam 3 5g in cell suspensions were higher and the retained profiles were lower than those of individual cell transport without pamam 3 5g pretreatment fig 3 clearly sites competition by pamam 3 5g would lead to the greater cell mobility with pamam 3 5g in suspensions moreover the bacterial breakthrough curves only involving with pre covering sand by pamam 3 5g were lower than with pamam 3 5g in cell suspensions yet without pre covering sand by pamam 3 5g clearly competition for deposition sites by pamam 3 5g was not the only mechanism enhancing bacteria transport many previous studies found that suspended organic matters in suspensions could prevent colloids from contacting the quartz sand and resulted in the decreased deposition by steric hindrance effect foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012a due to the small sizes nano scaled pamam more than 4 64 1013 particles ml 10 μg l table s5 were present in suspensions which is at least six orders of magnitude higher than bacteria 1 5 107 cells ml under the experimental conditions according to the adsorption experiments less than 30 and 10 of 3 5g adsorbed onto cell and quartz sand surfaces in 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively since only a small portion of pamam 3 5g adsorbed onto cell and quartz sand surfaces large amounts of suspended pamam 3 5g thus remained in suspensions these great amount of suspended pamam 3 5g particles would occupy the spaces between bacteria and quartz sand and prevent bacteria from attaching on quartz sand surfaces inhibiting bacterial deposition onto quartz sand surfaces via the steric hindrance effect as a result increased transport of bacteria in the copresence of pamam 3 5g was observed 3 2 effect of pamam 4g as stated above negatively charged pamam 3 5g enhanced bacteria transport in quartz sand under all investigated solution conditions to understand whether positively charged pamam 4g would also affect bacterial transport and deposition behaviors the results of e coli transport experiments in both nacl 10 and 25 mm and cacl2 1 2 and 5 mm solutions with pamam 4g were compared with those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 similar as the experiments with pamam 3 5g in suspensions three concentration gradients of 10 μg l 1 and 10 mg l were also considered for pamam 4g unlike those observed for pamam 3 5g the breakthrough curves of bacteria with pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 left solid symbols in suspensions were lower than those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 left open symbols regardless of pamam concentrations under all investigated salt solution conditions exception was in 5 mm cacl2 solutions with 10 mg l pamam for instance in 10 mm nacl solutions nearly 73 9 of bacteria eluted out from the column with the absence of pamam 4g while approximate 57 8 of bacteria broke through the columns with 10 μg l pamam 4g clearly under the majority investigated conditions the presence of pamam 4g decreased bacterial transport in quartz sand the decreased bacterial transport with the presence of positive charge of hematite yang et al 2016 and protein wu et al 2018 have also been reported previously moreover increasing concentration of pamam 4g to 1 mg l induced larger effect on the inhibition of cell transport in porous media the lower breakthrough curves with relatively high concentration of pamam 4g in suspensions indicated that similar to pamam 3 5g the concentration of pamam 4g also affect transport of cells in porous media however it should be noted that further increasing the concentration of pamam 4g to 10 mg l yet increased cell transport relative to that of 1 mg l in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the observations indicated that pamam 4g decreased the bacterial transport behaviors yet the degree of inhibition was sensitive to the concentration of pamam 4g furthermore with 10 mg l pamam 4g copresent in suspensions the effluent cell concentrations that broke through the columns increased with increasing injection duration pore volumes which differed from those of steady state breakthrough plateau with lower pamam 4g concentrations or without the presence of pamam 4g the observation suggested that unlike lower pamam 4g concentrations the presence of 10 mg l pamam 4g could reduce the cell deposition rate coefficient during the transport process contrary to the breakthrough curves the bacterial retained profiles with pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 right solid symbols were higher than those without pamam 4g figs 4 and 5 right open symbols in both nacl and cacl2 solutions exception was in 5 mm cacl2 solutions with 10 mg l pamam for instance 51 0 and 65 1 of cells deposited on sand surface without pamam 4g in suspensions in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively whereas the retained cell percentages increased to around 92 6 and 95 6 with 1 mg l pamam 4g in suspensions respectively meanwhile the retained amount of cells on quartz sand increased with the increase of pamam 4g concentrations from 10 μg l to 1 mg l further increasing the concentration of pamam 4g to 10 mg l yet lowered the overall amounts of e coli retained columns under all solution conditions although different cell deposition behaviors were obtained by the copresence of pamam 4g at diverse concentrations similar shape of bacterial retained profiles yet were observed for experiments either with or without pamam 4g in suspensions under all solution conditions the observation indicated that although the pamam 4g increased the retention of bacteria in columns yet they do not affect the shape of the retained profiles as stated above colloid sizes were found to have correlation with the transport behavior of the colloids cai et al 2014 chowdhury et al 2012b tufenkji and elimelech 2004 however dls measurement results table s1 revealed that the presence of pamam 4g did not induce significant alteration of cell sizes under all ionic strength conditions in two types of salt solutions clearly bacterial size was not a contributor led to the decreased cell transport observed with the copresence of pamam 4g the adsorption of pamam 3 5g onto cell surfaces would affect their surface properties including zeta potential contact angles and hamaker constant the detailed information about determination of contact angles and calculation of hamaker constant were provided in supplementary materials to testify whether pamam 4g would also adsorb onto e coli surfaces adsorption experiments were conducted in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as the representative conditions fig s2 we found that pamam 4g did adsorb onto surfaces of bacteria under the examined solution conditions for instance in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions around 20 and 38 of pamam 4g adsorbed on cell surfaces respectively according to fig s5 approximately 41 and 82 of cell surfaces were covered by pamam 4g in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively the detailed calculation protocol was given in the supplementary materials the partial cell surfaces covered by pamam 4g led to the alteration of bacterial chemical heterogeneity which would theoretically influence the cell transport via the change of electrostatic repulsive interaction with quartz sand to verify zeta potentials table s1 and contact angles table s4 were determined since pamam 4g adsorbed onto cell surfaces zeta potentials of bacterial shifted to positively charged with the copresence of pamam 4g the reversed surface charge of bacteria to positive would theoretically predict a decreased cell transport by reducing repulsion between cell and quartz sand with pamam 4g in suspensions in addition to the change of zeta potentials hamaker constant detailed examination was provided in supplementary materials would also be influenced by the adsorption of pamam 4g on cell surfaces which might affect the interaction energy xdlvo interactions of cell with quartz sand herein to directly determine whether the interaction forces was changed by the copresence of pamam 4g the xdlvo energy interactions both with and without pamam 4g in suspensions at all 4g concentrations were calculated fig 6 the total interaction force with pamam 4g were less repulsive than those in the absence of pamam 4g in both nacl and cacl2 solutions clearly the interaction force with quartz sand was decreased due to the adsorption of pamam 4g onto bacterial surfaces the decreased bacterial transport thus was obtained figs 4 and 5 however interaction force became more repulsive with increasing pamam 4g concentrations which theoretically would predict the increased cell transport with the increase of pamam 4g concentrations although the xdlvo results could explain the relatively increased cell transport with increasing concentration of pamam 4g from 1 to 10 mg l yet they were inconsistent with the inhibited cell transport with the increase of concentration of pamam 4g from 10 μg l to 1 mg l thus other mechanisms would control the cell transport behavior under different concentration gradients the interaction of colloids or organic matters with porous media could also influence the bacterial transport behaviors foppen et al 2006 wu et al 2017 2018 yang et al 2016 to figure out whether the adsorption of the positively charged pamam 4g onto quartz sand would occur pamam 4g adsorption experiments were conducted in two representative solutions in both 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions approximately 7 47 of pamam 4g adsorbed on quartz sand in 25 mm nacl while the percentage of was 8 82 in 5 mm cacl2 solutions according to fig s6 about 35 and 70 of sand surfaces were covered by adsorbed pamam 4g in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions respectively indicating the incomplete coverage of sand surface under all the experimental conditions with the copresence of 1 mg l pamam 4g many previous studies reported that the adsorbed positively charged organic matters would provide extra attractive sites for cell attachment on porous media driving to the greater bacterial retention in columns dong et al 2014 kim et al 2008 thus to further investigate the influence of adsorbed pamam 4g on cell deposition extra experiments with pre equilibrating the columns with 3 pvs of 1 mg l pamam 4g prior to the injection of bacterial suspensions in 25 mm nacl and 5 mm cacl2 solutions as representative conditions were conducted as expected lower breakthrough curves relative to those without pretreatment of sand by pamam 4g were observed for the quartz sand pre covered by pamam 4g fig 7 the results suggested that adsorption of pamam 4g on quartz sand could attract more bacteria attachment via providing extra positive sites for cell clearly as well as the chemical heterogeneity of cell surfaces the chemical heterogeneity on quartz sand surfaces resulted from the adsorption of pamam 4g also have contributed to the inhibited bacteria transport with pamam 4g in suspensions the chemical heterogeneity on either colloid or the collector surfaces has also found to greatly affect the deposition of colloids cai et al 2016 wu et al 2018 it is worth pointing out that comparing with lower concentrations of pamam 4g i e 10 μg l after the injection of bacteria suspensions with the copresence of pamam 4g into columns it would be much sooner faster for the sand surfaces to be covered by pamam 4g due to great chances of collisions between pamam 4g and quartz sand with higher concentrations of pamam 4g i e 1 and 10 mg l thus the chemical heterogeneity on the surfaces could be formed relatively much faster and their amount would be relatively greater as indicated by more positively zeta potentials of quartz sand table s2 at relatively higher pamam concentrations i e 1 and 10 mg l as a result inhibited cell transport with the increase of concentration of pamam 4g from 10 μg l to 1 mg l was obtained however the cell transport increased with increasing concentration of pamam 4g from 1 to 10 mg l which suggested other mechanisms would also affect the cell transport behavior with the copresence of highest concentrations of pamam 4g similar as pamam 3 5g the number of pamam 4g are also at least six orders magnitude larger than much those of cells in suspensions table s5 the great amount of suspended pamam 4g could prevent bacteria from attaching on quartz sand via steric effect which would theoretically enhance bacteria transport however decreased cell transport behaviors were observed under all tested solution conditions with the copresence of pamam 4g in suspensions relative to that without pamam 4g we deduce that the decreased electrostatic repulsion was the dominant contributor to the inhibited cell transport at 10 μg l and 1 mg l relative to those without 4g in suspensions as the concentration of pamam 4g increased up to 10 mg l steric repulsion might also become an important mechanism controlling the cell transport and deposition behaviors in comparison with 1 mg l pamam 4g in suspensions due to the significantly increase of pamam quantity as stated above charge heterogeneity on the quartz sand surfaces by the adsorption of pamam 4g would be formed much faster with the increasing pamam 4g concentrations especially for 10 mg l pamam 4g which would attract more and faster deposition of bacteria and led to the lower effluent cell concentrations during the beginning of transport experiments the first pore volume with copresence of 10 mg l pamam 4g as the continuous injection of bacteria the probability for bacteria to come close to the quartz sand and then deposition onto quartz sand would be greatly decreased due to the steric hindrance effect induced by the relatively larger amount of suspended pamam 4g of 10 mg l than other lower concentrations thus the sharp increased effluent cell concentrations with increased pore volumes were observed with the copresence of 10 mg l pamam 4g under all examined solution conditions clearly the alteration in electrostatic interaction drove to the change of bacterial transport behavior under all the experimental conditions with all the pamam 4g concentrations especially with lower concentrations in addition to electrostatic interaction steric hindrance effect induced by the increased quantities of pamam 4g would also contribute the changed bacterial transport behaviors at the largest pamam 4g concentration 10 mg l 4 conclusion the effects of the negatively 3 5g as the representative and positively 4g as the representative charged pamam on the transport and deposition of bacteria were investigated under different solution conditions ion valence and ionic strength and pamam concentrations the core results showed that negatively charged pamam 3 5g would increase the transport and the enhanced cell transport was more obvious with the increase of pamam concentrations under all the experimental conditions in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the addition of pamam 3 5g in suspensions increased the repulsion both electrostatic repulsive interaction and steric repulsion between cell and quartz sand and partially competed with bacteria for the deposition sites on the quartz sand surfaces resulting in the increased bacterial transport in contrast the presence of positively charged pamam 4g with three concentrations decreased cell transport and increased their deposition under all the experimental conditions the adsorption of pamam 4g onto both cell and quartz sand surfaces reduced repulsive interactions between cell and sand and thus inhibited bacterial transport behaviors steric hindrance effect due to the presence of great amount of suspended pamam 4g with the increase of concentration to 10 mg l also played an important role in bacterial transport and deposition behaviors the results showed that pamam with different terminal groups would drive to distinct bacterial transport behaviors in porous media with enhanced transport with negatively charged pamam yet decreased cell transport with the copresence of positive charged pamam declaration of

18703,calcium phosphate scaling is one of the main limitations in effluent desalination using membranes this may be overcome by tailoring membranes with lower rejection of the scalant ions in this study we systematically examined the use of negatively and positively charged membranes rejecting ions mainly based on donnan exclusion as a low scaling alternative to dielectric exclusion dominated polyamide nf membranes for effluent desalination the two charged membranes exhibited a lower calcium and especially phosphate rejection than the polyamide membrane consequently the calcium phosphate supersaturation and then the propensity to scaling of the charged membranes were much lower than the polyamide membrane this also allowed filtering at a much higher recovery ratio with the charged membranes it was also found that despite the fact that the charged membranes had an opposite fixed charge their scaling behavior was similar apparently although these membranes showed opposite selectivity towards scalant ions phosphate and calcium in single salt solutions the rejection pattern in mixed salt solutions resulted in similar saturation indices much lower than for polyamide membrane the scale formed on all three membranes was identified as amorphous calcium phosphate acp although its saturation index was lower than its solubility factor this was explained by concentration polarization which increases the saturation index in the solution adjacent to the membrane surface tests in absence of permeate flux showed a much slower precipitation that took a few days compared with filtration conditions few hours in addition under these conditions the effect of the scaling on the membrane permeability was generally reduced and the scale contained crystalline calcium phosphate products different from acp the results indicate that the ion rejection and resulting polarization next to the membrane surface plays a crucial role in scaling thus tuning ion selectivity of nf membranes towards scalant ions presents a promising alternative for scaling mitigation during effluent desalination keywords calcium phosphate scaling scale mitigation loose nanofiltration membranes effluent desalination selectivity 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming a critical problem in many places around the world already affecting every continent mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore alternative water resources are needed high quality treated wastewater effluent is considered today to be an important water source for nonpotable reuse especially for irrigation tal 2016 tran et al 2017 vergine et al 2017 however even following advanced tertiary treatment the effluent salinity remains high tds 500 5000 μs cm tal 2016 vergine et al 2017 consequently the application of effluent is limited to specific crops depending on its salinity kaner et al 2017 furthermore effluent application in irrigation for long durations can result in salt accumulation in particular sodium in the vadose zone which adversely affects plant growth and crop production as well as soil properties flörke et al 2019 tal 2016 therefore for sustainable and long term wastewater reuse the effluent quality in general and salinity in particular needs to be improved assouline et al 2015 flörke et al 2019 inyinbor et al 2019 tal 2016 vergine et al 2017 fortunately when the goal is to use the effluent for irrigation not all the dissolved ions need to be removed tal 2016 tran et al 2016 and thus energy demanding reverse osmosis ro membranes which would remove all ions are unnecessary instead low energy desalination systems are more promising these systems can be realized using nanofiltration nf membranes which combine high flux low operation pressure and high retention of small organic molecules mohammad et al 2015 however a major obstacle for effective membrane desalination application is scaling especially when the membranes have high retention of multivalent anions mohammad et al 2015 this also limits the water recovery ratio which is of special importance in inland desalination miller et al 2015 specifically wastewater effluent usually contains high levels of phosphate with concentrations normally in the range of 4 48 mg l greenberg et al 2005 and calcium and consequently the effluent is supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate several researchers have already shown that the major scalant that forms during membrane effluent desalination is a form of calcium phosphate cap greenberg et al 2005 lan et al 2018 levchenko and freger 2016 rathinam et al 2018 various strategies have been investigated and applied to decrease scaling such as the removal or reduction of scale forming species prior to the desalination step filtration under high cross flow velocities or low water recovery in a semi batch configuration warsinger et al 2018 the use of flow reversal uchymiak et al 2009 and the addition of antiscalants which is the primary strategy applied today to reduce inorganic scaling antony et al 2011 tang et al 2016 unfortunately currently there are no suitable antiscalants for amorphous calcium phosphate acp deposition steiner et al 2010 in addition antiscalants can have a negative impact on the environment belkin et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 several studies also suggested that the membrane physicochemical surface properties and morphologic characteristics can impact scale formation and great efforts are being made to investigate this approach kim et al 2010 lin and cohen 2011 rathinam et al 2018 tong et al 2017 recently levchenko and freger suggested a different approach to control scaling on nf membranes by tailoring the membrane to break the symmetry between the ions that permeate or are rejected through the membrane levchenko and freger 2016 since concentrations of both the cations and anions of the precipitating salt affect its supersaturation it was postulated that the reduced rejection and concentration polarization of even one of these ions i e either calcium or phosphate would mitigate membrane scaling this was indeed demonstrated by using a positively charged nf membrane in which the selectivity is governed by the donnan exclusion mechanism resulting in a low rejection of phosphate levchenko and freger 2016 the membrane indeed exhibited little flux decline during the concentration of a synthetic effluent in contrast the polyamide membrane nf270 dominated by the dielectric exclusion mechanism displaying a symmetric high rejection of both phosphate and calcium and consequently a high saturation index si with respect to acp at the membrane surface rapidly scaled when water recovery exceeded 50 this study left open the question of whether a negatively charged nf membrane employing the donnan exclusion to readily pass calcium rather than phosphate would similarly mitigate acp scaling on one hand acp stoichiometry contains more calcium than phosphate thus reduced calcium rejection could mitigate supersaturation more strongly than that of phosphate on the other hand calcium rejection by a negatively charged nf membrane may not be as low as that of phosphate by the positively charged one since the ion characteristics are quite different another point is that phosphate scaling acp formation on the surface was studied only under one set of operational conditions and was not even directly confirmed but merely suggested by the rapid flux decline during the filtration experiments this study aims to close these gaps by including a negatively charged nf membrane that rejects ions mainly based on the donnan exclusion and systematically comparing it with the two other nf types positively charged and dielectric exclusion dominated nf270 membranes with comparable morphologies the study employs different sets of operational conditions and modes of membrane exposure to synthetic feed solutions representative of wastewater effluent supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate as a crucial part of this effort we thoroughly examine the scalant layer on the membrane surface to reveal the relative impact of operational conditions and membrane type on scaling and scalant characteristics the ultimate purpose is to understand the effect of ion rejection and surface characteristics on the acp scaling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chloroform

to obtain a mean value of the rms roughness n 2 2 3 2 membrane transport properties all experiments besides the determination of the molecular weight cut off mwco were performed using a cross flow filtration system fig s1 the system included a cross flow cell with a flow channel of dimensions 3 cm width 0 4 cm height and 8 cm length and a 24 cm2 membrane surface area both the permeate and the retentate streams were recirculated back to the feed tank recycling mode to maintain a constant feed concentration unless stated otherwise the retentate stream passed through a polyester microfilter cartridge 80 μm amiad filtration system israel to separate crystals that might form in the bulk solution the feed solution temperature was kept at 25 c by a thermostat polyscience recirculator the average cross flow feed velocity was set at 0 28 m s reynolds number 1940 the experiments were done under constant pressure and the scaling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in the permeate flux with time using a thermal flow meter bronkhorst netherlands before any experiment the membrane permeance l p was measured with double distilled water ddw following compaction until a constant flux was obtained typically 12 h by 1 l p v a t p where v is the water volume collected l a is the membrane area m2 t is time h and p is the applied pressure bar single salt rejection measurements na2so4 nacl mgso4 and cacl2 were carried out using 1 g l solution as feed the salt rejection was estimated based on the solution conductivity measured using a conductivity meter mettler toledo le703 switzerland and the rejection was estimated based on equation 2 2 r λ f λ p λ f 100 where λ f and λ p are the conductivity of the feed and the permeate respectively the mwco of the membranes was calculated by measuring the rejection of different neutral organic solutes sucrose glucose and 1 kda and 2 kda pegs each one separately using a dead end filtration cell amicon 8050 the concentrations in the feed solution of the sugars and peg were 5 wt and 1 g l respectively the concentrations of sucrose and glucose were determined by using a digital refractometer schmidt haensch germany the concentration of the pegs was obtained by measuring total organic carbon toc shimadzu analyzer japan the mwco of the membrane was determined by the molecular weight of the solute corresponding to 90 retention 2 4 scaling experiments 2 4 1 calculation of saturation index and concentration polarization the average saturation index of acp in the bulk solution sib was calculated in order to estimate the degree of the supersaturation level with respect to acp cah0 22 po4 0 74 christoffersen et al 1990 using the phreeqc minteq v4 database and defined as 3 si b log c a 2 p o 4 3 0 74 h 0 22 k s p where k sp is the thermodynamic solubility product pksp 10 56 christoffersen et al 1990 and x i is the respective ion activity in the feed the si at the membrane surface sim which is higher than in the bulk due to concentration polarization cp was calculated similarly but the concentration of each ion was at the membrane surface was caclulated as lan et al 2018 4 i m i b c p i where cp i is the average concentration polarization factor of ioni which was calculated using the film model eq 5 sutzkover et al 2000 5 c p i c m c b c p c b 1 c p c b exp j v k i where c m c p and c b are the solute concentrations adjacent to the membrane surface and in the permeate and the bulk respectively j v m sec 1 is the permeate flux and k i m sec 1 is the average mass transfer coefficient for ion i k i was determined according to a method described by sutzkover et al 2000 in this method the decline in the permeate flux caused by the addition of salt to deionized water as feed is measured then based on the relation between the net pressure driving force and the osmotic pressure on the membrane surface an average mass transfer coefficient is obtained by 6 k s a l t j v s a l t l n δ p π f π p 1 j v s a l t j v w a t e r where j v salt m sec 1 and j v water m sec 1 are the permeate fluxes with water and the salt solution respectively π f kg m 1 sec 2 and π p kg m 1 sec 2 are the osmotic pressures of the feed and the permeate respectively and δ p is the applied pressure kg m 1 sec 2 it must be note that equation 6 proposed for ro membranes is valid when the water permeability of the membrane does not significantly depend on the salt concentration in the feed and the convective contribution to salt transport is negligible our results below cf fig 6 show that water permeability indeed varied only moderately with changing feed concentration in addition it is well established that convective contribution is small in nf membranes due to small thickness yaroshchuk 2002 bason et al 2009 the average mass transfer coefficient for nacl table 1 was calculated using 7 mmol l 1 nacl which is equivalent to π f 0 34 bar and π p π f 1 r δ p 5 bar and a feed cross flow velocity of 0 28 m s the average mass transfer coefficient for the calcium and phosphate ions in the solution table 1 was calculated using the following equation urama and mariñas 1997 7 k n a c l k i d n a c l d i β where β equals to 2 3 according to the classic boundary layer theory levich 1962 and diffusion coefficient d i was taken from the literature table s1 it is noted that the local mass transfer coefficient at different locations along the membrane varies and can be 3 4 times lower at the exit of the cell as was shown by lyster and cohen 2007 using a cross flow cell with a similar configuration lyster and cohen 2007 2 4 2 scaling experiments the scaling experiments were conducted in the cross flow system at 130 l h at a constant pressure with a similar initial flux 2 4 ml min for all three membranes that was obtained by adjusting the feed pressure 5 9 and 11 bar for nf270 spps and pei respectively the synthetic feed solution had a composition that corresponded to effluents from the shafdan wastewater treatment plant table 2 from table 2 it seems that the supersaturation calculated using the geochemical model software phreeqc minteq v4 database of crystalline hydroxyapatite hap is the highest however due to the slow nucleation of hap it was more likely that acp would be the main scaling salt uskokovi and uskokovi 2011 christoffersen et al 1990 the scaling experiments were conducted under four conditions in order to explore different factors that may influence the scaling degree 1 total recycling mode 2 concentration mode no permeate recycling mode 3 no permeate flux mode i e recycling the feed solution but without filtration no pressure and 4 static mode no feed flow under the total recycling mode both the retentate and the permeate were recycled to the feed tank thus the feed concentration remained constant here the experiments were conducted with the synthetic solution table 2 but with the addition of 35 mg l of phosphate ions and 100 mg l of calcium ions which is what wuld be obtained for 80 recovery assuming perfect rejection of phosphate the calculated sib with respect to acp for this solutoin was 0 25 eq 3 in the no permeate recycling mode the permeate stream was not recirculated back to the feed tank therefore the feed solution concentrated with time the initial feed solution 5 l had the composition of the secondary wastewater effluent table 2 and the experiments ended either when the permeate flux started declining sharply or when the feed volume decreased under 1 0 l when it could no longer be circulated due to technical limitations of the pressure pump the scaling experiments under the no permeate flux mode and the static mode were also conducted with the unsaturated feed solution sib acp 0 25 the no permeate flux mode experiments were conducted for 52 h and 120 h the static mode experiments were done by soaking clean membranes with a 7 cm2 area in a beaker filled with 4 5 l of the scaling solution under constant stirring 100 rpm at room temperature after predetermined times 2 d 5 d and 8 d the membranes were removed and washed by quickly dipping them in milli q water to remove the excess solution then the membranes were taken for analysis before each experiment the membrane was compacted with ddw until a constant flux was obtained then the feed solution without the phosphate salts was filtered until a constant flux was obtained after the permeate flux stabilized the phosphate salts were added to commence the scaling experiments for the no permeate flux mode the membrane flux was also measured following the experiment during the experiments water samples were collected from the feed and the permeate every few hours for analysis by inductively coupled plasma icp varian 720 es the chloride concentration was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa or from the charge balance all scaling experiments were done at least in duplicate and the results were almost identical in all cases 2 4 3 scale characteristics after each scaling experiment the scaled membrane was analyzed the scaled membrane surface at different locations along the membrane inlet center and outlet was investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei company netherlands and with sem with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds before the measurement the membrane sample was coated with an approximately 20 nm thick gold layer the mineral scale crystals were examined by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical b v almelo the netherlands the diffraction patterns were recorded within the range 10 70 with cukα radiation λ 1 54178 å at 40 kv and 30 ma scans were run for 15 min in an angular range 10 60 with 0 033 steps in addition the ionic composition of the scaling layer was determined by soaking the membrane in a 25 mm hcl solution overnight and analyzing the ion concentrations by icp 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization and ion rejection pattern atr ftir xps and zeta potential measurements were employed to confirm the fabrication of membranes with positively and negatively charged surfaces the atr ftir spectrum following coating of the pes membrane with spps fig s2 shows that a new band appears at 1026 cm 1 assigned to symmetric stretching of the aromatic sulfonic acid group the changes in the c s and the c n ratios measured using xps table 3 show the successful coating of the pes support with spps and pei the c s ratio decreased from 16 7 to 12 8 following coating with spps due to the increase in the s content whereas coating with pei resulted in a decrease in the c n ratio from 21 2 to 10 3 due to the high n content in pei the n content in pes is most likely due to the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the pes membrane bernstein et al 2018 the zeta potential measurements in fig 1 demonstrate that the coating with pei and spps resulted in positively and negatively surfaces respectively the spps coated membrane was negatively charged over the entire ph range because of the strong acidic sulfonate groups whereas the pei coated membrane was positively charged throughout the ph range due to the amine groups the poly piperazine amide nf270 showed a typical zeta potential with an isoelectric point at ph 3 5 gerardo et al 2015 the rejection of four single salt solutions in fig 2 clearly shows that the sequence of the salt rejection of the spps and pei coated membranes is according to the donnan exclusion for negatively na2so4 nacl mgso4 cacl2 and positively charged membranes cacl2 nacl mgso4 na2so4 respectively on the other hand the rejection of the divalent ions mgso4 of the nf270 membrane was much higher than the single ion salt and the na2so4 higher than the cacl2 this pattern corresponds to a mechanism strongly dominated by the dielectric exclusion with some contribution of steric and donnan effects as expected for a low dielectric polyamide membrane containing some negatively charged carboxylic groups it is generally presumed that hydrophilic membranes and membranes with low surface roughness have a lower propensity for scaling kim et al 2010 lin and cohen 2011 therefore the surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the three membranes were compared as well the contact angle ca value table 4 of the nf270 membrane was comparable to the ca values reported by others ben david et al 2010 park et al 2006 and qualified this membrane as hydrophilic the contact angle of the two fabricated charged membranes were similar and somewhat higher than that of the nf270 but these membranes can still be considered hydrophilic which probably is due to the charged functional groups the surface roughness of the nf270 table 4 was lower than the roughness levels of the spps and the pei which were similar the mwco of the nf270 membrane estimated from fig s3 which correlates to the pore size was also much lower than that of the two fabricated membranes based on the relatively high mwco of the charged membranes they can be defined as loose nf membranes and therefore the steric and probably the dielectric mechanisms are lower than those of dense nf membranes such as the nf270 this may influence the effluent quality in a real application which was out of the scope of the current study but a significant effect the mwco of the membrane on scaling at this pore size range 0 5 2 nm to the best of our knowledge was not reported 3 2 scaling experiments in the recycling mode the scaling propensity of the three membranes during filtration was first studied under the recycling mode with a synthetic effluent sib acp 0 25 representative results of the normalized flux during the filtration for each membrane are presented in fig 3 the inset in fig 3 indicates that the lag time the time before the permeate flux began to decrease i e induction time was very short for all three membranes probably due to a high supersaturation on the membrane surface warsinger et al 2018 the fact that the sib was negative implies that the sim was much higher than the sib as is discussed later in addition fig 3 shows that the flux decline was rapid and had a similar rate for all three membranes during the first few hours of filtration up to approx 7 h which may indicate that initially the scaling of the three membranes was similar however after a few hours the rate of the flux decline in the spps and the pei coated membranes decreased in a similar manner whereas the flux for the nf270 membrane continued to decline at a fairly constant rate throughout the experiment as a result the final flux for the spps and the pei coated membranes at the end of the experiments after 52 h was about 55 of the initial flux compared with 30 for the nf270 membrane the sem images taken after the filtration experiments at different locations along the membrane surface inlet center outlet fig s4 revealed that the flux decline of all three membranes was due to scaling and that the scaling degree increased along the flow channel due to differences in the local cp which increased towards the exit of the flow channel lyster and cohen 2007 it also shows that the higher flux decline rate of the nf270 polyamide membrane was most likely due to a much higher surface coverage and larger particle size compared to the two charged membranes the chemical composition of the scale was further analyzed in the middle location where the hydrodynamic conditions and thus the cp are weakly affected by the cell geometry lyster and cohen 2007 the sem eds analysis fig 4 demonstrates that the scale was mainly composed of phosphate and calcium ions and that sulfur ions were not detected which implies that the main scalant was cap minerals the spherical agglomerates in the sem images suggested that the scale consisted mainly of acp as was also suggested by others uskokovi and uskokovi 2011 this conclusion is supported by the xrd spectra which showed no new peaks for the surface of any of the three membranes after scaling fig s5 the icp results of the dissolved scaling layer also show that only p and ca were detected table 5 while other major ions such as s k na and mg were under the detection limit the ca p molar ratio for all three scaled membranes table 5 was also consistent with the conclusion that the same phase of amorphous calcium phosphate formed on all membranes in an attempt to elucidate the differences in the scaling behavior the selectivity of the membranes towards ionic species involved in the filtration experiments was measured the rejection of the multivalent ions ca2 mg2 hpo4 2 so4 2 was lower for the spps and pei coated membranes than for the nf270 membrane fig 5 in particular the phosphate rejection of the nf270 membrane was almost 100 and therefore the phosphate ion concentration adjacent the membrane surface was very high average cpof calcium phosphate was 2 8 it should also be noted that the rejection of phosphate and calcium ions for the synthetic effluent was similar for the two charged membranes fig 5 although the rejection of these ions in single salts was totally different fig 2 this is obviously the result of the coupling between the permeation of different ions in a multi ion solution through the transmembrane potential yaroshchuk et al 2011 pages et al 2013 yaroshchuk and bruening 2017 note that na and cl rejection is commensurate for all membranes being only somewhat higher for nf270 although nacl cannot be considered a dominant salt since na constitutes less than 50 of the cationic charge a rough estimate of the transmembrane potential δφm can be made using the nernst equation based on nacl rejection r nacl 8 δ φ m r t f l n 1 r n a c l where r t and f have their standard electrochemical meaning the sign is determined by the ratio of the cation and anion transport numbers and given that r nacl is similar for the positively and negatively charged membranes the potential has roughly the same absolute value but the opposite signs for the negatively charged membrane this reduces phosphate and increases calcium rejection compared with single salts and for the positively charged membrane it does the opposite as a result the calcium and phosphate rejection becomes similar for the mixed feed given the similar effect of the two ions on the si of acp exponents in eq 3 it could be anticipated that both membrane types would have phosphate scaling reduced in a similar manner compared with nf270 which showed a high rejection of both ions and hence stronger scaling based on the ion rejections and the cp factor for each membrane the average supersaturation ratio along the membrane surface sim could be evaluated eq 4 the initial sim of the acp for both charged membranes was similar sim 0 11 and 0 10 respectively and was by about 0 36 higher than the sib whereas for the nf270 membrane the increase above sib was higher by about 0 46 sim 0 21 the difference is attributed to the higher cp factor of nf270 because of its much higher phosphate and calcium rejection nonetheless the uneven cp throughout the filtration cell lyster and cohen 2007 was probably the reason that fast scaling occurred for all three membranes fig 3 insert the sim at any specific location along the membrane surface decreased with the filtration time due to the reduction in the permeate flux assuming the boundary layer thickness weakly changed with the filtration time which can explain the changes in the flux decline rate of the charged membranes for example the estimated sim values for the membranes at j v 0 8j v0 the onset of the flux decline of the charged membranes were only 0 02 and 0 01 for the spps and pei coated membranes respectively on the other hand sim of acp for the nf270 membrane was higher and more significantly above sib thus the scaling and relative flux decline for the nf270 polyamide membrane steadily continued during the entire recycling mode experiment fig 3 3 3 scaling experiments in no permeate recycling mode the recovery ratio that can obtained with each membrane up until the point when the onset of flux decline was recorded fig 6 points a c was also examined by conducting scaling experiments under no permeate recycling mode sib 0 92 in which the permeate was collected thereby the salt concentration in the feed and si increased here the initial sim acp values of the spps and pei coated membranes were sim acp 0 49 and 0 50 respectively compared to sim acp 0 34 for the nf270 membrane as seen in fig 6 the normalized permeate flux of the nf270 membrane sharply decreased after collecting 2 0 l of the permeate after 13 3 h which was equivalent to approximately 40 recovery sim acp 0 23 at 40 water recovery as mentioned before although the average sim was negative precipitation occurred due to a much higher local cp along the flow channel and especially at the exit this was due to the high rejection of phosphate and calcium by the nf270 membrane thus the flux decline rate accelerated after 40 recovery and sim increased reaching sim 0 1 at 65 water recovery at 27 2 h on the other hand the spps and pei coated membranes experienced a small and gradual flux decline up until 3 5 l of the permeate was collected i e at 70 water recovery after 27 5 h at this stage the saturation index of both membranes was sim acp 0 27 the sem images fig 7 clearly demonstrate the formation of acp scale on the nf270 membrane surface confirmed by eds analysis in fig 8 at the onset of the flux decline points a c in fig 6 which increased with the recovery ratio fig 6 point d note that the flux also declined with increasing recovery for the charged membranes though to a much lesser degree and the final permeate flux was 88 of the initial flux this could not be explained by the increased osmotic pressure of the feed which would yield only about a 3 5 decline based on the calculated changes in ion concentrations see tables s2 4 it is then presumed that the decrease was due to minor scaling as well as osmotic deswelling i e reduced swelling of the membrane active layer due to decreasing water activity in the solution dražević et al 2014 freger et al 2000 nilsson et al 2008 3 4 scaling under non filtration experiments 3 4 1 scaling under no permeate flux mode it was suggested that the membrane surface properties may have an important impact on scale formation rathinam et al 2018 steiner et al 2010 tong et al 2017 therefore the scaling experiments were also conducted without filtration this was first elucidated by experiments in the no permeate flux mode in which the unsaturated feed solution sib acp 0 25 was circulated over the membrane for 52 h and then 120 h without applying pressure i e without filtration the sem images taken after 52 h showed that no scaling could be detected for any of the three membranes and no calcium or phosphate was measured by the eds analysis figs s6 and s7 in addition the permeate flux before and after these experiments did not change for any of the three membranes table 6 as seen in the sem images and sem eds analysis figs s8 and s9 scaling started to occur between 52 and 120 h compared to about an hour or a few hours during the filtration experiments or the non recycling conditions the membrane permeance after 120 h also showed little relation with the pristine membrane permeate flux table 6 furthermore the ca p ratio as well as the presence of mg na and k ions results not shown and the crystal morphology fig s8 were different compared to the results that were obtained under the two filtration mode experiments suggesting a different scaling mechanism under the no permeate flux conditions two new peaks that were found in the xrd spectra of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes support this assumption unfortunately the peaks could not not assinged to a specific crystalline phase since the xrd spectrum was noisy and probably incomplete the higher flux decline of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes as well as the higher content of scalant ions and the formation of the new crystals based on the icp table 6 and sem and sem eds measurements figs s6 9 found on these membranes compared with the spps coated membrane indicated that the latter surprisingly experienced less scaling this was in contrast to similarly low scaling for the two charged membranes during the filtration experiments the reason for this differnce is unclear and will have to be clarified in a future study 3 4 2 static experiments the effects of the surface properties on the formation and adsorption of the acp were further studied under static conditions by immersing the membranes vertically to eliminate particle sedimentation on the membrane surface in the scaling solution sib acp 0 25 for different periods of time as was found in the no permeate flux mode scaling occurred after at least 2 days fig s10 and fig s11 in addition based on the sem sem eds and xrd measurements figs s10 s16 the scaling of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes was similar and higher than that of the spps coated membrane similar to the findings under the no permeate flux mode these results reveal that the ion rejection by the membranes or the ion concentration at the membrane surface is the dominant cause for scaling on the membrane surface during filtration and that the surface properties have less impact on scaling as was also previously suggested by shaffer et al 2016 it is also noted that although the membrane surface properties have a marginal effect on scaling they do have an influence on other important parameters such as the rejection of total organics and micropollutants and on organic and bio fouling dahdal et al 2014 quay et al 2018 thompson et al 2012 wang et al 2016 since the latter can also affect scaling these parameters should be investigated in order to understand what should be the optimal characteristics of nf membranes for effluent desalination 4 conclusions the effect of the ion exclusion mechanism of nf membranes on the acp scaling during wastewater desalination was investigated using a synthetic secondary effluent for three different nf membranes two charged membranes one with a positive and the other with a negative fixed charge and a commercial polyamide membrane nf270 the exclusion mechanism of the two charged membranes was dominated by the donnan exclusion whereas the exclusion mechanism of the polyamide nf membrane was dominated by the dielectric effect with some contributions from steric and donnan exclusions therefore the scalant ion rejection p and ca in a mixed effluent as well as the cp levels for these ions were similar for the charged membranes but much lower than for the polyamide membrane consequently the two charged membranes had a similar but much lower propensity for scaling than the nf270 membrane it was also found that the scale was composed of amorphous calcium phosphate for all three membranes although its feed saturation index was sometimes negative and much lower than for other calcium phosphate products the scaling under no filtration conditions with and without cross flow was much slower than in the filtration modes and also resulted in different scaling products this indicates a marginal effect of the membrane surface properties on the scale formation during effluent desalination these results imply that for effluent desalination where the salt rejection does not have to be high new nf membranes with much less ca and or p rejection should be developed which could mitigate scaling and allow much higher recoveries clearly more research is still needed to elucidate the effect of the membrane charge on other important phenomena in effluent

18703,calcium phosphate scaling is one of the main limitations in effluent desalination using membranes this may be overcome by tailoring membranes with lower rejection of the scalant ions in this study we systematically examined the use of negatively and positively charged membranes rejecting ions mainly based on donnan exclusion as a low scaling alternative to dielectric exclusion dominated polyamide nf membranes for effluent desalination the two charged membranes exhibited a lower calcium and especially phosphate rejection than the polyamide membrane consequently the calcium phosphate supersaturation and then the propensity to scaling of the charged membranes were much lower than the polyamide membrane this also allowed filtering at a much higher recovery ratio with the charged membranes it was also found that despite the fact that the charged membranes had an opposite fixed charge their scaling behavior was similar apparently although these membranes showed opposite selectivity towards scalant ions phosphate and calcium in single salt solutions the rejection pattern in mixed salt solutions resulted in similar saturation indices much lower than for polyamide membrane the scale formed on all three membranes was identified as amorphous calcium phosphate acp although its saturation index was lower than its solubility factor this was explained by concentration polarization which increases the saturation index in the solution adjacent to the membrane surface tests in absence of permeate flux showed a much slower precipitation that took a few days compared with filtration conditions few hours in addition under these conditions the effect of the scaling on the membrane permeability was generally reduced and the scale contained crystalline calcium phosphate products different from acp the results indicate that the ion rejection and resulting polarization next to the membrane surface plays a crucial role in scaling thus tuning ion selectivity of nf membranes towards scalant ions presents a promising alternative for scaling mitigation during effluent desalination keywords calcium phosphate scaling scale mitigation loose nanofiltration membranes effluent desalination selectivity 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming a critical problem in many places around the world already affecting every continent mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore alternative water resources are needed high quality treated wastewater effluent is considered today to be an important water source for nonpotable reuse especially for irrigation tal 2016 tran et al 2017 vergine et al 2017 however even following advanced tertiary treatment the effluent salinity remains high tds 500 5000 μs cm tal 2016 vergine et al 2017 consequently the application of effluent is limited to specific crops depending on its salinity kaner et al 2017 furthermore effluent application in irrigation for long durations can result in salt accumulation in particular sodium in the vadose zone which adversely affects plant growth and crop production as well as soil properties flörke et al 2019 tal 2016 therefore for sustainable and long term wastewater reuse the effluent quality in general and salinity in particular needs to be improved assouline et al 2015 flörke et al 2019 inyinbor et al 2019 tal 2016 vergine et al 2017 fortunately when the goal is to use the effluent for irrigation not all the dissolved ions need to be removed tal 2016 tran et al 2016 and thus energy demanding reverse osmosis ro membranes which would remove all ions are unnecessary instead low energy desalination systems are more promising these systems can be realized using nanofiltration nf membranes which combine high flux low operation pressure and high retention of small organic molecules mohammad et al 2015 however a major obstacle for effective membrane desalination application is scaling especially when the membranes have high retention of multivalent anions mohammad et al 2015 this also limits the water recovery ratio which is of special importance in inland desalination miller et al 2015 specifically wastewater effluent usually contains high levels of phosphate with concentrations normally in the range of 4 48 mg l greenberg et al 2005 and calcium and consequently the effluent is supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate several researchers have already shown that the major scalant that forms during membrane effluent desalination is a form of calcium phosphate cap greenberg et al 2005 lan et al 2018 levchenko and freger 2016 rathinam et al 2018 various strategies have been investigated and applied to decrease scaling such as the removal or reduction of scale forming species prior to the desalination step filtration under high cross flow velocities or low water recovery in a semi batch configuration warsinger et al 2018 the use of flow reversal uchymiak et al 2009 and the addition of antiscalants which is the primary strategy applied today to reduce inorganic scaling antony et al 2011 tang et al 2016 unfortunately currently there are no suitable antiscalants for amorphous calcium phosphate acp deposition steiner et al 2010 in addition antiscalants can have a negative impact on the environment belkin et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 several studies also suggested that the membrane physicochemical surface properties and morphologic characteristics can impact scale formation and great efforts are being made to investigate this approach kim et al 2010 lin and cohen 2011 rathinam et al 2018 tong et al 2017 recently levchenko and freger suggested a different approach to control scaling on nf membranes by tailoring the membrane to break the symmetry between the ions that permeate or are rejected through the membrane levchenko and freger 2016 since concentrations of both the cations and anions of the precipitating salt affect its supersaturation it was postulated that the reduced rejection and concentration polarization of even one of these ions i e either calcium or phosphate would mitigate membrane scaling this was indeed demonstrated by using a positively charged nf membrane in which the selectivity is governed by the donnan exclusion mechanism resulting in a low rejection of phosphate levchenko and freger 2016 the membrane indeed exhibited little flux decline during the concentration of a synthetic effluent in contrast the polyamide membrane nf270 dominated by the dielectric exclusion mechanism displaying a symmetric high rejection of both phosphate and calcium and consequently a high saturation index si with respect to acp at the membrane surface rapidly scaled when water recovery exceeded 50 this study left open the question of whether a negatively charged nf membrane employing the donnan exclusion to readily pass calcium rather than phosphate would similarly mitigate acp scaling on one hand acp stoichiometry contains more calcium than phosphate thus reduced calcium rejection could mitigate supersaturation more strongly than that of phosphate on the other hand calcium rejection by a negatively charged nf membrane may not be as low as that of phosphate by the positively charged one since the ion characteristics are quite different another point is that phosphate scaling acp formation on the surface was studied only under one set of operational conditions and was not even directly confirmed but merely suggested by the rapid flux decline during the filtration experiments this study aims to close these gaps by including a negatively charged nf membrane that rejects ions mainly based on the donnan exclusion and systematically comparing it with the two other nf types positively charged and dielectric exclusion dominated nf270 membranes with comparable morphologies the study employs different sets of operational conditions and modes of membrane exposure to synthetic feed solutions representative of wastewater effluent supersaturated with respect to calcium phosphate as a crucial part of this effort we thoroughly examine the scalant layer on the membrane surface to reveal the relative impact of operational conditions and membrane type on scaling and scalant characteristics the ultimate purpose is to understand the effect of ion rejection and surface characteristics on the acp scaling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chloroform

filtration system fig s1 the system included a cross flow cell with a flow channel of dimensions 3 cm width 0 4 cm height and 8 cm length and a 24 cm2 membrane surface area both the permeate and the retentate streams were recirculated back to the feed tank recycling mode to maintain a constant feed concentration unless stated otherwise the retentate stream passed through a polyester microfilter cartridge 80 μm amiad filtration system israel to separate crystals that might form in the bulk solution the feed solution temperature was kept at 25 c by a thermostat polyscience recirculator the average cross flow feed velocity was set at 0 28 m s reynolds number 1940 the experiments were done under constant pressure and the scaling was evaluated by monitoring the changes in the permeate flux with time using a thermal flow meter bronkhorst netherlands before any experiment the membrane permeance l p was measured with double distilled water ddw following compaction until a constant flux was obtained typically 12 h by 1 l p v a t p where v is the water volume collected l a is the membrane area m2 t is time h and p is the applied pressure bar single salt rejection measurements na2so4 nacl mgso4 and cacl2 were carried out using 1 g l solution as feed the salt rejection was estimated based on the solution conductivity measured using a conductivity meter mettler toledo le703 switzerland and the rejection was estimated based on equation 2 2 r λ f λ p λ f 100 where λ f and λ p are the conductivity of the feed and the permeate respectively the mwco of the membranes was calculated by measuring the rejection of different neutral organic solutes sucrose glucose and 1 kda and 2 kda pegs each one separately using a dead end filtration cell amicon 8050 the concentrations in the feed solution of the sugars and peg were 5 wt and 1 g l respectively the concentrations of sucrose and glucose were determined by using a digital refractometer schmidt haensch germany the concentration of the pegs was obtained by measuring total organic carbon toc shimadzu analyzer japan the mwco of the membrane was determined by the molecular weight of the solute corresponding to 90 retention 2 4 scaling experiments 2 4 1 calculation of saturation index and concentration polarization the average saturation index of acp in the bulk solution sib was calculated in order to estimate the degree of the supersaturation level with respect to acp cah0 22 po4 0 74 christoffersen et al 1990 using the phreeqc minteq v4 database and defined as 3 si b log c a 2 p o 4 3 0 74 h 0 22 k s p where k sp is the thermodynamic solubility product pksp 10 56 christoffersen et al 1990 and x i is the respective ion activity in the feed the si at the membrane surface sim which is higher than in the bulk due to concentration polarization cp was calculated similarly but the concentration of each ion was at the membrane surface was caclulated as lan et al 2018 4 i m i b c p i where cp i is the average concentration polarization factor of ioni which was calculated using the film model eq 5 sutzkover et al 2000 5 c p i c m c b c p c b 1 c p c b exp j v k i where c m c p and c b are the solute concentrations adjacent to the membrane surface and in the permeate and the bulk respectively j v m sec 1 is the permeate flux and k i m sec 1 is the average mass transfer coefficient for ion i k i was determined according to a method described by sutzkover et al 2000 in this method the decline in the permeate flux caused by the addition of salt to deionized water as feed is measured then based on the relation between the net pressure driving force and the osmotic pressure on the membrane surface an average mass transfer coefficient is obtained by 6 k s a l t j v s a l t l n δ p π f π p 1 j v s a l t j v w a t e r where j v salt m sec 1 and j v water m sec 1 are the permeate fluxes with water and the salt solution respectively π f kg m 1 sec 2 and π p kg m 1 sec 2 are the osmotic pressures of the feed and the permeate respectively and δ p is the applied pressure kg m 1 sec 2 it must be note that equation 6 proposed for ro membranes is valid when the water permeability of the membrane does not significantly depend on the salt concentration in the feed and the convective contribution to salt transport is negligible our results below cf fig 6 show that water permeability indeed varied only moderately with changing feed concentration in addition it is well established that convective contribution is small in nf membranes due to small thickness yaroshchuk 2002 bason et al 2009 the average mass transfer coefficient for nacl table 1 was calculated using 7 mmol l 1 nacl which is equivalent to π f 0 34 bar and π p π f 1 r δ p 5 bar and a feed cross flow velocity of 0 28 m s the average mass transfer coefficient for the calcium and phosphate ions in the solution table 1 was calculated using the following equation urama and mariñas 1997 7 k n a c l k i d n a c l d i β where β equals to 2 3 according to the classic boundary layer theory levich 1962 and diffusion coefficient d i was taken from the literature table s1 it is noted that the local mass transfer coefficient at different locations along the membrane varies and can be 3 4 times lower at the exit of the cell as was shown by lyster and cohen 2007 using a cross flow cell with a similar configuration lyster and cohen 2007 2 4 2 scaling experiments the scaling experiments were conducted in the cross flow system at 130 l h at a constant pressure with a similar initial flux 2 4 ml min for all three membranes that was obtained by adjusting the feed pressure 5 9 and 11 bar for nf270 spps and pei respectively the synthetic feed solution had a composition that corresponded to effluents from the shafdan wastewater treatment plant table 2 from table 2 it seems that the supersaturation calculated using the geochemical model software phreeqc minteq v4 database of crystalline hydroxyapatite hap is the highest however due to the slow nucleation of hap it was more likely that acp would be the main scaling salt uskokovi and uskokovi 2011 christoffersen et al 1990 the scaling experiments were conducted under four conditions in order to explore different factors that may influence the scaling degree 1 total recycling mode 2 concentration mode no permeate recycling mode 3 no permeate flux mode i e recycling the feed solution but without filtration no pressure and 4 static mode no feed flow under the total recycling mode both the retentate and the permeate were recycled to the feed tank thus the feed concentration remained constant here the experiments were conducted with the synthetic solution table 2 but with the addition of 35 mg l of phosphate ions and 100 mg l of calcium ions which is what wuld be obtained for 80 recovery assuming perfect rejection of phosphate the calculated sib with respect to acp for this solutoin was 0 25 eq 3 in the no permeate recycling mode the permeate stream was not recirculated back to the feed tank therefore the feed solution concentrated with time the initial feed solution 5 l had the composition of the secondary wastewater effluent table 2 and the experiments ended either when the permeate flux started declining sharply or when the feed volume decreased under 1 0 l when it could no longer be circulated due to technical limitations of the pressure pump the scaling experiments under the no permeate flux mode and the static mode were also conducted with the unsaturated feed solution sib acp 0 25 the no permeate flux mode experiments were conducted for 52 h and 120 h the static mode experiments were done by soaking clean membranes with a 7 cm2 area in a beaker filled with 4 5 l of the scaling solution under constant stirring 100 rpm at room temperature after predetermined times 2 d 5 d and 8 d the membranes were removed and washed by quickly dipping them in milli q water to remove the excess solution then the membranes were taken for analysis before each experiment the membrane was compacted with ddw until a constant flux was obtained then the feed solution without the phosphate salts was filtered until a constant flux was obtained after the permeate flux stabilized the phosphate salts were added to commence the scaling experiments for the no permeate flux mode the membrane flux was also measured following the experiment during the experiments water samples were collected from the feed and the permeate every few hours for analysis by inductively coupled plasma icp varian 720 es the chloride concentration was determined by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa or from the charge balance all scaling experiments were done at least in duplicate and the results were almost identical in all cases 2 4 3 scale characteristics after each scaling experiment the scaled membrane was analyzed the scaled membrane surface at different locations along the membrane inlet center and outlet was investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei company netherlands and with sem with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds before the measurement the membrane sample was coated with an approximately 20 nm thick gold layer the mineral scale crystals were examined by x ray diffraction xrd panalytical b v almelo the netherlands the diffraction patterns were recorded within the range 10 70 with cukα radiation λ 1 54178 å at 40 kv and 30 ma scans were run for 15 min in an angular range 10 60 with 0 033 steps in addition the ionic composition of the scaling layer was determined by soaking the membrane in a 25 mm hcl solution overnight and analyzing the ion concentrations by icp 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization and ion rejection pattern atr ftir xps and zeta potential measurements were employed to confirm the fabrication of membranes with positively and negatively charged surfaces the atr ftir spectrum following coating of the pes membrane with spps fig s2 shows that a new band appears at 1026 cm 1 assigned to symmetric stretching of the aromatic sulfonic acid group the changes in the c s and the c n ratios measured using xps table 3 show the successful coating of the pes support with spps and pei the c s ratio decreased from 16 7 to 12 8 following coating with spps due to the increase in the s content whereas coating with pei resulted in a decrease in the c n ratio from 21 2 to 10 3 due to the high n content in pei the n content in pes is most likely due to the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the pes membrane bernstein et al 2018 the zeta potential measurements in fig 1 demonstrate that the coating with pei and spps resulted in positively and negatively surfaces respectively the spps coated membrane was negatively charged over the entire ph range because of the strong acidic sulfonate groups whereas the pei coated membrane was positively charged throughout the ph range due to the amine groups the poly piperazine amide nf270 showed a typical zeta potential with an isoelectric point at ph 3 5 gerardo et al 2015 the rejection of four single salt solutions in fig 2 clearly shows that the sequence of the salt rejection of the spps and pei coated membranes is according to the donnan exclusion for negatively na2so4 nacl mgso4 cacl2 and positively charged membranes cacl2 nacl mgso4 na2so4 respectively on the other hand the rejection of the divalent ions mgso4 of the nf270 membrane was much higher than the single ion salt and the na2so4 higher than the cacl2 this pattern corresponds to a mechanism strongly dominated by the dielectric exclusion with some contribution of steric and donnan effects as expected for a low dielectric polyamide membrane containing some negatively charged carboxylic groups it is generally presumed that hydrophilic membranes and membranes with low surface roughness have a lower propensity for scaling kim et al 2010 lin and cohen 2011 therefore the surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the three membranes were compared as well the contact angle ca value table 4 of the nf270 membrane was comparable to the ca values reported by others ben david et al 2010 park et al 2006 and qualified this membrane as hydrophilic the contact angle of the two fabricated charged membranes were similar and somewhat higher than that of the nf270 but these membranes can still be considered hydrophilic which probably is due to the charged functional groups the surface roughness of the nf270 table 4 was lower than the roughness levels of the spps and the pei which were similar the mwco of the nf270 membrane estimated from fig s3 which correlates to the pore size was also much lower than that of the two fabricated membranes based on the relatively high mwco of the charged membranes they can be defined as loose nf membranes and therefore the steric and probably the dielectric mechanisms are lower than those of dense nf membranes such as the nf270 this may influence the effluent quality in a real application which was out of the scope of the current study but a significant effect the mwco of the membrane on scaling at this pore size range 0 5 2 nm to the best of our knowledge was not reported 3 2 scaling experiments in the recycling mode the scaling propensity of the three membranes during filtration was first studied under the recycling mode with a synthetic effluent sib acp 0 25 representative results of the normalized flux during the filtration for each membrane are presented in fig 3 the inset in fig 3 indicates that the lag time the time before the permeate flux began to decrease i e induction time was very short for all three membranes probably due to a high supersaturation on the membrane surface warsinger et al 2018 the fact that the sib was negative implies that the sim was much higher than the sib as is discussed later in addition fig 3 shows that the flux decline was rapid and had a similar rate for all three membranes during the first few hours of filtration up to approx 7 h which may indicate that initially the scaling of the three membranes was similar however after a few hours the rate of the flux decline in the spps and the pei coated membranes decreased in a similar manner whereas the flux for the nf270 membrane continued to decline at a fairly constant rate throughout the experiment as a result the final flux for the spps and the pei coated membranes at the end of the experiments after 52 h was about 55 of the initial flux compared with 30 for the nf270 membrane the sem images taken after the filtration experiments at different locations along the membrane surface inlet center outlet fig s4 revealed that the flux decline of all three membranes was due to scaling and that the scaling degree increased along the flow channel due to differences in the local cp which increased towards the exit of the flow channel lyster and cohen 2007 it also shows that the higher flux decline rate of the nf270 polyamide membrane was most likely due to a much higher surface coverage and larger particle size compared to the two charged membranes the chemical composition of the scale was further analyzed in the middle location where the hydrodynamic conditions and thus the cp are weakly affected by the cell geometry lyster and cohen 2007 the sem eds analysis fig 4 demonstrates that the scale was mainly composed of phosphate and calcium ions and that sulfur ions were not detected which implies that the main scalant was cap minerals the spherical agglomerates in the sem images suggested that the scale consisted mainly of acp as was also suggested by others uskokovi and uskokovi 2011 this conclusion is supported by the xrd spectra which showed no new peaks for the surface of any of the three membranes after scaling fig s5 the icp results of the dissolved scaling layer also show that only p and ca were detected table 5 while other major ions such as s k na and mg were under the detection limit the ca p molar ratio for all three scaled membranes table 5 was also consistent with the conclusion that the same phase of amorphous calcium phosphate formed on all membranes in an attempt to elucidate the differences in the scaling behavior the selectivity of the membranes towards ionic species involved in the filtration experiments was measured the rejection of the multivalent ions ca2 mg2 hpo4 2 so4 2 was lower for the spps and pei coated membranes than for the nf270 membrane fig 5 in particular the phosphate rejection of the nf270 membrane was almost 100 and therefore the phosphate ion concentration adjacent the membrane surface was very high average cpof calcium phosphate was 2 8 it should also be noted that the rejection of phosphate and calcium ions for the synthetic effluent was similar for the two charged membranes fig 5 although the rejection of these ions in single salts was totally different fig 2 this is obviously the result of the coupling between the permeation of different ions in a multi ion solution through the transmembrane potential yaroshchuk et al 2011 pages et al 2013 yaroshchuk and bruening 2017 note that na and cl rejection is commensurate for all membranes being only somewhat higher for nf270 although nacl cannot be considered a dominant salt since na constitutes less than 50 of the cationic charge a rough estimate of the transmembrane potential δφm can be made using the nernst equation based on nacl rejection r nacl 8 δ φ m r t f l n 1 r n a c l where r t and f have their standard electrochemical meaning the sign is determined by the ratio of the cation and anion transport numbers and given that r nacl is similar for the positively and negatively charged membranes the potential has roughly the same absolute value but the opposite signs for the negatively charged membrane this reduces phosphate and increases calcium rejection compared with single salts and for the positively charged membrane it does the opposite as a result the calcium and phosphate rejection becomes similar for the mixed feed given the similar effect of the two ions on the si of acp exponents in eq 3 it could be anticipated that both membrane types would have phosphate scaling reduced in a similar manner compared with nf270 which showed a high rejection of both ions and hence stronger scaling based on the ion rejections and the cp factor for each membrane the average supersaturation ratio along the membrane surface sim could be evaluated eq 4 the initial sim of the acp for both charged membranes was similar sim 0 11 and 0 10 respectively and was by about 0 36 higher than the sib whereas for the nf270 membrane the increase above sib was higher by about 0 46 sim 0 21 the difference is attributed to the higher cp factor of nf270 because of its much higher phosphate and calcium rejection nonetheless the uneven cp throughout the filtration cell lyster and cohen 2007 was probably the reason that fast scaling occurred for all three membranes fig 3 insert the sim at any specific location along the membrane surface decreased with the filtration time due to the reduction in the permeate flux assuming the boundary layer thickness weakly changed with the filtration time which can explain the changes in the flux decline rate of the charged membranes for example the estimated sim values for the membranes at j v 0 8j v0 the onset of the flux decline of the charged membranes were only 0 02 and 0 01 for the spps and pei coated membranes respectively on the other hand sim of acp for the nf270 membrane was higher and more significantly above sib thus the scaling and relative flux decline for the nf270 polyamide membrane steadily continued during the entire recycling mode experiment fig 3 3 3 scaling experiments in no permeate recycling mode the recovery ratio that can obtained with each membrane up until the point when the onset of flux decline was recorded fig 6 points a c was also examined by conducting scaling experiments under no permeate recycling mode sib 0 92 in which the permeate was collected thereby the salt concentration in the feed and si increased here the initial sim acp values of the spps and pei coated membranes were sim acp 0 49 and 0 50 respectively compared to sim acp 0 34 for the nf270 membrane as seen in fig 6 the normalized permeate flux of the nf270 membrane sharply decreased after collecting 2 0 l of the permeate after 13 3 h which was equivalent to approximately 40 recovery sim acp 0 23 at 40 water recovery as mentioned before although the average sim was negative precipitation occurred due to a much higher local cp along the flow channel and especially at the exit this was due to the high rejection of phosphate and calcium by the nf270 membrane thus the flux decline rate accelerated after 40 recovery and sim increased reaching sim 0 1 at 65 water recovery at 27 2 h on the other hand the spps and pei coated membranes experienced a small and gradual flux decline up until 3 5 l of the permeate was collected i e at 70 water recovery after 27 5 h at this stage the saturation index of both membranes was sim acp 0 27 the sem images fig 7 clearly demonstrate the formation of acp scale on the nf270 membrane surface confirmed by eds analysis in fig 8 at the onset of the flux decline points a c in fig 6 which increased with the recovery ratio fig 6 point d note that the flux also declined with increasing recovery for the charged membranes though to a much lesser degree and the final permeate flux was 88 of the initial flux this could not be explained by the increased osmotic pressure of the feed which would yield only about a 3 5 decline based on the calculated changes in ion concentrations see tables s2 4 it is then presumed that the decrease was due to minor scaling as well as osmotic deswelling i e reduced swelling of the membrane active layer due to decreasing water activity in the solution dražević et al 2014 freger et al 2000 nilsson et al 2008 3 4 scaling under non filtration experiments 3 4 1 scaling under no permeate flux mode it was suggested that the membrane surface properties may have an important impact on scale formation rathinam et al 2018 steiner et al 2010 tong et al 2017 therefore the scaling experiments were also conducted without filtration this was first elucidated by experiments in the no permeate flux mode in which the unsaturated feed solution sib acp 0 25 was circulated over the membrane for 52 h and then 120 h without applying pressure i e without filtration the sem images taken after 52 h showed that no scaling could be detected for any of the three membranes and no calcium or phosphate was measured by the eds analysis figs s6 and s7 in addition the permeate flux before and after these experiments did not change for any of the three membranes table 6 as seen in the sem images and sem eds analysis figs s8 and s9 scaling started to occur between 52 and 120 h compared to about an hour or a few hours during the filtration experiments or the non recycling conditions the membrane permeance after 120 h also showed little relation with the pristine membrane permeate flux table 6 furthermore the ca p ratio as well as the presence of mg na and k ions results not shown and the crystal morphology fig s8 were different compared to the results that were obtained under the two filtration mode experiments suggesting a different scaling mechanism under the no permeate flux conditions two new peaks that were found in the xrd spectra of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes support this assumption unfortunately the peaks could not not assinged to a specific crystalline phase since the xrd spectrum was noisy and probably incomplete the higher flux decline of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes as well as the higher content of scalant ions and the formation of the new crystals based on the icp table 6 and sem and sem eds measurements figs s6 9 found on these membranes compared with the spps coated membrane indicated that the latter surprisingly experienced less scaling this was in contrast to similarly low scaling for the two charged membranes during the filtration experiments the reason for this differnce is unclear and will have to be clarified in a future study 3 4 2 static experiments the effects of the surface properties on the formation and adsorption of the acp were further studied under static conditions by immersing the membranes vertically to eliminate particle sedimentation on the membrane surface in the scaling solution sib acp 0 25 for different periods of time as was found in the no permeate flux mode scaling occurred after at least 2 days fig s10 and fig s11 in addition based on the sem sem eds and xrd measurements figs s10 s16 the scaling of the nf270 and the pei coated membranes was similar and higher than that of the spps coated membrane similar to the findings under the no permeate flux mode these results reveal that the ion rejection by the membranes or the ion concentration at the membrane surface is the dominant cause for scaling on the membrane surface during filtration and that the surface properties have less impact on scaling as was also previously suggested by shaffer et al 2016 it is also noted that although the membrane surface properties have a marginal effect on scaling they do have an influence on other important parameters such as the rejection of total organics and micropollutants and on organic and bio fouling dahdal et al 2014 quay et al 2018 thompson et al 2012 wang et al 2016 since the latter can also affect scaling these parameters should be investigated in order to understand what should be the optimal characteristics of nf membranes for effluent desalination 4 conclusions the effect of the ion exclusion mechanism of nf membranes on the acp scaling during wastewater desalination was investigated using a synthetic secondary effluent for three different nf membranes two charged membranes one with a positive and the other with a negative fixed charge and a commercial polyamide membrane nf270 the exclusion mechanism of the two charged membranes was dominated by the donnan exclusion whereas the exclusion mechanism of the polyamide nf membrane was dominated by the dielectric effect with some contributions from steric and donnan exclusions therefore the scalant ion rejection p and ca in a mixed effluent as well as the cp levels for these ions were similar for the charged membranes but much lower than for the polyamide membrane consequently the two charged membranes had a similar but much lower propensity for scaling than the nf270 membrane it was also found that the scale was composed of amorphous calcium phosphate for all three membranes although its feed saturation index was sometimes negative and much lower than for other calcium phosphate products the scaling under no filtration conditions with and without cross flow was much slower than in the filtration modes and also resulted in different scaling products this indicates a marginal effect of the membrane surface properties on the scale formation during effluent desalination these results imply that for effluent desalination where the salt rejection does not have to be high new nf membranes with much less ca and or p rejection should be developed which could mitigate scaling and allow much higher recoveries clearly more research is still needed to elucidate the effect of the membrane charge on other important phenomena in effluent desalination such as fouling biofouling and overall performance conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies

18704,the ecological responses of riverine ecosystems are strongly influenced by anthropogenic perturbations however high resolution quantitative shifts in the ecosystem responses to multiple human pressures in riverine ecosystems are not well understood given that in most of the anthropogenically impacted rivers eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously we explored fdaase activity microbial quotient and a sum of six heavy metals in an empirical relationship to develop an ecological response index eri the fdaase a measure of fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity and microbial quotient the proportion of microbial biomass c to the total organic carbon cmic toc were used to address ecosystem responses to c eutrophy and metal pollution we analyzed 1404 water samples and 2808 sediment samples collected from the land water interface lwi and riverbed sediment 50 m reach of 24 sites along a 528 km main stem and from 30 sites downstream two point sources of the ganga river the index was compare to carlson s trophic state index tsi to quantify eutrophy and håkanson s risk index ri and modified ecological risk index mri for metal pollution the eri showed strong correlation with tsi r2 0 70 0 97 p 0 001 ri r2 0 76 0 94 p 0 001 and mri r2 0 76 0 96 p 0 001 the eri developed here is the first response index against multiple human pressures able to quantitatively predict c eutrophication and metal pollution simultaneously in large rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords c eutrophication ecological response index fdaase activity ganga river heavy metals microbial quotient 1 introduction a research area of increasing significance in aquatic pollution control is to establish quantitatively how a lotic system is ecologically responding to anthropogenic perturbations various research results are examined in terms of standardization or quantification although no uniform stick of quantifying the quality can be universally applied satyamurthy 2017 variables that researchers usually measure in environmental studies may not necessarily account for a large percentage of the variation in the changes in ecosystem response against human perturbations additionally the tolerance of accuracy while predicting ecosystem responses depends also on the parameter in question its stability with environmental components how intricately the variable is linked to the ecosystem functioning and to what extent they can be made universal peterson and stevenson 1992 friberg 2014 rivers are highly dynamic due to recurrent low or high flows arthington et al 2006 mcgarvey 2014 and variability in flow may temporarily alter the water quality attributes leading to an unexpected change in site conditions at a given point of time that are otherwise environmentally different alexander et al 2000 harris and heathwaite 2012 sediment based biomonitoring tools can help more accurately understanding the response relationships and magnitude of ecological degradation turley et al 2016 pandey and yadav 2017 a shift in microbial functioning in the riverbed sediment which is highly sensitive even to small changes walling et al 2003 can be used as an important predictor of river ecosystem response feris et al 2009 gibbons et al 2014 however a higher magnitude of turbulence continues to de stabilize the riverbed sediment as well in recent studies we observed that the land water interface lwi provides an easily accessible and stable testbed for more accurately predicting river ecosystem responses to anthropogenic perturbations jaiswal and pandey 2019 although response variables such as chlorophyll a biomass and productivity have been extensively studied pandey et al 2014 gholizadeh et al 2016 we are not aware of any such studies that have explicitly examined land water interface lwi together with riverbed sediment to link heavy metal enzyme matrices as a predictor of riverine responses to human perturbations further the toxicological targets such as fish zooplankton benthic algae etc show high variances in metal accumulation due to mobility feeding behavior trophic status and hydrodynamic determinants and therefore the measurement of response toxic manifestation for instance resulting from an in situ exposure is relatively difficult microbial extracellular enzymes ee in the riverbed sediment are more closely associated with stressors for instance heavy metals and are expected to show quantifiable responses even at small ecological changes paerl et al 2003 carbon enhances microbial activities whereas heavy metals negatively alter the microbial community structure and functioning accordingly total microbial activities can be an important measure of carbon and metal enrichment in aquatic habitats thus the integration of metal concentrations along the carbon based biological responses will provide an overall picture of ecosystem status o connor and paul 2000 the ee activity is a predictor of cellular metabolism regulated by carbon and nutrient availability and represents an intersect at which the control of microbial community metabolism shifts from the nutrient to energy flow sinsabaugh et al 2009 furthermore unlike benthic algae and organisms of higher trophic levels where the dynamic control and bio magnification factors often become the principal determinant of overall risk ee as a response variable can be used as a primary level instantaneous response determinant pandey and yadav 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2018 in a recent field trial jaiswal and pandey 2018 we found that the activity of fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdaase an extracellular microbial enzyme can be used to assess the level of substrate stimulation and heavy metal toxicity in riverbed sediment the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis involves all the three classes of enzymes lipase protease and esterase and is considered as a proximate of total microbial activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 costa et al 2007 the co2 emission a commonly considered functional determinant of ecosystem change is also regulated by fdaase jaiswal and pandey 2019 the indices developed so far to assess the risk associated with heavy metals such as enrichment factor buat menard and chesselet 1979 potential ecological risk index håkanson 1980 pollution load index tomilson et al 1980 pollution index nemerow 1991 modified pollution index brady et al 2015 and geoaccumulation index müller 1969 consider the toxicant only furthermore most of the indices consider the concentration of an individual metal at a time however the toxic effects in the natural ecosystems are regulated by the effect of toxicants in combination håkanson 1980 further substances such as organic c may cancel out or balance the effect of toxic substances håkanson 1980 and it becomes difficult to adequately establish a linear dose response relationship under in situ condition where the regulatory determinants work in opposite direction because in many human impacted systems eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously it is important to consider the carbon concentration microbial ee activities and the total concentration of heavy metals while synthesizing an empirical relationship for appropriately addressing the eutrophy metal pollution responses because the carbon stimulates fdaase while the heavy metals induce the adverse effects such empirical relationship at equilibria will provide a functional measure of the threshold at which the community metabolism shifts from stimulatory to inhibitory control our target was to establish fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis as a novel holistic bioassay tool for assessing river ecosystem response and to develop an index which can provide an ecologically valid and simple quantitative value on ecosystem response to c eutrophication and metal pollution we believe that establishing an empirical relationship considering carbon heavy metals and this extracellular enzyme using a stable test bed would be a novel idea for future research the resultant ecological tool can more appropriately address the concordant changes in ecological responses with stronger mechanistic linkages between the causal determinants and consequent responses 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the ganga river basin about 1 086 000 km2 watershed area is one of the largest trans boundary river basins in the world in india the basin covers 26 2 of the geographical area it is the most fertile river basin and has the highest population density in the country the ganga river originates from gangotri glacier in the himalayan region flows through 2525 km course and finally merges in the indian ocean at the bay of bengal average rainfall in the basin varies from 760 mm in western areas to 2290 mm in eastern regions about 63 of the ganga brahmaputra meghna river basin lies in india 8 in nepal 7 in bangladesh and 2 5 in bhutan in its long course a large number of tributaries joins the ganga river on both banks yamuna and son are the important tributaries of the right bank whereas the ghaghara gandak and kosi are the major contributors at left bank discharge of untreated and partially treated urban sewage open drains and industrial wastewater are the major factors of tributary driven pollution to the main channel along the mainstream there are 36 class i cities and 14 class ii cities which generate over 2723 mld of sewage out of which only 44 is discharged after treatment in addition there are 138 drains that discharge 6087 mld of wastewater to the river there are 764 industries mainly tanneries sugar paper and pulp and textile industries situated along the bank of the river generating 501 mld of wastewater the climate in the basin is sub tropical to tropical monsoonal the year constitutes three distinct seasons hot and dry summer april to june a moist rainy july to september and a cold winter season november to february march and october are transitional months about 58 soil of the basin is mountainous sub montaneous and alluvium with high fertility and erodibility 2 2 experimental design the present study was conducted during summer low flow of three consecutive years 2016 2018 along a 528 km long stretch considering riverbed sediment and land water interface lwi of the ganga river in the context of this study the lwi is defined as the unique and complex border of the environment between the free flowing river water and the edge of the land mass we performed two sets of studies in the first set we selected 24 sites along a 528 km stretch of the river between kanpur upstream 26 51 n 80 32 e and varanasi downstream 25 33 n 83 06 e in the second set we performed trajectory analysis selecting two point sources the wazidpur drain at kanpur and the assi drain at varanasi fig 1 the assi drain adds 66 4 mld urban sewage while the wazidpur drain releases 54 0 mld industrial effluent to the river for trajectory analyses we selected 15 equidistant locations situated 100 m apart starting from the drain mouth to 1 4 km grid downstream the point sources fig 1 each site in the main stem as well as downstream point sources were divided into three sub sites and the samples were collected in triplicate sub surface 25 cm depth river water samples were collected in triplicate from 50 m reach from each sub site along the main stem and downstream point source locations in acid rinsed polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles samples were stored at 4 c in an ice box in one part of the water sample 100 ml collected from each sub site we added 1 ml of concentrated hno3 to avoid utilization of heavy metals by microbial communities the riverbed sediment samples 50 m reach 0 5 cm depth were collected in acid rinsed polyethylene bags using stainless steel corers all the samples were stored at 4 c in an ice box for lwi we selected a 2 m belt transect for the collection of samples from three locations one at zero reach the point where water touches the land and the other two were located 1 m inward and 1 m outward from the zero reach the samples were collected in acid rinsed polyethylene bags using stainless steel corers top 5 cm depth was considered for the collection of lwi sediment samples all the samples were brought to the laboratory and all the analyses were done within a week of sampling the sediment samples were air dried for 3 4 days at room temperature grinded and sieved using a 2 mm mesh these samples were used for analysis of toc nutrients and heavy metal concentrations to avoid the effect of moisture condition of the sediment at room temperature on microbial enzyme activities part of the fresh sediment samples were incubated in desiccator to maintain the moisture level at 80 the reagents used were of analytical grade before use the glassware were rinsed with nitric acid followed by ultrapure millipore water 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 chemical analysis the total organic carbon toc in sediment was quantified using a toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer total n was determined by following gerhardt kjeldhal method misra 1968 the no3 in water sample was measured following brucine sulphanilic acid method voghel 1971 and po4 3 using ammonium molybdate stannous chloride method murphy and riley 1962 for estimation of total heavy metals sediment samples were digested in 5 1 1 tri acid mixture hno3 hcl hclo4 and water samples were digested in concentrated nitric acid in a microwave digestion extraction system sineo model mds 6g and analyzed for the six most common heavy metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkinelmer model analyst 800 usa fitted with a lamp of particular metal using appropriate drift blank bioavailable fractions of heavy metals were measured using edta single step extraction procedure ure 1996 sediment samples were shaken for 1 h with 0 05 mol l edta ph 7 0 centrifuged and supernatants used for estimation the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas was calibrated using standard solution of respective metals and drift blanks the detection limits of aas were 0 0008 0 003 0 001 0 006 0 015 and 0 001 μg ml for cd cr cu ni pb and zn respectively the standard stock solutions sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india of 1000 ppm were diluted to desired concentrations in the instrument an oxidizing flame of air ethylene was used in each case the analytical grade nitrate salt of pb cd cr and ni and granules of cu and zn with 99 purity level were used for preparing the solutions used in the spiking of samples our preliminary trial with weak acid nitric acid recoverable metals did not show sufficient recovery even below 50 for cr and so to ensure maximum recovery we repeatedly tested using different ratios of tri acids hno3 hcl hclo4 our repeated trials showed maximum recovery 99 at hno3 hcl hclo4 ratio of 5 1 1 the quality control measures were taken for the assessment of contamination and data reliability the blank and drift standards obtained from sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india were run after five determinations for repetitive calibration of the instrument the coefficient of variances cv were determined to assure precision of analysis the analytical variances of the data obtained were below 10 for each metal the trophic state index tsi was calculated using n and p data following carlson 1977 the risk index ri was calculated using total as well as bioavailable heavy metal data following håkanson 1980 and modified ecological risk index mri was calculated following duodu et al 2016 2017 2 3 2 microbial variables microbial biomass carbon cmic was estimated by chloroform fumigation extraction method jenkinson and powlson 1976 the sediment samples with 80 moisture content were subjected to chloroform fumigation and the organic carbon was determined using a toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer the basal respiration br was measured following wardle 1993 the substrate induced respiration sir was determined similarly as br in the samples amended with 6 mg of glucose per gram of sediment at the beginning of incubation anderson and domsch 1978 the ratio of br sir the microbial metabolic quotient qco2 wardle et al 1993 was used as a relative measure of microbial inefficiency fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity fdaase activity a measure of total microbial activity was determined spectrophotometrically following adam and duncan 2001 for this purpose a 2 g of sediment sample was incubated while shaking for 20 min in 15 ml of 60 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 and 0 2 ml of 1000 μg fda ml 1 solution the reaction was stopped by adding 15 ml of chloroform methanol 2 1 v v the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 3 min and the supernatant filtered through whatman no 1 filter paper absorbance recorded at 490 nm and activity was calculated from the standard graph the 1 mm fluorescein stock solution was prepared using disodium fluorescein salt sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india a standard graph was prepared by serial dilution 10 200 μm of the stock solution 2 4 ecological response index eri the indices developed earlier to analyze the effect of heavy metals on river ecosystem consider the absolute or relative concentrations of metals response based indices are generally lacking despite the fact that these can be more useful in predicting the ecosystem level effects of stressors we developed a new empirical relationship the ecological response index eri using fdaase microbial quotient and total heavy metals to address changes in ecosystem response towards c eutrophication and metal pollution in rivers we constructed the relationship as below 1 e r i fdaase qm i 1 n m i where fdaase fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity qm microbial quotient the proportion of microbial biomass carbon to total organic carbon mi concentration of ith metal of the two primary determinants fdaase activity is a commonly used measure of total microbial activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 here we consider changes in fdaase activity as a proximate response to variation in carbon and heavy metals further because in situ responses generally show cumulative effect we consider the total concentration of the six most common heavy metals ʃthm of human impacted riverine systems as a second determinant while establishing the response relationship because the organic carbon chelates the metals thereby reducing the adverse effect on microbial enzyme activity we consider microbial quotient as a third determinant to address the response relationship 2 microbial quotient cmic toc mathematical interpretation of equations 1 and 2 gives rise to 3 e r i fdaase c mic toc σ thm where toc total organic carbon cmic

19 53 eri fig 10 4 discussion for an accurate diagnosis of river ecosystem health it is important to understand how the system in question is responding to multiple anthropogenic perturbations organic matter supply stimulates microbial biomass activity while the toxic agents such as heavy metals cause adverse effect pérez piqueres et al 2006 jaiswal and pandey 2018 here we found that the organic carbon in the sediment reduced the toxic effect but this effect declined as the total heavy metal concentration in the sediment exceed 284 73 μg g 1 such response shifts need to be quantitatively identified to accurately predict the ecological changes against multiple human perturbations in the riverine ecosystems factors such as hydrology reduce the frequency of contact between stressors heavy metals for instance and the biological units such as algae zooplankton fish etc besides this the feeding behavior movement metabolism and trophic status of the organism also hamper their suitability to be used as a response indicator of metal toxicity the microbial functional attributes are highly sensitive even to small changes in the environment and thus can provide an integrated measure of ecosystem response not obtainable from physical or chemical measures or by analysis of higher organism s diversity the microbial enzyme activities can be the best predictor of metal associated toxicity and c enrichment in the riverbed sediment pandey and yadav 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2018 2019 and the concentration dependence can be expected to be more direct than the other biological variables here we use the fdaase activity as a marker of change in microbial responses to c eutrophy and heavy metal stress this response condition represents an intersect of substrate stimulation and metal driven inhibition because enzyme activity is a product of cellular metabolism regulated by substrate availability and inhibitors 4 1 fdaase a predictor of river ecosystem response the c eutrophication significantly affects many of the physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic ecosystems and causes a predominant and rapid change in microbial community structure and functioning pandey et al 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2019 we found a general increase in the concentrations of carbon nutrients and heavy metals over time in the main stem and downstream point sources indicating a consistent increase in anthropogenic pressures brookes 1995 has developed the microbial metabolic quotient qco2 basal respiration per unit of substrate induced respiration as an indicator of stress condition we found relatively higher values of qco2 in the riverbed sediment and at the land water interface lwi at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 in the main stem and at sites downstream wpdr indicating stressed condition to microbial community due to high concentrations of heavy metals the main river stem considered in this study is known as the most polluted stretch of the ganga river dwivedi et al 2018 the sites 4 5 and 6 are located in jajmau area of the kanpur city where massive amount of leather industry effluents are discharged directly into the river additionally about 400 tonnes of solid wastes are discharged into the river from 450 tanneries and 150 other industrial units situated in this area also the kanpur city flushes over 171 mld treated sewage over 168 mld untreated sewage and over 202 mld industrial effluents to the river the sites 22 23 and 24 are situated around rajghat downstream to varanasi city where in addition to other agrochemical industrial and urban releases the varuna tributary adds large amount of pollutants to the main channel at varanasi city the ganga river receives 141 mld treated and 46 mld untreated sewage thus at these sites the concentrations of carbon nutrients and heavy metals indicate strong anthropogenic effects the microbial enzyme activities have been used to quantify changes in organic matter substrate and toxicants inhibitors across different ecosystems sinsabaugh et al 2009 wallenius et al 2011 the fluorescein diacetate fda hydrolytic activity is one of the most accepted accurate and simple methods for the measurement of total microbial activity green et al 2006 the complete hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate 3 6 diacetylfluoresceine a perfluorophore requires all the three major groups of extracellular and membrane bound enzymes lipases esterases and proteases and directly correlates the biomass and atp content schnürer and rosswall 1982 fontvieille et al 1992 jiang et al 2016 lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol esterases split esters in to acids and alcohols and proteases hydrolyze the peptide bonds benkovic and hammes schiffer 2003 the heavy metals have affinity to bind with sulfhydryl group present in the catalytic site and thereby reducing the enzyme activity suzuki 2015 the fda hydrolyzing ability collectively named as fdaase is widespread among the decomposers and has been used as a measure of total microbial activity in soil schnürer and rosswall 1982 activated sludge fontvieille et al 1992 frølund et al 1995 marine sediment meyer reil 1991 poremba 1995 organic matrices ntougias et al 2006 and in riverine sediment marmonier et al 1995 jaiswal and pandey 2018 2019 here we found strong synchrony in fdaase activity measured in two different sub habitats riverbed sediment and at lwi in the main stem river and downstream both the point sources perucci et al 2000 have proposed qfda as a measure of fdaase activity per unit of microbial biomass c for assessing the effect of xenobiotic stressors when we calculated qfda using our data we found relatively lower values at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 in the main stem and at sites located downstream wpdr all characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals we used microbial quotient the ratio of cmic to toc anderson and domsch 1989 together with the fdaase as a measure of microbial response to carbon and metal enrichment the microbial quotient is used as a response variable to express the microbial efficiency along the environmental gradient the use of microbial quotient help to identify the proportion of toc channelized in the form of microbial c at sites characterized by very high concentrations of heavy metals the toc may be high but cmic may not be due to the toxic effects of metals we found a strong synchrony between the fdaase activity and microbial quotient in the riverbed sediment and at lwi contrary to this the fdaase and cmic showed significant negative correlations with ʃthm r2 0 47 0 96 p 0 001 and ʃtbf r2 0 64 0 97 p 0 001 in the main stem and at wpdr indicating adverse effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass activity these correlations were significantly positive at asdr where the metal concentrations were low further we found strong synchrony between toc and fdaase along the study gradient except at sites with a high concentration of heavy metals indicating that the modulatory effect of c occurs only up to a certain level of metal stress the strong correlation of fdaase with toc at asdr characterized by relatively low concentration of metals indicates its relevance as a predictor of c eutrophy because in most of the human impacted rivers eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously it is important to consider carbon metal pollution and microbial biomass activity while synthesizing an empirical relationship for quantifying ecosystem responses to multiple human perturbations supply of organic carbon enhances the microbial biomass activity we found this relationship strongly valid for sites downstream asdr and in the main stem river except at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 where ʃthm 360 μg g 1 the fdaase was significantly positively correlated with toc in the riverbed sediment r2 0 76 p 0 001 and at lwi r2 0 84 p 0 001 downstream asdr contrary to this the fdaase showed significant negative correlations with toc r2 0 80 0 83 p 0 001 ʃthm r2 0 92 0 96 p 0 001 and ʃtbf r2 0 97 0 99 p 0 001 at wpdr this indicate that at high concentration of heavy metals ʃthm and ʃtbf the fdaase activity is reduced even if the concentration of toc is high this strong and dual effects of carbon and metal toxicants suggest that the fdaase activity could be used as a response predictor of subtle changes in c eutrophy and metal pollution the stronger correlations of fdaase with cmic r2 0 74 0 99 p 0 001 compared to those with toc r2 0 53 0 84 p 0 001 further advocates the significance of using microbial quotient as one of the response predictors in developing the proposed index 4 2 index formulation interpretation and comparison with other indices the indices developed so far for riverine ecosystems are often constrained by factors such as hydrologic regime sediment load and sensitivity of the chosen determinants furthermore in human impacted rivers a combination of factors causes ecosystem degradation accordingly quantifying the ecosystem responses using a specific attribute may not be sufficient to define the multiple causations these limitations are continuing to demand a more stable widely applicable and cost effective index to quantitatively assess the impact of multiple human stressors on ecological shifts in riverine ecosystems schinegger et al 2012 here we analyzed the data collected from 24 sites along 528 km main stem and 30 sites downstream two point sources for three consecutive years to develop an ecological response index eri to quantify ecosystem changes against human perturbations in the ganga river our empirical relationship considers total concentration of six heavy metals as stressor microbial quotient as a measure of efficacy to utilize carbon substrate and fdaase activity as a holistic bioassay for quantifying c eutrophy and metal pollution along the total metal concentration we used bioavailable fractions also to further verify the ecosystem responses to increase the validity of comparison and to minimize variances we repeated all the measurements at the land water interface lwi at corresponding sites of the main stem and downstream point sources our previous studies show that the lwi of large rivers provides a stable testbed with the riverine imprint of ecosystem processes jaiswal and pandey 2019 the eri obtained at lwi showed strong synchrony with those based on the data from the riverbed sediment 4 2 1 as a predictor of eutrophy the developed index model equation was tested as a quantitative predictor of the state of eutrophication we found strong correlations r2 0 70 0 97 p 0 001 of eri with carlson s trophic state index tsi carlson 1977 the ganga river experiences excessive input of n and p pandey et al 2017 to minimize the effect of the hydrodynamic influences and those of turbidity we used n and p based tsi during low flow the strong relationships clearly indicate that similar to tsi p and tsi n the developed index eri is highly appropriate for quantitatively predicting the trophic state of the lotic ecosystems for a numeric classification we used dynamic fit model intersects between toc and eri at asdr where ʃthm did not exceed the toxic threshold the intersect for the riverbed sediment was at 2 49 toc and 77 85 eri whereas for lwi it was at 3 05 toc and 88 54 eri a comparison of the intersect model of asdr and wpdr did show that the eri values between 39 and 77 demarcate hypereutrophic condition the eri within this range prevailed up to 800 m downstream asdr this drain flushes over 66 mld of domestic sewage rich in organic c and nutrients based on the carlson s tsi p and tsi n also these sites are characterized under hypereutrophic condition the eri ranging from 78 to 155 represents eutrophic and 156 to 320 the oligotrophic conditions these were well verified using carlson s tsi p and tsi n 4 2 2 as a predictor of metal pollution this aspect was tested using håkanson s risk index ri håkanson 1980 and modified ecological risk index mri duodu et al 2016 2017 based on total metal concentration as well as their bioavailable fraction we found strong correlations r2 0 76 0 94 p 0 001 between eri and ri and between eri and mri r2 0 76 0 96 p 0 001 at wazidpur drain where the metal concentrations were substantially high the intersects of the dynamic fit model were at 488 μg g 1 ʃthm and 36 53 eri and at 2 38 toc and 24 07 eri in the riverbed sediment and at 3 18 toc and 23 2 eri and at 674 95 μg g 1 ʃthm and 22 13 eri at lwi fig 10 the lowest value of eri was recorded for the most polluted site in the intersect the eri values below 24 shows extreme toxic condition values less than 24 prevailed at sites up to 700 m downstream the wazidpur drain which adds 54 mld of industrial effluents rich in heavy metals and other toxicants when assessed with respect to håkanson s risk index these locations were found under significantly high ecological risk category an index value of 77 intersect of toc and eri at asdr defining the upper range of extreme eutrophy for wpdr was at toc 3 80 while the intersect of toc and eri was at 2 38 this indicates that a large fraction of toc in this range 2 38 3 80 could possibly be utilized in complexing with heavy metals 4 2 3 as a predictor of eutrophy metal pollution because in most of the anthropogenically impacted rivers c enrichment often accompanied by heavy metal enrichment we tested if the index developed here can be used in predicting eutrophy metal pollution together because carbon stimulates fdaase activity while heavy metals exert an adverse effect the developed index was tested by comparing the response when both were relatively high we found a significant curvilinear relationship between fdaase and toc r2 0 66 0 70 p 0 001 indicating that the stimulatory effect of c was counter balanced when heavy metal concentration exceed certain levels ʃthm 284 73 μg g 1 on comparing the dynamic fit curve intersects of asdr with wpdr we found that eri values between 25 and 38 could be used as a predictor of eutrophy metal pollution overall the eri values ranging from 0 to 24 represents extreme metal pollution toxic condition 25 38 represents a combination of eutrophy and metal pollution 39 77 represents hypereutrophic and low metal pollution 78 155 represents eutrophic and 156 320 represents the oligotrophic state of the river ecosystem 5 conclusions our results emphasize the importance of fdaase as a response determinant of ecosystem functional shifts in large rivers the study shows when taken together in an empirical relationship the fdaase toc cmic and total metal concentration provide a quantitative diagnostic for appropriately addressing the eutrophy metal pollution responses in human impacted rivers the ecological response index eri developed here is invariably able to predict the concordant changes in riverine ecosystem responses with stronger mechanistic links between the causal determinants and consequent responses the eri presents a validated scale to quantitatively predict the c eutrophication and metal pollution simultaneously the index predicts on the scale of 0 320 as 0 24 extreme metal pollution eco toxic condition 25 38 eutrophic and metal pollution 39 77 hypereutrophic and low metal pollution 78 155 eutrophic and 156 320 oligotrophic state the

18704,the ecological responses of riverine ecosystems are strongly influenced by anthropogenic perturbations however high resolution quantitative shifts in the ecosystem responses to multiple human pressures in riverine ecosystems are not well understood given that in most of the anthropogenically impacted rivers eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously we explored fdaase activity microbial quotient and a sum of six heavy metals in an empirical relationship to develop an ecological response index eri the fdaase a measure of fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity and microbial quotient the proportion of microbial biomass c to the total organic carbon cmic toc were used to address ecosystem responses to c eutrophy and metal pollution we analyzed 1404 water samples and 2808 sediment samples collected from the land water interface lwi and riverbed sediment 50 m reach of 24 sites along a 528 km main stem and from 30 sites downstream two point sources of the ganga river the index was compare to carlson s trophic state index tsi to quantify eutrophy and håkanson s risk index ri and modified ecological risk index mri for metal pollution the eri showed strong

quantitatively predict c eutrophication and metal pollution simultaneously in large rivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords c eutrophication ecological response index fdaase activity ganga river heavy metals microbial quotient 1 introduction a research area of increasing significance in aquatic pollution control is to establish quantitatively how a lotic system is ecologically responding to anthropogenic perturbations various research results are examined in terms of standardization or quantification although no uniform stick of quantifying the quality can be universally applied satyamurthy 2017 variables that researchers usually measure in environmental studies may not necessarily account for a large percentage of the variation in the changes in ecosystem response against human perturbations additionally the tolerance of accuracy while predicting ecosystem responses depends also on the parameter in question its stability with environmental components how intricately the variable is linked to the ecosystem functioning and to what extent they can be made universal peterson and stevenson 1992 friberg 2014 rivers are highly dynamic due to recurrent low or high flows arthington et al 2006 mcgarvey 2014 and variability in flow may temporarily alter the water quality attributes leading to an unexpected change in site conditions at a given point of time that are otherwise environmentally different alexander et al 2000 harris and heathwaite 2012 sediment based biomonitoring tools can help more accurately understanding the response relationships and magnitude of ecological degradation turley et al 2016 pandey and yadav 2017 a shift in microbial functioning in the riverbed sediment which is highly sensitive even to small changes walling et al 2003 can be used as an important predictor of river ecosystem response feris et al 2009 gibbons et al 2014 however a higher magnitude of turbulence continues to de stabilize the riverbed sediment as well in recent studies we observed that the land water interface lwi provides an easily accessible and stable testbed for more accurately predicting river ecosystem responses to anthropogenic perturbations jaiswal and pandey 2019 although response variables such as chlorophyll a biomass and productivity have been extensively studied pandey et al 2014 gholizadeh et al 2016 we are not aware of any such studies that have explicitly examined land water interface lwi together with riverbed sediment to link heavy metal enzyme matrices as a predictor of riverine responses to human perturbations further the toxicological targets such as fish zooplankton benthic algae etc show high variances in metal accumulation due to mobility feeding behavior trophic status and hydrodynamic determinants and therefore the measurement of response toxic manifestation for instance resulting from an in situ exposure is relatively difficult microbial extracellular enzymes ee in the riverbed sediment are more closely associated with stressors for instance heavy metals and are expected to show quantifiable responses even at small ecological changes paerl et al 2003 carbon enhances microbial activities whereas heavy metals negatively alter the microbial community structure and functioning accordingly total microbial activities can be an important measure of carbon and metal enrichment in aquatic habitats thus the integration of metal concentrations along the carbon based biological responses will provide an overall picture of ecosystem status o connor and paul 2000 the ee activity is a predictor of cellular metabolism regulated by carbon and nutrient availability and represents an intersect at which the control of microbial community metabolism shifts from the nutrient to energy flow sinsabaugh et al 2009 furthermore unlike benthic algae and organisms of higher trophic levels where the dynamic control and bio magnification factors often become the principal determinant of overall risk ee as a response variable can be used as a primary level instantaneous response determinant pandey and yadav 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2018 in a recent field trial jaiswal and pandey 2018 we found that the activity of fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdaase an extracellular microbial enzyme can be used to assess the level of substrate stimulation and heavy metal toxicity in riverbed sediment the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis involves all the three classes of enzymes lipase protease and esterase and is considered as a proximate of total microbial activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 costa et al 2007 the co2 emission a commonly considered functional determinant of ecosystem change is also regulated by fdaase jaiswal and pandey 2019 the indices developed so far to assess the risk associated with heavy metals such as enrichment factor buat menard and chesselet 1979 potential ecological risk index håkanson 1980 pollution load index tomilson et al 1980 pollution index nemerow 1991 modified pollution index brady et al 2015 and geoaccumulation index müller 1969 consider the toxicant only furthermore most of the indices consider the concentration of an individual metal at a time however the toxic effects in the natural ecosystems are regulated by the effect of toxicants in combination håkanson 1980 further substances such as organic c may cancel out or balance the effect of toxic substances håkanson 1980 and it becomes difficult to adequately establish a linear dose response relationship under in situ condition where the regulatory determinants work in opposite direction because in many human impacted systems eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously it is important to consider the carbon concentration microbial ee activities and the total concentration of heavy metals while synthesizing an empirical relationship for appropriately addressing the eutrophy metal pollution responses because the carbon stimulates fdaase while the heavy metals induce the adverse effects such empirical relationship at equilibria will provide a functional measure of the threshold at which the community metabolism shifts from stimulatory to inhibitory control our target was to establish fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis as a novel holistic bioassay tool for assessing river ecosystem response and to develop an index which can provide an ecologically valid and simple quantitative value on ecosystem response to c eutrophication and metal pollution we believe that establishing an empirical relationship considering carbon heavy metals and this extracellular enzyme using a stable test bed would be a novel idea for future research the resultant ecological tool can more appropriately address the concordant changes in ecological responses with stronger mechanistic linkages between the causal determinants and consequent responses 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the ganga river basin about 1 086 000 km2 watershed area is one of the largest trans boundary river basins in the world in india the basin covers 26 2 of the geographical area it is the most fertile river basin and has the highest population density in the country the ganga river originates from gangotri glacier in the himalayan region flows through 2525 km course and finally merges in the indian ocean at the bay of bengal average rainfall in the basin varies from 760 mm in western areas to 2290 mm in eastern regions about 63 of the ganga brahmaputra meghna river basin lies in india 8 in nepal 7 in bangladesh and 2 5 in bhutan in its long course a large number of tributaries joins the ganga river on both banks yamuna and son are the important tributaries of the right bank whereas the ghaghara gandak and kosi are the major contributors at left bank discharge of untreated and partially treated urban sewage open drains and industrial wastewater are the major factors of tributary driven pollution to the main channel along the mainstream there are 36 class i cities and 14 class ii cities which generate over 2723 mld of sewage out of which only 44 is discharged after treatment in addition there are 138 drains that discharge 6087 mld of wastewater to the river there are 764 industries mainly tanneries sugar paper and pulp and textile industries situated along the bank of the river generating 501 mld of wastewater the climate in the basin is sub tropical to tropical monsoonal the year constitutes three distinct seasons hot and dry summer april to june a moist rainy july to september and a cold winter season november to february march and october are transitional months about 58 soil of the basin is mountainous sub montaneous and alluvium with high fertility and erodibility 2 2 experimental design the present study was conducted during summer low flow of three consecutive years 2016 2018 along a 528 km long stretch considering riverbed sediment and land water interface lwi of the ganga river in the context of this study the lwi is defined as the unique and complex border of the environment between the free flowing river water and the edge of the land mass we performed two sets of studies in the first set we selected 24 sites along a 528 km stretch of the river between kanpur upstream 26 51 n 80 32 e and varanasi downstream 25 33 n 83 06 e in the second set we performed trajectory analysis selecting two point sources the wazidpur drain at kanpur and the assi drain at varanasi fig 1 the assi drain adds 66 4 mld urban sewage while the wazidpur drain releases 54 0 mld industrial effluent to the river for trajectory analyses we selected 15 equidistant locations situated 100 m apart starting from the drain mouth to 1 4 km grid downstream the point sources fig 1 each site in the main stem as well as downstream point sources were divided into three sub sites and the samples were collected in triplicate sub surface 25 cm depth river water samples were collected in triplicate from 50 m reach from each sub site along the main stem and downstream point source locations in acid rinsed polyethylene terephthalate pet bottles samples were stored at 4 c in an ice box in one part of the water sample 100 ml collected from each sub site we added 1 ml of concentrated hno3 to avoid utilization of heavy metals by microbial communities the riverbed sediment samples 50 m reach 0 5 cm depth were collected in acid rinsed polyethylene bags using stainless steel corers all the samples were stored at 4 c in an ice box for lwi we selected a 2 m belt transect for the collection of samples from three locations one at zero reach the point where water touches the land and the other two were located 1 m inward and 1 m outward from the zero reach the samples were collected in acid rinsed polyethylene bags using stainless steel corers top 5 cm depth was considered for the collection of lwi sediment samples all the samples were brought to the laboratory and all the analyses were done within a week of sampling the sediment samples were air dried for 3 4 days at room temperature grinded and sieved using a 2 mm mesh these samples were used for analysis of toc nutrients and heavy metal concentrations to avoid the effect of moisture condition of the sediment at room temperature on microbial enzyme activities part of the fresh sediment samples were incubated in desiccator to maintain the moisture level at 80 the reagents used were of analytical grade before use the glassware were rinsed with nitric acid followed by ultrapure millipore water 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 chemical analysis the total organic carbon toc in sediment was quantified using a toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer total n was determined by following gerhardt kjeldhal method misra 1968 the no3 in water sample was measured following brucine sulphanilic acid method voghel 1971 and po4 3 using ammonium molybdate stannous chloride method murphy and riley 1962 for estimation of total heavy metals sediment samples were digested in 5 1 1 tri acid mixture hno3 hcl hclo4 and water samples were digested in concentrated nitric acid in a microwave digestion extraction system sineo model mds 6g and analyzed for the six most common heavy metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkinelmer model analyst 800 usa fitted with a lamp of particular metal using appropriate drift blank bioavailable fractions of heavy metals were measured using edta single step extraction procedure ure 1996 sediment samples were shaken for 1 h with 0 05 mol l edta ph 7 0 centrifuged and supernatants used for estimation the atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas was calibrated using standard solution of respective metals and drift blanks the detection limits of aas were 0 0008 0 003 0 001 0 006 0 015 and 0 001 μg ml for cd cr cu ni pb and zn respectively the standard stock solutions sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india of 1000 ppm were diluted to desired concentrations in the instrument an oxidizing flame of air ethylene was used in each case the analytical grade nitrate salt of pb cd cr and ni and granules of cu and zn with 99 purity level were used for preparing the solutions used in the spiking of samples our preliminary trial with weak acid nitric acid recoverable metals did not show sufficient recovery even below 50 for cr and so to ensure maximum recovery we repeatedly tested using different ratios of tri acids hno3 hcl hclo4 our repeated trials showed maximum recovery 99 at hno3 hcl hclo4 ratio of 5 1 1 the quality control measures were taken for the assessment of contamination and data reliability the blank and drift standards obtained from sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india were run after five determinations for repetitive calibration of the instrument the coefficient of variances cv were determined to assure precision of analysis the analytical variances of the data obtained were below 10 for each metal the trophic state index tsi was calculated using n and p data following carlson 1977 the risk index ri was calculated using total as well as bioavailable heavy metal data following håkanson 1980 and modified ecological risk index mri was calculated following duodu et al 2016 2017 2 3 2 microbial variables microbial biomass carbon cmic was estimated by chloroform fumigation extraction method jenkinson and powlson 1976 the sediment samples with 80 moisture content were subjected to chloroform fumigation and the organic carbon was determined using a toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer the basal respiration br was measured following wardle 1993 the substrate induced respiration sir was determined similarly as br in the samples amended with 6 mg of glucose per gram of sediment at the beginning of incubation anderson and domsch 1978 the ratio of br sir the microbial metabolic quotient qco2 wardle et al 1993 was used as a relative measure of microbial inefficiency fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity fdaase activity a measure of total microbial activity was determined spectrophotometrically following adam and duncan 2001 for this purpose a 2 g of sediment sample was incubated while shaking for 20 min in 15 ml of 60 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 6 and 0 2 ml of 1000 μg fda ml 1 solution the reaction was stopped by adding 15 ml of chloroform methanol 2 1 v v the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 3 min and the supernatant filtered through whatman no 1 filter paper absorbance recorded at 490 nm and activity was calculated from the standard graph the 1 mm fluorescein stock solution was prepared using disodium fluorescein salt sisco research laboratories pvt ltd india a standard graph was prepared by serial dilution 10 200 μm of the stock solution 2 4 ecological response index eri the indices developed earlier to analyze the effect of heavy metals on river ecosystem consider the absolute or relative concentrations of metals response based indices are generally lacking despite the fact that these can be more useful in predicting the ecosystem level effects of stressors we developed a new empirical relationship the ecological response index eri using fdaase microbial quotient and total heavy metals to address changes in ecosystem response towards c eutrophication and metal pollution in rivers we constructed the relationship as below 1 e r i fdaase qm i 1 n m i where fdaase fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity qm microbial quotient the proportion of microbial biomass carbon to total organic carbon mi concentration of ith metal of the two primary determinants fdaase activity is a commonly used measure of total microbial activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 here we consider changes in fdaase activity as a proximate response to variation in carbon and heavy metals further because in situ responses generally show cumulative effect we consider the total concentration of the six most common heavy metals ʃthm of human impacted riverine systems as a second determinant while establishing the response relationship because the organic carbon chelates the metals thereby reducing the adverse effect on microbial enzyme activity we consider microbial quotient as a third determinant to address the response relationship 2 microbial quotient cmic toc mathematical interpretation of equations 1 and 2 gives rise to 3 e r i fdaase c mic toc σ thm where toc total organic carbon cmic

ecological response index 3 3 1 main stem the values of ecological response index eri in the riverbed sediment decreased along the pollution gradient the values varied between 3 34 and 319 06 when

compare the ecological response index eri developed in this study the eri did show a strong negative correlation with ri mri and tsi r2 0 70 0 97 p 0 001 supplementary figs 7 8 and 9 further we used dynamic fit model intersects between toc and eri at asdr and among eri ʃthm and toc at wpdr to interpret our index for asdr it was at 2 49 toc and 77 85 eri for wpdr the intersect was at 488 μg g 1 ʃthm and 38 53 eri and at 2 38 toc and 24 07 eri fig 10 for lwi the intersect for asdr was at 3 05 toc and 88 54 eri for wpdr the intersect was at 3 18 toc and 23 2 eri and at 674 95 μg g 1 ʃthm and 19 53 eri fig 10 4 discussion for an accurate diagnosis of river ecosystem health it is important to understand how the system in question is responding to multiple anthropogenic perturbations organic matter supply stimulates microbial biomass activity while the toxic agents such as heavy metals cause adverse effect pérez piqueres et al 2006 jaiswal and pandey 2018 here we found that the organic carbon in the sediment reduced the toxic effect but this effect declined as the total heavy metal concentration in the sediment exceed 284 73 μg g 1 such response shifts need to be quantitatively identified to accurately predict the ecological changes against multiple human perturbations in the riverine ecosystems factors such as hydrology reduce the frequency of contact between stressors heavy metals for instance and the biological units such as algae zooplankton fish etc besides this the feeding behavior movement metabolism and trophic status of the organism also hamper their suitability to be used as a response indicator of metal toxicity the microbial functional attributes are highly sensitive even to small changes in the environment and thus can provide an integrated measure of ecosystem response not obtainable from physical or chemical measures or by analysis of higher organism s diversity the microbial enzyme activities can be the best predictor of metal associated toxicity and c enrichment in the riverbed sediment pandey and yadav 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2018 2019 and the concentration dependence can be expected to be more direct than the other biological variables here we use the fdaase activity as a marker of change in microbial responses to c eutrophy and heavy metal stress this response condition represents an intersect of substrate stimulation and metal driven inhibition because enzyme activity is a product of cellular metabolism regulated by substrate availability and inhibitors 4 1 fdaase a predictor of river ecosystem response the c eutrophication significantly affects many of the physical chemical and biological processes in aquatic ecosystems and causes a predominant and rapid change in microbial community structure and functioning pandey et al 2017 jaiswal and pandey 2019 we found a general increase in the concentrations of carbon nutrients and heavy metals over time in the main stem and downstream point sources indicating a consistent increase in anthropogenic pressures brookes 1995 has developed the microbial metabolic quotient qco2 basal respiration per unit of substrate induced respiration as an indicator of stress condition we found relatively higher values of qco2 in the riverbed sediment and at the land water interface lwi at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 in the main stem and at sites downstream wpdr indicating stressed condition to microbial community due to high concentrations of heavy metals the main river stem considered in this study is known as the most polluted stretch of the ganga river dwivedi et al 2018 the sites 4 5 and 6 are located in jajmau area of the kanpur city where massive amount of leather industry effluents are discharged directly into the river additionally about 400 tonnes of solid wastes are discharged into the river from 450 tanneries and 150 other industrial units situated in this area also the kanpur city flushes over 171 mld treated sewage over 168 mld untreated sewage and over 202 mld industrial effluents to the river the sites 22 23 and 24 are situated around rajghat downstream to varanasi city where in addition to other agrochemical industrial and urban releases the varuna tributary adds large amount of pollutants to the main channel at varanasi city the ganga river receives 141 mld treated and 46 mld untreated sewage thus at these sites the concentrations of carbon nutrients and heavy metals indicate strong anthropogenic effects the microbial enzyme activities have been used to quantify changes in organic matter substrate and toxicants inhibitors across different ecosystems sinsabaugh et al 2009 wallenius et al 2011 the fluorescein diacetate fda hydrolytic activity is one of the most accepted accurate and simple methods for the measurement of total microbial activity green et al 2006 the complete hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate 3 6 diacetylfluoresceine a perfluorophore requires all the three major groups of extracellular and membrane bound enzymes lipases esterases and proteases and directly correlates the biomass and atp content schnürer and rosswall 1982 fontvieille et al 1992 jiang et al 2016 lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol esterases split esters in to acids and alcohols and proteases hydrolyze the peptide bonds benkovic and hammes schiffer 2003 the heavy metals have affinity to bind with sulfhydryl group present in the catalytic site and thereby reducing the enzyme activity suzuki 2015 the fda hydrolyzing ability collectively named as fdaase is widespread among the decomposers and has been used as a measure of total microbial activity in soil schnürer and rosswall 1982 activated sludge fontvieille et al 1992 frølund et al 1995 marine sediment meyer reil 1991 poremba 1995 organic matrices ntougias et al 2006 and in riverine sediment marmonier et al 1995 jaiswal and pandey 2018 2019 here we found strong synchrony in fdaase activity measured in two different sub habitats riverbed sediment and at lwi in the main stem river and downstream both the point sources perucci et al 2000 have proposed qfda as a measure of fdaase activity per unit of microbial biomass c for assessing the effect of xenobiotic stressors when we calculated qfda using our data we found relatively lower values at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 in the main stem and at sites located downstream wpdr all characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals we used microbial quotient the ratio of cmic to toc anderson and domsch 1989 together with the fdaase as a measure of microbial response to carbon and metal enrichment the microbial quotient is used as a response variable to express the microbial efficiency along the environmental gradient the use of microbial quotient help to identify the proportion of toc channelized in the form of microbial c at sites characterized by very high concentrations of heavy metals the toc may be high but cmic may not be due to the toxic effects of metals we found a strong synchrony between the fdaase activity and microbial quotient in the riverbed sediment and at lwi contrary to this the fdaase and cmic showed significant negative correlations with ʃthm r2 0 47 0 96 p 0 001 and ʃtbf r2 0 64 0 97 p 0 001 in the main stem and at wpdr indicating adverse effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass activity these correlations were significantly positive at asdr where the metal concentrations were low further we found strong synchrony between toc and fdaase along the study gradient except at sites with a high concentration of heavy metals indicating that the modulatory effect of c occurs only up to a certain level of metal stress the strong correlation of fdaase with toc at asdr characterized by relatively low concentration of metals indicates its relevance as a predictor of c eutrophy because in most of the human impacted rivers eutrophy and metal pollution occur simultaneously it is important to consider carbon metal pollution and microbial biomass activity while synthesizing an empirical relationship for quantifying ecosystem responses to multiple human perturbations supply of organic carbon enhances the microbial biomass activity we found this relationship strongly valid for sites downstream asdr and in the main stem river except at sites 4 5 6 22 23 and 24 where ʃthm 360 μg g 1 the fdaase was significantly positively correlated with toc in the riverbed sediment r2 0 76 p 0 001 and at lwi r2 0 84 p 0 001 downstream asdr contrary to this the fdaase showed significant negative correlations with toc r2 0 80 0 83 p 0 001 ʃthm r2 0 92 0 96 p 0 001 and ʃtbf r2 0 97 0 99 p 0 001 at wpdr this indicate that at high concentration of heavy metals ʃthm and ʃtbf the fdaase activity is reduced even if the concentration of toc is high this strong and dual effects of carbon and metal toxicants suggest that the fdaase activity could be used as a response predictor of subtle changes in c eutrophy and metal pollution the stronger correlations of fdaase with cmic r2 0 74 0 99 p 0 001 compared to those with toc r2 0 53 0 84 p 0 001 further advocates the significance of using microbial quotient as one of the response predictors in developing the proposed index 4 2 index formulation interpretation and comparison with other indices the indices developed so far for riverine ecosystems are often constrained by factors such as hydrologic regime sediment load and sensitivity of the chosen determinants furthermore in human impacted rivers a combination of factors causes ecosystem degradation accordingly quantifying the ecosystem responses using a specific attribute may not be sufficient to define the multiple causations these limitations are continuing to demand a more stable widely applicable and cost effective index to quantitatively assess the impact of multiple human stressors on ecological shifts in riverine ecosystems schinegger et al 2012 here we analyzed the data collected from 24 sites along 528 km main stem and 30 sites downstream two point sources for three consecutive years to develop an ecological response index eri to quantify ecosystem changes against human perturbations in the ganga river our empirical relationship considers total concentration of six heavy metals as stressor microbial quotient as a measure of efficacy to utilize carbon substrate and fdaase activity as a holistic bioassay for quantifying c eutrophy and metal pollution along the total metal concentration we used bioavailable fractions also to further verify the ecosystem responses to increase the validity of comparison and to minimize variances we repeated all the measurements at the land water interface lwi at corresponding sites of the main stem and downstream point sources our previous studies show that the lwi of large rivers provides a stable testbed with the riverine imprint of ecosystem processes jaiswal and pandey 2019 the eri obtained at lwi showed strong synchrony with those based on the data from the riverbed sediment 4 2 1 as a predictor of eutrophy the developed index model equation was tested as a quantitative predictor of the state of eutrophication we found strong correlations r2 0 70 0 97 p 0 001 of eri with carlson s trophic state index tsi carlson 1977 the ganga river experiences excessive input of n and p pandey et al 2017 to minimize the effect of the hydrodynamic influences and those of turbidity we used n and p based tsi during low flow the strong relationships clearly indicate that similar to tsi p and tsi n the developed index eri is highly appropriate for quantitatively predicting the trophic state of the lotic ecosystems for a numeric classification we used dynamic fit model intersects between toc and eri at asdr where ʃthm did not exceed the toxic threshold the intersect for the riverbed sediment was at 2 49 toc and 77 85 eri whereas for lwi it was at 3 05 toc and 88 54 eri a comparison of the intersect model of asdr and wpdr did show that the eri values between 39 and 77 demarcate hypereutrophic condition the eri within this range prevailed up to 800 m downstream asdr this drain flushes over 66 mld of domestic sewage rich in organic c and nutrients based on the carlson s tsi p and tsi n also these sites are characterized under hypereutrophic condition the eri ranging from 78 to 155 represents eutrophic and 156 to 320 the oligotrophic conditions these were well verified using carlson s tsi p and tsi n 4 2 2 as a predictor of metal pollution this aspect was tested using håkanson s risk index ri håkanson 1980 and modified ecological risk index mri duodu et al 2016 2017 based on total metal concentration as well as their bioavailable fraction we found strong correlations r2 0 76 0 94 p 0 001 between eri and ri and between eri and mri r2 0 76 0 96 p 0 001 at wazidpur drain where the metal concentrations were substantially high the intersects of the dynamic fit model were at 488 μg g 1 ʃthm and 36 53 eri and at 2 38 toc and 24 07 eri in the riverbed sediment and at 3 18 toc and 23 2 eri and at 674 95 μg g 1 ʃthm and 22 13 eri at lwi fig 10 the lowest value of eri was recorded for the most polluted site in the intersect the eri values below 24 shows extreme toxic condition values less than 24 prevailed at sites up to 700 m downstream the wazidpur drain which adds 54 mld of industrial effluents rich in heavy metals and other toxicants when assessed with respect to håkanson s risk index these locations were found under significantly high ecological risk category an index value of 77 intersect of toc and eri at asdr defining the upper range of extreme eutrophy for wpdr was at toc 3 80 while the intersect of toc and eri was at 2 38 this indicates that a large fraction of toc in this range 2 38 3 80 could possibly be utilized in complexing with heavy metals 4 2 3 as a predictor of eutrophy metal pollution because in most of the anthropogenically impacted rivers c enrichment often accompanied by heavy metal enrichment we tested if the index developed here can be used in predicting eutrophy metal pollution together because carbon stimulates fdaase activity while heavy metals exert an adverse effect the developed index was tested by comparing the response when both were relatively high we found a significant curvilinear relationship between fdaase and toc r2 0 66 0 70 p 0 001 indicating that the stimulatory effect of c was counter balanced when heavy metal concentration exceed certain levels ʃthm 284 73 μg g 1 on comparing the dynamic fit curve intersects of asdr with wpdr we found that eri values between 25 and 38 could be used as a predictor of eutrophy metal pollution overall the eri values ranging from 0 to 24 represents extreme metal pollution toxic condition 25 38 represents a combination of eutrophy and metal pollution 39 77 represents hypereutrophic and low metal pollution 78 155 represents eutrophic and 156 320 represents the oligotrophic state of the river ecosystem 5 conclusions our results emphasize the importance of fdaase as a response determinant of ecosystem functional shifts in large rivers the study shows when taken together in an empirical relationship the fdaase toc cmic and total metal concentration provide a quantitative diagnostic for appropriately addressing the eutrophy metal pollution responses in human impacted rivers the ecological response index eri developed here is invariably able to predict the concordant changes in riverine ecosystem responses with stronger mechanistic links between the causal determinants and consequent responses the eri presents a validated scale to quantitatively predict the c eutrophication and metal pollution simultaneously the index predicts on the scale of 0 320 as 0 24 extreme metal pollution eco toxic condition 25 38 eutrophic and metal pollution 39 77 hypereutrophic and low metal pollution 78 155 eutrophic and 156 320 oligotrophic state the
