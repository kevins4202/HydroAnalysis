2495,this study addresses the issue of scant availability of sub daily precipitation data by introducing a novel selection methodology named pattern mapping pm within the existing method of fragments mof framework for the disaggregation of daily precipitation pm introduces multiple statistics based criterion in the selection of fragments thus enhancing accuracy of the selection process the performance of deterministic and stochastic versions of pm mof is compared with three widely used disaggregation methods namely k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model using hyetos software package and micro canonical cascade mcc using reanalysis data at 14 global locations spanning various climatic zones it is seen that the pm mof method has considerably lower percentage error in replicating the standard statistics 50 2 to 50 3 for stochastic pm mof and 7 4 to 13 2 for deterministic pm mof when compared to existing methods knn mof 65 4 to 76 2 hyetos 78 3 to 69 4 and mcc 63 1 to 72 the comparison of densities using skill score show that skill score of pm mof is 0 97 which is higher than other methods 0 94 for knn mof 0 83 for hyetos and 0 85 for mcc control experiments designed around varying length of training data and stochastic deterministic mode of pm mof ascertain the contribution of the novel methodological improvements in the superior performance of pm mof the robustness of the methodology and geography independent performance of pm mof makes it a potent candidate for wider application in hydrological and climate studies keywords

sediment transport and pollutant load modelling gutierrez magness and mccuen 2004 etc the extension of such analyse under a climate change scenario similarly requires sub daily or hourly projected precipitation datasets lee and jeong 2014 the sixth assessment report ar6 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change states that it only has very low confidence about changes in sub daily precipitation extremes due to their limited length and sporadic spatial coverage ipcc 2021 the limited length and sporadic spatial coverage of sub daily data is a major impediment for robust quantification of past changes in extremes the availability of sub daily or hourly precipitation data is constrained by the cost of monitoring instruments for past and present data anis and rode 2015 yusop et al 2014 and computational costs for climate models for future data prein et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 however disaggregation methods can be used to address the gap between requirement and availability of sub daily data these methods are essentially data transformation procedures that attempt to disaggregate the daily data into sub daily values by preserving the statistical properties of sub daily training datasets bárdossy and pegram 2016 knoesen and smithers 2009 a variety of disaggregation methodologies are reported in the literature based on theoretical insights disaggregation methods can be broadly categorized into three types 1 models based on poisson cluster process 2 random cascade models and 3 nonparametric resampling based on method of fragments mof poisson cluster based models try to replicate the fundamental physical phenomena of precipitation based on the assumption that precipitation events are distributed according to a poisson point process koutsoyiannis 2003 the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model blrp kossieris et al 2018 yusop et al 2014 and the neyman scott rectangular pulse nsrp yendra et al 2015 model fall under this category random cascade models work on the assumption of scale invariance i e statistical properties of processes observed at different scales are governed by the same relationship olsson 1998 based on this assumption information drawn from coarser scale precipitation patterns is used to derive the characteristics of fine scale time series both poisson cluster and random cascade models are parametrized by making assumptions about the distribution of precipitation the nonparametric resampling technique based on the method of fragments mof avoids prior assumptions about the diurnal distribution of precipitation as it is data driven the mof works on the assumption that similar sub daily patterns fragment vector exist for similar depths of precipitation carreau et al 2019 based on this assumption the fragment vectors derived from the historical sub daily data are resampled to generate high temporal resolution precipitation data svanidze 1964 introduced mof for stochastic streamflow generation and it has been extensively used in the disaggregation literature over the past few decades silva and portela 2012 2011 srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 svanidze 1980 wojcik and buishand 2003 generated six hourly values of temperature and precipitation from the daily values through direct resampling and mof and have reported that the mof performs better than direct resampling of observed six hourly values moreover a good correlation was noticed between the seasonal maximum precipitation amounts of observed and mof disaggregated precipitation time series selection of proper fragments plays a pivotal role in the disaggregation of coarser resolution time series in the mof related methods the k nearest neighbour method knn a widely used resampling algorithm in mof resamples the fragments based on the match between the depths of the candidate day and training data lee and jeong 2014 reported using the genetic algorithm ga along with knn resampling to disaggregate daily precipitation data by mixing the historical sub daily precipitation data sampled from the entire sample space ga is used for mixing in the context of disaggregation in order to avoid generation of patterns identical to historical values preserving the stochastic nature of precipitation the proposed method is found to be performing well in preserving the observed standard statistical features knn is often coupled with mof as a resampling algorithm in the context of precipitation disaggregation li et al 2018 pui et al 2012 westra et al 2013 however knn uses the single criterion of daily precipitation depth to draw a sample from the historical training space similarly other mof methods use singular criteria like intensity seasonality and similarity scores breinl and di baldassarre 2019 this presents an opportunity for improvement in the methodological domain in terms of introducing multiple criteria for selection of fragments from the training space multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques have been extensively reported in the literature as decision making tools to choose among competing alternatives by compounding multiple criteria shiru et al 2019 mcdm techniques applied in the context of disaggregation of daily precipitation data is hypothesized to have the advantage of enhancing the accuracy in selection of fragments from the training data consequently it is also hypothesized that the use of multiple criteria will expand the space from which the fragment is sampled due to the incremental precision in fragment selection moreover the length of training data is an influencing factor in mof based disaggregation frameworks for example in instances where the target daily precipitation is high knn does not ensure accuracy in the case when the diurnal distribution of the daily precipitation value in the training data do not match with the diurnal distribution of target daily precipitation to the authors best knowledge no study has been reported so far using mcdm techniques in the resampling procedure in mof based on the above discussions the following objectives are outlined for this study 1 incorporation of mdcm technique in the resampling procedure based on mof and 2 the evaluation of the proposed method and a comparison with existing methods the remainder of the article is structured as follows in section 2 a detailed description of the proposed methodology is presented a brief description of the data used for disaggregation and the study area is provided in section 3 section 4 discusses the performance of the proposed method in comparison to existing methods finally the summary and conclusions are reported in section 5 2 methodology the current study builds on the idea of selecting processed sub daily precipitation data referred to as fragments from a training dataset of any given location and using the fragments to disaggregate the daily precipitation data of a given day target day of the same location in this study a multi criteria decision making technique called compromise programming is employed as a resampling method for the selection of suitable fragments the selection of the fragments from the training data search space is made by formulating a set of normalized indices these indices were computed using the statistical properties of the target day and the sub daily data of the training dataset in developing these indices based on the statistical properties it is assumed that these properties have temporal stationarity the error computed between the statistical properties of the target day and the training data are normalized to design indices subsequently these indices are used to rank fragment vectors using compromise programming the best fragment relative to the criteria is picked up conditioned on a match between the previous and next day s wetness state of target daily precipitation to account for inter day connectivity sub daily precipitation time series of the target day is generated by multiplying the selected fragment by the target daily precipitation the detailed description of the proposed methodology is presented in the subsequent sub sections and represented in fig 1 2 1 method of fragments the term fragment corresponds to the ratio of sub daily to daily data and the fragment vector of a day is derived using eq 1 and 2 1 p d h 1 24 p d h 2 f d f d 1 f d 2 f d 3 f d 24 f d h p d h p d where p d is the cumulative daily precipitation of dth day in the training data f d is the fragment vector of dth day f d h and p dh are the fragment and the precipitation at hour h of dth day d varies in the range of 1 to n n is the total number of days in the training data set in order to account for the continuity of rainstorms the training day and target days are classified into four types based on the wetness state of the antecedent and subsequent day westra et al 2013 a day d is considered a wet day if the total precipitation on that day p d is greater than zero the four types of classified days are class 1 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 wet wet wet class 2 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 dry wet wet class 3 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 wet wet dry class 4 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 dry wet dry the fragment vectors from the training dataset are chosen based on a distance criterion with the help of resampling algorithms provided that the class of target day and training day are same the disaggregated data of the target day is computed by multiplying the chosen fragment vector with the target daily precipitation p target as given in eq 3 3 p target h f d p target the common steps between most widely used k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof and the proposed method are given below step 1 compute the fragment vectors from the training dataset using eq 2 step 2 in previous studies applying knn mof a moving window of 15 days around the julian day of p target is used however in this study the sampling window has been expanded to the entire training dataset this novelty could be incorporated in pm mof since the strength of mcdm makes the selection procedure of the fragment robust enough to accommodate higher degree of variability without compromising accuracy step 3 categorize the training and target daily precipitation days into different classes based on their antecedent and posterior wetness conditions refer to section 2 1 step 4 extract the k nearest neighbours of p target in the training period based on the distance criterion the number of nearest neighbours is computed as k n c breinl and di baldassarre 2019 lall and sharma 1996 where n c represents the sample size of the class members falling within the training data for sampling between j neighbours the following conditional probability distribution is used as described in eq 4 to 5 lall and sharma 1996 pui et al 2012 4 w j 1 j i 1 k 1 j 5 p j i 1 j w j where i represents the neighbour index lower values of i indicates the closest of the nearest neighbors note that the computed weights w j are normalized such that they sum to unity step 5 compute a uniform random number u 0 1 and compare with p j choose w j where u is closest to p j identify the fragment vector corresponding to the jth neighbour with chosen w j the target daily precipitation is disaggregated by multiplying the fragment vector with p target repeat step 2 to step 5 for each target day until the entire daily records are disaggregated 2 2 k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof the distance criterion in step 4 of mof based disaggregation method for knn resampling method is p d p target the k number of fragment vectors with lowest distance criterion and meeting the class criterion are selected randomly for disaggregation of target daily precipitation 2 3 pattern mapping based mof pm mof both knn mof and pm mof share the same mof principles that similar sub daily patterns fragment vector exist for similar depths of precipitation in the proposed pm mof a new selection criterion is used based on the relation between the statistical properties of sub daily data and the daily data in the training period a detailed description of the proposed methodology for finding the distance criterion is given below 2 3 1 establishing relationship between sub daily statistical features and daily values in the training period the statistical properties standard deviation maximum value of the sub daily data of the training period are extracted and their correlation with the timeseries of the daily data of the training period is computed it is observed that the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 8 across all locations fig 2 therefore linear relations between the daily data and the statistical properties of the sub daily data are established using regression 2 3 2 formulation of error indices subsequently the daily data of the target day p target is used as input in these linear equations to estimate the statistical properties of the sub daily data of the target day the sub daily parameters estimated above are then linked with the parameters of the training sub daily data p d h using a set of novel normalized indices formulated in this study these indices are mentioned in eq 6 through 10 6 i n d e x 1 sd d sd reg sd reg d 1 n 7 i n d e x 2 α d α reg α reg d 1 n α m a x p d h h 1 24 8 i n d e x 3 β d β reg β reg d 1 n β α sd f 9 i n d e x 4 γ d γ reg γ reg d 1 n γ e v e n t r a t i o α 10 i n d e x 5 p d p target p target d 1 n where reg represents the values of the regressed statistical properties of the sub daily data of the target day sd d is the standard deviation of the training sub daily precipitation of dth day p d h h 1 24 sd f is the standard deviation of the fragment vector of the training sub daily precipitation on the dth day f d event ratio is the ratio of the number of hourly time steps the precipitation values are greater than zero in a day to the total number of values in a day i e 24 p target is the total daily precipitation of the target day pd is the total daily precipitation of the dth day of the training dataset the computed indices are used to populate a payoff matrix m with the number of days present in the training data n as the number of rows and the number of indices k as the number of columns 2 3 3 weightage allocation weights are allocated for the aforementioned normalized indices using criteria importance and through intercriteria correlation critic method xie et al 2022 yan et al 2021 and combined into a single measure by employing compromise programming in this study the critic method has been chosen over other weightage allocation methods such as the entropy method because of its ability to account for inter criteria correlation anil et al 2021 diakoulaki et al 1995 the payoff matrix m is transformed into the interval 0 1 and the elements in the transformed matrix c are determined using eq 11 11 c dk m dk m k m k m k where m k m k represents the minimum and maximum values of the kth index respectively m dk denotes the value of the k th index of d th training day note that as normalized error indices are used in the payoff matrix the ideal m k and anti ideal m k values will be equal to least and highest value k th column of payoff matrix m respectively variability of each index is captured by computing the standard deviation of each column σ k of matrix c a symmetric matrix of size k k with element r kl is formulated where the value of r kl represents the linear correlation coefficient between kth column and lth column of matrix c the quantity of information q k in relation to each index is calculated using the eq 12 ruan et al 2021 if the inter criteria correlation r kl is high the quantity of information will be low and lower weightage will be allocated to those criteria 12 q k σ k l 1 k 1 r kl the weights of the indices w k are determined using eq 13 13 w k q k k 1 k q k 2 3 4 ranking of fragments using compromise programming compromise programming ranks the alternatives by compounding the indices into a single lp metric value a measure of proximity to the ideal solution raju et al 2017 the alternatives in this case are the fragments of sub daily precipitation data of each day of the training period the equation to compute the lp metric value is given in eq 14 14 l p d k 1 k w k 2 m k m dk 2 1 2 where m k is the minimum value of the kth normalized index m dk denotes the k th index of d th training day and wk is the weight allocated to the kth index obtained from critic method at the end of this step n number of lp values are generated where n is the total number of days in the training dataset the obtained lp values are used as the distance criterion in pm mof since the proposed methodology identifies the best precipitation patterns fragments relative to the criteria from the training data the methodology is named pattern mapping 2 4 comparison disaggregation methods the efficacy of the proposed disaggregation method is compared against two other widely used stochastic disaggregation methods modified bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model performed using the computer program called hyetos and micro canonical cascade mcc models the three methods knn mof hyetos and mcc were particularly chosen for comparison for the following reasons i they have varying model structures i e hyetos is based on the poison point process mcc is based on the theory of scale invariance and the mof methods are based on observed rainfall fractions ii they are widely used for disaggregation of precipitation across different parts of the world an r package called hyetosminute kossieris et al 2016 has been employed to disaggregate daily precipitation using the blrp method a python package called melodist förster et al 2016 has been used to disaggregate daily precipitation using the micro canonical cascade method since the chosen comparison disaggregation methods are stochastic in nature 100 realizations were simulated in order to account the stochasticity a brief description of these disaggregation methods is given below 2 4 1 hyetos the modified bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model is used as another disaggregation method by employing an r package called hyetosminute kossieris et al 2016 in the mblrp model rainfall sequences are portrayed as a series of storm events described by rain cells consisting of a set of random variables represented by different distributions the original blrp model is parameterized using five random variables λ β rblm γ η μ x rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 the cell clusters storms at the first level are simulated following a poisson process with a cluster generation rate λ and the expected value of exponentially distributed storm generation duration is 1 γ β rblm denotes arrival time of the rain cell within the duration of poisson distributed storm activity the duration of each rain cell s contribution is considered to be exponentially distributed with expectation 1 η the average precipitation intensity associated with each cell is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean µx in the mblrp model gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters is used instead of the exponential distribution for better representation of dry wet spell properties kim et al 2013 rodriquez iturbe et al 1988 the parameters of the mblrp model are estimated using the evolutionary annealing simplex eas algorithm kossieris et al 2018 the objective function is formulated by computing the error between the statistical properties of observed and simulated rainfall such as mean variance autocorrelation and proportion of dry spells for 1 3 12 and 24 h levels of accumulation kim et al 2017 clusters of wet days are separated with least one dry day between the sequence of wet days the disaggregation is performed for these clusters of wet days for each cluster the match between simulated daily depths obtained from the hourly simulations and the sequence of observed daily values is assessed using a tolerance distance ds the model would run repeatedly until the maximum number of repetitions is achieved or else it generates a sequence with tolerance distance within a permissible limit in the hyetos model the predetermined maximum tolerance distance ds is defined as given in eq 15 15 ds i 1 l ln 2 p i c p i c 1 2 where p i and p i are the observed and simulated daily precipitation depths in a cluster of wet days respectively l represents the length of sequence of wet days c is a constant in the formulation of ds the logarithmic transformation helps reduce bias towards the extreme values and the constant c value is used as 0 1 in order to reduce the bias due to very low values the bias between observed and simulated daily rainfall depths is addressed using a repetitive scheme with proportional adjustment in this study the value of ds is set to 0 1 to avoid unacceptable bias and the maximum number of total repetitions is set as 5000 2 4 2 mcc olsson 1998 introduced the principle of a multiplicative micro canonical cascade model for temporal disaggregation of rainfall the disaggregation is performed assuming doubling of temporal resolution for each step i e the coarser resolution data is split into b finer time steps of equal duration where b is the branching number set to 2 müller and haberlandt 2018 the procedure is applied iteratively until the desired temporal resolution is achieved splitting of precipitation volume at higher cascade level is performed using the weights w1 and w2 that sum to unity to preserve the volume exactly three possible combinations of w1 and w2 in the cascade generator are given in eq 16 16 w 1 w 2 0 a n d 1 w i t h p 0 1 1 a n d 0 w i t h p 1 0 x a n d 1 x w i t h p x 1 x 0 x 1 where p represents the probability of each combination of weights p 0 1 indicates that no precipitation volume assigned to the first time step w1 and entire volume is allocated to the second time step a contrasting scenario of splitting is performed when the probability is p 1 0 in the third case the precipitation volume could be allocated to both time steps with a x 1 x splitting with being the fraction defined as 0 x 1 in the mcc model the cascade generator is a function of scale weights are scale dependent preserving the mass exactly in disaggregation güntner et al 2001 rupp et al 2009 in cascade based disaggregation of precipitation the position of a time step is defined based on wetness state of neighbouring time steps four types of positions starting enclosed isolated and ending and two volume classes are used where the lower and upper volume classes are separated by the mean rainfall volume of each position considering as a random variable for all disaggregation steps a probability density function f x with the empirical probabilities for each value of is estimated to account the dependency of the scaling properties on the external precipitation pattern förster et al 2016 müller and haberlandt 2018 in this method the daily values are disaggregated in time steps of halves 24 hr 12 hr 6 hr 3 hr 1 5 hr 0 75 hr consequently a time series in steps of 45 min can be equally distributed to a 15 minute time series and then again reaggregated to obtain a time series of 1 h intervals 2 5 evaluation of disaggregation methodologies the validation of the proposed disaggregation methodology along with comparison methods emphasizes on the evaluation of disaggregated sub daily data in reproducing five aspects of observed data these are i standard validation statistics such as mean standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and proportion of wet events ii within day statistical properties such as daily maximum intensities and daily variance iii intensity durationfrequency curves for different durations iv ability to match the probability density function pdf of observed hourly precipitation time series 3 study area and data forty years 1980 2019 of hourly precipitation values acquired from the fifth generation reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf known as era5 reanalysis data are used as reference data in this study due to the scarcity of long term continuous observed precipitation time series across the world era5 is available at a horizontal resolution of 31 km at hourly time intervals hersbach and dee 2016 the era5 reanalysis products were found to be performing well in hydrological modelling tarek et al 2020 and also in representing the historical climate variability gleixner et al 2020 two years 1980 1981 of data have been used as training data in order to test the efficacy of each disaggregation method trained with a small sample thirty years 1990 2019 of hourly data has been cumulated to daily values and then disaggregated for validation hourly precipitation time series from fourteen locations shown in fig 3 spread across the globe were taken in this study that represents different climatic zones the locations were chosen such that they cover all the major climatological as defined by koppen classification zones across the globe the details about the chosen locations are provided in table s1 4 results in this section the pattern mapping based mof is referred as pm mof knn based mof is referred as knn mof bartlett lewis rectangular pulse is referred as hyetos and micro canonical cascade model is referred as mcc 4 1 standard validation statistics the ability of disaggregated precipitation time series in reproducing standard statistical measures of observed data such as mean standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and proportion of wet spells is important to evaluate the performance of rainfall disaggregation methodologies the percentage errors between the statistical properties of the reference and disaggregated data are computed and presented in table 1 note that for stochastic disaggregation methods the median value of percentage errors computed for 100 realizations is given in table 1 pm mof knn mof and micro canonical cascade models perform well at reproducing the mean at all the locations this is attributable to their ability to preserve the daily total precipitation the mean values of hyetos disaggregated precipitation time series are slightly lower than that of observed mean precipitation at e f h i l and n this is plausibly due to the methodology of hyetos that disaggregates clusters of wet days contrasting to other methods which disaggregate individual wet days the performance of pattern mapping in reproducing the observed variance presented in terms of standard deviation is found to be satisfactory at all locations except at b c and d but it slightly underestimates the variance at all locations the variance of knn mof disaggregated precipitation is overestimated 10 at most of the locations since knn mof resamples the fragments based on the similarity between target and training precipitation depths the overestimation of variance indicates that the diurnal distribution characteristics resampled from the training data are altered in the target precipitation data moreover the stochastic resampling using the k nearest neighbour method might lead to resampling of unsuitable fragments especially from within a limited training sample however pm mof considers sd as the criterion for selection of fragments and thus resulting in better performance when compared to knn mof this result indicates that inclusion of multiple criteria for the selection of fragments in training data positively correlates with the accuracy of disaggregation the performance of hyetos disaggregated data is satisfactory at most of the locations but there is a considerable absolute deviation 10 between simulated and observed variance at locations b c d g and i the variance of mcc based disaggregated precipitation has been overestimated at most of the locations the lag 1 autocorrelation is a measure of the relationship between two consecutive precipitation events the performance of both pm mof and knn mof disaggregated data is considerably good in reproducing the lag 1 autocorrelation with pm mof having a slight edge over knn mof refer to table 1 the performance of hyetos and mcc disaggregated data are not up to par at most of the locations whereas the hyetos overestimates lag 1 autocorrelation and the mcc underestimates the lag 1 autocorrelation at most of the locations wetness proportion indicates the ratio of the number of wet events with precipitation values exceeding zero in a time series to the total number of time steps both pm mof and knn mof disaggregated data are reasonably good in reproducing the observed wetness proportions see table 1 this is due to the fact that resampling methods use realistic precipitation patterns to disaggregate precipitation the performance of hyetos and mcc disaggregated data is poor since hyetos tends to underestimate the wetness proportions and the mcc method tends to overestimate it at most of the locations 4 2 within day statistics the standard statistical measures give an outline of the overall performance of the time series but the reproduction of within day statistical features such as daily maximum intensity and standard deviation plays an important role in preserving the extreme values hence the performance of the disaggregated time series is evaluated with the root mean square error rmse eq 17 between the reference and modelled daily standard deviation and daily maximum intensity maximum value out of 24 values in a day 17 rmse t 1 t p s t p o t 2 t where p s t p o t represents the daily standard deviation daily maximum intensity of disaggregated and reference precipitation at time step t and t represents the total number of days the rmse computed between observed and disaggregated daily maximum intensities for all the locations is presented in fig 4 which shows that the deterministic version of pm mof outperforms the remaining three methods in simulating the maximum daily intensities the stochastic version of pm mof performs well at locations b f g h j k m and n the methodological development introduced in the selection of fragments in the pm mof method helps to select the best fragment relative to the employed criteria for disaggregation it can be observed that the variability of rmse computed for 100 realizations of pm mof knn mof and mcc disaggregated time series are comparatively lower than that of hyetos disaggregated realizations the performance of stochastic disaggregation methods is reasonably good at most of the locations except at locations b and c the rmse computed between observed and disaggregated diurnal variances at all the locations is presented in fig 5 the results are similar to that of daily maximum intensities with pm mof outperforming other methods 4 3 performance in terms of replicating observed intensity duration frequency relationships intensity duration frequency curves are used to assess the ability of models to capture the distribution of extremes hence intensity frequency curves were generated from the maximum intensity of each year for 1 3 6 and 12 h duration the intensity frequency curves were generated based on the empirical cumulative distribution of the observed and disaggregated precipitation time series in this method annual maximum precipitation is sorted in descending order and ranked accordingly and the probability of exceedance is calculated using weibull s plotting position formula eq 18 18 p m n 1 where p is probability of exceedance m is the rank of event n is the total number of events the observed intensity frequency curves for annual maxima of reference and disaggregated time series for 1 and 3 hr durations are plotted in figs 6 and 7 from fig 6 it is noticed that the performance of pm mof is satisfactory at more than half of the locations in comparison to knn mof and mcc the performance of pm mof in matching the observed intensity frequency curve at locations b m and n is not satisfactory along with other disaggregation methods it can be noticed that knn mof is overestimating the intensities at lower probabilities of exceedances at most of the locations mcc is overestimating the intensities at all locations except at location l for all probability of exceedances it can also be observed that the overall uncertainty in the intensity frequency curves generated hyetos is found to be higher than other methods moreover the median of hyetos is underestimating the intensities at most of the locations the intensity frequency curves for 3 hr duration fig 7 show that the overestimation of mcc disaggregated data has slightly decreased in comparison to the intensity frequency curve for 1 hr duration however the performance of the remaining three models is similar at most of the locations intensity frequency curves at higher duration levels of 6 hr and 12 hrs figures s1 and s2 for all four models are equally performing well at all locations from these results it can be inferred that pm mof and knn mof are performing well at reproducing the return levels for all durations the performance of knn mof and mcc improved in simulating intensities for 6 hr and 12 hr duration 4 4 performance in terms of matching the observed pdf the ability of the disaggregation methods in replicating the observed probability density function pdf is assessed by computing the skill score skill score measures the degree of similarity between the observed and simulated pdfs by measuring the common area between them anandhi and nanjundiah 2015 manikanta and vema 2022 a skill score of one indicates an exact overlap of the pdf of observed and disaggregated data the equation of skill score is given in eq 19 19 skillscore i 1 nb m i n f p f o t where t represents the number of data points f p f o represent the frequencies of disaggregated and observed values of precipitation at a given bin nb represent the total number of bins chosen to analyze the match between observed and simulated pdfs in this analysis a bin size of 0 01 mm was adopted to assess the frequency characteristics of observed and simulated precipitation the skill score of observed versus disaggregated values at all locations is plotted in fig 8 from the figure it is evident that the proposed method pm is performing well in comparison to hyetos and mcc in matching the distribution of characteristics of observed precipitation values at all the locations with a skill score value greater than 0 9 except at locations c and d the performance of knn mof and mcc disaggregated data in terms of skill score is reasonably good in most of the locations except at locations c d and h the performance of hyetos is comparatively poorer than other disaggregation methods in terms of skill score at most of the locations the median skill score of pm mof across all locations is 0 97 which is comparatively greater than the median skill score of other disaggregated datasets 0 94 for knn mof 0 83 for hyetos and 0 85 for mcc suggesting the efficacy of the proposed method in reproducing the observed pdf 4 5 sensitivity analysis of indices used in pm mof since the novelty of this study was the introduction of multiple indices in the domain of temporal disaggregation an experiment to understand the sensitivity of performance of pm mof against the indices eq 6 to 10 is performed for this purpose the performance of the original pm is compared with pm by excluding one index at a time by computing the rmse for daily maximum intensities and daily standard deviation fig 9 the results denote that the rmse value of the proposed pm mof is lower than the pm mof without indices in most of the cases indicating that the indices contribute well to the better performance of proposed pm the sensitivity of index 4 in terms of performance of pm found to be lower when compared to other indices however it was observed that the sensitivity is found to be increasing with an increase in the duration of training period refer to figures s3 and s4 4 6 performance of pm and knn based mof with varying lengths of training data the pm mof approach makes methodological advances on the knn mof method therefore a set of experiments were designed to check the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to knn one of the primary influencing factors for the two resampling methods is the length of training data available hence it is important to know the influence of length of training dataset on the performance of two resampling methods hence an experiment is performed with knn mof and pm mof with varying lengths of training data for this purpose three training samples with lengths of 2 5 and 10 years were used the performance of knn mof and pm mof is compared in terms of rmse of daily maximum intensities and diurnal variances see fig 10 from fig 10 it can be noticed the performance of pm based mof is comparatively better than knn based mof in simulating daily maximum intensities at most of the locations even with small sample of training data 2 years it can also be observed that the performance of pm is improving with increasing length of training data this improvement is plausibly due to the employed linear regression based error indices used in pm these indices might help in selecting the best fragment relative to the criteria and thereby leading to improved disaggregation 5 summary and conclusions sub daily precipitation data while important for hydrological applications like idf curves urban drainage etc is scantily available due to resource constraints hence researchers have proposed multiple methods of disaggregation of daily data to sub daily scales using various approaches mof is one of the widely accepted disaggregated methods and has been applied with selection techniques like knn and knn ga however such methods depend on a single criterion for the selection of the fragment from the training data therefore to improve upon the performance of the selection criterion we have introduced multi criteria decision into precipitation disaggregation in this study the new method is named pattern mapping wherein normalized indices between the statistical properties of the target day and training dataset are processed through compromise programming to select a fragment from the training data the robustness of the new method is tested across various locations representing diverse climatic conditions the efficacy of the proposed method has been evaluated by comparing it with three commonly used disaggregation methods namely knn mof hyetos and mcc moreover as this study is a methodological advancement over existing mof methods control experiments are carried out to assess the distinctive contribution of the mcdm approach in the disaggregation of precipitation results show that pm mof performed well in all the climate zones arid warm temperate equatorial coastal and inland while it was also observed that the performance of the models did not have any correlation with any particular climatic zone sub daily data generated from pm mof was found to be satisfactory in matching the standard statistical measures such as mean variance lag 1 autocorrelation and wetness proportions of the observed dataset it is seen that the pm mof method has a considerably lower percentage error 50 2 to 50 3 for stochastic pm mof and 7 4 to 13 2 for deterministic pm mof see table 1 and table s2 in comparison to the existing methods mof 65 4 to 76 2 hyetos 78 3 to 69 4 and mcc 63 1 to 72 pm mof has outperformed other disaggregation methods in reproducing the within day statistics such as daily maximum intensities and diurnal variance the performance of pm mof in terms of reproducing intensity frequency curves for 1 hr and 3 hr durations is found to be satisfactory when compared to other disaggregation methods the performance of the disaggregated datasets in reproducing the observed pdf has been analyzed in terms of skill score it was found that the pm mof and mof datasets are performing better than hyetos and mcc datasets with pm mof performing slightly better than mof the results are in line with the findings of pui et al 2012 suggesting the better performance of nonparametric methods pm mof and knn mof over their parametric counterparts hyetos and mcc the control experiments with introduction of stochasticity and levelling the temporal window for training data showed that pm mof performs better than currently used mof methods consequently the improvement in results can be deterministically attributed to the improvement in methodology proposed in the paper it is important to note that both hyetos and mcc are parametrized by making assumptions about the distribution of precipitation while these parametric models can disaggregate precipitation over a range of temporal scales they require long term observed sub daily data for reliable calibration of the model parameters and are also computationally expensive molnar and burlando 2005 pui et al 2012 yusop et al 2014 in contrast the resampling based disaggregation models both pm mof and knn mof generate sub daily data by utilizing the observed diurnal precipitation patterns accordingly the performance of both pm mof and knn mof is constrained by the duration and quality of the training data moreover none of the methods discussed above is designed to conserve the statistical properties of the sub daily precipitation for any given target day resulting in skewed intra day precipitation patterns for instance to disaggregate a target daily precipitation of 100 mm which has actually occurred in 3 sub daily events knn might select the nearest precipitation value in the training dataset which is 40 mm which has actually occurred in 1 sub daily event this results in the distribution of 100 mm daily precipitation in just one hour of the disaggregated target day in the case of pm instead selecting the nearest neighbour based on the similarity between target and training daily precipitation depths alone it considers the relationships between sub daily statistical features and daily precipitation for resampling the best suitable fragments the linear relationships established between sub daily statistical features and daily precipitation in the training period help us to estimate the sub daily statistical features of target daily precipitation step 2 in section 2 1 the error indices computed between the sub daily statistical features of each individual training day and the estimated sub daily statistical features of the target day are used to select the best fragment relative to the criteria through multi criteria decision making steps 3 to 5 in section 2 1 this helps us to choose a fragment with 35 mm of daily precipitation which has actually occurred in 3 events resulting in better disaggregation of target daily precipitation and preservation of target day statistical properties the results show that pm mof is performing well in comparison to other methods even when trained with small samples two years and the skill of pm mof is increasing with increasing length of training data the encouraging results show the validity of the established relations between sub daily statistical features and daily cumulative precipitation which are used for selection of fragments in the methodology of pm this suggests that pm mof can be further used to disaggregate the future daily precipitation values obtained from the climate models along with this the applicability of the proposed method in spatial disaggregation and disaggregation of weather variables such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation is reserved for future research in summary the proposed disaggregation algorithm named pattern mapping is a robust method for simulating sub daily precipitation values the proposed disaggregation method is expected to assist hydro climatologists for various applications in engineering and water resources research the developed method can be used for the application of urban hydrology where the time of concentration typically ranges between a few minutes to a few hours integration of the proposed disaggregation methodology with a statistical downscaling model is helpful in the assessment of the changes in the frequency and occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the present and future climate scenarios the accurate estimation of precipitation extremes assists the policymakers in the design of resilient and sustainable urban infrastructure and also helps in reconsideration of existing urban systems the rainfall intensity obtained from the disaggregated precipitation time series can also be used to accurately estimate sediment and pollutant loads credit authorship contribution statement velpuri manikanta conceptualization methodology

2495,this study addresses the issue of scant availability of sub daily precipitation data by introducing a novel selection methodology named pattern mapping pm within the existing method of fragments mof framework for the disaggregation of daily precipitation pm introduces multiple statistics based criterion in the selection of fragments thus enhancing accuracy of the selection process the performance of deterministic and stochastic versions of pm mof is compared with three widely used disaggregation methods namely k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model using hyetos software package and micro canonical cascade mcc using reanalysis data at 14 global locations spanning various climatic zones it is seen that the pm mof method has considerably lower percentage error in replicating the standard statistics 50 2 to 50 3 for stochastic pm mof and 7 4 to 13 2 for deterministic pm mof when compared to existing methods knn mof 65 4 to 76 2 hyetos 78 3 to 69 4 and mcc 63 1 to 72 the comparison of densities using skill score show that skill score of pm mof is 0 97 which is higher than other methods 0 94 for knn mof 0 83 for hyetos and 0 85 for mcc control experiments designed around varying length of training data and stochastic deterministic mode of pm mof ascertain the contribution of the novel methodological improvements in the superior performance of pm mof the robustness of the methodology and geography independent performance of pm mof makes it a potent candidate for wider application in hydrological and climate studies keywords

sediment transport and pollutant load modelling gutierrez magness and mccuen 2004 etc the extension of such analyse under a climate change scenario similarly requires sub daily or hourly projected precipitation datasets lee and jeong 2014 the sixth assessment report ar6 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change states that it only has very low confidence about changes in sub daily precipitation extremes due to their limited length and sporadic spatial coverage ipcc 2021 the limited length and sporadic spatial coverage of sub daily data is a major impediment for robust quantification of past changes in extremes the availability of sub daily or hourly precipitation data is constrained by the cost of monitoring instruments for past and present data anis and rode 2015 yusop et al 2014 and computational costs for climate models for future data prein et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 however disaggregation methods can be used to address the gap between requirement and availability of sub daily data these methods are essentially data transformation procedures that attempt to disaggregate the daily data into sub daily values by preserving the statistical properties of sub daily training datasets bárdossy and pegram 2016 knoesen and smithers 2009 a variety of disaggregation methodologies are reported in the literature based on theoretical insights disaggregation methods can be broadly categorized into three types 1 models based on poisson cluster process 2 random cascade models and 3 nonparametric resampling based on method of fragments mof poisson cluster based models try to replicate the fundamental physical phenomena of precipitation based on the assumption that precipitation events are distributed according to a poisson point process koutsoyiannis 2003 the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model blrp kossieris et al 2018 yusop et al 2014 and the neyman scott rectangular pulse nsrp yendra et al 2015 model fall under this category random cascade models work on the assumption of scale invariance i e statistical properties of processes observed at different scales are governed by the same relationship olsson 1998 based on this assumption information drawn from coarser scale precipitation patterns is used to derive the characteristics of fine scale time series both poisson cluster and random cascade models are parametrized by making assumptions about the distribution of precipitation the nonparametric resampling technique based on the method of fragments mof avoids prior assumptions about the diurnal distribution of precipitation as it is data driven the mof works on the assumption that similar sub daily patterns fragment vector exist for similar depths of precipitation carreau et al 2019 based on this assumption the fragment vectors derived from the historical sub daily data are resampled to generate high temporal resolution precipitation data svanidze 1964 introduced mof for stochastic streamflow generation and it has been extensively used in the disaggregation literature over the past few decades silva and portela 2012 2011 srikanthan and mcmahon 2001 svanidze 1980 wojcik and buishand 2003 generated six hourly values of temperature and precipitation from the daily values through direct resampling and mof and have reported that the mof performs better than direct resampling of observed six hourly values moreover a good correlation was noticed between the seasonal maximum precipitation amounts of observed and mof disaggregated precipitation time series selection of proper fragments plays a pivotal role in the disaggregation of coarser resolution time series in the mof related methods the k nearest neighbour method knn a widely used resampling algorithm in mof resamples the fragments based on the match between the depths of the candidate day and training data lee and jeong 2014 reported using the genetic algorithm ga along with knn resampling to disaggregate daily precipitation data by mixing the historical sub daily precipitation data sampled from the entire sample space ga is used for mixing in the context of disaggregation in order to avoid generation of patterns identical to historical values preserving the stochastic nature of precipitation the proposed method is found to be performing well in preserving the observed standard statistical features knn is often coupled with mof as a resampling algorithm in the context of precipitation disaggregation li et al 2018 pui et al 2012 westra et al 2013 however knn uses the single criterion of daily precipitation depth to draw a sample from the historical training space similarly other mof methods use singular criteria like intensity seasonality and similarity scores breinl and di baldassarre 2019 this presents an opportunity for improvement in the methodological domain in terms of introducing multiple criteria for selection of fragments from the training space multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques have been extensively reported in the literature as decision making tools to choose among competing alternatives by compounding multiple criteria shiru et al 2019 mcdm techniques applied in the context of disaggregation of daily precipitation data is hypothesized to have the advantage of enhancing the accuracy in selection of fragments from the training data consequently it is also hypothesized that the use of multiple criteria will expand the space from which the fragment is sampled due to the incremental precision in fragment selection moreover the length of training data is an influencing factor in mof based disaggregation frameworks for example in instances where the target daily precipitation is high knn does not ensure accuracy in the case when the diurnal distribution of the daily precipitation value in the training data do not match with the diurnal distribution of target daily precipitation to the authors best knowledge no study has been reported so far using mcdm techniques in the resampling procedure in mof based on the above discussions the following objectives are outlined for this study 1 incorporation of mdcm technique in the resampling procedure based on mof and 2 the evaluation of the proposed method and a comparison with existing methods the remainder of the article is structured as follows in section 2 a detailed description of the proposed methodology is presented a brief description of the data used for disaggregation and the study area is provided in section 3 section 4 discusses the performance of the proposed method in comparison to existing methods finally the summary and conclusions are reported in section 5 2 methodology the current study builds on the idea of selecting processed sub daily precipitation data referred to as fragments from a training dataset of any given location and using the fragments to disaggregate the daily precipitation data of a given day target day of the same location in this study a multi criteria decision making technique called compromise programming is employed as a resampling method for the selection of suitable fragments the selection of the fragments from the training data search space is made by formulating a set of normalized indices these indices were computed using the statistical properties of the target day and the sub daily data of the training dataset in developing these indices based on the statistical properties it is assumed that these properties have temporal stationarity the error computed between the statistical properties of the target day and the training data are normalized to design indices subsequently these indices are used to rank fragment vectors using compromise programming the best fragment relative to the criteria is picked up conditioned on a match between the previous and next day s wetness state of target daily precipitation to account for inter day connectivity sub daily precipitation time series of the target day is generated by multiplying the selected fragment by the target daily precipitation the detailed description of the proposed methodology is presented in the subsequent sub sections and represented in fig 1 2 1 method of fragments the term fragment corresponds to the ratio of sub daily to daily data and the fragment vector of a day is derived using eq 1 and 2 1 p d h 1 24 p d h 2 f d f d 1 f d 2 f d 3 f d 24 f d h p d h p d where p d is the cumulative daily precipitation of dth day in the training data f d is the fragment vector of dth day f d h and p dh are the fragment and the precipitation at hour h of dth day d varies in the range of 1 to n n is the total number of days in the training data set in order to account for the continuity of rainstorms the training day and target days are classified into four types based on the wetness state of the antecedent and subsequent day westra et al 2013 a day d is considered a wet day if the total precipitation on that day p d is greater than zero the four types of classified days are class 1 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 wet wet wet class 2 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 dry wet wet class 3 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 wet wet dry class 4 p d 0 p d 1 0 p d 1 0 dry wet dry the fragment vectors from the training dataset are chosen based on a distance criterion with the help of resampling algorithms provided that the class of target day and training day are same the disaggregated data of the target day is computed by multiplying the chosen fragment vector with the target daily precipitation p target as given in eq 3 3 p target h f d p target the common steps between most widely used k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof and the proposed method are given below step 1 compute the fragment vectors from the training dataset using eq 2 step 2 in previous studies applying knn mof a moving window of 15 days around the julian day of p target is used however in this study the sampling window has been expanded to the entire training dataset this novelty could be incorporated in pm mof since the strength of mcdm makes the selection procedure of the fragment robust enough to accommodate higher degree of variability without compromising accuracy step 3 categorize the training and target daily precipitation days into different classes based on their antecedent and posterior wetness conditions refer to section 2 1 step 4 extract the k nearest neighbours of p target in the training period based on the distance criterion the number of nearest neighbours is computed as k n c breinl and di baldassarre 2019 lall and sharma 1996 where n c represents the sample size of the class members falling within the training data for sampling between j neighbours the following conditional probability distribution is used as described in eq 4 to 5 lall and sharma 1996 pui et al 2012 4 w j 1 j i 1 k 1 j 5 p j i 1 j w j where i represents the neighbour index lower values of i indicates the closest of the nearest neighbors note that the computed weights w j are normalized such that they sum to unity step 5 compute a uniform random number u 0 1 and compare with p j choose w j where u is closest to p j identify the fragment vector corresponding to the jth neighbour with chosen w j the target daily precipitation is disaggregated by multiplying the fragment vector with p target repeat step 2 to step 5 for each target day until the entire daily records are disaggregated 2 2 k nearest neighbour based mof knn mof the distance criterion in step 4 of mof based disaggregation method for knn resampling method is p d p target the k number of fragment vectors with lowest distance criterion and meeting the class criterion are selected randomly for disaggregation of target daily precipitation 2 3 pattern mapping based mof pm mof both knn mof and pm mof share the same mof principles that similar sub daily patterns fragment vector exist for similar depths of precipitation in the proposed pm mof a new selection criterion is used based on the relation between the statistical properties of sub daily data and the daily data in the training period a detailed description of the proposed methodology for finding the distance criterion is given below 2 3 1 establishing relationship between sub daily statistical features and daily values in the training period the statistical properties standard deviation maximum value of the sub daily data of the training period are extracted and their correlation with the timeseries of the daily data of the training period is computed it is observed that the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 8 across all locations fig 2 therefore linear relations between the daily data and the statistical properties of the sub daily data are established using regression 2 3 2 formulation of error indices subsequently the daily data of the target day p target is used as input in these linear equations to estimate the statistical properties of the sub daily data of the target day the sub daily parameters estimated above are then linked with the parameters of the training sub daily data p d h using a set of novel normalized indices formulated in this study these indices are mentioned in eq 6 through 10 6 i n d e x 1 sd d sd reg sd reg d 1 n 7 i n d e x 2 α d α reg α reg d 1 n α m a x p d h h 1 24 8 i n d e x 3 β d β reg β reg d 1 n β α sd f 9 i n d e x 4 γ d γ reg γ reg d 1 n γ e v e n t r a t i o α 10 i n d e x 5 p d p target p target d 1 n where reg represents the values of the regressed statistical properties of the sub daily data of the target day sd d is the standard deviation of the training sub daily precipitation of dth day p d h h 1 24 sd f is the standard deviation of the fragment vector of the training sub daily precipitation on the dth day f d event ratio is the ratio of the number of hourly time steps the precipitation values are greater than zero in a day to the total number of values in a day i e 24 p target is the total daily precipitation of the target day pd is the total daily precipitation of the dth day of the training dataset the computed indices are used to populate a payoff matrix m with the number of days present in the training data n as the number of rows and the number of indices k as the number of columns 2 3 3 weightage allocation weights are allocated for the aforementioned normalized indices using criteria importance and through intercriteria correlation critic method xie et al 2022 yan et al 2021 and combined into a single measure by employing compromise programming in this study the critic method has been chosen over other weightage allocation methods such as the entropy method because of its ability to account for inter criteria correlation anil et al 2021 diakoulaki et al 1995 the payoff matrix m is transformed into the interval 0 1 and the elements in the transformed matrix c are determined using eq 11 11 c dk m dk m k m k m k where m k m k represents the minimum and maximum values of the kth index respectively m dk denotes the value of the k th index of d th training day note that as normalized error indices are used in the payoff matrix the ideal m k and anti ideal m k values will be equal to least and highest value k th column of payoff matrix m respectively variability of each index is captured by computing the standard deviation of each column σ k of matrix c a symmetric matrix of size k k with element r kl is formulated where the value of r kl represents the linear correlation coefficient between kth column and lth column of matrix c the quantity of information q k in relation to each index is calculated using the eq 12 ruan et al 2021 if the inter criteria correlation r kl is high the quantity of information will be low and lower weightage will be allocated to those criteria 12 q k σ k l 1 k 1 r kl the weights of the indices w k are determined using eq 13 13 w k q k k 1 k q k 2 3 4 ranking of fragments using compromise programming compromise programming ranks the alternatives by compounding the indices into a single lp metric value a measure of proximity to the ideal solution raju et al 2017 the alternatives in this case are the fragments of sub daily precipitation data of each day of the training period the equation to compute the lp metric value is given in eq 14 14 l p d k 1 k w k 2 m k m dk 2 1 2 where m k is the minimum value of the kth normalized index m dk denotes the k th index of d th training day and wk is the weight allocated to the kth index obtained from critic method at the end of this step n number of lp values are generated where n is the total number of days in the training dataset the obtained lp values are used as the distance criterion in pm mof since the proposed methodology identifies the best precipitation patterns fragments relative to the criteria from the training data the methodology is named pattern mapping 2 4 comparison disaggregation methods the efficacy of the proposed disaggregation method is compared against two other widely used stochastic disaggregation methods modified bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model performed using the computer program called hyetos and micro canonical cascade mcc models the three methods knn mof hyetos and mcc were particularly chosen for comparison for the following reasons i they have varying model structures i e hyetos is based on the poison point process mcc is based on the theory of scale invariance and the mof methods are based on observed rainfall fractions ii they are widely used for disaggregation of precipitation across different parts of the world an r package called hyetosminute kossieris et al 2016 has been employed to disaggregate daily precipitation using the blrp method a python package called melodist förster et al 2016 has been used to disaggregate daily precipitation using the micro canonical cascade method since the chosen comparison disaggregation methods are stochastic in nature 100 realizations were simulated in order to account the stochasticity a brief description of these disaggregation methods is given below 2 4 1 hyetos the modified bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model is used as another disaggregation method by employing an r package called hyetosminute kossieris et al 2016 in the mblrp model rainfall sequences are portrayed as a series of storm events described by rain cells consisting of a set of random variables represented by different distributions the original blrp model is parameterized using five random variables λ β rblm γ η μ x rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 the cell clusters storms at the first level are simulated following a poisson process with a cluster generation rate λ and the expected value of exponentially distributed storm generation duration is 1 γ β rblm denotes arrival time of the rain cell within the duration of poisson distributed storm activity the duration of each rain cell s contribution is considered to be exponentially distributed with expectation 1 η the average precipitation intensity associated with each cell is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean µx in the mblrp model gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters is used instead of the exponential distribution for better representation of dry wet spell properties kim et al 2013 rodriquez iturbe et al 1988 the parameters of the mblrp model are estimated using the evolutionary annealing simplex eas algorithm kossieris et al 2018 the objective function is formulated by computing the error between the statistical properties of observed and simulated rainfall such as mean variance autocorrelation and proportion of dry spells for 1 3 12 and 24 h levels of accumulation kim et al 2017 clusters of wet days are separated with least one dry day between the sequence of wet days the disaggregation is performed for these clusters of wet days for each cluster the match between simulated daily depths obtained from the hourly simulations and the sequence of observed daily values is assessed using a tolerance distance ds the model would run repeatedly until the maximum number of repetitions is achieved or else it generates a sequence with tolerance distance within a permissible limit in the hyetos model the predetermined maximum tolerance distance ds is defined as given in eq 15 15 ds i 1 l ln 2 p i c p i c 1 2 where p i and p i are the observed and simulated daily precipitation depths in a cluster of wet days respectively l represents the length of sequence of wet days c is a constant in the formulation of ds the logarithmic transformation helps reduce bias towards the extreme values and the constant c value is used as 0 1 in order to reduce the bias due to very low values the bias between observed and simulated daily rainfall depths is addressed using a repetitive scheme with proportional adjustment in this study the value of ds is set to 0 1 to avoid unacceptable bias and the maximum number of total repetitions is set as 5000 2 4 2 mcc olsson 1998 introduced the principle of a multiplicative micro canonical cascade model for temporal disaggregation of rainfall the disaggregation is performed assuming doubling of temporal resolution for each step i e the coarser resolution data is split into b finer time steps of equal duration where b is the branching number set to 2 müller and haberlandt 2018 the procedure is applied iteratively until the desired temporal resolution is achieved splitting of precipitation volume at higher cascade level is performed using the weights w1 and w2 that sum to unity to preserve the volume exactly three possible combinations of w1 and w2 in the cascade generator are given in eq 16 16 w 1 w 2 0 a n d 1 w i t h p 0 1 1 a n d 0 w i t h p 1 0 x a n d 1 x w i t h p x 1 x 0 x 1 where p represents the probability of each combination of weights p 0 1 indicates that no precipitation volume assigned to the first time step w1 and entire volume is allocated to the second time step a contrasting scenario of splitting is performed when the probability is p 1 0 in the third case the precipitation volume could be allocated to both time steps with a x 1 x splitting with being the fraction defined as 0 x 1 in the mcc model the cascade generator is a function of scale weights are scale dependent preserving the mass exactly in disaggregation güntner et al 2001 rupp et al 2009 in cascade based disaggregation of precipitation the position of a time step is defined based on wetness state of neighbouring time steps four types of positions starting enclosed isolated and ending and two volume classes are used where the lower and upper volume classes are separated by the mean rainfall volume of each position considering as a random variable for all disaggregation steps a probability density function f x with the empirical probabilities for each value of is estimated to account the dependency of the scaling properties on the external precipitation pattern förster et al 2016 müller and haberlandt 2018 in this method the daily values are disaggregated in time steps of halves 24 hr 12 hr 6 hr 3 hr 1 5 hr 0 75 hr consequently a time series in steps of 45 min can be equally distributed to a 15 minute time series and then again reaggregated to obtain a time series of 1 h intervals 2 5 evaluation of disaggregation methodologies the validation of the proposed disaggregation methodology along with comparison methods emphasizes on the evaluation of disaggregated sub daily data in reproducing five aspects of observed data these are i standard validation statistics such as mean standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and proportion of wet events ii within day statistical properties such as daily maximum intensities and daily variance iii intensity durationfrequency curves for different durations iv ability to match the probability density function pdf of observed hourly precipitation time series 3 study area and data forty years 1980 2019 of hourly precipitation values acquired from the fifth generation reanalysis product from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf known as era5 reanalysis data are used as reference data in this study due to the scarcity of long term continuous observed precipitation time series across the world era5 is available at a horizontal resolution of 31 km at hourly time intervals hersbach and dee 2016 the era5 reanalysis products were found to be performing well in hydrological modelling tarek et al 2020 and also in representing the historical climate variability gleixner et al 2020 two years 1980 1981 of data have been used as training data in order to test the efficacy of each disaggregation method trained with a small sample thirty years 1990 2019 of hourly data has been cumulated to daily values and then disaggregated for validation hourly precipitation time series from fourteen locations shown in fig 3 spread across the globe were taken in this study that represents different climatic zones the locations were chosen such that they cover all the major climatological as defined by koppen classification zones across the globe the details about the chosen locations are provided in table s1 4 results in this section the pattern mapping based mof is referred as pm mof knn based mof is referred as knn mof bartlett lewis rectangular pulse is referred as hyetos and micro canonical cascade model is referred as mcc 4 1 standard validation statistics the ability of disaggregated precipitation time series in reproducing standard statistical measures of observed data such as mean standard deviation lag 1 autocorrelation and proportion of wet spells is important to evaluate the performance of rainfall disaggregation methodologies the percentage errors between the statistical properties of the reference and disaggregated data are computed and presented in table 1 note that for stochastic disaggregation methods the median value of percentage errors computed for 100 realizations is given in table 1 pm mof knn mof and micro canonical cascade models perform well at reproducing the mean at all the locations this is attributable to their ability to preserve the daily total precipitation the mean values of hyetos disaggregated precipitation time series are slightly lower than that of observed mean precipitation at e f h i l and n this is plausibly due to the methodology of hyetos that disaggregates clusters of wet days contrasting to other methods which disaggregate individual wet days the performance of pattern mapping in reproducing the observed variance presented in terms of standard deviation is found to be satisfactory at all locations except at b c and d but it slightly underestimates the variance at all locations the variance of knn mof disaggregated precipitation is overestimated 10 at most of the locations since knn mof resamples the fragments based on the similarity between target and training precipitation depths the overestimation of variance indicates that the diurnal distribution characteristics resampled from the training data are altered in the target precipitation data moreover the stochastic resampling using the k nearest neighbour method might lead to resampling of unsuitable fragments especially from within a limited training sample however pm mof considers sd as the criterion for selection of fragments and thus resulting in better performance when compared to knn mof this result indicates that inclusion of multiple criteria for the selection of fragments in training data positively correlates with the accuracy of disaggregation the performance of hyetos disaggregated data is satisfactory at most of the locations but there is a considerable absolute deviation 10 between simulated and observed variance at locations b c d g and i the variance of mcc based disaggregated precipitation has been overestimated at most of the locations the lag 1 autocorrelation is a measure of the relationship between two consecutive precipitation events the performance of both pm mof and knn mof disaggregated data is considerably good in reproducing the lag 1 autocorrelation with pm mof having a slight edge over knn mof refer to table 1 the performance of hyetos and mcc disaggregated data are not up to par at most of the locations whereas the hyetos overestimates lag 1 autocorrelation and the mcc underestimates the lag 1 autocorrelation at most of the locations wetness proportion indicates the ratio of the number of wet events with precipitation values exceeding zero in a time series to the total number of time steps both pm mof and knn mof disaggregated data are reasonably good in reproducing the observed wetness proportions see table 1 this is due to the fact that resampling methods use realistic precipitation patterns to disaggregate precipitation the performance of hyetos and mcc disaggregated data is poor since hyetos tends to underestimate the wetness proportions and the mcc method tends to overestimate it at most of the locations 4 2 within day statistics the standard statistical measures give an outline of the overall performance of the time series but the reproduction of within day statistical features such as daily maximum intensity and standard deviation plays an important role in preserving the extreme values hence the performance of the disaggregated time series is evaluated with the root mean square error rmse eq 17 between the reference and modelled daily standard deviation and daily maximum intensity maximum value out of 24 values in a day 17 rmse t 1 t p s t p o t 2 t where p s t p o t represents the daily standard deviation daily maximum intensity of disaggregated and reference precipitation at time step t and t represents the total number of days the rmse computed between observed and disaggregated daily maximum intensities for all the locations is presented in fig 4 which shows that the deterministic version of pm mof outperforms the remaining three methods in simulating the maximum daily intensities the stochastic version of pm mof performs well at locations b f g h j k m and n the methodological development introduced in the selection of fragments in the pm mof method helps to select the best fragment relative to the employed criteria for disaggregation it can be observed that the variability of rmse computed for 100 realizations of pm mof knn mof and mcc disaggregated time series are comparatively lower than that of hyetos disaggregated realizations the performance of stochastic disaggregation methods is reasonably good at most of the locations except at locations b and c the rmse computed between observed and disaggregated diurnal variances at all the locations is presented in fig 5 the results are similar to that of daily maximum intensities with pm mof outperforming other methods 4 3 performance in terms of replicating observed intensity duration frequency relationships intensity duration frequency curves are used to assess the ability of models to capture the distribution of extremes hence intensity frequency curves were generated from the maximum intensity of each year for 1 3 6 and 12 h duration the intensity frequency curves were generated based on the empirical cumulative distribution of the observed and disaggregated precipitation time series in this method annual maximum precipitation is sorted in descending order and ranked accordingly and the probability of exceedance is calculated using weibull s plotting position formula eq 18 18 p m n 1 where p is probability of exceedance m is the rank of event n is the total number of events the observed intensity frequency curves for annual maxima of reference and disaggregated time series for 1 and 3 hr durations are plotted in figs 6 and 7 from fig 6 it is noticed that the performance of pm mof is satisfactory at more than half of the locations in comparison to knn mof and mcc the performance of pm mof in matching the observed intensity frequency curve at locations b m and n is not satisfactory along with other disaggregation methods it can be noticed that knn mof is overestimating the intensities at lower probabilities of exceedances at most of the locations mcc is overestimating the intensities at all locations except at location l for all probability of exceedances it can also be observed that the overall uncertainty in the intensity frequency curves generated hyetos is found to be higher than other methods moreover the median of hyetos is underestimating the intensities at most of the locations the intensity frequency curves for 3 hr duration fig 7 show that the overestimation of mcc disaggregated data has slightly decreased in comparison to the intensity frequency curve for 1 hr duration however the performance of the remaining three models is similar at most of the locations intensity frequency curves at higher duration levels of 6 hr and 12 hrs figures s1 and s2 for all four models are equally performing well at all locations from these results it can be inferred that pm mof and knn mof are performing well at reproducing the return levels for all durations the performance of knn mof and mcc improved in simulating intensities for 6 hr and 12 hr duration 4 4 performance in terms of matching the observed pdf the ability of the disaggregation methods in replicating the observed probability density function pdf is assessed by computing the skill score skill score measures the degree of similarity between the observed and simulated pdfs by measuring the common area between them anandhi and nanjundiah 2015 manikanta and vema 2022 a skill score of one indicates an exact overlap of the pdf of observed and disaggregated data the equation of skill score is given in eq 19 19 skillscore i 1 nb m i n f p f o t where t represents the number of data points f p f o represent the frequencies of disaggregated and observed values of precipitation at a given bin nb represent the total number of bins chosen to analyze the match between observed and simulated pdfs in this analysis a bin size of 0 01 mm was adopted to assess the frequency characteristics of observed and simulated precipitation the skill score of observed versus disaggregated values at all locations is plotted in fig 8 from the figure it is evident that the proposed method pm is performing well in comparison to hyetos and mcc in matching the distribution of characteristics of observed precipitation values at all the locations with a skill score value greater than 0 9 except at locations c and d the performance of knn mof and mcc disaggregated data in terms of skill score is reasonably good in most of the locations except at locations c d and h the performance of hyetos is comparatively poorer than other disaggregation methods in terms of skill score at most of the locations the median skill score of pm mof across all locations is 0 97 which is comparatively greater than the median skill score of other disaggregated datasets 0 94 for knn mof 0 83 for hyetos and 0 85 for mcc suggesting the efficacy of the proposed method in reproducing the observed pdf 4 5 sensitivity analysis of indices used in pm mof since the novelty of this study was the introduction of multiple indices in the domain of temporal disaggregation an experiment to understand the sensitivity of performance of pm mof against the indices eq 6 to 10 is performed for this purpose the performance of the original pm is compared with pm by excluding one index at a time by computing the rmse for daily maximum intensities and daily standard deviation fig 9 the results denote that the rmse value of the proposed pm mof is lower than the pm mof without indices in most of the cases indicating that the indices contribute well to the better performance of proposed pm the sensitivity of index 4 in terms of performance of pm found to be lower when compared to other indices however it was observed that the sensitivity is found to be increasing with an increase in the duration of training period refer to figures s3 and s4 4 6 performance of pm and knn based mof with varying lengths of training data the pm mof approach makes methodological advances on the knn mof method therefore a set of experiments were designed to check the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison to knn one of the primary influencing factors for the two resampling methods is the length of training data available hence it is important to know the influence of length of training dataset on the performance of two resampling methods hence an experiment is performed with knn mof and pm mof with varying lengths of training data for this purpose three training samples with lengths of 2 5 and 10 years were used the performance of knn mof and pm mof is compared in terms of rmse of daily maximum intensities and diurnal variances see fig 10 from fig 10 it can be noticed the performance of pm based mof is comparatively better than knn based mof in simulating daily maximum intensities at most of the locations even with small sample of training data 2 years it can also be observed that the performance of pm is improving with increasing length of training data this improvement is plausibly due to the employed linear regression based error indices used in pm these indices might help in selecting the best fragment relative to the criteria and thereby leading to improved disaggregation 5 summary and conclusions sub daily precipitation data while important for hydrological applications like idf curves urban drainage etc is scantily available due to resource constraints hence researchers have proposed multiple methods of disaggregation of daily data to sub daily scales using various approaches mof is one of the widely accepted disaggregated methods and has been applied with selection techniques like knn and knn ga however such methods depend on a single criterion for the selection of the fragment from the training data therefore to improve upon the performance of the selection criterion we have introduced multi criteria decision into precipitation disaggregation in this study the new method is named pattern mapping wherein normalized indices between the statistical properties of the target day and training dataset are processed through compromise programming to select a fragment from the training data the robustness of the new method is tested across various locations representing diverse climatic conditions the efficacy of the proposed method has been evaluated by comparing it with three commonly used disaggregation methods namely knn mof hyetos and mcc moreover as this study is a methodological advancement over existing mof methods control experiments are carried out to assess the distinctive contribution of the mcdm approach in the disaggregation of precipitation results show that pm mof performed well in all the climate zones arid warm temperate equatorial coastal and inland while it was also observed that the performance of the models did not have any correlation with any particular climatic zone sub daily data generated from pm mof was found to be satisfactory in matching the standard statistical measures such as mean variance lag 1 autocorrelation and wetness proportions of the observed dataset it is seen that the pm mof method has a considerably lower percentage error 50 2 to 50 3 for stochastic pm mof and 7 4 to 13 2 for deterministic pm mof see table 1 and table s2 in comparison to the existing methods mof 65 4 to 76 2 hyetos 78 3 to 69 4 and mcc 63 1 to 72 pm mof has outperformed other disaggregation methods in reproducing the within day statistics such as daily maximum intensities and diurnal variance the performance of pm mof in terms of reproducing intensity frequency curves for 1 hr and 3 hr durations is found to be satisfactory when compared to other disaggregation methods the performance of the disaggregated datasets in reproducing the observed pdf has been analyzed in terms of skill score it was found that the pm mof and mof datasets are performing better than hyetos and mcc datasets with pm mof performing slightly better than mof the results are in line with the findings of pui et al 2012 suggesting the better performance of nonparametric methods pm mof and knn mof over their parametric counterparts hyetos and mcc the control experiments with introduction of stochasticity and levelling the temporal window for training data showed that pm mof performs better than currently used mof methods consequently the improvement in results can be deterministically attributed to the improvement in methodology proposed in the paper it is important to note that both hyetos and mcc are parametrized by making assumptions about the distribution of precipitation while these parametric models can disaggregate precipitation over a range of temporal scales they require long term observed sub daily data for reliable calibration of the model parameters and are also computationally expensive molnar and burlando 2005 pui et al 2012 yusop et al 2014 in contrast the resampling based disaggregation models both pm mof and knn mof generate sub daily data by utilizing the observed diurnal precipitation patterns accordingly the performance of both pm mof and knn mof is constrained by the duration and quality of the training data moreover none of the methods discussed above is designed to conserve the statistical properties of the sub daily precipitation for any given target day resulting in skewed intra day precipitation patterns for instance to disaggregate a target daily precipitation of 100 mm which has actually occurred in 3 sub daily events knn might select the nearest precipitation value in the training dataset which is 40 mm which has actually occurred in 1 sub daily event this results in the distribution of 100 mm daily precipitation in just one hour of the disaggregated target day in the case of pm instead selecting the nearest neighbour based on the similarity between target and training daily precipitation depths alone it considers the relationships between sub daily statistical features and daily precipitation for resampling the best suitable fragments the linear relationships established between sub daily statistical features and daily precipitation in the training period help us to estimate the sub daily statistical features of target daily precipitation step 2 in section 2 1 the error indices computed between the sub daily statistical features of each individual training day and the estimated sub daily statistical features of the target day are used to select the best fragment relative to the criteria through multi criteria decision making steps 3 to 5 in section 2 1 this helps us to choose a fragment with 35 mm of daily precipitation which has actually occurred in 3 events resulting in better disaggregation of target daily precipitation and preservation of target day statistical properties the results show that pm mof is performing well in comparison to other methods even when trained with small samples two years and the skill of pm mof is increasing with increasing length of training data the encouraging results show the validity of the established relations between sub daily statistical features and daily cumulative precipitation which are used for selection of fragments in the methodology of pm this suggests that pm mof can be further used to disaggregate the future daily precipitation values obtained from the climate models along with this the applicability of the proposed method in spatial disaggregation and disaggregation of weather variables such as temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation is reserved for future research in summary the proposed disaggregation algorithm named pattern mapping is a robust method for simulating sub daily precipitation values the proposed disaggregation method is expected to assist hydro climatologists for various applications in engineering and water resources research the developed method can be used for the application of urban hydrology where the time of concentration typically ranges between a few minutes to a few hours integration of the proposed disaggregation methodology with a statistical downscaling model is helpful in the assessment of the changes in the frequency and occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the present and future climate scenarios the accurate estimation of precipitation extremes assists the policymakers in the design of resilient and sustainable urban infrastructure and also helps in reconsideration of existing urban systems the rainfall intensity obtained from the disaggregated precipitation time series can also be used to accurately estimate sediment and pollutant loads credit authorship contribution statement velpuri manikanta conceptualization methodology

two critical hydrophysiological responses of plants to drought stress however few studies have been developed to quantify their interactions to fill this gap we developed a soil plant hydraulic model sr hrv that attempts to characterize the effects of stomatal regulation and three universal soil root hydraulic resistance variations i e root aquaporins promotion aqu apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact the sensitive parameters of the sr hrv model were analyzed and optimized based on a field experiment with sunflower plants helianthus annuus l several simulation scenarios were designed to clarify the individual and interactive effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations for plants with different stomatal sensitivities results show that the sensitivity of simulated stomatal conductance and soil water content response to stomatal regulation parameters especially to abscisic acid related parameters are more active than to soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters but as the soil dries the sensitivities to apd and contact parameters are rapidly increased the simulation demonstrates that aqp alleviates the leaf water potential drop down and maintains relatively high root water absorption of the plant when it is in mild drought conditions while contact and apd respectively restrict the water flux and drought signal responses with continuous soil dehydration moreover the aqp effects are more pronounced but the effects of apd and contact would be restricted for plants with higher stomatal sensitivity to drought signals these simulation results imply the diverse response strategies of plants to drought the collaborations between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations should be

soil plant hydraulic model developed in this study swc soil volumetric water content swc50 soil volumetric water content at a 50 cm soil depth 1 introduction as a primary physiological process accompanying photosynthesis plant transpiration plays an essential role in the terrestrial hydrological cycle evaristo et al 2015 precisely quantifying plant transpiration is a significant prerequisite for a number of applications including climate prediction water resource management and crop yield estimation lian et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however owing to the difficulty of estimating stomatal conductance and other complex plant hydrophysiological responses to environmental stresses transpiration estimation suffers from large uncertainty the range of predicted transpiration is spanning 20 65 of terrestrial evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 vereecken et al 2015 the radial hydraulic resistances from the rhizosphere the soils surrounding the root surface to the root xylem are known as the primary constraints on water transport during a drought event carminati and javaux 2020 specifically besides being restricted by the hydraulic status in the bulk soil the radial water flow is also affected by the hydraulic conductivity at the soil root interface and in root tissue effective root soil contact is a premise for the continuity of root water absorption in the rhizosphere but with soil dehydration air gaps would emerge at the soil root interface which restricts the water movement from soil to root advances in noninvasive imaging techniques in soil science and plant physiology such as high resolution x ray computer tomography have allowed observing the appearance of root soil contact loosening contact air gap formation in drought conditions carminati et al 2013 koebernick et al 2018 then when water moves through the soil root interface the varying permeability of root tissues and anatomical structures offer three water paths toward xylem vessels couvreur et al 2018 zarebanadkouki et al 2019 i e the symplastic path via plasmodesmata across neighboring cells the transcellular path cross membranes of neighboring cells and the apoplastic path through intercell space and root wall in the first two cell to cell paths aquaporins such as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pips and tonoplast intrinsic proteins tips play a vital gating role in water molecule transportation maurel et al 2015 however drought stress usually affects the activity of aquaporins by changing hormonal regulation and gene expression boursiac et al 2005 perrone et al 2012 regarding the tortuous radial flow channels in the apoplastic path constructed by apoplastic suberization and casparian strips these anatomical structures are prone to be destroyed with continuous root dehydration north and nobel 1992 barrios masias et al 2015 the abovementioned structural and physiological changes along the soil root radial water path affect the hydraulic resistance of the root zone many studies have explored the qualitative impacts of soil root hydraulic resistance variation on soil plant water transport sade et al 2009 and vandeleur et al 2009 reported the enhancement of root aquaporin activity of solanum lycopersicum and vitis vinifera in drought conditions which allows plants to maintain high transpiration and prevents leaf water potential drop down carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 observed air gap formation at the soil root interface following transpiration decrease in lupinus albus l and vicia faba l rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 detected an alleviation of hydraulic gradient enlargement in the rhizosphere of olives olea europaea l as a result of immediate stomatal closure although these phenomena confirmed the influences of soil root hydraulic resistance variations on the soil plant hydraulic system only a few simulation studies like cai et al 2018 and nguyen et al 2020 considered the variations of root or plant hydraulic resistances when plants in a drought situation the hydraulic resistance of the root system is generally assumed to be independent of the soil root water status in most modeling applications the conditions for the applicability of such an assumption and the related potential uncertainties in soil plant water transport modeling are still poorly determined additionally in a drought situation the influencing factors of soil root hydraulic resistance such as root aquaporin activity and soil root contact respond simultaneously rather than independently other than the study by couvreur et al 2014b few quantitative studies have described the effects of interactions between different soil root hydraulic resistance variations on soil plant water transport more than relying on hydraulic traits of belowground including water potential hydraulic resistance and water flux in the soil root system water transport in the soil plant continuum is regulated by the stomatal behavior of plants tardieu et al 2017 carminati and javaux 2020 nguyen et al 2020 according to dixon and joly 1895 the rhizosphere hydraulic status interacts with the stomatal behavior via the cohesion tension mechanism to avoid vascular embolism and desiccation plants regulate their stomatal aperture to maintain the water balance between transpiration demand and the water supply capacity of the hydraulic system martin stpaul et al 2017 intuitively a lower leaf water potential stimulates stomatal closure through changes in the turgor of the guard cell several sources of evidence suggest that chemical compounds such as abscisic acid aba also participate in stomatal regulation as shown in fig 1 b dodd et al 2010 visentin et al 2016 according to the common definition of tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 1998 two types of stomatal regulation strategies can be recognized isohydric and anisohydric compared with those of isohydric plants the stomata of anisohydric plants are insensitive to hydraulic signals therefore the corresponding leaf water potential is usually prone to decrease with soil water depletion however recently this dichotomy was challenged because it failed to describe different iso anisohydric behavior for the same species schultz 2003 feng et al 2019 hochberg et al 2018 and ratzmann et al 2019 argued that the classification of iso anisohydry not only depends on the hydraulic properties of plants but also correlates with environmental conditions noteworthy carminati and javaux 2020 using a hydraulic model demonstrated the dominant influences of soil hydraulic conductivity loss on stomatal closure this result implies that the soil root zone is a key region to alter the stomatal behavior in drought conditions however few simulation studies have focused on the interactions of soil root hydraulic resistance variation and stomatal regulation especially for plants with different stomatal sensitivities root water uptake rwu modeling is a promising tool for simulating hydraulic interactions between the rhizosphere and aboveground parts of plants javaux et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 in physical based rwu models the principle of microscopic water flow from soil to root can be analogously described by ohm law gardner 1960 first described rwu as a function of the water potential gradient and hydraulic resistances between the rhizosphere and root surface since then several microscopic physical rwu models have been proposed and are intended to describe the complex geometrical and morphological characteristics of the soil root system cowan 1965 clausnitzer and hopmans 1994 doussan et al 1998 javaux et al 2008 schröder et al 2009 however microscopic models are cumbersome to use at the field or larger scales due to the high data demands and computational costs thus upscaling of rwu models to the macroscopic scale is urgently needed from a practical perspective couvreur et al 2012 dos santos et al 2017 de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 avoided developing a model based on the complex hydraulic architecture of the root system they scaled up the single root model using mass balance theory and introduced a concept of matric flux potential to represent soil plant hydraulic properties the water flux from the soil to the root surface the root xylem and the leaf are systematically simulated in this model however for the purpose of simplification macroscopic rwu models including the models of de jong van lier et al 2008 jong van lier et al 2013 and couvreur et al 2012 couvreur et al 2014a typically assume a constant critical potential threshold at the leaf or root collar to determine the root water absorption capacity when plants are suffering drought stress this assumption is typically reasonable for plants with more isohydric behavior but for anisohydric plants their leaf water potential usually presents strong plasticity to drought stress the usage of a constant threshold might not reflect the stomatal response to drought signal stimulations huber et al 2015 tardieu et al 2015 to address these issues a macroscopic water transport model sr hrv was proposed in this study in the sr hrv model the soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects of root aquaporins promotion aqp apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact were respectively characterized by piecewise linear functions and the collaborative regulations of hydraulic and chemical aba signals on stomatal conductance gs were quantified moreover the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the sr hrv model were carried out based on a field experiment with sunflower plants helianthus annuus l the numerical experiments of plant dehydration were designed with different soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal sensitivities the objectives of this study are to 1 determine and calibrate the sensitive parameters of the sr hrv model 2 clarify the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact on water transport and 3 identify the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations on transpiration and drought signal responses for plants with different stomatal sensitivities to hydraulic and chemical signals 2 theory 2 1 modeling water transport

modeling water flow from the soil to root xylem by the matric flux approach to avoid numerical instability in the rwu simulation caused by the steep water gradient and flow line convergence near the roots de jong van lier et al 2006 introduced a convenient expression of matric flux potential m l2 t which is defined as an integral of hydraulic conductivity k h l t 1 from the permanent wilting point hw l to the current potential h l in soil or plant tissue 3 m h w h k h d h the root system is simplified as vertically cylindrical roots with the same diameter according to de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 fig 2 a for a single root as shown in fig 2b the function of axisymmetric radial flow from the soil to the root surface and root xylem is written as 4 θ t q r q r where q l t 1 is the radial flux density r l is the radial distance from the root center based on darcy s equation and assuming the gravitational gradients are irrelevant to the problem q is described as 5 q k h r m r combining eq 4 and eq 5 the radial water flow is translated into the following second order differential equation 6 θ t m r r 2 m r the solution of eq 6 can be divided into two processes water flows from the rhizosphere to the root surface and water flows from the root surface to the root xylem for the soil surrounding the root de jong van lier et al 2008 developed an expression for root water uptake s z per unit thickness of the root zone at depth z 7 s z ρ z m s z m 0 s z where m0s z l2 t 1 and m0 z l2 t 1 represent the matric flux potential at the two boundaries of the rhizosphere one boundary is bulk soil another is root surface as shown in fig 2b at depth z ρ z l 2 is an integrated variable of root properties at depth z can be calculated by 8 ρ z 4 r 0 2 a s 2 r m 2 z 2 r m 2 z r 0 2 ln a s r m z r 0 where r0 l is the radius of root surface the distance to root center αs represents the relative radial distance where the water content is equal to the mean soil water content swc of the rhizosphere r0 and αs are assumed to be 0 5 mm and 0 53 in analogy to de jong van lier et al 2008 rm z l is the radial radius of the rwu given by 9 r m z 1 π r l d z where rld z cm cm 3 is the root length density at depth z by assuming that the water content is constant within the root phloem between the root surface and xylem de jong van lier et al 2013 the matric flux potential relationship between the root surface and xylem can be established by solving eq 6 10 m 0 r z m x z s z 2 r m 2 z ln r 0 r x where m0r z is the matric flux potential of the root surface based on the root radial hydraulic conductivity krr l t 1 mx z l2 t 1 is the matric flux potential of the root xylem at depth z the root xylem resistance is ignored thus mx is related to the water potential in the root collar hcollar l rx l is the xylem radius at depth z which is assumed to be 0 2 mm analogous to de jong van lier et al 2013 2 1 3 leaf water potential and stomatal aperture

according to 11 h collar h l t a l sx considering the responses of stomatal conductance gs n l 2 t 1 to drought signals tardieu et al 1996 proposed a model in which gs is controlled by the aba concentration in the leaf xylem caba n l 3 and the leaf water status at a leaf plant scale 12 g s g s m i n α exp c aba β exp δ h l where gs min n l 2 t 1 is the minimum stomatal conductance resulting from the cuticular conductance and the conductance through closed stomata α n l 2 t 1 β n 1 l3 and δ l 1 are the influential factors on stomatal regulation gs min α represents the maximum stomatal conductance by assuming that caba is close to 0 and hl is very high which can be used to calculate the potential transpiration of plants β and δ represent stomatal sensitivity to drought signals the greater absolute β and δ indicate the greater stomatal sensitivity to caba and hl respectively according to tardieu et al 1996 caba has a linear response to root water potential and is diluted by water flux through the plant however aba is synthesized not only in roots but also in shoots leaves kuromori et al 2018 recent studies according to mcadam et al 2016 mcadam et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and kuromori et al 2021 etc indicate that phloem companion cells guard cells especially mesophyll cells of leaves might be the potential main site of aba synthesizing in the plant moreover several root to shoot signals such as cle25 peptide and redox calcium have been found that regulate the aba synthesis and stomatal responses in leaves takahashi et al 2018 yoshida and fernie 2018 in this study considering the synthetic effects of the shoot and root hydraulic states on aba synthesis we simulated the caba using the average water potential in the plant hplant l 13 c aba z a h plant c t a m b where a n t 1 l 1 b l3 t 1 and c l are fitting parameters and m plants l 2 is the plant density used for transferring ta from the field scale l3 l 3 t 1 to the plant scale l2 t 1 in this study m equal to 4 plants m 2 regarding hplant we assumed it is equal to the average water potentials in the leaf and root the root water potential indicates the average water potentials in the root surface and xylem across the whole root system at the field scale plant transpiration ta can be calculated based on the stomatal conductance at the canopy scale which is estimated by upscaling gs through weighting by the effective leaf area index laieff based on big leaf theory ding et al 2014 14 t a s ϕ n ρ a c p g a d λ s γ g a g s l a i eff where s ml 1t 2k 1 is the slope of the curve representing

bastiaanssen et al 2012 15 la i eff lai 0 3 l a i 1 2 with meteorological data leaf area index plant height and gs the plant transpiration can be calculated at the field scale based on the penman monteith direct equation in the swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes et al 2017 2 2 hydraulic resistance responses of the soil root system in water limited conditions 2 2 1 hydraulic conductivity reduction in the rhizosphere due to contact the hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere is critical for plant water use efficiency however in drought conditions the root surface detaches from the soil accompanied by the root cells begin to shrink and reduce the secretion of hydrophilic substances carminati et al 2013 observed an air gap that appears along with the taproot when hs ranged from 0 005 to 0 01 mpa and extended to 0 35 mm when hs decreased below 0 04 mpa koebernick et al 2018 found that the root soil contact of the taproot and lateral roots of vicia faba l significantly decreased when the hs decreased below 0 02 mpa once an air gap is formed the hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere is extremely limited because water transport mainly relies on gas diffusion liu et al 2015 detected an increasing air gap width with hs decreasing which increased the hydraulic resistance at the root soil interface for robinia pseudoacacia few simulations had quantified the effects of air gap formation on root soil interface hydraulic resistance and root water uptake liu et al 2015 de willigen et al 2018 however complex model structures and numerous parameters were introduced in these simulations in this study to limit model complexity based on the changing trend of the quantitative relationship between water potential and hydraulic conductivity in the rhizosphere similar to couvreur et al 2014b we used a piecewise linear function to describe the effects of contact 16 k s r α contact s r k soil 17 α contact s r 1 h s r h sr 1 1 h s r h sr 1 h sr 2 h sr 1 h sr 2 h s r h sr 1 0 h s r h sr 2 where the hydraulic conductivity in the rhizosphere ks r l t 1 is modified as a function of αcontact s r αcontact s r is correlated with the water potential in the rhizosphere hs r l here hsr 1 l and hsr 2 l are the two thresholds of water potential in the rhizosphere ks r is equal to the hydraulic conductivity in bulk soil ksoil without considering the contact effects however once contact occurs ks r linearly decreases when hs r is lower than hsr 1 and ks r decreases to 0 when hs r drops to hsr 2 the matric flux potentials in the boundaries of the rhizosphere eq 7 were modified by ks r in the bulk soil and root surface 2 2 2 variations in root radial conductivity due to aqp and apd the root radial conductivity krr l t 1 regulates the water flow from the root surface to the xylem which has been experimentally found to be much lower than the soil conductivity in wet soil soil water potential above 0 1 0 01 mpa draye et al 2010 the permeability of plasma membranes determines the hydraulic resistance in the transcellular and symplastic radial pathways while it is reversibly regulated by the activity of aquaporins many pieces of evidence show that aquaporins play significant roles in the response to environmental stimuli pawlowicz and masajada 2019 but inconsistent impacts of aquaporins response on root radial conductivity have been found in a variety of plants boursiac et al 2005 zhao et al 2008 perrone et al 2012 might be mediated by aba plants can enhance their root extraction capacity when suffering slight drought stress quintero et al 1999 hose et al 2000 hachez et al 2012 pawlowicz and masajada 2019 glinka 1980 and quintero et al 1999 found that the root hydraulic conductivity of sunflower increased by 150 250 when supplied with a 4 μm external aba solution in this study similar to couvreur et al 2014b we adopted a multiplicative factor αaqp to quantify the promotion effects of aqp on krr which is linearly correlated with the water potential in root tissue hroot expressed as 18 α aqp 1 h root h root 1 1 h root h root 1 h root 3 h root 1 r h root 3 h root h root 1 1 r h root h root 3 where hroot l is assumed to be the average water potential of the root surface and xylem at a specific depth hroot 1 l and hroot 3 l are two thresholds of water potential in the root tissue r is the maximum promotion factor of krr due to the aqp effects krr linearly increases starting at hroot hroot 1 and increases up to 1 r times krr when hroot hroot 3 different from couvreur et al 2014b we selected hroot rather than hs as the influential factor to quantify the promotion of krr which could better reflect the hydraulic status in roots especially when a large water potential gradient exists between soil and roots in addition to the cell to cell pathway apoplastic transport is another important radial water pathway in root tissue the smoothness of apoplastic water flow is dominantly associated with the root anatomical structure barrios masias et al 2015 however continuous dehydration usually damages the root anatomical structure cuneo et al 2016 observed that the mechanical damage of cortical cells lacunae formation coincided with root shrinkage of grapevines vitis berlandieri x when the stem potential was less than 0 6 mpa tataranni et al 2015 found that the number of suberized cellular layers of olive o europaea l increased to nearly five from the endodermis to the cortex and the reduction in radial hydraulic conductivity exceeded 80 when the leaf water potential was lower than 6 5 mpa however although several correlations regarding microcosmic morpho anatomical changes and root hydraulic conductivity were proposed for specific plants tataranni et al 2015 no robust models have been established that can effectively describe the apd effects on the root hydraulic status for the purpose of simplification according to the potential influences of apd on krr we introduced a linear function to characterize the effects of apd based on hroot as expressed in eq 19 19 α apd 1 h root h root 2 1 h root h root 2 h root 4 h root 2 h root 4 h root h root 2 0 h root h root 4 where hroot 2 l and hroot 4 l are the two thresholds of water potential in the root tissue krr linearly decreases when hroot is below hroot 2 and we considered that radial water flow stops if hroot decreases to hroot 4 then a multiplicative relationship is used to describe the combined effects of αaqp and αapd as expressed in eq 20 20 k rr α aqp α apd k rr 3 methodology 3 1 model coupling and implementation in the sr hrv model the water transport processes in the soil vegetationatmosphere continuum are subdivided into water movement from the rhizosphere to the root surface root xylem and leaf stomata described in the theory section we originally compiled these processes based on the rootextraction subroutine of the swap model kroes et al 2017 which can provide the numerical solution of the richards equation eq 1 based on the physical rwu model developed by de jong van lier et al 2013 we embedded the tardieu davies model and three piecewise linear functions in the calculation procedure to describe the effects of stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations described in section 2 2 the water potentials in the leaves and roots were implicitly correlated with the water potential in the root collar hcollar the newton raphson iteration of hcollar was carried out until the simulated transpiration of the rwu model and stomatal conductance model is converged 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation based on field observation of sunflower plants we analyzed the parameter sensitivities of the sr hrv model and selected the sensitive parameters for calibration and validation the initial soil water distribution daily meteorological data groundwater table and crop morphological indicators including crop height lai and rld were collected as the input variables to run the sr hrv model a soil profile 0 300 cm was discretized into 2 cm layers the upper and bottom boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the details of the field experiment measurements parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration methods are described in this section 3 2 1 field experiments the field experiments comprised three plots of y2016 1 y2016 2 and y2017 each plot with an area of approximately 30 m2 at the yichang experimental station in the hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china 108 0 15 3 e 41 4 2 16 n sunflowers helianthus annuus l cultivar jk gl601 were grown from 5 june to 19 september 2016 and from 27 may to 15 september 2017 the row distance between the sowing points was 50 cm the field was irrigated 250 300 mm before sowing on 9 may 2016 and 15 may 2017 and no irrigation was applied during the plant growth period the meteorological data of the experimental site were retrieved from an automatic meteorological station located 10 m from the experimental site the groundwater table was monitored every 1 5 days in a water well near the field swcs 0 100 cm were measured by the oven drying and weighing method at 1 27 51 69 and 105 days after sowing in 2016 and at 1 30 60 70 80 and 112 days after sowing in 2017 the soil samples were collected every 10 cm down to 40 cm depth and from there every 20 cm down to 100 cm depth the van genuchten 1980 of the soils table 1 were initially estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 and calibrated using pest parameter estimation software with the first two soil water measurements 0 100 cm soil profile before 30 days after sowing of the two years no crop was assumed due to the low transpiration during this period the stomatal conductance gs of the youngest fully expanded leaf of tagged plants was measured using a portable photosynthetic apparatus li 6400 li cor lincoln usa at midday from 10 a m to 12 a m on windless and sunny days 42 53 65 72 and 107 days after sowing in 2016 38 43 and 69 days after sowing in 2017 each leaf was measured 5 times the length l and width w of green leaves and the height of three representative plants were measured with a tape starting from 27 and 22 days after sowing in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 3 a and b the leaf area la was calculated based on the empirical relationship la 0 6564 l w proposed by chen 1984 the lai was defined as the green leaf area per unit of ground surface area the dynamic root distributions of the plants were monitored by a minirhizotron and root 700 system ecomatik munich germany before sowing four parallel transparent rhizotubes with an interval of 1 m horizontally were diagonally inserted into the soil in the middle of the two sowing rows the insertion angle of each rhizotubes was 45 to the horizontal and the vertical depth of insertion was 1 m the roots surrounding the rhizotubes were scanned with a root 700 digital camera layer by layer the vertical height of each scan layer was controlled to 15 cm the root length of the sunflower in each scanned image was distinguished and calculated with the root analysis software winrhizotron regent instruments inc quebec canada the rld was converted by assuming that the equivalent soil thickness surrounding the rhizotubes was equal to 2 5 mm the rld of the whole field was determined by the average rld status in four parallel rhizotube images the rld of three plots at different soil depths and sampling dates are shown in fig 3c 3 2 2 base values of the hydraulic properties in the soil plant system the base values of the hydrophysiological parameters in the sr hrv model are listed in table 2 the radial hydraulic conductivity krr l t 1 was transformed by the radial root hydraulic conductance lrr t 1 according to the conversion equation introduced by de jong van lier et al 2013 the lrr of sunflower was investigated by adiredjo et al 2014 and liu and shan 2003 we took the average upper limit of their measurements 2 08 10 6 d 1 and 2 97 10 6 d 1 as the base value of lrr by assuming ksx was constant in the xylem of stems and leaves at a 1 m distance from the root collar to the evaporation site of the leaves the stem leaf hydraulic conductance lsx t 1 of plants was transformed by stem leaf hydraulic conductivity ksx l t 1 according to ahmad et al 2018 and gleason et al 2017 the base values of the stomatal parameters regarding caba and gs eqs 12 and 13 were referred to the experimental results of tardieu et al 1996 δ controls the participation activity of hl in stomatal regulation as absolute δ increases the regulation capacity of hl to gs is enhanced according to tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 2015 the reference δ values are 0 for sunflower however considering drought tolerance of the sunflower and to prevent serious xylem cavitation stiller and sperry 2002 ahmad et al 2018 cardoso et al 2018 we set the base δ as 0 2 referring to the simulation of couvreur et al 2014b we assumed that soil root contact loosening occurs when hs r equals 0 05 mpa and ks r decreases to 0 when hs r decreases to 1 5 mpa due to incomplete soil root contact a hypothetical state the water absorption is ignored if hs r below hsr 2 regarding the function of aquaporin responses based on the related experimental and simulation studies in section 2 2 2 we assumed that the krr would be subject to an increase of 200 r 2 when the hroot changes from 0 005 mpa to 0 1 mpa considering the correlation between apd and contact we preliminarily set the same base water potential thresholds for apd and contact 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation are quantified by different hydrophysiological parameters in the sr hrv model to test the sensitivity of simulated gs and swc to different parameters based on field observations of y2016 1 a classic sensitivity analysis method of morris 1991 was used in this study this method developed from one step at a time oat theory can effectively balance the efficiency and accuracy of the calculation regarding a model with k input parameters two sets of input parameters x and x are determined 21 x x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k x x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k where the same values in x and x are selected except for the ith parameter a variation step δ is added to the ith parameter in x δ is between 1 p 1 and 1 1 p 1 times the variation range for the ith parameter and p represents the change gradients of the ith parameter the elementary effects f i x of the ith parameter can be characterized as the change rate of model output y x and y x 22 f i x y x y x δ to avoid the randomness of parameter values the element effects for each input parameter are repeatedly estimated r times by randomly sampling x 1 x 2 x r two evaluation indexes μi and σi are defined as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of the ith parameter 23 μ i 1 r j 1 r f i x j σ i 1 r 1 j 1 r f i x j μ i 2 where μi can assess the overall influence of an input ith parameter on the model output and σi can describe nonlinear effects and interactions between the ith and other parameters in this study to alleviate the influences of meteorology groundwater table and crop growth the cumulative values of μi and σi c μ and c σ were selected to evaluate the dynamic sensitivity responses of gs and swc to seven stomatal regulation parameters and seven soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters table 2 to avoid the disturbance of soil evaporation rainfall and groundwater table changes on soil water dynamics the swc at a 50 cm soil depth swc50 was selected in the sensitivity analysis nine levels between the ranges of 0 5 1 5 times the base values and 10 times r 10 random samplings were set for each parameter the input parameter dataset generation and evaluation index calculation were based on simlab software tarantola and becker 2017 3 2 4 calibration and validation of sensitive parameters to reduce the parameter uncertainty the plant hydraulic conductivity conductance sensitive stomatal parameters and sensitive soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters were selected to calibrate y2016 1 and y2017 and validate y2016 2 based on field experiments with sunflower plants in parameter calibration pest software white et al 2020 was used in this study which combines the fast convergence speed of the gauss newton method with the global search characteristics of the gradient descent method which can improve parameter adjustment efficiency and avoid the subjectivity of artificial parameter adjustment doherty 2004 the average weighted square relative difference fj between measured and simulated gs converted to the daily average from the observation at midday based on the sine function and swcs at seven depths were collected as the objective function the parameters can be calibrated by multiple stepwise iterative methods 24 min f j 1 m i 1 m γ 1 y i j s y i o 2 where y i o is the ith observed value y i j s is the ith simulated value in the jth optimization m is the total number of observations and γ is the weight of the ith observation in this study considering the differences in the number of observations of gs 1 and swcs 7 during a day the weights of relative square differences of gs were set as 7 times those of the swcs 3 3 simulation scenario design to better focus on soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects and their interaction with the stomatal behavior two types of ideal drying out scenarios were designed in our study simulation scenario i with the calibrated stomatal parameters the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact were investigated specifically five soil root hydraulic resistance scenarios i e i constant scenario without considering the root soil hydraulic resistance variations the variable soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios with the individual effects of the ii root aquaporins promotion aqp iii apoplastic path damage apd iv root soil contact loosening contact and v their interactive effects aqp apd contact a a c on the soil plant water potentials and rwu distribution were simulated respectively simulation scenario ii we expanded the calibrated stomatal regulations benchmarking stomatal sensitivity sen 10 to assume that plants have higher sen 30 more isohydric and lower sen 05 more anisohydric stomatal sensitivities to leaf water potential sen lepo and xylem aba concentration sen caba which were simulated by halving and tripling the calibrated stomatal parameters β and δ the stomatal sensitivity parameters regarding caba and hl as shown in eq 12 the effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact on plant transpiration and drought signal responses were compared when plants with different stomatal sensitivities in simulation scenarios i and ii a soil profile 0 100 cm vertically discretized in 1 cm layers was established the upper and bottom boundaries were controlled by constant atmospheric and free drainage conditions the soil physical properties were the same as those in the field experiment table 1 the atmospheric conditions and plant growth status including lai plant height and rld distribution were based on the measurements on 8 august 2016 when the sunflower development stage was equal to 1 0 the initial soil water pressure in each compartment was in hydrostatic equilibrium with the groundwater table at a depth of 5 m no rain irrigation or soil evaporation was assumed the soil water consumption or storage in the soil profile depended only on rwu and bottom drainage 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of the hydrophysiological parameters the cumulative sensitivity indexes c μ and c σ of simulated gs and swc50 to the hydrophysiological parameters of the sr hrv model are shown in fig 4 the c μ and c σ of simulated gs response to stomatal regulation parameters α β and δ and xylem aba concentration parameters a b and c are increased earlier and greater than to other parameters fig 4a and b especially the c μ and c σ of gs response to aba related parameters β a b and c increase from 0 01 m s 1 to 1 0 m s 1 which are obviously higher than to soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters these results might imply a response mechanism of the plants to drought stress that is the stomata actively respond before the occurrence of soil root hydraulic resistance variations this phenomenon has been reported by carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 for white lupins and vicia faba l the reason behind this is that the plants could reduce the stomatal aperture with the dual stimulations of hydraulic and chemical drought signals which effectively prevent water loss and water potential drop down around roots faiz and weatherley 1982 carminati et al 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 for some plants with more anisohydric behaviors such as sunflowers gs is insensitive to hydraulic signals tardieu and simonneau 1998 cardoso et al 2020 aba related processes would play a more essential role in regulating the stomatal behavior once plants suffer drought stress moreover compared to apd hroot 2 and hroot 4 and contact hsr 1 and hsr 2 parameters the c μ and c σ of simulated gs to aqp parameters r hroot 1 and hroot 3 are responded earlier and are generally greater before the 30th day this is attributed to the aqp effects being easily triggered in the simulation hroot 0 1 mpa even when the soil is relatively wet in this situation the increase in krr can effectively reduce the hydraulic resistance of the whole water transport system sade et al 2009 chaumont and tyerman 2014 however after the 30th and 60th days the c μ and c σ response to apd hroot 2 and hroot 4 and contact hsr 1 and hsr 2 parameters rapidly increase nearly 2 5 orders of magnitude even approach to the c μ and c σ of gs response to aqp parameters after 90th days which means that apd and contact began to dominantly regulate gs during this period as the explanation in section 4 3 these results are well responded to recent outstanding works from carminati and javaux 2020 and cai et al 2021 who verified that soil root hydraulic properties play a vital role in the soil plant water transport system in addition the response orders of the cumulative sensitivity indexes c μ and c σ of simulated swc50 to different parameters are similar to those of gs fig 4c and d this implies a close link between stomatal regulation and soil water status in the sr hrv model a greater gs induces higher transpiration and more negative water potential in plants thereby accelerating water consumption from the soil in contrast the continuous decrease in soil moisture prompts a considerable decrease in the water potential and hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere thereby stimulating drought signal production and stomatal closure the hydrophysiological parameters collectively participate in the hydraulic interaction between the stomata and soil thus the c μ and c σ of gs and swc50 to hydrophysiological parameters are synchronously responded however the parameter sensitivity might be different when plants with various hydrophysiological traits e g plant morphology stomatal sensitivity drought signal generation and resistance to soil root hydraulic resistance variations and growth conditions e g vapor pressure deficit and soil environments for example the soil hydraulic properties significantly affect water uptake patterns and soil plant hydraulics in drought situations cai et al 2021 the sensitivity of plant hydraulic traits including water potential resistance and water flux in the different organs or tissues of the plant to contact and apd parameters in sandy or loam soil is probably higher than those in clay soil because contact and apd are more easily triggered therefore it is necessary to test the parameter sensitivity in specific scenarios before the model application 4 2 calibration and validation of hydrophysiological parameters in this section besides lsx and krr the sensitive hydrophysiological parameters including three stomatal regulation parameters α β and δ and the most sensitive parameter in each hydrophysiological process of caba response aqp apd and contact b r hroot 4 and hsr 2 were selected for calibration y2016 1 and y2017 and validation y2016 2 using field observations of gs and swcs the calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 fig 5 b and d show the calibrated simulation results of gs and swcs in y2016 1 and y2017 the gs rapidly decreased after the 50th day in y2016 1 and eventually dropped down to below 0 001 m s 1 after the 100th day differently in y2017 gs decreased slightly from the 25th to the 50th day and then remained relatively stable at 0 01 0 0125 m s 1 the swcs 0 100 cm depth in y2016 1 decreased from 0 32 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 to 0 13 0 15 cm3 cm 3 during the whole simulation period while the swcs in y2017 maintained a higher status of 0 19 0 26 cm3 cm 3 at a soil depth of 50 90 cm these results indicate that the sunflower experienced varying degrees of drought stress in y2016 1 and y2017 more severe drought stress took place in y2016 1 which mainly resulted from the rapid decline in the groundwater table in 2016 in fig 5a similar to y2016 1 large declines of gs and swcs are simulated in y2016 2 for validation the simulated ks r in the validation rapidly decreased after the 80th day below ksoil and eventually dropped to 4 10 8 cm d 1 after the 90th day fig 5c which indicates that the contact effects were activated during this simulation period moreover influenced by the aqp effects the krr in the validation successively increased over 9 0 10 6 cm d 1 from the topsoil to deeper soil from the 40th to the 100th day however due to the apd effects krr gradually decreased after the 85th day the gs and swcs are two critical hydraulic indicators of the soil plant system which affect the water flow and drought signal generation in the leaf and rhizosphere carminati et al 2020 cai et al 2021 in the model calibration and validation we obtained relatively good agreements between simulations and observations for gs root mean square error rmse of 5 56 10 4 1 19 10 3 m s determination coefficient r2 of 0 87 0 98 and swcs rmse of 0 008 0 0511 cm3 cm 3 r2 of 0 70 0 99 moreover similar to the experimental results from tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 1998 who observed gs decreased from 0 053 m s 1 to 0 002 m s 1 at the hourly scale as hl decreased from 0 9 mpa to 2 5 mpa and caba increased from 0 to 425 μmol m 3 for sunflower we simulated gs decreased from 0 013 m s 1 to 0 001 m s 1 at the diurnal scale approximately from 0 041 m s 1 to 0 003 m s 1 at midday based on a sine function company with the hl decreased from 0 01 mpa to 1 7 mpa and caba increased from 48 to 423 μmol m 3 considering the genetic differences and environmental influences the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters were acceptable however as shown in table 4 several absolute correlation coefficients among calibrated parameters were over 0 8 which indicates parameter uncertainty might exist due to the equifinality of different parameters for the simulations of gs and swc thus more observations regarding leaf water potential root water potential xylem aba concentration root aquaporin activity root anatomy and root soil air gap are needed which would contribute to further reducing the uncertainty of model parameters 4 3 simulation scenario i effects of different soil root hydraulic resistance variations on water transport as shown in figs 6 8 the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations on the hydraulic traits of plants are simulated with the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters table 3 systematic analysis of the root soil hydraulic resistance variation effects helps elucidate the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations in section 4 4 4 3 1 aqp scenario the absolute water potentials of the root collar hcollar and leaf hl fig 6f and b in the aqp scenario are lower than those in the constant scenario when the absolute average soil water potential hs mean is below 0 45 mpa during the initial simulation period before the 30th days fig 6d the corresponding rwu is slightly enhanced fig 7d maintaining 0 012 0 013 cm3 cm 3 d 1 at a soil depth of 20 60 cm from the 8th to the 24th day these positive hydraulic responses are attributed to the increase in krr in the aqp scenario fig 7c which alleviates the potential gradient and increases the flux transmission from the rhizosphere to the leaves in mild drought conditions sade et al 2009 chaumont and tyerman 2014 and gambetta et al 2017 verified these promotion effects of aquaporin responses on the water permeability of root cells root hydraulic conductivity and plant transpiration however similar to the simulation case of aquaporin in couvreur et al 2014b these competitive aqp effects gradually disappeared in the later simulation stage this is mainly because the soil hydraulic resistance gradually replaces the root radial hydraulic resistance as the primary restriction in the soil root water path as the soil dries out thereby limiting the promotion effect of krr improvement on soil root water transport newman 1969 liu et al 2015 carminati and javaux 2020 4 3 2 apd scenario the value of h0 mean approach 1 8 mpa after the 30th day in the apd scenario fig 6e which is lower than that in the constant scenario 2 6 mpa however hcollar and hl increase faster than in the constant scenario fig 6b and f which are higher than 2 6 mpa on the 50th day these water potential responses indicate the inhibition of hydraulic transfer efficiency between the xylem and root surface due to the apd effects fig 7c which restricts the water potential decrease in the root surface thereby impeding the root water absorption as shown in fig 6a ta is slightly lower than it is in the constant scenario after the 40th day moreover from a modeling perspective according to equation 13 the inefficient water potential decrease in the root surface alleviates the increase in hplant and caba therefore caba in the apd scenario is slightly lower than that in the constant scenario fig 6c interestingly in a partial root zone drying experiment for potato solanum tuberosum l puertolas et al 2015 found that the root aba concentration accumulation of dry compartments in vertical heterogeneous conditions upper dry was lower than that in horizontal heterogeneous conditions according to recent developments in the field of aba biosynthesis and transport in a plant mcadam et al 2016 kuromori et al 2018 mcadam and brodribb 2018 the aba is mainly generated in leaves and supplied to the roots via the phloem the lower aba accumulation of the older roots in the upper layers implies that root aging or tissue damage e g apd might inhibit the aba synthesis in leaf and limits the aba concentration in the xylem 4 3 3 contact scenario different from the water potential status in the apd scenario h0 mean hcollar and hl constantly increased to 2 5 2 8 mpa after the 50th day in the contact scenario fig 6b e and f greater than those in the constant scenario however the increase in hs mean gradually approaches 1 0 mpa fig 6d which is lower than that in the constant scenario 1 5 mpa these phenomena are caused by hydraulic conductivity reduction in the rhizosphere fig 7b which alleviates water potential decrease in the bulk soil but accelerates the decrease in the root surface and xylem thereby slightly increasing the caba level fig 6c with the combined effects of hl and caba ta further decreases below the constant scenario from the 30th to the 60th day fig 6a therefore we conjecture that the stomatal aperture rather than merely relying on the hydraulic signal stimulation is also closely regulated by the aba or other chemical signals when the air gap gradually appears this positive stimulation of chemical signal probably can explain the experimental results of carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 who observed a proactive decrease in transpiration before the occurrence of contact 4 3 4 a a c scenario with the interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations a a c the hydraulic responses of plants vary over time initially the water potentials of the leaf and root collar are similar to those in the aqp scenario before the 30th day fig 6b and f the rwu is also enhanced at this stage fig 7d at the later simulation stage the decreases in hs mean fig 6d and h0 mean fig 6e are restricted by the effects of contact and apd respectively while the variations of ta fig 6a and rwu fig 7d in the a a c are similar to the contact scenario rather than the apd scenario meanwhile as shown in fig 8a the relation between ta and hs mean in the a a c scenario is close to the contact scenario these results indicate that contact restricts the response of water flux including ta equivalent to stomatal conductance and rwu to severe soil dehydration from a modeling perspective this is because although apd prevents the water potential decrease at the root surface it is also low enough 0 9 mpa 1 8 mpa to trigger the contact 0 05 mpa and causes a matric flux potential drop down at the soil root interface however caba and hl in the a a c scenario are similar to those in the apd scenario fig 6b and c and as shown in fig 8b the relation between ta and hl in the a a c scenario is closer to the apd scenario these results indicate that apd controls the drought signal responses and their regulation on ta equivalent to stomatal conductance therefore we conjecture that the hydraulic traits in the a a c scenario are determined by the unique and targeted effects of individual soil root hydraulic resistance variation rather than their simple accumulation significantly the occurrences and dynamic effects of contact and apd should be particularly considered when plants suffer from severe drought stress because they regulate the water flux and drought signal responses respectively meanwhile it is worth noting that contact and apd are two dynamic inter enforcing processes as stated by carminati et al 2013 as a result of root apoplastic path damage apd and root shrink air gap formation contact increases the hydraulic resistance in the rhizosphere which further accelerates apd moreover owing to the unique effects of contact and apd on soil and root water potential fig 6d and e the observations of soil and root water potential might be the appropriate variables to parameterize these two processes when the plant is in a drought situation furthermore complex hydrophysiological factors e g soil texture and density root hair activity and mucilage secretion are involved in the apd and contact processes carminati et al 2016 koebernick et al 2018 how to macroscopically quantify these effects and eliminate the scale effects between experimental observations and parameter determinations remains an open question 4 4 simulation scenario ii effect of stomatal regulations on the variation in root soil hydraulic resistance taking the situation simulated with calibrated stomatal parameters as a benchmark sen 10 the deviations of ta and relations between hl and hs mean figs 9 and 10 in different soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios and stomatal sensitivity situations are compared in this section 4 4 1 stomatal sensitivity in the sen 30 situations stomata are more sensitive to drought signals than they are in the sen 10 situations plants maintain high transpiration of 0 60 0 65 cm d 1 for a shorter time 0 15 days while the lower water consumption alleviates the decrease in ta at the later stage fig 9a moreover as shown in fig 10 the sensitive stomatal responses in the sen 30 situations prevent the increases in hl 1 6 mpa and caba 400 μmol m 3 as hs mean increase these results imply a cautious stomatal strategy more isohydric behavior of the plants to adapt to long term drought stress martin stpaul et al 2017 however when stomata are less sensitive to the drought signals in the sen 05 situations more anisohydric behavior the opposite traits of ta are presented as time goes by plants maintain high transpiration of 0 65 0 7 cm d 1 for a longer time 0 30 days the greater water consumption accelerates the decrease in transpiration in the later stage fig 9a the corresponding hl increase to 2 5 3 8 mpa and caba over 800 μmol m 3 rapidly increase as hs mean increase in sen 05 situations fig 10a 4 4 2 performances of aqp apd and contact distinct hydraulic responses are presented in different soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios and stomatal sensitivity situations compared with the constant scenario in the sen 10 situation fig 9b the relative transpiration in the aqp scenario is greater than 1 and gradually increases before the 27th day while after that it begins to decrease and decrease below 0 95 from the 31st to 36th day interestingly the variation ranges of relative transpiration in the aqp scenario are reduced and amplified in the sen 05 and sen 30 situations fig 9c respectively these simulation phenomena imply that the aqp effects are constrained under insensitive stomatal situations when plants with more anisohydric behavior from the modeling perspective one possible reason is that the aqp mainly acts at the initial simulation stage when the soil is relatively wet as described in section 4 3 only a few hydraulic hl 1 3 mpa and aba caba 200 μmol m 3 signals are produced from the aqp effects to regulate the stomatal aperture during this period these disturbances are diluted for plants with insensitive stomatal responses because of the relatively high drought signal level in this situation as shown in the sen 05 situation fig 10c however paradoxically the root aquaporin activity of anisohydric plants seems to be more active than isohydric plants such as vandeleur et al 2009 found that the permeability of root cortex cells of chardonnay an anisohydric cultivar of grapevine is higher than grenache an isohydric cultivar of grapevine under drought stress due to the upregulation of pips plasma membrane intrinsic proteins this phenomenon implies complex hydrophysiological responses of plants to drought it is not enough to describe the plant hydraulic behavior merely at a local organ scale more attention should be paid to the interactions between different organs and hydraulic behaviors in soil plant water transport modeling in the apd and contact scenarios the relative transpiration is approximately 1 0 before the 30th day in the sen 10 situation fig 9b but after then it rapidly decreases to 0 95 and 0 7 on the 33rd 35th days similar variation ranges of relative transpiration are presented in the sen 05 situation fig 9c however in the sen 30 situation fig 9c the variation ranges of relative transpiration are reduced which indicates that the sensitive stomatal response protects plant transpiration from the influences of apd and contact especially apd the reason is that the sensitive stomatal regulation restricts leaf water loss by immediate closure of stomata thereby preventing the water potential from further decreasing in the soil plant system as shown in fig 10d and e similarly martin stpaul et al 2017 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 and carminati et al 2020 successively demonstrated the importance of stomatal closure to prevent xylem embolism and alleviate the formation of a large gradient in water potential around the roots moreover due to the greater regulation capacity of contact with respect to transpiration response to soil dehydration in the a a c scenario as explained in section 4 3 similar relative transpiration responses are obtained in the contact and a a c scenarios in the sen 10 and sen 05 situations fig 9b and c furthermore as shown in fig 10b and e as hs mean increases in the contact and a a c scenarios the hl and caba rapidly increase which would stimulate the stomatal closure and implies that contact limits soil water availability of plants however as a result of the effects of apd on drought signal responses as explained in section 4 3 as hs mean increases the increases in hl in a a c scenarios are slightly greater than those in contact scenarios 4 4 3 regulations of hydraulic and chemical signals compared with the benchmarking situation the deviations of ta hl and caba in the sen caba situations are greater than those in the sen lepo situations figs 9 10 these results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis of the aba related parameters in section 4 1 indicating that the stomatal responses to aba signals have significant impacts on water transport in the simulation similar simulation results were presented by huber et al 2015 an argument is put forward that only relying on the regulation of leaf water potential is insufficient to portray the stomatal behavior and hydraulic properties of plants with more anisohydric behaviors an appropriate description of stomatal responses to chemical signals is necessary for these plants in water transport modeling furthermore it is worth noting that the drought signals also participate in other hydraulic and physiological processes for example a lower plant water potential can induce hydraulic failure in the xylem embolism mcdowell et al 2008 martin stpaul et al 2017 and aba concentration is also correlated with biomass assimilations of leaves and roots puertolas et al 2015 dinneny 2019 while these processes are not the focus of this paper moreover a complex root shoot signaling interaction is behind the aba biosynthesis and accumulation in plants while the xylem aba concentration in the leaf was simplify quantified by a function of the mean status of water potential in shoot and root in this study which might induce the uncertainty in stomatal response to soil root hydraulic variation especially to apd and due to the physiological and genetic differences among species other chemical signals such as the cytokinin and ph in leaf tissues also participate in stomatal regulation davies et al 2002 chaves et al 2003 the generation mechanism and regulation ability of these chemical solutes may affect the responses of gs and hl to drought iso anisohydric behavior however how to quantify the effects of these chemical solutes and whether these effects are necessary to consider in the stomatal model need more exploration in further studies 5 conclusions and outlooks in this study we proposed a soil plant hydraulic model sr hrv by improving the macroscopic physical rwu model of de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 and explicitly describing the upper boundary with the tardieu davies 1996 tardieu davies 2015 stomatal conductance model compared with previous studies the sr hrv model innovatively bridges the gap with hydraulic and chemical signals to simulate the interactions between soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation the effects of three universal hydraulic resistance variations of root aquaporins promotion aqp root apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact were specifically characterized by piecewise linear functions based on the parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration the dynamic interactions of soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation on the hydraulic traits of plants were simulated in different scenarios the following conclusions can be made 1 the sensitivity of simulated gs and swc50 to stomatal regulation parameters especially to the aba signal correlated parameters respond earlier and greater than the soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters however the sensitivity to apd and contact parameters would rapidly increase with further soil dehydration 2 three soil root hydraulic resistance variations distinctively affect the plant hydraulic traits in the a a c scenario aqp improves root water absorption and affects transpiration when plants are in mild drought conditions contact and apd respectively regulate the water flux and drought signal responses when plants suffer severe drought stress 3 the increase of stomatal sensitivity to drought signals induces early transpiration reduction but alleviates the transpiration decline for a longer time which enhances the aqp effects and eliminates the effects of apd and contact conversely when stomatal sensitivity decrease to drought signals especially to aba signal the opposite responses of soil root hydraulic resistance variations effects are presented the above conclusions contribute to exploring the primary hydrophysiological response and balancing the simulation accuracy and model complexity in soil plant water transport modeling for plants with a more anisohydric behavior the regulation of chemical signals on stomatal conductance should be considered moreover it is essential to understand the stomatal sensitivity of plants which determines the necessity to consider the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations in water transport modeling the primary influential factor of soil root hydraulic resistance variation relies on the soil plant water situation some hydrophysiological responses can be simplified in the simulation such as the aqp effects in severe drought conditions and apd contact effects in mild drought conditions while the interactive effects of apd and contact should be particularly considered when plants suffer continuous drought stress based on the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters the sr hrv model favorably simulated the stomatal conductance soil water status and soil root hydraulic resistance variations at the field scale however some assumptions were made during the model development due to data limitations in the literature such as the soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects were quantified by the linear functions of hydraulic status in the soil root system the xylem aba concentration was considered to be related to the average hydraulic status of the leaf and root and to simplify the model the root xylem resistance the formation of xylem cavitation and the hysteresis effects of stomatal response and soil root hydraulic resistance variation were not considered in this study these assumptions may have an impact on simulation results of soil root hydraulic resistance drought signal generation and stomatal response such as the quantification of xylem aba concentration accounting for the synthetic effects of the shoot and root hydraulic states which affects the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations thus the rationality and potential effects of these assumptions need further clarification based on the detailed hydro morpho physiological observations in plant drought experiments moreover exhaustive parameter calibration is beneficial for model application for the parameters of stomatal regulation and xylem aba concentration responses it is recommended to employ convenient observations of stomatal conductance xylem aba concentration and leaf water potential in calibrations while for the parameter calibrations of soil root hydraulic resistance variations besides the essential measurements of soil water status and root water potential the observations of root morphology anatomy and aquaporins activity are also advised furthermore the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations should be tested under various soil types and atmospheric conditions it is promising to couple the sr hrv model with other physiological simulations including carbon assimilation and biomass allocation which provide a promising way to explore the influences of stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations on crop growth yield formation and the water carbon cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

two critical hydrophysiological responses of plants to drought stress however few studies have been developed to quantify their interactions to fill this gap we developed a soil plant hydraulic model sr hrv that attempts to characterize the effects of stomatal regulation and three universal soil root hydraulic resistance variations i e root aquaporins promotion aqu apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact the sensitive parameters of the sr hrv model were analyzed and optimized based on a field experiment with sunflower plants helianthus annuus l several simulation scenarios were designed to clarify the individual and interactive effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations for plants with different stomatal sensitivities results show that the sensitivity of simulated stomatal conductance and soil water content response to stomatal regulation parameters especially to abscisic acid related parameters are more active than to soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters but as the soil dries the sensitivities to apd and contact parameters are rapidly increased the simulation demonstrates that aqp alleviates the leaf water potential drop down and maintains relatively high root water absorption of the plant when it is in mild drought conditions while contact and apd respectively restrict the water flux and drought signal responses with continuous soil dehydration moreover the aqp effects are more pronounced but the effects of apd and contact would be restricted for plants with higher stomatal sensitivity to drought signals these simulation results imply the diverse response strategies of plants to drought the collaborations between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations should be

soil plant hydraulic model developed in this study swc soil volumetric water content swc50 soil volumetric water content at a 50 cm soil depth 1 introduction as a primary physiological process accompanying photosynthesis plant transpiration plays an essential role in the terrestrial hydrological cycle evaristo et al 2015 precisely quantifying plant transpiration is a significant prerequisite for a number of applications including climate prediction water resource management and crop yield estimation lian et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however owing to the difficulty of estimating stomatal conductance and other complex plant hydrophysiological responses to environmental stresses transpiration estimation suffers from large uncertainty the range of predicted transpiration is spanning 20 65 of terrestrial evapotranspiration jasechko et al 2013 vereecken et al 2015 the radial hydraulic resistances from the rhizosphere the soils surrounding the root surface to the root xylem are known as the primary constraints on water transport during a drought event carminati and javaux 2020 specifically besides being restricted by the hydraulic status in the bulk soil the radial water flow is also affected by the hydraulic conductivity at the soil root interface and in root tissue effective root soil contact is a premise for the continuity of root water absorption in the rhizosphere but with soil dehydration air gaps would emerge at the soil root interface which restricts the water movement from soil to root advances in noninvasive imaging techniques in soil science and plant physiology such as high resolution x ray computer tomography have allowed observing the appearance of root soil contact loosening contact air gap formation in drought conditions carminati et al 2013 koebernick et al 2018 then when water moves through the soil root interface the varying permeability of root tissues and anatomical structures offer three water paths toward xylem vessels couvreur et al 2018 zarebanadkouki et al 2019 i e the symplastic path via plasmodesmata across neighboring cells the transcellular path cross membranes of neighboring cells and the apoplastic path through intercell space and root wall in the first two cell to cell paths aquaporins such as plasma membrane intrinsic proteins pips and tonoplast intrinsic proteins tips play a vital gating role in water molecule transportation maurel et al 2015 however drought stress usually affects the activity of aquaporins by changing hormonal regulation and gene expression boursiac et al 2005 perrone et al 2012 regarding the tortuous radial flow channels in the apoplastic path constructed by apoplastic suberization and casparian strips these anatomical structures are prone to be destroyed with continuous root dehydration north and nobel 1992 barrios masias et al 2015 the abovementioned structural and physiological changes along the soil root radial water path affect the hydraulic resistance of the root zone many studies have explored the qualitative impacts of soil root hydraulic resistance variation on soil plant water transport sade et al 2009 and vandeleur et al 2009 reported the enhancement of root aquaporin activity of solanum lycopersicum and vitis vinifera in drought conditions which allows plants to maintain high transpiration and prevents leaf water potential drop down carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 observed air gap formation at the soil root interface following transpiration decrease in lupinus albus l and vicia faba l rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 detected an alleviation of hydraulic gradient enlargement in the rhizosphere of olives olea europaea l as a result of immediate stomatal closure although these phenomena confirmed the influences of soil root hydraulic resistance variations on the soil plant hydraulic system only a few simulation studies like cai et al 2018 and nguyen et al 2020 considered the variations of root or plant hydraulic resistances when plants in a drought situation the hydraulic resistance of the root system is generally assumed to be independent of the soil root water status in most modeling applications the conditions for the applicability of such an assumption and the related potential uncertainties in soil plant water transport modeling are still poorly determined additionally in a drought situation the influencing factors of soil root hydraulic resistance such as root aquaporin activity and soil root contact respond simultaneously rather than independently other than the study by couvreur et al 2014b few quantitative studies have described the effects of interactions between different soil root hydraulic resistance variations on soil plant water transport more than relying on hydraulic traits of belowground including water potential hydraulic resistance and water flux in the soil root system water transport in the soil plant continuum is regulated by the stomatal behavior of plants tardieu et al 2017 carminati and javaux 2020 nguyen et al 2020 according to dixon and joly 1895 the rhizosphere hydraulic status interacts with the stomatal behavior via the cohesion tension mechanism to avoid vascular embolism and desiccation plants regulate their stomatal aperture to maintain the water balance between transpiration demand and the water supply capacity of the hydraulic system martin stpaul et al 2017 intuitively a lower leaf water potential stimulates stomatal closure through changes in the turgor of the guard cell several sources of evidence suggest that chemical compounds such as abscisic acid aba also participate in stomatal regulation as shown in fig 1 b dodd et al 2010 visentin et al 2016 according to the common definition of tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 1998 two types of stomatal regulation strategies can be recognized isohydric and anisohydric compared with those of isohydric plants the stomata of anisohydric plants are insensitive to hydraulic signals therefore the corresponding leaf water potential is usually prone to decrease with soil water depletion however recently this dichotomy was challenged because it failed to describe different iso anisohydric behavior for the same species schultz 2003 feng et al 2019 hochberg et al 2018 and ratzmann et al 2019 argued that the classification of iso anisohydry not only depends on the hydraulic properties of plants but also correlates with environmental conditions noteworthy carminati and javaux 2020 using a hydraulic model demonstrated the dominant influences of soil hydraulic conductivity loss on stomatal closure this result implies that the soil root zone is a key region to alter the stomatal behavior in drought conditions however few simulation studies have focused on the interactions of soil root hydraulic resistance variation and stomatal regulation especially for plants with different stomatal sensitivities root water uptake rwu modeling is a promising tool for simulating hydraulic interactions between the rhizosphere and aboveground parts of plants javaux et al 2013 dos santos et al 2017 in physical based rwu models the principle of microscopic water flow from soil to root can be analogously described by ohm law gardner 1960 first described rwu as a function of the water potential gradient and hydraulic resistances between the rhizosphere and root surface since then several microscopic physical rwu models have been proposed and are intended to describe the complex geometrical and morphological characteristics of the soil root system cowan 1965 clausnitzer and hopmans 1994 doussan et al 1998 javaux et al 2008 schröder et al 2009 however microscopic models are cumbersome to use at the field or larger scales due to the high data demands and computational costs thus upscaling of rwu models to the macroscopic scale is urgently needed from a practical perspective couvreur et al 2012 dos santos et al 2017 de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 avoided developing a model based on the complex hydraulic architecture of the root system they scaled up the single root model using mass balance theory and introduced a concept of matric flux potential to represent soil plant hydraulic properties the water flux from the soil to the root surface the root xylem and the leaf are systematically simulated in this model however for the purpose of simplification macroscopic rwu models including the models of de jong van lier et al 2008 jong van lier et al 2013 and couvreur et al 2012 couvreur et al 2014a typically assume a constant critical potential threshold at the leaf or root collar to determine the root water absorption capacity when plants are suffering drought stress this assumption is typically reasonable for plants with more isohydric behavior but for anisohydric plants their leaf water potential usually presents strong plasticity to drought stress the usage of a constant threshold might not reflect the stomatal response to drought signal stimulations huber et al 2015 tardieu et al 2015 to address these issues a macroscopic water transport model sr hrv was proposed in this study in the sr hrv model the soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects of root aquaporins promotion aqp apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact were respectively characterized by piecewise linear functions and the collaborative regulations of hydraulic and chemical aba signals on stomatal conductance gs were quantified moreover the parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the sr hrv model were carried out based on a field experiment with sunflower plants helianthus annuus l the numerical experiments of plant dehydration were designed with different soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal sensitivities the objectives of this study are to 1 determine and calibrate the sensitive parameters of the sr hrv model 2 clarify the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact on water transport and 3 identify the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations on transpiration and drought signal responses for plants with different stomatal sensitivities to hydraulic and chemical signals 2 theory 2 1 modeling water transport

modeling water flow from the soil to root xylem by the matric flux approach to avoid numerical instability in the rwu simulation caused by the steep water gradient and flow line convergence near the roots de jong van lier et al 2006 introduced a convenient expression of matric flux potential m l2 t which is defined as an integral of hydraulic conductivity k h l t 1 from the permanent wilting point hw l to the current potential h l in soil or plant tissue 3 m h w h k h d h the root system is simplified as vertically cylindrical roots with the same diameter according to de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 fig 2 a for a single root as shown in fig 2b the function of axisymmetric radial flow from the soil to the root surface and root xylem is written as 4 θ t q r q r where q l t 1 is the radial flux density r l is the radial distance from the root center based on darcy s equation and assuming the gravitational gradients are irrelevant to the problem q is described as 5 q k h r m r combining eq 4 and eq 5 the radial water flow is translated into the following second order differential equation 6 θ t m r r 2 m r the solution of eq 6 can be divided into two processes water flows from the rhizosphere to the root surface and water flows from the root surface to the root xylem for the soil surrounding the root de jong van lier et al 2008 developed an

mean soil water content swc of the rhizosphere r0 and αs are assumed to be 0 5 mm and 0 53 in analogy to de jong van lier et al 2008 rm z l is the radial radius of the rwu given by 9 r m z 1 π r l d z where rld z cm cm 3 is the root length density at depth z by assuming that the water content is constant within the root phloem between the root surface and xylem de jong van lier et al 2013 the matric flux potential relationship between the root surface and xylem can be established by solving eq 6 10 m 0 r z m x z s z 2 r m 2 z ln r 0 r x where m0r z is the matric flux potential of the root surface based on the root radial hydraulic conductivity krr l t 1 mx z l2 t 1 is the matric flux potential of the root xylem at depth z the root xylem resistance is ignored thus mx is related to the water potential in the root collar hcollar l rx l is the xylem radius at depth z which is assumed to be 0 2 mm analogous to de jong van lier et al 2013 2 1 3 leaf water potential and stomatal aperture control by the tardieu davies model the water potentials in the leaf hl l and root collar hcollar are correlated by the transpiration flux ta l t 1 and hydraulic conductance in the stem lsx t 1 according to 11 h collar h l t a l sx considering the responses of stomatal conductance gs n l 2 t 1 to drought signals tardieu et al 1996 proposed a model in which gs is controlled by the aba concentration in the leaf xylem caba n l 3 and the leaf water status at a leaf plant scale 12 g s g s m i n α exp c aba β exp δ h l where gs min n l 2 t 1 is the minimum stomatal conductance resulting from the cuticular conductance and the conductance through closed stomata α n l 2 t 1 β n 1 l3 and δ l 1 are the influential factors on stomatal regulation gs min α represents the maximum stomatal conductance by assuming that caba is close to 0 and hl is very high which can be used to calculate the potential transpiration of plants β and δ represent stomatal sensitivity to drought signals the greater absolute β and δ indicate the greater stomatal sensitivity to caba and hl respectively according to tardieu et al 1996 caba has a linear response to root water potential and is diluted by water flux through the plant however aba is synthesized not only in roots but also in shoots leaves kuromori et al 2018 recent studies according to mcadam et al 2016 mcadam et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and kuromori et al 2021 etc indicate that phloem companion cells guard cells especially mesophyll cells of leaves might be the potential main site of aba synthesizing in the plant moreover several root to shoot signals such as cle25 peptide and redox calcium have been found that regulate the aba synthesis and stomatal responses in leaves takahashi et al 2018 yoshida and fernie 2018 in this study considering the synthetic effects of the shoot and root hydraulic states on aba synthesis we simulated the caba using the average water potential in the plant hplant l 13 c aba z a h plant c t a m b where a n t 1 l 1 b l3 t 1 and c l are fitting parameters and m plants l 2 is the plant density used for transferring ta from the field scale l3 l 3 t 1 to the plant scale l2 t 1 in this study m equal to 4 plants m 2 regarding hplant we assumed it is equal to the average water potentials in the leaf and root the root water potential indicates the average water potentials in the root surface and xylem across the whole root system at the field scale plant transpiration ta can be calculated based on the stomatal conductance at the canopy scale which is estimated by upscaling gs through weighting by the effective leaf area index laieff based on big leaf theory ding et al 2014 14 t a s ϕ n ρ a c p g a d λ s γ g a g s l a i eff where s ml 1t 2k 1 is the slope of the curve representing

bastiaanssen et al 2012 15 la i eff lai 0 3 l a i 1 2 with meteorological data leaf area index plant height and gs the plant transpiration can be calculated at the field scale based on the penman monteith direct equation in the swap soil water atmosphere plant model kroes et al 2017 2 2 hydraulic resistance responses of the soil root system in water limited conditions 2 2 1 hydraulic conductivity reduction in the rhizosphere due to contact the hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere is critical for plant water use efficiency however in drought conditions the root surface detaches from the soil accompanied by the root cells begin to shrink and reduce the secretion of hydrophilic substances carminati et al 2013 observed an air gap that appears along with the taproot when hs ranged from 0 005 to 0 01 mpa and extended to 0 35 mm when hs decreased below 0 04 mpa koebernick et al 2018 found that the root soil contact of the taproot and lateral roots of vicia faba l significantly decreased when the hs decreased below 0 02 mpa once an air gap is formed the hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere is extremely limited because water transport mainly relies on gas diffusion liu et al 2015 detected an increasing air gap width with hs decreasing which increased the hydraulic resistance at the root soil interface for robinia pseudoacacia few simulations had quantified the effects of air gap formation on root soil interface hydraulic resistance and root water uptake liu et al 2015 de willigen et al 2018 however complex model structures and numerous parameters were introduced in these simulations in this study to limit model complexity based on the changing trend of the quantitative relationship between water potential and hydraulic conductivity in the rhizosphere similar to couvreur et al 2014b we used a piecewise linear function to describe the effects of contact 16 k s r α contact s r k soil 17 α contact s r 1 h s r h sr 1 1 h s r h sr 1 h sr 2 h sr 1 h sr 2 h s r h sr 1 0 h s r h sr 2 where the hydraulic conductivity in the rhizosphere ks r l t 1 is modified as a function of αcontact s r αcontact s r is correlated with the water potential in the rhizosphere hs r l here hsr 1 l and hsr 2 l are the two thresholds of water potential in the rhizosphere ks r is equal to the hydraulic conductivity in bulk soil ksoil without considering the contact effects however once contact occurs ks r linearly decreases when hs r is lower than hsr 1 and ks r decreases to 0 when hs r drops to hsr 2 the matric flux potentials in the boundaries of the rhizosphere eq 7 were modified by ks r in the bulk soil and root surface 2 2 2 variations in root radial conductivity due to aqp and apd the root radial conductivity krr l t 1 regulates the water flow from the root surface to the xylem which has been experimentally found to be much lower than the soil conductivity in wet soil soil water potential above 0 1 0 01 mpa draye et al 2010 the permeability of plasma membranes determines the hydraulic resistance in the transcellular and symplastic radial pathways while it is reversibly regulated by the activity of aquaporins many pieces of evidence show that aquaporins play significant roles in the response to environmental stimuli pawlowicz and masajada 2019 but inconsistent impacts of aquaporins response on root radial conductivity have been found in a variety of plants boursiac et al 2005 zhao et al 2008 perrone et al 2012 might be mediated by aba plants can enhance their root extraction capacity when suffering slight drought stress quintero et al 1999 hose et al 2000 hachez et al 2012 pawlowicz and masajada 2019 glinka 1980 and quintero et al 1999 found that the root hydraulic conductivity of sunflower increased by 150 250 when supplied with a 4 μm external aba solution in this study similar to couvreur et al 2014b we adopted a multiplicative factor αaqp to quantify the promotion effects of aqp on krr which is linearly correlated with the water potential in root tissue hroot expressed as 18 α aqp 1 h root h root 1 1 h root h root 1 h root 3 h root 1 r h root 3 h root h root 1 1 r h root h root 3 where hroot l is assumed to be the average water potential of the root surface and xylem at a specific depth hroot 1 l and hroot 3 l are two thresholds of water potential in the root tissue r is the maximum promotion factor of krr due to the aqp effects krr linearly increases starting at hroot hroot 1 and increases up to 1 r times krr when hroot hroot 3 different from couvreur et al 2014b we selected hroot rather than hs as the influential factor to quantify the promotion of krr which could better reflect the hydraulic status in roots especially when a large water potential gradient exists between soil and roots in addition to the cell to cell pathway apoplastic transport is another important radial water pathway in root tissue the smoothness of apoplastic water flow is dominantly associated with the root anatomical structure barrios masias et al 2015 however continuous dehydration usually damages the root anatomical structure cuneo et al 2016 observed that the mechanical damage of cortical cells lacunae formation coincided with root shrinkage of grapevines vitis berlandieri x when the stem potential was less than 0 6 mpa tataranni et al 2015 found that the number of suberized cellular layers of olive o europaea l increased to nearly five from the endodermis to the cortex and the reduction in radial hydraulic conductivity exceeded 80 when the leaf water potential was lower than 6 5 mpa however although several correlations regarding microcosmic morpho anatomical changes and root hydraulic conductivity were proposed for specific plants tataranni et al 2015 no robust models have been established that can effectively describe the apd effects on the root hydraulic status for the purpose of simplification according to the potential influences of apd on krr we introduced a linear function to characterize the effects of apd based on hroot as expressed in eq 19 19 α apd 1 h root h root 2 1 h root h root 2 h root 4 h root 2 h root 4 h root h root 2 0 h root h root 4 where hroot 2 l and hroot 4 l are the two thresholds of water potential in the root tissue krr linearly decreases when hroot is below hroot 2 and we considered that radial water flow stops if hroot decreases to hroot 4 then a multiplicative relationship is used to describe the combined effects of αaqp and αapd as expressed in eq 20 20 k rr α aqp α apd k rr 3 methodology 3 1 model coupling and implementation in the sr hrv model the water transport processes in the soil vegetationatmosphere continuum are subdivided into water movement from the rhizosphere to the root surface root xylem and leaf stomata described in the theory section we originally compiled these processes based on the rootextraction subroutine of the swap model kroes et al 2017 which can provide the numerical solution of the richards equation eq 1 based on the physical rwu model developed by de jong van lier et al 2013 we embedded the tardieu davies model and three piecewise linear functions in the calculation procedure to describe the effects of stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations described in section 2 2 the water potentials in the leaves and roots were implicitly correlated with the water potential in the root collar hcollar the newton raphson iteration of hcollar was carried out until the simulated transpiration of the rwu model and stomatal conductance model is converged 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis calibration and validation based on field observation of sunflower plants we analyzed the parameter sensitivities of the sr hrv model and selected the sensitive parameters for calibration and validation the initial soil water distribution daily meteorological data groundwater table and crop morphological indicators including crop height lai and rld were collected as the input variables to run the sr hrv model a soil profile 0 300 cm was discretized into 2 cm layers the upper and bottom boundaries of the soil profile were controlled by atmospheric conditions and groundwater tables respectively the details of the field experiment measurements parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration methods are described in this section 3 2 1 field experiments the field experiments comprised three plots of y2016 1 y2016 2 and y2017 each plot with an area of approximately 30 m2 at the yichang experimental station in the hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china 108 0 15 3 e 41 4 2 16 n sunflowers helianthus annuus l cultivar jk gl601 were grown from 5 june to 19 september 2016 and from 27 may to 15 september 2017 the row distance between the sowing points was 50 cm the field was irrigated 250 300 mm before sowing on 9 may 2016 and 15 may 2017 and no irrigation was applied during the plant growth period the meteorological data of the experimental site were retrieved from an automatic meteorological station located 10 m from the experimental site the groundwater table was monitored every 1 5 days in a water well near the field swcs 0 100 cm were measured by the oven drying and weighing method at 1 27 51 69 and 105 days after sowing in 2016 and at 1 30 60 70 80 and 112 days after sowing in 2017 the soil samples were collected every 10 cm down to 40 cm depth and from there every 20 cm down to 100 cm depth the van genuchten 1980 of the soils table 1 were initially estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 and calibrated using pest parameter estimation software with the first two soil water measurements 0 100 cm soil profile before 30 days after sowing of the two years no crop was assumed due to the low transpiration during this period the stomatal conductance gs of the youngest fully expanded leaf of tagged plants was measured using a portable photosynthetic apparatus li 6400 li cor lincoln usa at midday from 10 a m to 12 a m on windless and sunny days 42 53 65 72 and 107 days after sowing in 2016 38 43 and 69 days after sowing in 2017 each leaf was measured 5 times the length l and width w of green leaves and the height of three representative plants were measured with a tape starting from 27 and 22 days after sowing in 2016 and 2017 respectively fig 3 a and b the leaf area la was calculated based on the empirical relationship la 0 6564 l w proposed by chen 1984 the lai was defined as the green leaf area per unit of ground surface area the dynamic root distributions of the plants were monitored by a minirhizotron and root 700 system ecomatik munich germany before sowing four parallel transparent rhizotubes with an interval of 1 m horizontally were diagonally inserted into the soil in the middle of the two sowing rows the insertion angle of each rhizotubes was 45 to the horizontal and the vertical depth of insertion was 1 m the roots surrounding the rhizotubes were scanned with a root 700 digital camera layer by layer the vertical height of each scan layer was controlled to 15 cm the root length of the sunflower in each scanned image was distinguished and calculated with the root analysis software winrhizotron regent instruments inc quebec canada the rld was converted by assuming that the equivalent soil thickness surrounding the rhizotubes was equal to 2 5 mm the rld of the whole field was determined by the average rld status in four parallel rhizotube images the rld of three plots at different soil depths and sampling dates are shown in fig 3c 3 2 2 base values of the hydraulic properties in the soil plant system the base values of the hydrophysiological parameters in the sr hrv model are listed in table 2 the radial hydraulic conductivity krr l t 1 was transformed by the radial root hydraulic conductance lrr t 1 according to the conversion equation introduced by de jong van lier et al 2013 the lrr of sunflower was investigated by adiredjo et al 2014 and liu and shan 2003 we took the average upper limit of their measurements 2 08 10 6 d 1 and 2 97 10 6 d 1 as the base value of lrr by assuming ksx was constant in the xylem of stems and leaves at a 1 m distance from the root collar to the evaporation site of the leaves the stem leaf hydraulic conductance lsx t 1 of plants was transformed by stem leaf hydraulic conductivity ksx l t 1 according to ahmad et al 2018 and gleason et al 2017 the base values of the stomatal parameters regarding caba and gs eqs 12 and 13 were referred to the experimental results of tardieu et al 1996 δ controls the participation activity of hl in stomatal regulation as absolute δ increases the regulation capacity of hl to gs is enhanced according to tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 2015 the reference δ values are 0 for sunflower however considering drought tolerance of the sunflower and to prevent serious xylem cavitation stiller and sperry 2002 ahmad et al 2018 cardoso et al 2018 we set the base δ as 0 2 referring to the simulation of couvreur et al 2014b we assumed that soil root contact loosening occurs when hs r equals 0 05 mpa and ks r decreases to 0 when hs r decreases to 1 5 mpa due to incomplete soil root contact a hypothetical state the water absorption is ignored if hs r below hsr 2 regarding the function of aquaporin responses based on the related experimental and simulation studies in section 2 2 2 we assumed that the krr would be subject to an increase of 200 r 2 when the hroot changes from 0 005 mpa to 0 1 mpa considering the correlation between apd and contact we preliminarily set the same base water potential thresholds for apd and contact 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation are quantified by different hydrophysiological parameters in the sr hrv model to test the sensitivity of simulated gs and swc to different parameters based on field observations of y2016 1 a classic sensitivity analysis method of morris 1991 was used in this study this method developed from one step at a time oat theory can effectively balance the efficiency and accuracy of the calculation regarding a model with k input parameters two sets of input parameters x and x are determined 21 x x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k x x 1 x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k where the same values in x and x are selected except for the ith parameter a variation step δ is added to the ith parameter in x δ is between 1 p 1 and 1 1 p 1 times the variation range for the ith parameter and p represents the change gradients of the ith parameter the elementary effects f i x of the ith parameter can be characterized as the change rate of model output y x and y x 22 f i x y x y x δ to avoid the randomness of parameter values the element effects for each input parameter are repeatedly estimated r times by randomly sampling x 1 x 2 x r two evaluation indexes μi and σi are defined as the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of the ith parameter 23 μ i 1 r j 1 r f i x j σ i 1 r 1 j 1 r f i x j μ i 2 where μi can assess the overall influence of an input ith parameter on the model output and σi can describe nonlinear effects and interactions between the ith and other parameters in this study to alleviate the influences of meteorology groundwater table and crop growth the cumulative values of μi and σi c μ and c σ were selected to evaluate the dynamic sensitivity responses of gs and swc to seven stomatal regulation parameters and seven soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters table 2 to avoid the disturbance of soil evaporation rainfall and groundwater table changes on soil water dynamics the swc at a 50 cm soil depth swc50 was selected in the sensitivity analysis nine levels between the ranges of 0 5 1 5 times the base values and 10 times r 10 random samplings were set for each parameter the input parameter dataset generation and evaluation index calculation were based on simlab software tarantola and becker 2017 3 2 4 calibration and validation of sensitive parameters to reduce the parameter uncertainty the plant hydraulic conductivity conductance sensitive stomatal parameters and sensitive soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters were selected to calibrate y2016 1 and y2017 and validate y2016 2 based on field experiments with sunflower plants in parameter calibration pest software white et al 2020 was used in this study which combines the fast convergence speed of the gauss newton method with the global search characteristics of the gradient descent method which can improve parameter adjustment efficiency and avoid the subjectivity of artificial parameter adjustment doherty 2004 the average weighted square relative difference fj between measured and simulated gs converted to the daily average from the observation at midday based on the sine function and swcs at seven depths were collected as the objective function the parameters can be calibrated by multiple stepwise iterative methods 24 min f j 1 m i 1 m γ 1 y i j s y i o 2 where y i o is the ith observed value y i j s is the ith simulated value in the jth optimization m is the total number of observations and γ is the weight of the ith observation in this study considering the differences in the number of observations of gs 1 and swcs 7 during a day the weights of relative square differences of gs were set as 7 times those of the swcs 3 3 simulation scenario design to better focus on soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects and their interaction with the stomatal behavior two types of ideal drying out scenarios were designed in our study simulation scenario i with the calibrated stomatal parameters the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact were investigated specifically five soil root hydraulic resistance scenarios i e i constant scenario without considering the root soil hydraulic resistance variations the variable soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios with the individual effects of the ii root aquaporins promotion aqp iii apoplastic path damage apd iv root soil contact loosening contact and v their interactive effects aqp apd contact a a c on the soil plant water potentials and rwu distribution were simulated respectively simulation scenario ii we expanded the calibrated stomatal regulations benchmarking stomatal sensitivity sen 10 to assume that plants have higher sen 30 more isohydric and lower sen 05 more anisohydric stomatal sensitivities to leaf water potential sen lepo and xylem aba concentration sen caba which were simulated by halving and tripling the calibrated stomatal parameters β and δ the stomatal sensitivity parameters regarding caba and hl as shown in eq 12 the effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations aqp apd and contact on plant transpiration and drought signal responses were compared when plants with different stomatal sensitivities in simulation scenarios i and ii a soil profile 0 100 cm vertically discretized in 1 cm layers was established the upper and bottom boundaries were controlled by constant atmospheric and free drainage conditions the soil physical properties were the same as those in the field experiment table 1 the atmospheric conditions and plant growth status including lai plant height and rld distribution were based on the measurements on 8 august 2016 when the sunflower development stage was equal to 1 0 the initial soil water pressure in each compartment was in hydrostatic equilibrium with the groundwater table at a depth of 5 m no rain irrigation or soil evaporation was assumed the soil water consumption or storage in the soil profile depended only on rwu and bottom drainage 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of the hydrophysiological parameters the cumulative sensitivity indexes c μ and c σ of simulated gs and swc50 to the hydrophysiological parameters of the sr hrv model are shown in fig 4 the c μ and c σ of simulated gs response to stomatal regulation parameters α β and δ and xylem aba concentration parameters a b and c are increased earlier and greater than to other parameters fig 4a and b especially the c μ and c σ of gs response to aba related parameters β a b and c increase from 0 01 m s 1 to 1 0 m s 1 which are obviously higher than to soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters these results might imply a response mechanism of the plants to drought stress that is the stomata actively respond before the occurrence of soil root hydraulic resistance variations this phenomenon has been reported by carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 for white lupins and vicia faba l the reason behind this is that the plants could reduce the stomatal aperture with the dual stimulations of hydraulic and chemical drought signals which effectively prevent water loss and water potential drop down around roots faiz and weatherley 1982 carminati et al 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 for some plants with more anisohydric behaviors such as sunflowers gs is insensitive to hydraulic signals tardieu and simonneau 1998 cardoso et al 2020 aba related processes would play a more essential role in regulating the stomatal behavior once plants suffer drought stress moreover compared to apd hroot 2 and hroot 4 and contact hsr 1 and hsr 2 parameters the c μ and c σ of simulated gs to aqp parameters r hroot 1 and hroot 3 are responded earlier and are generally greater before the 30th day this is attributed to the aqp effects being easily triggered in the simulation hroot 0 1 mpa even when the soil is relatively wet in this situation the increase in krr can effectively reduce the hydraulic resistance of the whole water transport system sade et al 2009 chaumont and tyerman 2014 however after the 30th and 60th days the c μ and c σ response to apd hroot 2 and hroot 4 and contact hsr 1 and hsr 2 parameters rapidly increase nearly 2 5 orders of magnitude even approach to the c μ and c σ of gs response to aqp parameters after 90th days which means that apd and contact began to dominantly regulate gs during this period as the explanation in section 4 3 these results are well responded to recent outstanding works from carminati and javaux 2020 and cai et al 2021 who verified that soil root hydraulic properties play a vital role in the soil plant water transport system in addition the response orders of the cumulative sensitivity indexes c μ and c σ of simulated swc50 to different parameters are similar to those of gs fig 4c and d this implies a close link between stomatal regulation and soil water status in the sr hrv model a greater gs induces higher transpiration and more negative water potential in plants thereby accelerating water consumption from the soil in contrast the continuous decrease in soil moisture prompts a considerable decrease in the water potential and hydraulic conductivity of the rhizosphere thereby stimulating drought signal production and stomatal closure the hydrophysiological parameters collectively participate in the hydraulic interaction between the stomata and soil thus the c μ and c σ of gs and swc50 to hydrophysiological parameters are synchronously responded however the parameter sensitivity might be different when plants with various hydrophysiological traits e g plant morphology stomatal sensitivity drought signal generation and resistance to soil root hydraulic resistance variations and growth conditions e g vapor pressure deficit and soil environments for example the soil hydraulic properties significantly affect water uptake patterns and soil plant hydraulics in drought situations cai et al 2021 the sensitivity of plant hydraulic traits including water potential resistance and water flux in the different organs or tissues of the plant to contact and apd parameters in sandy or loam soil is probably higher than those in clay soil because contact and apd are more easily triggered therefore it is necessary to test the parameter sensitivity in specific scenarios before the model application 4 2 calibration and validation of hydrophysiological parameters in this section besides lsx and krr the sensitive hydrophysiological parameters including three stomatal regulation parameters α β and δ and the most sensitive parameter in each hydrophysiological process of caba response aqp apd and contact b r hroot 4 and hsr 2 were selected for calibration y2016 1 and y2017 and validation y2016 2 using field observations of gs and swcs the calibrated parameters are shown in table 3 fig 5 b and d show the calibrated simulation results of gs and swcs in y2016 1 and y2017 the gs rapidly decreased after the 50th day in y2016 1 and eventually dropped down to below 0 001 m s 1 after the 100th day differently in y2017 gs decreased slightly from the 25th to the 50th day and then remained relatively stable at 0 01 0 0125 m s 1 the swcs 0 100 cm depth in y2016 1 decreased from 0 32 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 to 0 13 0 15 cm3 cm 3 during the whole simulation period while the swcs in y2017 maintained a higher status of 0 19 0 26 cm3 cm 3 at a soil depth of 50 90 cm these results indicate that the sunflower experienced varying degrees of drought stress in y2016 1 and y2017 more severe drought stress took place in y2016 1 which mainly resulted from the rapid decline in the groundwater table in 2016 in fig 5a similar to y2016 1 large declines of gs and swcs are simulated in y2016 2 for validation the simulated ks r in the validation rapidly decreased after the 80th day below ksoil and eventually dropped to 4 10 8 cm d 1 after the 90th day fig 5c which indicates that the contact effects were activated during this simulation period moreover influenced by the aqp effects the krr in the validation successively increased over 9 0 10 6 cm d 1 from the topsoil to deeper soil from the 40th to the 100th day however due to the apd effects krr gradually decreased after the 85th day the gs and swcs are two critical hydraulic indicators of the soil plant system which affect the water flow and drought signal generation in the leaf and rhizosphere carminati et al 2020 cai et al 2021 in the model calibration and validation we obtained relatively good agreements between simulations and observations for gs root mean square error rmse of 5 56 10 4 1 19 10 3 m s determination coefficient r2 of 0 87 0 98 and swcs rmse of 0 008 0 0511 cm3 cm 3 r2 of 0 70 0 99 moreover similar to the experimental results from tardieu et al 1996 tardieu et al 1998 who observed gs decreased from 0 053 m s 1 to 0 002 m s 1 at the hourly scale as hl decreased from 0 9 mpa to 2 5 mpa and caba increased from 0 to 425 μmol m 3 for sunflower we simulated gs decreased from 0 013 m s 1 to 0 001 m s 1 at the diurnal scale approximately from 0 041 m s 1 to 0 003 m s 1 at midday based on a sine function company with the hl decreased from 0 01 mpa to 1 7 mpa and caba increased from 48 to 423 μmol m 3 considering the genetic differences and environmental influences the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters were acceptable however as shown in table 4 several absolute correlation coefficients among calibrated parameters were over 0 8 which indicates parameter uncertainty might exist due to the equifinality of different parameters for the simulations of gs and swc thus more observations regarding leaf water potential root water potential xylem aba concentration root aquaporin activity root anatomy and root soil air gap are needed which would contribute to further reducing the uncertainty of model parameters 4 3 simulation scenario i effects of different soil root hydraulic resistance variations on water transport as shown in figs 6 8 the individual and interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations on the hydraulic traits of plants are simulated with the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters table 3 systematic analysis of the root soil hydraulic resistance variation effects helps elucidate the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations in section 4 4 4 3 1 aqp scenario the absolute water potentials of the root collar hcollar and leaf hl fig 6f and b in the aqp scenario are lower than those in the constant scenario when the absolute average soil water potential hs mean is below 0 45 mpa during the initial simulation period before the 30th days fig 6d the corresponding rwu is slightly enhanced fig 7d maintaining 0 012 0 013 cm3 cm 3 d 1 at a soil depth of 20 60 cm from the 8th to the 24th day these positive hydraulic responses are attributed to the increase in krr in the aqp scenario fig 7c which alleviates the potential gradient and increases the flux transmission from the rhizosphere to the leaves in mild drought conditions sade et al 2009 chaumont and tyerman 2014 and gambetta et al 2017 verified these promotion effects of aquaporin responses on the water permeability of root cells root hydraulic conductivity and plant transpiration however similar to the simulation case of aquaporin in couvreur et al 2014b these competitive aqp effects gradually disappeared in the later simulation stage this is mainly because the soil hydraulic resistance gradually replaces the root radial hydraulic resistance as the primary restriction in the soil root water path as the soil dries out thereby limiting the promotion effect of krr improvement on soil root water transport newman 1969 liu et al 2015 carminati and javaux 2020 4 3 2 apd scenario the value of h0 mean approach 1 8 mpa after the 30th day in the apd scenario fig 6e which is lower than that in the constant scenario 2 6 mpa however hcollar and hl increase faster than in the constant scenario fig 6b and f which are higher than 2 6 mpa on the 50th day these water potential responses indicate the inhibition of hydraulic transfer efficiency between the xylem and root surface due to the apd effects fig 7c which restricts the water potential decrease in the root surface thereby impeding the root water absorption as shown in fig 6a ta is slightly lower than it is in the constant scenario after the 40th day moreover from a modeling perspective according to equation 13 the inefficient water potential decrease in the root surface alleviates the increase in hplant and caba therefore caba in the apd scenario is slightly lower than that in the constant scenario fig 6c interestingly in a partial root zone drying experiment for potato solanum tuberosum l puertolas et al 2015 found that the root aba concentration accumulation of dry compartments in vertical heterogeneous conditions upper dry was lower than that in horizontal heterogeneous conditions according to recent developments in the field of aba biosynthesis and transport in a plant mcadam et al 2016 kuromori et al 2018 mcadam and brodribb 2018 the aba is mainly generated in leaves and supplied to the roots via the phloem the lower aba accumulation of the older roots in the upper layers implies that root aging or tissue damage e g apd might inhibit the aba synthesis in leaf and limits the aba concentration in the xylem 4 3 3 contact scenario different from the water potential status in the apd scenario h0 mean hcollar and hl constantly increased to 2 5 2 8 mpa after the 50th day in the contact scenario fig 6b e and f greater than those in the constant scenario however the increase in hs mean gradually approaches 1 0 mpa fig 6d which is lower than that in the constant scenario 1 5 mpa these phenomena are caused by hydraulic conductivity reduction in the rhizosphere fig 7b which alleviates water potential decrease in the bulk soil but accelerates the decrease in the root surface and xylem thereby slightly increasing the caba level fig 6c with the combined effects of hl and caba ta further decreases below the constant scenario from the 30th to the 60th day fig 6a therefore we conjecture that the stomatal aperture rather than merely relying on the hydraulic signal stimulation is also closely regulated by the aba or other chemical signals when the air gap gradually appears this positive stimulation of chemical signal probably can explain the experimental results of carminati et al 2013 and koebernick et al 2018 who observed a proactive decrease in transpiration before the occurrence of contact 4 3 4 a a c scenario with the interactive effects of three soil root hydraulic resistance variations a a c the hydraulic responses of plants vary over time initially the water potentials of the leaf and root collar are similar to those in the aqp scenario before the 30th day fig 6b and f the rwu is also enhanced at this stage fig 7d at the later simulation stage the decreases in hs mean fig 6d and h0 mean fig 6e are restricted by the effects of contact and apd respectively while the variations of ta fig 6a and rwu fig 7d in the a a c are similar to the contact scenario rather than the apd scenario meanwhile as shown in fig 8a the relation between ta and hs mean in the a a c scenario is close to the contact scenario these results indicate that contact restricts the response of water flux including ta equivalent to stomatal conductance and rwu to severe soil dehydration from a modeling perspective this is because although apd prevents the water potential decrease at the root surface it is also low enough 0 9 mpa 1 8 mpa to trigger the contact 0 05 mpa and causes a matric flux potential drop down at the soil root interface however caba and hl in the a a c scenario are similar to those in the apd scenario fig 6b and c and as shown in fig 8b the relation between ta and hl in the a a c scenario is closer to the apd scenario these results indicate that apd controls the drought signal responses and their regulation on ta equivalent to stomatal conductance therefore we conjecture that the hydraulic traits in the a a c scenario are determined by the unique and targeted effects of individual soil root hydraulic resistance variation rather than their simple accumulation significantly the occurrences and dynamic effects of contact and apd should be particularly considered when plants suffer from severe drought stress because they regulate the water flux and drought signal responses respectively meanwhile it is worth noting that contact and apd are two dynamic inter enforcing processes as stated by carminati et al 2013 as a result of root apoplastic path damage apd and root shrink air gap formation contact increases the hydraulic resistance in the rhizosphere which further accelerates apd moreover owing to the unique effects of contact and apd on soil and root water potential fig 6d and e the observations of soil and root water potential might be the appropriate variables to parameterize these two processes when the plant is in a drought situation furthermore complex hydrophysiological factors e g soil texture and density root hair activity and mucilage secretion are involved in the apd and contact processes carminati et al 2016 koebernick et al 2018 how to macroscopically quantify these effects and eliminate the scale effects between experimental observations and parameter determinations remains an open question 4 4 simulation scenario ii effect of stomatal regulations on the variation in root soil hydraulic resistance taking the situation simulated with calibrated stomatal parameters as a benchmark sen 10 the deviations of ta and relations between hl and hs mean figs 9 and 10 in different soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios and stomatal sensitivity situations are compared in this section 4 4 1 stomatal sensitivity in the sen 30 situations stomata are more sensitive to drought signals than they are in the sen 10 situations plants maintain high transpiration of 0 60 0 65 cm d 1 for a shorter time 0 15 days while the lower water consumption alleviates the decrease in ta at the later stage fig 9a moreover as shown in fig 10 the sensitive stomatal responses in the sen 30 situations prevent the increases in hl 1 6 mpa and caba 400 μmol m 3 as hs mean increase these results imply a cautious stomatal strategy more isohydric behavior of the plants to adapt to long term drought stress martin stpaul et al 2017 however when stomata are less sensitive to the drought signals in the sen 05 situations more anisohydric behavior the opposite traits of ta are presented as time goes by plants maintain high transpiration of 0 65 0 7 cm d 1 for a longer time 0 30 days the greater water consumption accelerates the decrease in transpiration in the later stage fig 9a the corresponding hl increase to 2 5 3 8 mpa and caba over 800 μmol m 3 rapidly increase as hs mean increase in sen 05 situations fig 10a 4 4 2 performances of aqp apd and contact distinct hydraulic responses are presented in different soil root hydraulic resistance variation scenarios and stomatal sensitivity situations compared with the constant scenario in the sen 10 situation fig 9b the relative transpiration in the aqp scenario is greater than 1 and gradually increases before the 27th day while after that it begins to decrease and decrease below 0 95 from the 31st to 36th day interestingly the variation ranges of relative transpiration in the aqp scenario are reduced and amplified in the sen 05 and sen 30 situations fig 9c respectively these simulation phenomena imply that the aqp effects are constrained under insensitive stomatal situations when plants with more anisohydric behavior from the modeling perspective one possible reason is that the aqp mainly acts at the initial simulation stage when the soil is relatively wet as described in section 4 3 only a few hydraulic hl 1 3 mpa and aba caba 200 μmol m 3 signals are produced from the aqp effects to regulate the stomatal aperture during this period these disturbances are diluted for plants with insensitive stomatal responses because of the relatively high drought signal level in this situation as shown in the sen 05 situation fig 10c however paradoxically the root aquaporin activity of anisohydric plants seems to be more active than isohydric plants such as vandeleur et al 2009 found that the permeability of root cortex cells of chardonnay an anisohydric cultivar of grapevine is higher than grenache an isohydric cultivar of grapevine under drought stress due to the upregulation of pips plasma membrane intrinsic proteins this phenomenon implies complex hydrophysiological responses of plants to drought it is not enough to describe the plant hydraulic behavior merely at a local organ scale more attention should be paid to the interactions between different organs and hydraulic behaviors in soil plant water transport modeling in the apd and contact scenarios the relative transpiration is approximately 1 0 before the 30th day in the sen 10 situation fig 9b but after then it rapidly decreases to 0 95 and 0 7 on the 33rd 35th days similar variation ranges of relative transpiration are presented in the sen 05 situation fig 9c however in the sen 30 situation fig 9c the variation ranges of relative transpiration are reduced which indicates that the sensitive stomatal response protects plant transpiration from the influences of apd and contact especially apd the reason is that the sensitive stomatal regulation restricts leaf water loss by immediate closure of stomata thereby preventing the water potential from further decreasing in the soil plant system as shown in fig 10d and e similarly martin stpaul et al 2017 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 and carminati et al 2020 successively demonstrated the importance of stomatal closure to prevent xylem embolism and alleviate the formation of a large gradient in water potential around the roots moreover due to the greater regulation capacity of contact with respect to transpiration response to soil dehydration in the a a c scenario as explained in section 4 3 similar relative transpiration responses are obtained in the contact and a a c scenarios in the sen 10 and sen 05 situations fig 9b and c furthermore as shown in fig 10b and e as hs mean increases in the contact and a a c scenarios the hl and caba rapidly increase which would stimulate the stomatal closure and implies that contact limits soil water availability of plants however as a result of the effects of apd on drought signal responses as explained in section 4 3 as hs mean increases the increases in hl in a a c scenarios are slightly greater than those in contact scenarios 4 4 3 regulations of hydraulic and chemical signals compared with the benchmarking situation the deviations of ta hl and caba in the sen caba situations are greater than those in the sen lepo situations figs 9 10 these results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis of the aba related parameters in section 4 1 indicating that the stomatal responses to aba signals have significant impacts on water transport in the simulation similar simulation results were presented by huber et al 2015 an argument is put forward that only relying on the regulation of leaf water potential is insufficient to portray the stomatal behavior and hydraulic properties of plants with more anisohydric behaviors an appropriate description of stomatal responses to chemical signals is necessary for these plants in water transport modeling furthermore it is worth noting that the drought signals also participate in other hydraulic and physiological processes for example a lower plant water potential can induce hydraulic failure in the xylem embolism mcdowell et al 2008 martin stpaul et al 2017 and aba concentration is also correlated with biomass assimilations of leaves and roots puertolas et al 2015 dinneny 2019 while these processes are not the focus of this paper moreover a complex root shoot signaling interaction is behind the aba biosynthesis and accumulation in plants while the xylem aba concentration in the leaf was simplify quantified by a function of the mean status of water potential in shoot and root in this study which might induce the uncertainty in stomatal response to soil root hydraulic variation especially to apd and due to the physiological and genetic differences among species other chemical signals such as the cytokinin and ph in leaf tissues also participate in stomatal regulation davies et al 2002 chaves et al 2003 the generation mechanism and regulation ability of these chemical solutes may affect the responses of gs and hl to drought iso anisohydric behavior however how to quantify the effects of these chemical solutes and whether these effects are necessary to consider in the stomatal model need more exploration in further studies 5 conclusions and outlooks in this study we proposed a soil plant hydraulic model sr hrv by improving the macroscopic physical rwu model of de jong van lier et al 2008 de jong van lier et al 2013 and explicitly describing the upper boundary with the tardieu davies 1996 tardieu davies 2015 stomatal conductance model compared with previous studies the sr hrv model innovatively bridges the gap with hydraulic and chemical signals to simulate the interactions between soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation the effects of three universal hydraulic resistance variations of root aquaporins promotion aqp root apoplastic path damage apd and root soil contact loosening contact were specifically characterized by piecewise linear functions based on the parameter sensitivity analysis and calibration the dynamic interactions of soil root hydraulic resistance variations and stomatal regulation on the hydraulic traits of plants were simulated in different scenarios the following conclusions can be made 1 the sensitivity of simulated gs and swc50 to stomatal regulation parameters especially to the aba signal correlated parameters respond earlier and greater than the soil root hydraulic resistance variation parameters however the sensitivity to apd and contact parameters would rapidly increase with further soil dehydration 2 three soil root hydraulic resistance variations distinctively affect the plant hydraulic traits in the a a c scenario aqp improves root water absorption and affects transpiration when plants are in mild drought conditions contact and apd respectively regulate the water flux and drought signal responses when plants suffer severe drought stress 3 the increase of stomatal sensitivity to drought signals induces early transpiration reduction but alleviates the transpiration decline for a longer time which enhances the aqp effects and eliminates the effects of apd and contact conversely when stomatal sensitivity decrease to drought signals especially to aba signal the opposite responses of soil root hydraulic resistance variations effects are presented the above conclusions contribute to exploring the primary hydrophysiological response and balancing the simulation accuracy and model complexity in soil plant water transport modeling for plants with a more anisohydric behavior the regulation of chemical signals on stomatal conductance should be considered moreover it is essential to understand the stomatal sensitivity of plants which determines the necessity to consider the effects of soil root hydraulic resistance variations in water transport modeling the primary influential factor of soil root hydraulic resistance variation relies on the soil plant water situation some hydrophysiological responses can be simplified in the simulation such as the aqp effects in severe drought conditions and apd contact effects in mild drought conditions while the interactive effects of apd and contact should be particularly considered when plants suffer continuous drought stress based on the calibrated hydrophysiological parameters the sr hrv model favorably simulated the stomatal conductance soil water status and soil root hydraulic resistance variations at the field scale however some assumptions were made during the model development due to data limitations in the literature such as the soil root hydraulic resistance variation effects were quantified by the linear functions of hydraulic status in the soil root system the xylem aba concentration was considered to be related to the average hydraulic status of the leaf and root and to simplify the model the root xylem resistance the formation of xylem cavitation and the hysteresis effects of stomatal response and soil root hydraulic resistance variation were not considered in this study these assumptions may have an impact on simulation results of soil root hydraulic resistance drought signal generation and stomatal response such as the quantification of xylem aba concentration accounting for the synthetic effects of the shoot and root hydraulic states which affects the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations thus the rationality and potential effects of these assumptions need further clarification based on the detailed hydro morpho physiological observations in plant drought experiments moreover exhaustive parameter calibration is beneficial for model application for the parameters of stomatal regulation and xylem aba concentration responses it is recommended to employ convenient observations of stomatal conductance xylem aba concentration and leaf water potential in calibrations while for the parameter calibrations of soil root hydraulic resistance variations besides the essential measurements of soil water status and root water potential the observations of root morphology anatomy and aquaporins activity are also advised furthermore the interactions between stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations should be tested under various soil types and atmospheric conditions it is promising to couple the sr hrv model with other physiological simulations including carbon assimilation and biomass allocation which provide a promising way to explore the influences of stomatal regulation and soil root hydraulic resistance variations on crop growth yield formation and the water carbon cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

2497,predicting water quality accurately is of great significance in water resource management data driven models e g neural networks perform effectively in this task high quality original datasets are necessary to build higher accuracy prediction models as missing data commonly exists this paper presents a novel piecewise multivariate imputation pwimp method for dealing with missing data in water quality series to obtain a prediction model with higher accuracy wavelet shrinkage denoising based on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt is used to reduce the noise of the original data after imputation four datasets which were generated by global multivariate imputation glimp pwimp coupling glimp and modwt and coupling pwimp and modwt are evaluated by the outcome of the long short term memory lstm neural networks in terms of six statistical indices the results show that the effect of pwimp is significantly better than that of glimp and is competitive with the method of coupling glimp and modwt the method of coupling pwimp and modwt significantly outperforms the other three models keywords missing data maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform water quality prediction long short term memory data availability datasets and the complete r source code are available for download at https github com keunghe source code for handing missing data in water quality by pwimp method 1 introduction since water is the material basis for human beings to survive grow and develop water quality cannot be ignored because water resources are unevenly distributed in time and space research on water quality prediction is significant and can help to plan and manage water resources it is difficult for traditional models to make a high accuracy water quality prediction since the water related data have nonlinearity nonstationary features uncertainty and randomness votruba 1988 artificial neural networks anns can handle these problems due to their ability to infinitely approximate any function however anns cannot preserve time information khan and chai 2017 recurrent neural networks rnns perform better in time series issues due to their ability to preserve information from previous moments nevertheless traditional rnns have drawbacks in gradient transfer and cannot solve the long time dependence problem to solve these problems long short term memory lstm was proposed and it has been successfully applied in water quality prediction abbas et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 zhou 2020 song et al 2021 in the case of lstm the quality of the original data is very important however missing data is a common occurrence in water quality assessment some factors such as equipment failures inadequate sampling procedures regular maintenance and artificial changes in sensor parameter settings may lead to numerous missing values in original water quality datasets ma et al 2020 which significantly limits water quality prediction for physics based models missing data will decrease model accuracy by affecting parameter estimates and for data driven models missing data will influence the model structure due to missing information in the original data gill et al 2007 hence preprocessing missing data is indispensable in recent years some studies have focused on exploring valid approaches to reduce the negative effects of missing data asadollah et al 2021 the two most common methods for handling missing data are deletion processing and imputation processing armijo olivo et al 2009 where the former is easy to implement but the effect is poor which will extensively decrease the statistical performance of subsequent models and create bias many imputation approaches have been proposed such as the expectation maximization em algorithm gaetan and yao 2003 the data augmentation da algorithm imtiaz and shah 2008 and missforest stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 in regard to multivariate problems one of the most popular approaches is multivariate imputation which has been applied in many fields and is easy to implement via statistical software or statistical language such as statistical product and service solutions spss statistical analysis system sas and r language however multivariate imputation was originally developed for survey data but not for spatiotemporal data thus implementing multivariate imputation directly by global multivariate imputation glimp which lets the entire original dataset be the interpolating dataset is unreasonable and it turns out that the effect is poorer than other methods dumedah and coulibaly 2011 feng et al 2014 due to the impact of monitoring facilities monitoring methods and water quality time series contain certain complex noise kang and lin 2007 therefore to obtain a higher accuracy of water quality prediction implementing the denoising technique is of great significance threshold shrinkage denoising based on wavelet transform is a universal method and it performs well taswell 2000 discrete wavelet transform dwt has been successfully applied to time series issues chan and fu 1999 wu et al 2000 keogh et al 2001 rhif et al 2019 to overcome the drawbacks of the dwt such as the limitation in the length of the series and without the property of displacement invariance the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt is proposed and it has been coupled with the series prediction methods in recent years some examples can be found in walden 2001 alarcon aquino and barria 2006 ann maharaj et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 in this study a novel and effective implementation method of multivariate imputation pwimp for dealing with water quality time series data is introduced and applied pwimp divides the original dataset into a few sub datasets based on the missing segments and then each sub dataset is filled in and combined to obtain a complete dataset pwimp can reflect both of the uncertainty and temporal information of the original data in addition threshold denoising based on modwt is implemented to get higher quality original data the lstm is used for predicting the dissolved oxygen do in london uk four models glimp lstm pwimp lstm glimp modwt lstm and pwimp modwt lstm are built to illustrate the effect of pwimp 2 methods 2 1 multivariate imputation multivariate imputation which was proposed by rubin 1987 often assumes that data scarcity obeys the pattern of missing completely at random mcar or missing at random mar mcar means that the missing observations are a random subset of all observations the missing and observed values will have similar distributions whereas mar means there might be systematic differences between the missing and observed values but these can be entirely explained by other observed variables for water quality data limitations cause the missing data during water quality samplings such as critical weather equipment which is call mcar type and limitation during analysis water quality in the laboratory like a non detection limit of equipment and missing record which is call mar type sillberg et al 2021 since the mar is a broader case an assumption that water quality data follow mar is accepted in this study van buuren 2018 the core of multivariate imputation is to produce many imputation values and form complete sample datasets multivariate imputation by chain equations mice achieved by the mice function in r software r core team 2021 is used in this study because it has been widely implemented in many fields white et al 2011 bouhlila and sellaouti 2013 romaniuk et al 2014 fig 1 plots the general implementation procedures of mice more details can be found in azur et al 2011 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 in this study random forest rf is chosen as the imputation method for the reason that rf based mice method has been proved to be of great performance finch et al 2016 chhabra et al 2017 smith et al 2021 the pwimp is obtained by modifying the original inputs of the general imputation procedures as shown in fig 2 for each missing segment intercept a segment containing both missing and non missing data by expanding forward and backward as a subset of the original data thereafter let the subset as the input data of mice to generate a complete subset thus we can obtain a complete dataset by combining all the subsets 2 2 modwt the modwt is an improved version of the dwt percival and walden 2000 both dwt and modwt allow to perform a multi resolution analysis which is a scale based additive decomposition the definition of modwt can be obtained directly from the dwt which can be written as follows zhu et al 2014 1 h j l h j l 2 j 2 g j l g j l 2 j 2 where h j l is the dwt wavelet filter g j l is the scaling filter h j l is the modwt wavelet filter and g j l is the modwt scaling filter l 1 2 l is the length of the filter then the modwt wavelet coefficients of level j can be defined as the convolution of the time series x x 0 x 1 x n 1 and the modwt filters can be written as follows zhu et al 2014 2 w j t l 0 l j 1 h j l x t l mod n 3 v j t l 0 l j 1 g j l x t l mod n where l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 it should be noted that the modwt wavelet coefficients at each scale will have the same length as the original signal x then they can be expressed in matrix notation as follows zhu et al 2014 4 w j ω j x and v j v j x where each row of the n n matrix ω j has values dictated by h j l while v j has values dictated by g j l the original time series x can be recovered from its modwt by the following equation zhu et al 2014 5 x j 1 j ω j t w j v j t v j j 1 j d j s j where d j ω j w j and s j v j v j it indicates that a time series can be represented as the detailed part from level 1 to level j and the core part of level j in this study the suggested level of decomposition of modwt is as follows 6 j max j log n 1 l 1 1 j z where z denotes the set of all positive integers 2 3 wavelet shrinkage generally one observation x x 1 x 2 x n in the time series model can be expressed as 7 x i g i e i for i 1 2 n where x i is the real observation e i is the noise and g i is the noiseless observation because modwt is linear the wavelet transform model can be written as follows 8 d d ε where d w x d w g ε w e and w is the wavelet coefficient matrix of the original time series the core idea of wavelet shrinkage is that if the elements of the matrix w are less than a threshold λ then such elements will be treated as noise and set to 0 the hard thresholding function can be written as follows 9 w w i w λ where i is the indicator function which can be written as follows 10 i 1 w λ 0 w λ more details of wavelet shrinkage can be found in donoho et al 1995 2 4 lstm the lstm which is a special architecture of rnn to conquer the exploding and vanishing gradient bottlenecks owing to the gradient propagation of the rnn over multiple layers was first proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the structures of the rnn and lstm are shown in fig 3 generally c indicates the cell state of the lstm memory and h indicates the hidden layer state of the node each memory contains one or more memory cells and three types of gates a forget gate an input gate and an output gate the forget gate controls the effect of historical information on the current cell state f t determining the degree of the passage of the cell state c t 1 at the previous moment can be written as hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 11 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where h t 1 is the hidden layer state at moment t 1 σ is the sigmoid activation function w f is the input weight matrix x t is the input value of the node at the current moment and b f is the bias term the input gate determines what information enters the memory cell and the combination of the forget gate and the input gate determines the update of cell state c t the processes can be written as follows hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 12 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 13 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 14 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where i t is the input gate vector value c t is the new information c t is the cell state at moment t b i and b c are bias terms and w c is the input weight matrix the output gate controls the output of cell state values which are processed by the tanh activation function and then multiplied by the memory cell state values to obtain the output information the processes can be written as follows 15 o t σ w 0 h t 1 x t b 0 16 h t o t tanh c t where h t is the hidden layer state at moment t w 0 is the input weight matrix o t is the output value and b 0 is the bias term as observed from eqs 11 to 16 the lstm node linearly modifies the information on the cell state through the gate structure which ensures that the temporal correlation does not decay even if the time series becomes longer 2 5 error evaluation criteria in this study the performances of the proposed models were evaluated using six statistical indices namely the index of agreement ia root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape correlation coefficient cc and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc the expressions of the six statistical indices can be written as follows 17 ia 1 i 1 n x x 2 i 1 n x x x x 2 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 19 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i 20 mape 1 n i 1 n x i x i x i 100 21 cc i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 22 nsc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where n is the length of the time series x i and x i are the actual and predicted values of water quality at time i respectively x and x are the average values of the actual and predicted water quality respectively the smaller mae mape and rmse are the better the model is ia varying between 0 and 1 represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and the higher the better the closer to 1 cc is the better the positive correlation the nsc which was first invented by nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranging from to 1 is considered a perfect match of predicted data to the observed data when equaling one the performance of the threshold shrinkage denoising is evaluated by three indices namely cc signal to noise ratio r xn and residual energy percentage e xn the formula to calculate cc can be expressed by eq 21 the expression of r xn can be written as 23 r xn 10 log i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 the energy percentage e xn of the noise reduced sequence to the original sequence is defined as 24 e xn e 0 e i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 where x i is the original sequence x i is the signal after denoising e 0 and e are the sequence energy of the original sequence and denoised sequence respectively if the signal x i has a high r xn after denoising it means that the effect of denoising is good the larger e xn is the closer the denoised sequence is to the original sequence 3 database the dataset used in this study can be found in leach et al 2013 according to the supporting documents of the data data were collected continuously at 30 minute intervals for periods of variable lengths depending on site between 1994 and 1997 fig 4 presents the location distribution of the sampling sites and note that only data of ten sites are contained in the dataset the data of these sites are suffering from missing data including single sample missing and segment missing filling in missing data of such a high temporal resolution dataset is meaningful there were five variables in this dataset and four variables ph ph conductivity 25c cd25 dissolved oxygen do and temperature water temp were used in this study there are ten user codes in this dataset and c9 is chosen because it has the largest samples some statistical indices of the collected dataset are listed in table 1 the presence and absence data can be found in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the original dataset has 1 727 samples with a lack of all variables and 288 samples with a lack of do 4 model development 4 1 construction of the pwimp lstm model the multivariate imputation procedures are implemented via the r package mice van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 in this study as mentioned in section 2 1 the pwimp is modified from a divided original dataset into pieces as input while the input of the glimp is the whole original dataset the pwimp model can be described as follows 1 let r 0 s i and p i be the original data series the missing segment and the subsequence of r 0 i 1 2 3 n respectively the relation between p i and s i can be written as follows 25 p i s il s i s ir where both s il and s ir are complete subsequences of r 0 s il is connected before s i and s ir is

can be written as 27 m m i α m i m i β m i 1 α β 1 the best performance of the pwimp is guaranteed by using the optimum values of α and β to evaluate which α β is the best the lstm model will receive

by eq 17 it should be noted that different input data generated by the pwimp are inputted into the lstm with the same hyperparameter which is not the subject in this study 2 determination of α β there

the energy percentage and correlation coefficient the conclusion is the same this means that modwt performs well in both glimp and pwimp in denoising and original signal retention 5 3 evaluation of the proposed models the predicting performance comparisons of these four models are listed in table 5 and figs 9 and 10 as shown comparing pwimp lstm with glimp lstm mae mape and rmse decreased by 18

significantly good comparing glimp modwt lstm with pwimp lstm glimp modwt lstm has lower mae mape and higher cc but has higher rmse and lower nsc and ia this means that even if the dataset generated

the mae and nsc of the pwimp modwt lstm changed significantly fig 12 shows the change of mae and nsc with the variation in α is significant as well which means that both α and β are significant parameters in the pwimp modwt lstm and not only does the modwt make a great contribution to the accuracy of the model 5 5 comparison between these four imputation methods on computation time since the modwt based denoising process cost little time the difference in computation time of these four models comes from the pwimp and glimp the comparison in computation time of these four models can be carried out by comparing the computation time between the pwimp and the glimp process the programs of pwimp and glimp were executed 10 times each on an intel r core tm i7 10875h cpu and the mean

is significantly better compared with modwt pwimp works almost as well as modwt it is verified twice that piecewise multivariate imputation is a powerful method in dealing with time series problems in addition when both pwimp and modwt were used to preprocess the original time series the mae of do validation was only 2 643 percent saturation while the mean value of do was 68 39 percent saturation

2497,predicting water quality accurately is of great significance in water resource management data driven models e g neural networks perform effectively in this task high quality original datasets are necessary to build higher accuracy prediction models as missing data commonly exists this paper presents a novel piecewise multivariate imputation pwimp method for dealing with missing data in water quality series to obtain a prediction model with higher accuracy wavelet shrinkage denoising based on the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt is used to reduce the noise of the original data after imputation four datasets which were generated by global multivariate imputation glimp pwimp coupling glimp and modwt and coupling pwimp and modwt are evaluated by the outcome of the long short term memory lstm neural networks in terms of six statistical indices the results show that the effect of pwimp is significantly better than that of glimp and is competitive with the method of coupling glimp and modwt the method of coupling pwimp and modwt significantly outperforms the other three models keywords missing data maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform water quality prediction long short term memory data availability datasets and the complete r source code are available for download at https github com keunghe source code for handing missing data in water quality by pwimp method 1 introduction since water is the material basis for human beings to survive grow and develop water quality cannot be ignored because water resources are unevenly distributed in time and space research on water quality prediction is significant and can help to plan and manage water resources it is difficult for traditional models to make a high accuracy water quality prediction since the water related data have nonlinearity nonstationary features uncertainty and randomness votruba 1988 artificial neural networks anns can handle these problems due to their ability to infinitely approximate any function however anns cannot preserve time information khan and chai 2017 recurrent neural networks rnns perform better in time series issues due to their ability to preserve information from previous moments nevertheless traditional rnns have drawbacks in gradient transfer and cannot solve the long time dependence problem to solve these problems long short term memory lstm was proposed and it has been successfully applied in water quality prediction abbas et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 zhou 2020 song et al 2021 in the case of lstm the quality of the original data is very important however missing data is a common occurrence in water quality assessment some factors such as equipment failures inadequate sampling procedures regular maintenance and artificial changes in sensor parameter settings may lead to numerous missing values in original water quality datasets ma et al 2020 which significantly limits water quality prediction for physics based models missing data will decrease model accuracy by affecting parameter estimates and for data driven models missing data will influence the model structure due to missing information in the original data gill et al 2007 hence preprocessing missing data is indispensable in recent years some studies have focused on exploring valid approaches to reduce the negative effects of missing data asadollah et al 2021 the two most common methods for handling missing data are deletion processing and imputation processing armijo olivo et al 2009 where the former is easy to implement but the effect is poor which will extensively decrease the statistical performance of subsequent models and create bias many imputation approaches have been proposed such as the expectation maximization em algorithm gaetan and yao 2003 the data augmentation da algorithm imtiaz and shah 2008 and missforest stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 in regard to multivariate problems one of the most popular approaches is multivariate imputation which has been applied in many fields and is easy to implement via statistical software or statistical language such as statistical product and service solutions spss statistical analysis system sas and r language however multivariate imputation was originally developed for survey data but not for spatiotemporal data thus implementing multivariate imputation directly by global multivariate imputation glimp which lets the entire original dataset be the interpolating dataset is unreasonable and it turns out that the effect is poorer than other methods dumedah and coulibaly 2011 feng et al 2014 due to the impact of monitoring facilities monitoring methods and water quality time series contain certain complex noise kang and lin 2007 therefore to obtain a higher accuracy of water quality prediction implementing the denoising technique is of great significance threshold shrinkage denoising based on wavelet transform is a universal method and it performs well taswell 2000 discrete wavelet transform dwt has been successfully applied to time series issues chan and fu 1999 wu et al 2000 keogh et al 2001 rhif et al 2019 to overcome the drawbacks of the dwt such as the limitation in the length of the series and without the property of displacement invariance the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt is proposed and it has been coupled with the series prediction methods in recent years some examples can be found in walden 2001 alarcon aquino and barria 2006 ann maharaj et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 in this study a novel and effective implementation method of multivariate imputation pwimp for dealing with water quality time series data is introduced and applied pwimp divides the original dataset into a few sub datasets based on the missing segments and then each sub dataset is filled in and combined to obtain a complete dataset pwimp can reflect both of the uncertainty and temporal information of the original data in addition threshold denoising based on modwt is implemented to get higher quality original data the lstm is used for predicting the dissolved oxygen do in london uk four models glimp lstm pwimp lstm glimp modwt lstm and pwimp modwt lstm are built to illustrate the effect of pwimp 2 methods 2 1 multivariate imputation multivariate imputation which was proposed by rubin 1987 often assumes that data scarcity obeys the pattern of missing completely at random mcar or missing at random mar mcar means that the missing observations are a random subset of all observations the missing and observed values will have similar distributions whereas mar means there might be systematic differences between the missing and observed values but these can be entirely explained by other observed variables for water quality data limitations cause the missing data during water quality samplings such as critical weather equipment which is call mcar type and limitation during analysis water quality in the laboratory like a non detection limit of equipment and missing record which is call mar type sillberg et al 2021 since the mar is a broader case an assumption that water quality data follow mar is accepted in this study van buuren 2018 the core of multivariate imputation is to produce many imputation values and form complete sample datasets multivariate imputation by chain equations mice achieved by the mice function in r software r core team 2021 is used in this study because it has been widely implemented in many fields white et al 2011 bouhlila and sellaouti 2013 romaniuk et al 2014 fig 1 plots the general implementation procedures of mice more details can be found in azur et al 2011 van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 in this study random forest rf is chosen as the imputation method for the reason that rf based mice method has been proved to be of great performance finch et al 2016 chhabra et al 2017 smith et al 2021 the pwimp is obtained by modifying the original inputs of the general imputation procedures as shown in fig 2 for each missing segment intercept a segment containing both missing and non missing data by expanding forward and backward as a subset of the original data thereafter let the subset as the input data of mice to generate a complete subset thus we can obtain a complete dataset by combining all the subsets 2 2 modwt the modwt is an improved version of the dwt percival and walden 2000 both dwt and modwt allow to perform a multi resolution analysis which is a scale based additive decomposition the definition of modwt can be obtained directly from the dwt which can be written as follows zhu et al 2014 1 h j l h j l 2 j 2 g j l g j l 2 j 2 where h j l is the dwt wavelet filter g j l is the scaling filter h j l is the modwt wavelet filter and g j l is the modwt scaling filter l 1 2 l is the length of the filter then the modwt wavelet coefficients of level j can be defined as the convolution of the time series x x 0 x 1 x n 1 and the modwt filters can be written as follows zhu et al 2014 2 w j t l 0 l j 1 h j l x t l mod n 3 v j t l 0 l j 1 g j l x t l mod n where l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 it should be noted that the modwt wavelet coefficients at each scale will have the same length as the original signal x then they can be expressed in matrix notation as follows zhu et al 2014 4 w j ω j x and v j v j x where each row of the n n matrix ω j has values dictated by h j l while v j has values dictated by g j l the original time series x can be recovered from its modwt by the following equation zhu et al 2014 5 x j 1 j ω j t w j v j t v j j 1 j d j s j where d j ω j w j and s j v j v j it indicates that a time series can be represented as the detailed part from level 1 to level j and the core part of level j in this study the suggested level of decomposition of modwt is as follows 6 j max j log n 1 l 1 1 j z where z denotes the set of all positive integers 2 3 wavelet shrinkage generally one observation x x 1 x 2 x n in the time series model can be expressed as 7 x i g i e i for i 1 2 n where x i is the real observation e i is the noise and g i is the noiseless observation because modwt is linear the wavelet transform model can be written as follows 8 d d ε where d w x d w g ε w e and w is the wavelet coefficient matrix of the original time series the core idea of wavelet shrinkage is that if the elements of the matrix w are less than a threshold λ then such elements will be treated as noise and set to 0 the hard thresholding function can be written as follows 9 w w i w λ where i is the indicator function which can be written as follows 10 i 1 w λ 0 w λ more details of wavelet shrinkage can be found in donoho et al 1995 2 4 lstm the lstm which is a special architecture of rnn to conquer the exploding and vanishing gradient bottlenecks owing to the gradient propagation of the rnn over multiple layers was first proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the structures of the rnn and lstm are shown in fig 3 generally c indicates the cell state of the lstm memory and h indicates the hidden layer state of the node each memory contains one or more memory cells and three types of gates a forget gate an input gate and an output gate the forget gate controls the effect of historical information on the current cell state f t determining the degree of the passage of the cell state c t 1 at the previous moment can be written as hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 11 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where h t 1 is the hidden layer state at moment t 1 σ is the sigmoid activation function w f is the input weight matrix x t is the input value of the node at the current moment and b f is the bias term the input gate determines what information enters the memory cell and the combination of the forget gate and the input gate determines the update of cell state c t the processes can be written as follows hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 12 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 13 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 14 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where i t is the input gate vector value c t is the new information c t is the cell state at moment t b i and b c are bias terms and w c is the input weight matrix the output gate controls the output of cell state values which are processed by the tanh activation function and then multiplied by the memory cell state values to obtain the output information the processes can be written as follows 15 o t σ w 0 h t 1 x t b 0 16 h t o t tanh c t where h t is the hidden layer state at moment t w 0 is the input weight matrix o t is the output value and b 0 is the bias term as observed from eqs 11 to 16 the lstm node linearly modifies the information on the cell state through the gate structure which ensures that the temporal correlation does not decay even if the time series becomes longer 2 5 error evaluation criteria in this study the performances of the proposed models were evaluated using six statistical indices namely the index of agreement ia root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae mean absolute percentage error mape correlation coefficient cc and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nsc the expressions of the six statistical indices can be written as follows 17 ia 1 i 1 n x x 2 i 1 n x x x x 2 18 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 19 mae 1 n i 1 n x i x i 20 mape 1 n i 1 n x i x i x i 100 21 cc i 1 n x i x x i x i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 22 nsc 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where n is the length of the time series x i and x i are the actual and predicted values of water quality at time i respectively x and x are the average values of the actual and predicted water quality respectively the smaller mae mape and rmse are the better the model is ia varying between 0 and 1 represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and the higher the better the closer to 1 cc is the better the positive correlation the nsc which was first invented by nash and sutcliffe 1970 ranging from to 1 is considered a perfect match of predicted data to the observed data when equaling one the performance of the threshold shrinkage denoising is evaluated by three indices namely cc signal to noise ratio r xn and residual energy percentage e xn the formula to calculate cc can be expressed by eq 21 the expression of r xn can be written as 23 r xn 10 log i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i x i 2 the energy percentage e xn of the noise reduced sequence to the original sequence is defined as 24 e xn e 0 e i 1 n x i 2 i 1 n x i 2 where x i is the original sequence x i is the signal after denoising e 0 and e are the sequence energy of the original sequence and denoised sequence respectively if the signal x i has a high r xn after denoising it means that the effect of denoising is good the larger e xn is the closer the denoised sequence is to the original sequence 3 database the dataset used in this study can be found in leach et al 2013 according to the supporting documents of the data data were collected continuously at 30 minute intervals for periods of variable lengths depending on site between 1994 and 1997 fig 4 presents the location distribution of the sampling sites and note that only data of ten sites are contained in the dataset the data of these sites are suffering from missing data including single sample missing and segment missing filling in missing data of such a high temporal resolution dataset is meaningful there were five variables in this dataset and four variables ph ph conductivity 25c cd25 dissolved oxygen do and temperature water temp were used in this study there are ten user codes in this dataset and c9 is chosen because it has the largest samples some statistical indices of the collected dataset are listed in table 1 the presence and absence data can be found in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the original dataset has 1 727 samples with a lack of all variables and 288 samples with a lack of do 4 model development 4 1 construction of the pwimp lstm model the multivariate imputation procedures are implemented via the r package mice van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2011 in this study as mentioned in section 2 1 the pwimp is modified from a divided original dataset into pieces as input while the input of the glimp is the whole original dataset the pwimp model can be described as follows 1 let r 0 s i and p i be the original data series the missing segment and the subsequence of r 0 i 1 2 3 n respectively the relation between p i and s i can be written as follows 25 p i s il s i s ir where both s il and s ir are complete subsequences of r 0 s il is connected before s i and s ir is connected after s i let m il m i and m ir be the lengths of s il s i and s ir respectively then the missing rate m is defined by 26 m m i m il m i m ir let m il α m i m ir β m i where α β 0 then eq 26 can be written as 27 m m i α m i m i β m i 1 α β 1 the best performance of the pwimp is guaranteed by using the optimum values of α and β to evaluate which α β is the best the lstm model will receive each complete data series after imputation with certain α β then the pwimp lstm model is built to evaluate the accuracy of the pwimp lstm model mae is chosen as the indicator which can be calculated by eq 17 it should be noted that different input data generated by the pwimp are inputted into the lstm with the same hyperparameter which is not the subject in this study 2 determination of α β there is no reference for how to determine α β thus the trial and error strategy is used to find the optimal values of α β in this study table 2 lists the relationship between the mae of validation datasets and α β it can be seen that 4 1 is the best α β 4 2 construction of the pwimp modwt lstm model the main steps of pwimp modwt lstm model establishment are summarized as follows 1 first obtain a complete data series generated by pwimp 2 apply modwt to the complete data series 3 apply threshold shrinkage denoising to the wavelet coefficients 4 inverse modwt of the threshold wavelet

denoising left and after denoising right as observed from figs 7 and 8 the high frequency part especially from d1 to d8 has been significantly reduced which means the effect of denoising is good the higher composition part from d9 to d12 has been preserved well both global and piecewise multivariate imputation data are smoother after denoising limited to space and to avoid redundancy the figures

the energy percentage and correlation coefficient the conclusion is the same this means that modwt performs well in both glimp and pwimp in denoising and original signal retention 5 3 evaluation of the proposed models the predicting performance comparisons of these four models are listed in table 5 and figs 9 and 10 as shown comparing pwimp lstm with glimp lstm mae mape and rmse decreased by 18

uncontrolled overflows however practical uncertainties are often neglected when assessing the potential of mpc strategies this paper aims to understand the risks associated with using a non perfect internal mpc model real precipitation forecast and realistic dynamic system capacity fluctuations an mpc with the objective to reduce the total combined sewer overflow cso volume was implemented in the case study of eindhoven in the netherlands where highly sensitive waterways receive the sewer overflows two types of risks were identified relative system performance loss and operative deterioration the former entails a practical decrease in efficacy of controlling cso spills compared to the theoretical situation whereas the latter describes the aggravation of environmental pollution compared to a static form of system operation the results obtained demonstrate that precipitation forecast uncertainty is associated with a small relative system performance loss opposite to this significant performance loss was observed as a consequence of uncertainties in the internal mpc model and the actual sewer system capacity available the latter caused additional combined sewer overflows compared to a statically optimised control for smaller precipitation events keywords combined sewer overflows model predictive control operational optimisation risk analysis uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction combined sewer overflow cso structures are an important part of combined sewer systems csss designed to alleviate urban flooding by discharging urban runoff and wastewater into receiving water bodies when the css becomes overloaded this release of untreated wastewater into the natural environment can result in ecological degradation of urban waters suárez and puertas 2005 owolabi mohandes and zayed 2022 necessitating methods to mitigate or reduce cso events real time control rtc the optimisation of operations of actuators using real time information about the system schütze et al 2004 has been described as a potential cost effective method to reduce cso events by activating the static e g in sewer storage and dynamic wwtp inlet or pumping station capacity of the css optimally dirckx et al 2011 rtc strategies can either be based on heuristic or optimisation based algorithms garcía et al 2015 optimisation based algorithms commonly use models to predict the optimal settings for a system over a receding horizon in the form of model predictive control mpc and show greater theoretical potential to optimise the css operation with regard to the set objective compared to heuristic algorithms lund et al 2018 in mpc strategies real time measurements of the system are used as initial conditions for an internal mpc model precipitation forecasts as a forcing variable and pumping capacities as model parameters the objective of the rtc can take many forms but typically aims to minimise environmental impact directly impact based rtc reduce the pollution loads from the css pollution based rtc or the volume of cso discharge volume based rtc to assert the performance of an mpc strategy prior to implementation modelling studies are used van daal et al 2017 this introduces a variety of sources of uncertainty which can impact the expected mpc performance uncertainties related to model parameters and precipitation forecast on model outputs have been studied e g achleitner et al 2009 deletic et al 2012 but the influence of these model uncertainties on the performance potential of rtc strategies have not explicitly been considered lund et al 2020 normally the internal mpc model is often used as the model representing the system thus negating any uncertainties that might occur e g sadler et al 2019 sun et al 2020a considering precipitation forecast several methods to account for precipitation uncertainty in an rtc setting have been proposed courdent et al 2015 svensen et al 2021 additionally it has been argued that the precipitation uncertainty will not influence the final mpc performance significantly due to the re updating of the initial conditions at every optimisation interval fiorelli et al 2013 similar results were shown in other research though the performance decreases difference between the theoretical and uncertain data use as shown in table 1 vary widely from almost negligible to almost half of the gained performance from these publications which use both mpc and deep reinforcement learning drl no clear trends in the performance loss could be established despite the many uncertainties potentially influencing the efficacy of rtc procedures highlighted the main source of uncertainty assessed remains rainfall forecast nowcast table 1 also see lund et al 2018 assessing the influence of this source of uncertainty seems to depend on how the uncertainty is modelled as the use of real cases and large biases seems to exacerbate performance loss research on multiple simultaneously modelled sources of uncertainty however is limited to synthetically added noise to input data thereby arguing the various uncertainties are compiled into a single uncertainty additionally the use of real data to accurately represent the dynamics of uncertainty in a uds context remains limited although both methods have merit in the development of new more robust control measures e g svensen et al 2021 it does not further the understanding of the relation between uncertainties and rtc efficacy nor enable further targeted research furthermore during the operation of a css changes to the system s dynamic capacity can occur as a result of pump failure emergency or scheduled maintenance at the wwtp or pumping stations and other unforeseen events such as partial blockages failure events related to actuators show the highest level of risk within urban drainage systems miszta kruk 2016 these temporary changes to the system capacity occur frequently in css and can exacerbate cso volumes significantly in practice korving et al 2006 for uncontrolled systems as rtc strategies are designed to fully utilise the redundancy of the css capacity the effects of these system capacity uncertainties on the system functioning is an important interaction to understand rtc algorithms able to maintain functioning during failure operations so called fault tolerant control either focus on failures in the information streams garofalo et al 2017 or theoretical local actuator failures ocampo martinez and puig 2009 and return to the pre rtc state when failures are detected pleau et al 2004 the cumulative effect of the aforementioned uncertainties and failure mechanisms on the efficacy of an rtc strategy has not been studied before and was identified as a key gap in the rtc literature van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2022 furthermore the uncertain nature of the practical efficacy of rtc to improve storm water system performance remains one of the main concerns from practitioners naughton et al 2021 and it can be assumed that these concerns apply to combined sewer system rtc as well this results in limited practical applications of mpc lund et al 2018 research assessing the risks of practical operational uncertainties on mpc efficacy is needed to ensure more widespread implementation of the technology the key novelty of this work will be to assess the relative importance of various sources of uncertainty model induced rainfall and system capacity uncertainties using real operational and forecast data this paper aims to develop and a methodology which systematically assesses the influence of different sources of uncertainty on the performance of model predictive control procedures and to quantify the influence of these sources of uncertainty on the mpc performance 2 methodology the developed methodology aims to assess the risks of different uncertainties on the performance potential of an mpc scheme these are computed based following a standardised methodology using the model based performance of the rtc strategy under different scenarios with varying levels of uncertainty considered first an mpc architecture based on an optimisation model is set up and the sources of uncertainty within the architecture are determined section 2 1 then based on the identified sources of uncertainty scenarios are defined section 2 2 and these scenarios are evaluated using a the risk based assessment methodology section 2 3 if risks are identified the underlying mechanisms are investigated to illustrate the application of the methodology and to assess their influence on the relevant risks a case study and the control procedure used are presented in section 3 2 1 model predictive control architecture a centralised mpc architecture is developed using a full hydrodynamic model to represent the physical combined sewer system a conceptual model based on the full hydrodynamic model has to be created for optimisation purposes see section 3 for details on the case study hereafter denoted as the internal mpc model following the definition by lund et al 2018 the centralised mpc architecture follows the procedure outlined in fig 1 the full hydrodynamic model is used to assess if there is a need for optimisation run optimisation will only be done during conditions or predicted conditions within the forecast horizon that fall within the optimisation objective several sources of uncertainty exist in real mpc affecting the final optimal actuator settings fig 1 data and processes indicated with dashed lines represent various sources of uncertainties considered in this work the generation of the internal mpc model requires initial conditions regarding both the runoff and the flow routing model precipitation forcing data actuator capacity conditions and model structure calibrated previously initial conditions for the internal mpc model are the hydraulic heads of the sections flow rates between the sections infiltration and initial loss parameters are derived from the full hydrodynamic model the runoff initial condition are estimated using a warm up period of two hours for every time interval the dynamic system capacity of a combined sewer system refers to the wastewater treatment plant capacity and or any intermediate pumping stations capacity both suffer from variable flow rates due to planned and unplanned activities in the system the full hydrodynamic model upper bound for these actuators the theoretical capacity are replaced by dynamic boundary conditions based on historical operation observations this mimics the observed i e actual operational capacity available during the event the precipitation forecast parsed to the internal mpc model is either the observed precipitation representing a perfect forecast e g zimmer et al 2015 or the actual i e real historical forecasts löwe et al 2016 2 2 uncertainty scenarios to understand the influence of the previously highlighted uncertainties in the system a generic methodology was set up this methodology is set up such that all relevant uncertainties potentially affecting the mpc performance can be integrated and combined a scenario based approach varying the uncertainties within the mpc architecture was used to assess the influence of different variables on the performance of the mpc procedure the influence of the aforementioned sources of uncertainty can be determined stochastically and deterministically following a stochastic framework random or semi random errors can be introduced to the variables in order to generate the uncertain scenarios however the number of samples which can be used is limited given the real time optimisation needs for mpc making a stochastic framework impractical a deterministic approach to uncertainty assessment involves defining a perfect information and uncertain real case per variable based on real data the perfect information scenario refers to the scenario where the information parsed to the internal mpc model is entirely the same as the state of the uds or full hydrodynamic model of the uds where the uncertain real scenario refers to the scenario which would be the case for the implementation of mpc in a real system using the real data a deterministic approach was used in this research as it better represents the real uncertainties that occur within an mpc framework and it can give meaningful results without the computational burden of a stochastic approach details for both the cases per previously identified variable fig 1 can be found in table 2 three of the aforementioned variables require operational data 1 initial conditions requires operational understanding of the sensor output 2 dynamic boundary condition uses observations of the functioning of the dynamics boundary condition monitored pumping station capacity or wwtp capacity and 3 the actuator functioning requires the reconstruction of previous set points and the comparison with the resultant set point for each actuator there could be overlap between the latter two if the pumping stations or wwtp are part of the control strategy the other two simplified model and precipitation forecast both rely on model outputs only and therefore do require the operation the css for data generation the influence of the three sources of uncertainty for the internal mpc model mentioned in section 2 1 were investigated in this paper 1 simplification of the internal mpc model 2 precipitation forecast and 3 the dynamic boundary condition these three were selected as data was available for the uncertain real as the other two require implementation of the studied control algorithm for data which has not been implemented yet based on these three sources of uncertainty five scenarios were defined combining different sources of uncertainty with the internal mpc procedure table 3 the computational penalty associated with mpc implementations is always limiting to the number of events that can be studied which should be considered when interpreting the results as multi year simulations are necessary for an accurate assessment of the performance of rtc strategies van daal et al 2017 the computational time for scenario 1 is especially high a six hour rain event takes over 20 days to simulate as the full hydrodynamic model is used as the internal mpc model limiting the number of events that can be studied further 2 3 risk and performance assessment to quantify the risks associated with implemented rtc we define two risks 1 the risk of relative system performance loss and 2 the risk of operative deterioration the risk of relative performance loss quantifies the difference between the theoretical and real mpc performance based aforementioned uncertainties in the rtc design process represented here using the five scenarios shown in table 3 on observation data the risk of operative deterioration is defined as the risk of operation of the sewer system using rtc that is worse than the static optimal operation defined as having a single set point for each actuator in the css to gain an objective insight in the functioning of an rtc system an absolute realised potential indicator arpi was previously introduced van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the arpi is calculated as the ratio between on the one side the difference between the rtc functioning and the statically optimised settings and on the other the difference between the maximum potential and the statically optimised settings following 1 arpi j so n j rtc n j so n j mt p a n where j so n is the performance using static optimised control for event n j rtc n is the performance of the rtc strategy and j amtp n is the maximum potential performance calculated using an adjusted version of the central basin approach einfalt and stölting 2002 the arpi ranges in theory from to 1 where a value close to 1 indicates a control strategy close to its maximum achievable potential 0 indicates the same result as the static optimal setting and any negative value between first the total arpi and arpis per event are calculated for scenario 1 i e the baseline scenario these form the theoretically achievable potential of the mpc strategy then the total arpi and arpi per event are calculated for the other three remaining scenarios outlined in table 3 the difference of the total arpi for a given scenario and the total arpi for the baseline scenario i e scenario 1 is used as the final indicator of the risk of relative performance loss the corresponding distributions of the arpi are also assessed to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the scenarios using the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test if there is a significant different between the scenarios the dynamics in the system causing the difference are further investigated if this isn t the case the source or set of sources of uncertainty are deemed to not have a significant effect on the performance of the mpc procedure additionally a relation of the risk of relative performance loss per event to precipitation and system capacity characteristics is then assessed by analysing the total rainfall depth maximum rainfall intensity and median system capacity during wet weather flow operation the risk of operative deterioration does not compare to the perfect baseline scenario 1 but rather uses the statically optimised rtc results the baseline of the rpi as the baseline this risk is defined as the frequency of controlled events which perform worse compared to the static optimal performance the magnitude of the deterioration is accounted for in the risk of relative performance loss and is therefore not part of the risk of operative deterioration the risks as described here can be used for a more informed risk benefit analysis to allow for a more rational implementation of rtc in practice 3 case study 3 1 catchment details the methodology described in previous section is demonstrated on the case study of eindhoven the netherlands the natural water bodies in this catchment experience nutrient overloading and oxygen depletion from both urban runoff moreno rodenas et al 2019 agricultural pollution pieterse bleuten and jørgensen 2003 and wwtp effluent langeveld et al 2013 this catchment has been studied before in the context of rtc of the full urban drainage system langeveld et al 2013 van daal rombouts et al 2017 an extensive monitoring network with high quality data was implemented previously for both the river and sewer networks schilperoort 2011 wwtp eindhoven has three inlets serving 29 urban drainage networks with a total capacity of 750 000p e of these 23 drainage systems drain through riool zuid southern sewer a large transport sewer system stretching nearly 30 km with pipe diameters ranging from 0 35 m to 2 25 m from the most upstream to the most downstream section pumping station ps aalst is located midway across this transport line this pumping station has a design capacity of 12 000 m3 h however the actual capacity used is limited to 10 000 m3 h even this reduced capacity is not always used as evident from the flow measurements recorded downstream of this pumping station see fig 2 the section upstream of the ps aalst is modelled and used in this study fig 3 this section spans roughly 18 km from the northernmost to the southernmost nodes and 12 km from east to west the full hydrodynamic model consists of 10 509 nodes 11 462 conduits and a total of 147 outlets both csos and storm water outlets both the full hydrodynamic and the internal mpc model were developed in epa swmm 5 1 015 rossman 2010 and ran through the python interface pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 both models have been previously developed and calibrated van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the internal mpc model was designed as a set of storage units representing the municipalities discharging into the transport sewer and was calibrated on the full hydrodynamic model it was deemed to have an acceptable performance as the mean nse varied between 0 57 and 0 78 flow rates through the system can be controlled by two large control stations in the transport line cs de meeren the downstream most control station and cs valkenswaard the upstream most control station splitting the system into three sections the flow rates through these control stations are the decision variables given to the centralised mpc procedure 3 2 control procedure a volume based rtc strategy was selected to minimise additional uncertainties inherent in models required for pollution and impact based rtc volume based rtc remains a popular objective in the scientific literature and practice due to alignment with monitoring and regulations meng fu and butler 2020 to optimise the actuators at every time step following the used architecture section 2 1 a general objective function was formulated the objective function used in this control procedure is based on the following three functions 1 flooding minimisation 2 cso volume minimisation and 3 equal filling degree eq 2 3 and 4 respectively following previously defined optimisation functions gelormino and ricker 1994 pleau et al 1996 fiorelli et al 2013 the objective functions are defined as follows 2 j flooding t δ t i 1 n nodes q flood i where δ t is the time step length of each iteration n nodes is the number of nodes in the model and q flood i is the flooding rate for the ith node in the model 3 j cso t δ t i 1 n cso q cso i where n cso is the number of cso structures in the system and q cso i is the overflow rate for the ith cso structure each cso structure could be assigned a weight e g vezzaro and grum 2014 but here the relative importance of each cso was deemed equal 4 j fillingdegree t i 1 n sections f d i μ n sections where n sections is the number of controlled sections f d i is the ith filling degree in the system μ is the mean filling degree over all the section the three objectives are combined to form a single objective function following 5 min a 1 j flooding a 2 j cso a 3 j fillingdegree where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are weights used to discern the importance of each term here set to 10000 100 and 1 respectively these weights were chosen to ensure clear prioritisation of flooding over cso events as within a ga framework these cannot be added as hard constraints note that third term in eq 5 was added to the optimisation objective to include equal filling of the system even when csos are not predicted and thereby reducing risk of overflows occurring beyond the forecast horizon the optimisation function is subject to implicit constraints mass and energy balance equations implemented in epa swmm5 to minimise undesired erratic actuator movement the change in set point at every time step was explicitly constrained to a maximum change of 300 m3 h per time step this explicit constraint was added to avoid the need to add another objective to the objective function as done in sun et al 2020a the above optimisation problem is solved using a conventional elitist genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 as it is commonly applied in water resource management nicklow et al 2010 and urban drainage system modelling with rtc in particular for many years rauch and harremoes 1999 in this case study this is done every 5 min of simulation time over a rtc forecasting horizon of 2 h a ga population size of 20 mutation probability of 0 1 using a uniform mutation operation crossover probability of 0 5 for uniform crossover operation a parent portion of 0 25 and a rank based selection operator were used these parameters were iteratively chosen to ensure good search performance the mpc scheme was run locally on a desktop with a four core intel i5 6500 cpu 3 20 ghz cpu a local control procedure following a single input single output structure for the two actuators based on water level as input and flow rate as output was previously developed and found to significantly reduce cso volumes for details see van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the set points for control station de meeren is set to 5000 m3 h and control station valkenswaard is set to 2500 m3 h and form the optimal static control for the system these restrictions are reached by means of a moveable gate controlled by a local pid controller this moveable gate is activated when wet weather flow using a simple threshold for the observed downstream head is detected inside the system and only opened when the system has gone back to dry weather flow for the catchment studied here flooding issues do not occur frequently due to a cso capacity of around 20 mm hr the inclusion of the flooding term in the objective function eq 1 therefore did not affect the actuator settings for the used catchment but was included to follow a more generalised approach to mpc to facilitate and formalise result comparisons 3 3 precipitation two types of precipitation data were used in this case study 1 the rain gauge adjusted radar dataset overeem holleman and buishand 2009 and 2 the radar precipitation prediction made by the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi based on two real time radar reflectivity measurements and advective velocity extrapolation of previous observations the latter is available in real time and can be used in predictive control where the former is adjusted based on merging of national and international radar data with the knmi operated rain gauge network available with a delay of a month both datasets have a resolution of 1x1 km at a 5 min interval and 128 pixels were used in the epa swmm5 model radar reflectivity for the prediction data is converted to precipitation depth using the following empirically derived equation 6 i 10 z 109 32 δ t 1 where i is the precipitation intensity in mm hr z is the reflectivity factor observed in dbz and δ t is the observation time step the historical prediction data set spans the years 2014 and 2015 precipitation events within these two years were selected usable events were defined as precipitation events resulting in wet weather flow throughout at least 2 sections of riool zuid with data available for pumping station aalst the latter requirement was only met for the 2015 data set a total of 17 precipitation events from 2015 were used in the final analysis for scenarios 2 till 5 this includes hybrid events i e events with various rainfall peaks considered as one event the maximum intensities for the events ranged from 2 17 to 30 58 mm hr mean of 10 74 mm hr and depths ranging 6 2 43 5 mm mean of 18 3 mm two rainfall events were used for assessing scenario 1 with maximum intensities of 13 and 10 75 mm hr and total rainfall depths of 28 7 and 14 3 mm for events 1 and 2 respectively 4 results this section shows and discusses the results obtained from the simulations as described in the previous section firstly the risk of relative performance loss is shown followed by the risk of operative deterioration the former is assessed for the difference between scenario 1 and 2 followed by the other three scenarios 4 1 risk of relative performance loss scenario 1 can be seen as the highest possible achievable mpc performance for the used strategy and procedure as it neglects all forms of uncertainty which might affect the performance named here the theoretical functioning scenario 1 performed better for the events with a total arpi of 0 79 compared to 0 50 for scenario 2 table 4 fig 4 indicating both considerably improved the system functioning and relative proximity to the maximum achievable performance compared to the baseline this represents a cso reduction of 68 7 and 44 4 respectively this equates to a 35 relative loss based on model uncertainty alone this difference was assessed by looking at the behaviour of the most downstream actuator in the system which was noticeably different during the cso events during the phase of the event when the cso occurred in scenario 1 the flow through actuator 1 was restricted further compared to scenario 2 reducing the cso volume at the downstream locations fig 4 this did cause a limited increase in the cso rate at the upstream cso such that the total cso volume was minimised in scenario 2 more flow was allowed through this control station causing an overall increase in the cso volume as scenario 1 the perfect baseline could only be analysed for two events scenario 2 the practical baseline was used as the baseline for showing the maximum achievable potential of the used mpc scheme the total cso volume of scenarios 2 till 5 following the mpc strategy set out in section 3 2 were compared to the total cso volume obtained using the static optimum settings as determined in previous work van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 reductions in the total cso volumes of the 17 analysed precipitation events were found for all four scenarios fig 5 a and b the boxplots whiskers indicating the 5 95 ci were constructed based on 12 events as five of the used events did not cause overflows in the static optimum these five events are further discussed in section 4 2 scenario 2 showed for the 17 analysed events a 23 8 reduction in the total cso volume and the negation of cso events for two additional precipitation events the absolute rpi for the combined events is 0 53 the latter value indicates the existence of un utilised potential within the system although unlikely to be achieved through rtc with the current actuator configuration for two events the mpc scheme managed to negate the cso event entirely a relatively small relative performance risk was observed for scenario 4 using real radar forecast data in the optimisation model with an arpi of 0 46 and cso reduction of 20 3 compared to the baseline equating to a 14 4 performance loss compared to scenario 2 table 5 one cso event was negated for scenario 3 one less compared to scenario 2 this suggest only a limited risk of relative performance loss when using radar forecasts the frequent updating of the internal mpc model ensures that the importance of accurate forecasting is minimal recent advances in precipitation forecasting are therefore unlikely to yield higher practical performance from mpc systems longer horizons and application of precipitation forecasts to heuristic control have not been assessed in this work and might show different performance related risks a more pronounced relative performance risk was associated with assuming the full capacity of the downstream pumping station with a relative reduction of 45 2 and 47 3 for scenarios 3 and 5 respectively both scenarios exacerbated the frequency of the cso events with an increase in the number of events with cso spills this is further discussed in section 4 2 the relatively large loss of performance corroborates findings by sun et al 2020b which indicate a decrease in efficacy of the mpc scheme under variable wwtp capacity they however consider their variable capacity as a process which can be modelled whereas the pumping capacity decrease here is considered aleatoric in nature the uncertain precipitation forecast and pumping capacity together do not synergistically influence the performance of the mpc scheme in a significant manner based on these results indeed the mean and median of the performance difference between scenario 3 and 5 for these 14 events were 0 5 and 0 respectively assessing the statistical significance of the difference in performance only the difference between scenarios 2 and 3 and between scenarios 2 and 4 were statistically significant following a ks test with ρ 0 05 as indicated by the scatter plots in fig 6 blue indicating significance orange a lack thereof the relative increase in cso volume for scenarios 3 and 5 is associated with an increase in the spill volume of the most downstream cso structure as the optimisation based rtc model assumes full dynamic capacity in the most downstream section of the sewer it reduces less the flow rate through the control stations causing an accumulation of water in the downstream section leading to increased cso volumes an example of this behaviour is shown in fig 7 at the control station de meeren the most downstream of the two control stations for the example in fig 7 scenario 2 did increase the cso volume at the upstream csos however that increase was less compared to the cso volume it reduced at the downstream most cso location a relation between the relative performance loss and precipitation characteristics was investigated too total rainfall depth was previously found to be the best indicator of cso volume for uncontrolled catchments fu and butler 2012 no such relation could be found from the simulated events presented here fig 8 a c the size of the dataset hampers the ability to draw significant relations within the dataset for which a larger dataset would be necessary however linear correlations between precipitation characteristics and performance loss are not expected given that such linear relations are not present in rtc performance either vezzaro 2022 4 2 risk of operative deterioration the risk of operative deterioration was assessed for scenarios 2 5 although uncertainties associated with the optimisation model model parameter structure and initial condition uncertainties are present in all scenarios no operative deterioration was found for scenarios 2 and 4 however for both scenarios 3 and 5 for three and two precipitation events respectively deterioration compared to the static optimal operation was observed causing additional overflows and overflow volumes for these events the additional overflows occurred at the downstream section of the system caused by the same mechanisms which caused the relative performance loss fig 7 although statistically significant statements cannot be made due to the relatively small sample size the risk of operative deterioration seems to be the case for the smaller event with relatively large deviation in performance of the pumping station fig 9 this is the type of precipitation event in which rtc typically has the highest potential vezzaro and grum 2014 kroll et al 2018 which can mean potentially larger risks than reported here given the relatively small dataset within this range of events given that an mpc system aims to maximise the system s capacity uncertainties in the downstream dynamic capacity can have a bigger influence on the system performance if this system is close to its maximum capacity which is the case for smaller events 5 discussion the uncertainty induced performance loss in this study fall within the range reported in literature see table 1 although the relative performance loss of 14 4 is more significant compared to the lowest bracket found 1 2 2 8 it is lower compared to the studies using real rainfall forecasts and the highest level of uncertainty jafari mousavi and kim 2020 zhang et al 2022 the latter using a bias of 25 is comparable to the performance loss associated with the reduced pumping capacity which is in the same range and is also considered a constant bias within the internal mpc model this is particularly interesting as zhang et al 2022 used a drl optimisation procedure indicating comparable results between different real time optimisation procedures it should be noted that the comparison with previous reported values remains difficult due to the case study specificity relative rtc potential and rainfall events used values here are reported in the form of the arpis van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 with the aim to allow for better comparative assessment in the future the modelling results obtained here show the importance of considering the risks of relative performance loss within the design stage of the mpc strategy using this method allows the design of the mpc to be more robust against the perceived risks and can give operators a more realistic insight in the implementable potential gains of mpc for their respective system this in turn will aid in the decision making process of investments for future rehabilitation projects of the uds methods to deal with the various sources of uncertainties have been proposed lund et al 2020 proposed a safety margin within their mpc structure of 5 allowing for random errors within the used model structure despite the relatively simple implementation of these safety margins the robustness against incorrect model parameters was improved without large losses in the theoretical performance of the system none of the previous studies reported a risk of operative deterioration within the results however often the results shown were compounded in a singular bar chat as per jafari mousavi and kim 2020 meaning that a literature comparison regarding the risk of operative deterioration could not be adequately done as the viability of an mpc strategy given the risk of operative deterioration depends on the sensitivity of the receiving water body to cso discharges this should be specifically investigated in future similar research for highly sensitive receiving water bodies where the frequency of cso discharges is the most important parameter the risks shown here might not be worth the relative benefits indeed frequencies of dissolved oxygen dips and ammonium peaks have been used in the studied catchment before as the optimisable indicator weijers et al 2012 the acceptability of the mpc associated risks should therefore be dependent on the used assessment framework as described in the urban pollution management manual 3 1 foundation for water research fwr 2018 robust risk appreciation frameworks similar to investment decisions as shown by sriwastava et al 2021 should be developed and put in place to enable informed decision making integrated models able to determine the impact of the cso events are necessary to appreciate the risks and benefits for every rtc system the risks identified here should therefore in future work be extended to impact based rtc strategies e g langeveld et al 2013 the risks identified per source of uncertainty should be studied for different catchments to better understand their respective impacts additionally from a practical implementation point of view various other uncertainties might cause an increase in the risk of operative deterioration e g measurement uncertainty communication issues in the rtc strategy these additional risks should be systematically assessed following the same method as presented here although the risks presented here were identified for an optimisation based control strategy the same risks can apply to heuristic control measures if not explicitly considered within the strategy 6 conclusion this research proposed a methodology to investigate the potential risks associated with using scenarios with various uncertain variables in a model predictive control mpc strategy applied to combined sewer systems csss five scenarios were defined to assess the relative impact of internal mpc model dynamic system capacity and precipitation forecast uncertainties the above risks were assessed on the case study of eindhoven in the netherlands the following conclusions can be drawn from the case study findings uncertainties associated with the mpc framework can have a significant influence on the practically achievable performance of the control strategy and should be investigated prior to implementation model uncertainties and unanticipated fluctuations in dynamic system capacity were found to have the largest influence on the performance unanticipated fluctuations in dynamic system capacity can lead to operative deterioration compared to a statically operated system when not considered within the mpc framework precipitation forecasts uncertainty can cause minor relative performance loss but can be used without significant risk of operative deterioration in an mpc strategy provided that the optimisation frequency is high enough the sources of uncertainty were not found to synergistically reduce the mpc potential nor increase the risk of operative deterioration the trade offs between the benefits of an mpc strategy and perceived risks should be explicitly considered before the implementation of mpc strategies in future research additional uncertainties considered outside the scope of this paper should be considered initial conditions of the runoff and routing internal mpc models and measurement uncertainties as well as additional combinations of these their respective contribution to the here identified risks should be further identified furthermore given the relative high influence of the internal mpc model uncertainty on the risks associated with performance loss a better understanding of the trade offs between computational speed and accuracy is necessary more detailed investigation into the exact mechanics behind the influence of uncertainties should be investigated to facilitate improved risk reduction in future mpc implementations given the large performance loss associated with the system capacity uncertainty and model uncertainty the development of efficient and robust rtc methods to manage these losses should be prioritised additional sources of performance loss such as operational performance of actuators have not been explicitly studied here and should be assessed following a similar framework as proposed here a comparison between heuristically and optimisation based controlled system and their respective risks is also recommended furthermore to further validate the results presented here additional simulations are needed on other case studies the sensitivity of model predictive control to uncertain dynamic capacity should be further assessed for a combined sewer system with multiple pumping stations within the system to further understand the dependency of mpc performance on changing dynamic capacities the dynamics between performance loss and rainfall characteristics should be further investigated as the initial results here show a higher level of risk associated with smaller rainfall events smaller rainfall events are found to be more susceptible to improvement through rtc strategies and the potential impact of these uncertainties on the mpc performance could therefore be higher than described here these results should therefore have to be validated on additional rainfall events and in other catchments credit authorship contribution statement j a van der werf conceptualization methodology writing original draft z kapelan supervision writing review editing j langeveld supervision

uncontrolled overflows however practical uncertainties are often neglected when assessing the potential of mpc strategies this paper aims to understand the risks associated with using a non perfect internal mpc model real precipitation forecast and realistic dynamic system capacity fluctuations an mpc with the objective to reduce the total combined sewer overflow cso volume was implemented in the case study of eindhoven in the netherlands where highly sensitive waterways receive the sewer overflows two types of risks were identified relative system performance loss and operative deterioration the former entails a practical decrease in efficacy of controlling cso spills compared to the theoretical situation whereas the latter describes the aggravation of environmental pollution compared to a static form of system operation the results obtained demonstrate that precipitation forecast uncertainty is associated with a small relative system performance loss opposite to this significant performance loss was observed as a consequence of uncertainties in the internal mpc model and the actual sewer system capacity available the latter caused additional combined sewer overflows compared to a statically optimised control for smaller precipitation events keywords combined sewer overflows model predictive control operational optimisation risk analysis uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction combined sewer overflow cso structures are an important part of combined sewer systems csss designed to alleviate urban flooding by discharging urban runoff and wastewater into receiving water bodies when the css becomes overloaded this release of untreated wastewater into the natural environment can result in ecological degradation of urban waters suárez and puertas 2005 owolabi mohandes and zayed 2022 necessitating methods to mitigate or reduce cso events real time control rtc the optimisation of operations of actuators using real time information about the system schütze et al 2004 has been described as a potential cost effective method to reduce cso events by activating the static e g in sewer storage and dynamic wwtp inlet or pumping station capacity of the css optimally dirckx et al 2011 rtc strategies can either be based on heuristic or optimisation based algorithms garcía et al 2015 optimisation based algorithms commonly use models to predict the optimal settings for a system over a receding horizon in the form of model predictive control mpc and show greater theoretical potential to optimise the css operation with regard to the set objective compared to heuristic algorithms lund et al 2018 in mpc strategies real time measurements of the system are used as initial conditions for an internal mpc model precipitation forecasts as a forcing variable and pumping capacities as model parameters the objective of the rtc can take many forms but typically aims to minimise environmental impact directly impact based rtc reduce the pollution loads from the css pollution based rtc or the volume of cso discharge volume based rtc to assert the performance of an mpc strategy prior to implementation modelling studies are used van daal et al 2017 this introduces a variety of sources of uncertainty which can impact the expected mpc performance uncertainties related to model parameters and precipitation forecast on model outputs have been studied e g achleitner et al 2009 deletic et al 2012 but the influence of these model uncertainties on the performance potential of rtc strategies have not explicitly been considered lund et al 2020 normally the internal mpc model is often used as the model representing the system thus negating any uncertainties that might occur e g sadler et al 2019 sun et al 2020a considering precipitation forecast several methods to account for precipitation uncertainty in an rtc setting have been proposed courdent et al 2015 svensen et al 2021 additionally it has been argued that the precipitation uncertainty will not influence the final mpc performance significantly due to the re updating of the initial conditions at every optimisation interval fiorelli et al 2013 similar results were shown in other research though the performance decreases difference between the theoretical and uncertain data use as shown in table 1 vary widely from almost negligible to almost half of the gained performance from these publications which use both mpc and deep reinforcement learning drl no clear trends in the performance loss could be established despite the many uncertainties potentially influencing the efficacy of rtc procedures highlighted the main source of uncertainty assessed remains rainfall forecast nowcast table 1 also see lund et al 2018 assessing the influence of this source of uncertainty seems to depend on how the uncertainty is modelled as the use of real cases and large biases seems to exacerbate performance loss research on multiple simultaneously modelled sources of uncertainty however is limited to synthetically added noise to input data thereby arguing the various uncertainties are compiled into a single uncertainty additionally the use of real data to accurately represent the dynamics of uncertainty in a uds context remains limited although both methods have merit in the development of new more robust control measures e g svensen et al 2021 it does not further the understanding of the relation between uncertainties and rtc efficacy nor enable further targeted research furthermore during the operation of a css changes to the system s dynamic capacity can occur as a result of pump failure emergency or scheduled maintenance at the wwtp or pumping stations and other unforeseen events such as partial blockages failure events related to actuators show the highest level of risk within urban drainage systems miszta kruk 2016 these temporary changes to the system capacity occur frequently in css and can exacerbate cso volumes significantly in practice korving et al 2006 for uncontrolled systems as rtc strategies are designed to fully utilise the redundancy of the css capacity the effects of these system capacity uncertainties on the system functioning is an important interaction to understand rtc algorithms able to maintain functioning during failure operations so called fault tolerant control either focus on failures in the information streams garofalo et al 2017 or theoretical local actuator failures ocampo martinez and puig 2009 and return to the pre rtc state when failures are detected pleau et al 2004 the cumulative effect of the aforementioned uncertainties and failure mechanisms on the efficacy of an rtc strategy has not been studied before and was identified as a key gap in the rtc literature van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2022 furthermore the uncertain nature of the practical efficacy of rtc to improve storm water system performance remains one of the main concerns from practitioners naughton et al 2021 and it can be assumed that these concerns apply to combined sewer system rtc as well this results in limited practical applications of mpc lund et al 2018 research assessing the risks of practical operational uncertainties on mpc efficacy is needed to ensure more widespread implementation of the technology the key novelty of this work will be to assess the relative importance of various sources of uncertainty model induced rainfall and system capacity uncertainties using real operational and forecast data this paper aims to develop and a methodology which systematically assesses the influence of different sources of uncertainty on the performance of model predictive control procedures and to quantify the influence of these sources of uncertainty on the mpc performance 2 methodology the developed methodology aims to assess the risks of different uncertainties on the performance potential of an mpc scheme these are computed based following a standardised methodology using the model based performance of the rtc strategy under different scenarios with varying levels of uncertainty considered first an mpc architecture based on an optimisation model is set up and the sources of uncertainty within the architecture are determined section 2 1 then based on the identified sources of uncertainty scenarios are defined section 2 2 and these scenarios are evaluated using a the risk based assessment methodology section 2 3 if risks are identified the underlying mechanisms are investigated to illustrate the application of the methodology and to assess their influence on the relevant risks a case study and the control procedure used are presented in section 3 2 1 model predictive control architecture a centralised mpc architecture is developed using a full hydrodynamic model to represent the physical combined sewer system a conceptual model based on the full hydrodynamic model has to be created for optimisation purposes see section 3 for details on the case study hereafter denoted as the internal mpc model following the definition by lund et al 2018 the centralised mpc architecture follows the procedure outlined in fig 1 the full hydrodynamic model is used to assess if there is a need for optimisation run optimisation will only be done during conditions or predicted conditions within the forecast horizon that fall within the optimisation objective several sources of uncertainty exist in real mpc affecting the final optimal actuator settings fig 1 data and processes indicated with dashed lines represent various sources of uncertainties considered in this work the generation of the internal mpc model requires initial conditions regarding both the runoff and the flow routing model precipitation forcing data actuator capacity conditions and model structure calibrated previously initial conditions for the internal mpc model are the hydraulic heads of the sections flow rates between the sections infiltration and initial loss parameters are derived from the full hydrodynamic model the runoff initial condition are estimated using a warm up period of two hours for every time interval the dynamic system capacity of a combined sewer system refers to the wastewater treatment plant capacity and or any intermediate pumping stations capacity both suffer from variable flow rates due to planned and unplanned activities in the system the full hydrodynamic model upper bound for these actuators the theoretical capacity are replaced by dynamic boundary conditions based on historical operation observations this mimics the observed i e actual operational capacity available during the event the precipitation forecast parsed to the internal mpc model is either the observed precipitation representing a perfect forecast e g zimmer et al 2015 or the actual i e real historical forecasts löwe et al 2016 2 2 uncertainty scenarios to understand the influence of the previously highlighted uncertainties in the system a generic methodology was set up this methodology is set up such that all relevant uncertainties potentially affecting the mpc performance can be integrated and combined a scenario based approach varying the uncertainties within the mpc architecture was used to assess the influence of different variables on the performance of the mpc procedure the influence of the aforementioned sources of uncertainty can be determined stochastically and deterministically following a stochastic framework random or semi random errors can be introduced to the variables in order to generate the uncertain scenarios however the number of samples which can be used is limited given the real time optimisation needs for mpc making a stochastic framework impractical a deterministic approach to uncertainty assessment involves defining a perfect information and uncertain real case per variable based on real data the perfect information scenario refers to the scenario where the information parsed to the internal mpc model is entirely the same as the state of the uds or full hydrodynamic model of the uds where the uncertain real scenario refers to the scenario which would be the case for the implementation of mpc in a real system using the real data a deterministic approach was used in this research as it better represents the real uncertainties that occur within an mpc framework and it can give meaningful results without the computational burden of a stochastic approach details for both the cases per previously identified variable fig 1 can be found in table 2 three of the aforementioned variables require operational data 1 initial conditions requires operational understanding of the sensor output 2 dynamic boundary condition uses observations of the functioning of the dynamics boundary condition monitored pumping station capacity or wwtp capacity and 3 the actuator functioning requires the reconstruction of previous set points and the comparison with the resultant set point for each actuator there could be overlap between the latter two if the pumping stations or wwtp are part of the control strategy the other two simplified model and precipitation forecast both rely on model outputs only and therefore do require the operation the css for data generation the influence of the three sources of uncertainty for the internal mpc model mentioned in section 2 1 were investigated in this paper 1 simplification of the internal mpc model 2 precipitation forecast and 3 the dynamic boundary condition these three were selected as data was available for the uncertain real as the other two require implementation of the studied control algorithm for data which has not been implemented yet based on these three sources of uncertainty five scenarios were defined combining different sources of uncertainty with the internal mpc procedure table 3 the computational penalty associated with mpc implementations is always limiting to the number of events that can be studied which should be considered when interpreting the results as multi year simulations are necessary for an accurate assessment of the performance of rtc strategies van daal et al 2017 the computational time for scenario 1 is especially high a six hour rain event takes over 20 days to simulate as the full hydrodynamic model is used as the internal mpc model limiting the number of events that can be studied further 2 3 risk and performance assessment to quantify the risks associated with implemented rtc we define two risks 1 the risk of relative system performance loss and 2 the risk of operative deterioration the risk of relative performance loss quantifies the difference between the theoretical and real mpc performance based aforementioned uncertainties in the rtc design process represented here using the five scenarios shown in table 3 on observation data the risk of operative deterioration is defined as the risk of operation of the sewer system using rtc that is worse than the static optimal operation defined as having a single set point for each actuator in the css to gain an objective insight in the functioning of an rtc system an absolute realised potential indicator arpi was previously introduced van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the arpi is calculated as the ratio between on the one side the difference between the rtc functioning and the statically optimised settings and on the other the difference between the maximum potential and the statically optimised settings following 1 arpi j so n j rtc n j so n j mt p a n where j so n is the performance using static optimised control for event n j rtc n is the performance of the rtc strategy and j amtp n is the maximum potential performance calculated using an adjusted version of the central basin approach einfalt and stölting 2002 the arpi ranges in theory from to 1 where a value close to 1 indicates a control strategy close to its maximum achievable potential 0 indicates the same result as the static optimal setting and any negative value between first the total arpi and arpis per event are calculated for scenario 1 i e the baseline scenario these form the theoretically achievable potential of the mpc strategy then the total arpi and arpi per event are calculated for the other three remaining scenarios outlined in table 3 the difference of the total arpi for a given scenario and the total arpi for the baseline scenario i e scenario 1 is used as the final indicator of the risk of relative performance loss the corresponding distributions of the arpi are also assessed to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the scenarios using the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test if there is a significant different between the scenarios the dynamics in the system causing the difference are further investigated if this isn t the case the source or set of sources of uncertainty are deemed to not have a significant effect on the performance of the mpc procedure additionally a relation of the risk of relative performance loss per event to precipitation and system capacity characteristics is then assessed by analysing the total rainfall depth maximum rainfall intensity and median system capacity during wet weather flow operation the risk of operative deterioration does not compare to the perfect baseline scenario 1 but rather uses the statically optimised rtc results the baseline of the rpi as the baseline this risk is defined as the frequency of controlled events which perform worse compared to the static optimal performance the magnitude of the deterioration is accounted for in the risk of relative performance loss and is therefore not part of the risk of operative deterioration the risks as described here can be used for a more informed risk benefit analysis to allow for a more rational implementation of rtc in practice 3 case study 3 1 catchment details the methodology described in previous section is demonstrated on the case study of eindhoven the netherlands the natural water bodies in this catchment experience nutrient overloading and oxygen depletion from both urban runoff moreno rodenas et al 2019 agricultural pollution pieterse bleuten and jørgensen 2003 and wwtp effluent langeveld et al 2013 this catchment has been studied before in the context of rtc of the full urban drainage system langeveld et al 2013 van daal rombouts et al 2017 an extensive monitoring network with high quality data was implemented previously for both the river and sewer networks schilperoort 2011 wwtp eindhoven has three inlets serving 29 urban drainage networks with a total capacity of 750 000p e of these 23 drainage systems drain through riool zuid southern sewer a large transport sewer system stretching nearly 30 km with pipe diameters ranging from 0 35 m to 2 25 m from the most upstream to the most downstream section pumping station ps aalst is located midway across this transport line this pumping station has a design capacity of 12 000 m3 h however the actual capacity used is limited to 10 000 m3 h even this reduced capacity is not always used as evident from the flow measurements recorded downstream of this pumping station see fig 2 the section upstream of the ps aalst is modelled and used in this study fig 3 this section spans roughly 18 km from the northernmost to the southernmost nodes and 12 km from east to west the full hydrodynamic model consists of 10 509 nodes 11 462 conduits and a total of 147 outlets both csos and storm water outlets both the full hydrodynamic and the internal mpc model were developed in epa swmm 5 1 015 rossman 2010 and ran through the python interface pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 both models have been previously developed and calibrated van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the internal mpc model was designed as a set of storage units representing the municipalities discharging into the transport sewer and was calibrated on the full hydrodynamic model it was deemed to have an acceptable performance as the mean nse varied between 0 57 and 0 78 flow rates through the system can be controlled by two large control stations in the transport line cs de meeren the downstream most control station and cs valkenswaard the upstream most control station splitting the system into three sections the flow rates through these control stations are the decision variables given to the centralised mpc procedure 3 2 control procedure a volume based rtc strategy was selected to minimise additional uncertainties inherent in models required for pollution and impact based rtc volume based rtc remains a popular objective in the scientific literature and practice due to alignment with monitoring and regulations meng fu and butler 2020 to optimise the actuators at every time step following the used architecture section 2 1 a general objective function was formulated the objective function used in this control procedure is based on the following three functions 1 flooding minimisation 2 cso volume minimisation and 3 equal filling degree eq 2 3 and 4 respectively following previously defined optimisation functions gelormino and ricker 1994 pleau et al 1996 fiorelli et al 2013 the objective functions are defined as follows 2 j flooding t δ t i 1 n nodes q flood i where δ t is the time step length of each iteration n nodes is the number of nodes in the model and q flood i is the flooding rate for the ith node in the model 3 j cso t δ t i 1 n cso q cso i where n cso is the number of cso structures in the system and q cso i is the overflow rate for the ith cso structure each cso structure could be assigned a weight e g vezzaro and grum 2014 but here the relative importance of each cso was deemed equal 4 j fillingdegree t i 1 n sections f d i μ n sections where n sections is the number of controlled sections f d i is the ith filling degree in the system μ is the mean filling degree over all the section the three objectives are combined to form a single objective function following 5 min a 1 j flooding a 2 j cso a 3 j fillingdegree where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are weights used to discern the importance of each term here set to 10000 100 and 1 respectively these weights were chosen to ensure clear prioritisation of flooding over cso events as within a ga framework these cannot be added as hard constraints note that third term in eq 5 was added to the optimisation objective to include equal filling of the system even when csos are not predicted and thereby reducing risk of overflows occurring beyond the forecast horizon the optimisation function is subject to implicit constraints mass and energy balance equations implemented in epa swmm5 to minimise undesired erratic actuator movement the change in set point at every time step was explicitly constrained to a maximum change of 300 m3 h per time step this explicit constraint was added to avoid the need to add another objective to the objective function as done in sun et al 2020a the above optimisation problem is solved using a conventional elitist genetic algorithm goldberg 1989 as it is commonly applied in water resource management nicklow et al 2010 and urban drainage system modelling with rtc in particular for many years rauch and harremoes 1999 in this case study this is done every 5 min of simulation time over a rtc forecasting horizon of 2 h a ga population size of 20 mutation probability of 0 1 using a uniform mutation operation crossover probability of 0 5 for uniform crossover operation a parent portion of 0 25 and a rank based selection operator were used these parameters were iteratively chosen to ensure good search performance the mpc scheme was run locally on a desktop with a four core intel i5 6500 cpu 3 20 ghz cpu a local control procedure following a single input single output structure for the two actuators based on water level as input and flow rate as output was previously developed and found to significantly reduce cso volumes for details see van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 the set points for control station de meeren is set to 5000 m3 h and control station valkenswaard is set to 2500 m3 h and form the optimal static control for the system these restrictions are reached by means of a moveable gate controlled by a local pid controller this moveable gate is activated when wet weather flow using a simple threshold for the observed downstream head is detected inside the system and only opened when the system has gone back to dry weather flow for the catchment studied here flooding issues do not occur frequently due to a cso capacity of around 20 mm hr the inclusion of the flooding term in the objective function eq 1 therefore did not affect the actuator settings for the used catchment but was included to follow a more generalised approach to mpc to facilitate and formalise result comparisons 3 3 precipitation two types of precipitation data were used in this case study 1 the rain gauge adjusted radar dataset overeem holleman and buishand 2009 and 2 the radar precipitation prediction made by the royal netherlands meteorological institute knmi based on two real time radar reflectivity measurements and advective velocity extrapolation of previous observations the latter is available in real time and can be used in predictive control where the former is adjusted based on merging of national and international radar data with the knmi operated rain gauge network available with a delay of a month both datasets have a resolution of 1x1 km at a 5 min interval and 128 pixels were used in the epa swmm5 model radar reflectivity for the prediction data is converted to precipitation depth using the following empirically derived equation 6 i 10 z 109 32 δ t 1 where i is the precipitation intensity in mm hr z is the reflectivity factor observed in dbz and δ t is the observation time step the historical prediction data set spans the years 2014 and 2015 precipitation events within these two years were selected usable events were defined as precipitation events resulting in wet weather flow throughout at least 2 sections of riool zuid with data available for pumping station aalst the latter requirement was only met for the 2015 data set a total of 17 precipitation events from 2015 were used in the final analysis for scenarios 2 till 5 this includes hybrid events i e events with various rainfall peaks considered as one event the maximum intensities for the events ranged from 2 17 to 30 58 mm hr mean of 10 74 mm hr and depths ranging 6 2 43 5 mm mean of 18 3 mm two rainfall events were used for assessing scenario 1 with maximum intensities of 13 and 10 75 mm hr and total rainfall depths of 28 7 and 14 3 mm for events 1 and 2 respectively 4 results this section shows and discusses the results obtained from the simulations as described in the previous section firstly the risk of relative performance loss is shown followed by the risk of operative deterioration the former is assessed for the difference between scenario 1 and 2 followed by the other three scenarios 4 1 risk of relative performance loss scenario 1 can be seen as the highest possible achievable mpc performance for the used strategy and procedure as it neglects all forms of uncertainty which might affect the performance named here the theoretical functioning scenario 1 performed better for the events with a total arpi of 0 79 compared to 0 50 for scenario 2 table 4 fig 4 indicating both considerably improved the system functioning and relative proximity to the maximum achievable performance compared to the baseline this represents a cso reduction of 68 7 and 44 4 respectively this equates to a 35 relative loss based on model uncertainty alone this difference was assessed by looking at the behaviour of the most downstream actuator in the system which was noticeably different during the cso events during the phase of the event when the cso occurred in scenario 1 the flow through actuator 1 was restricted further compared to scenario 2 reducing the cso volume at the downstream locations fig 4 this did cause a limited increase in the cso rate at the upstream cso such that the total cso volume was minimised in scenario 2 more flow was allowed through this control station causing an overall increase in the cso volume as scenario 1 the perfect baseline could only be analysed for two events scenario 2 the practical baseline was used as the baseline for showing the maximum achievable potential of the used mpc scheme the total cso volume of scenarios 2 till 5 following the mpc strategy set out in section 3 2 were compared to the total cso volume obtained using the static optimum settings as determined in previous work van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 reductions in the total cso volumes of the 17 analysed precipitation events were found for all four scenarios fig 5 a and b the boxplots whiskers indicating the 5 95 ci were constructed based on 12 events as five of the used events did not cause overflows in the static optimum these five events are further discussed in section 4 2 scenario 2 showed for the 17 analysed events a 23 8 reduction in the total cso volume and the negation of cso events for two additional precipitation events the absolute rpi for the combined events is 0 53 the latter value indicates the existence of un utilised potential within the system although unlikely to be achieved through rtc with the current actuator configuration for two events the mpc scheme managed to negate the cso event entirely a relatively small relative performance risk was observed for scenario 4 using real radar forecast data in the optimisation model with an arpi of 0 46 and cso reduction of 20 3 compared to the baseline equating to a 14 4 performance loss compared to scenario 2 table 5 one cso event was negated for scenario 3 one less compared to scenario 2 this suggest only a limited risk of relative performance loss when using radar forecasts the frequent updating of the internal mpc model ensures that the importance of accurate forecasting is minimal recent advances in precipitation forecasting are therefore unlikely to yield higher practical performance from mpc systems longer horizons and application of precipitation forecasts to heuristic control have not been assessed in this work and might show different performance related risks a more pronounced relative performance risk was associated with assuming the full capacity of the downstream pumping station with a relative reduction of 45 2 and 47 3 for scenarios 3 and 5 respectively both scenarios exacerbated the frequency of the cso events with an increase in the number of events with cso spills this is further discussed in section 4 2 the relatively large loss of performance corroborates findings by sun et al 2020b which indicate a decrease in efficacy of the mpc scheme under variable wwtp capacity they however consider their variable capacity as a process which can be modelled whereas the pumping capacity decrease here is considered aleatoric in nature the uncertain precipitation forecast and pumping capacity together do not synergistically influence the performance of the mpc scheme in a significant manner based on these results indeed the mean and median of the performance difference between scenario 3 and 5 for these 14 events were 0 5 and 0 respectively assessing the statistical significance of the difference in performance only the difference between scenarios 2 and 3 and between scenarios 2 and 4 were statistically significant following a ks test with ρ 0 05 as indicated by the scatter plots in fig 6 blue indicating significance orange a lack thereof the relative increase in cso volume for scenarios 3 and 5 is associated with an increase in the spill volume of the most downstream cso structure as the optimisation based rtc model assumes full dynamic capacity in the most downstream section of the sewer it reduces less the flow rate through the control stations causing an accumulation of water in the downstream section leading to increased cso volumes an example of this behaviour is shown in fig 7 at the control station de meeren the most downstream of the two control stations for the example in fig 7 scenario 2 did increase the cso volume at the upstream csos however that increase was less compared to the cso volume it reduced at the downstream most cso location a relation between the relative performance loss and precipitation characteristics was investigated too total rainfall depth was previously found to be the best indicator of cso volume for uncontrolled catchments fu and butler 2012 no such relation could be found from the simulated events presented here fig 8 a c the size of the dataset hampers the ability to draw significant relations within the dataset for which a larger dataset would be necessary however linear correlations between precipitation characteristics and performance loss are not expected given that such linear relations are not present in rtc performance either vezzaro 2022 4 2 risk of operative deterioration the risk of operative deterioration was assessed for scenarios 2 5 although uncertainties associated with the optimisation model model parameter structure and initial condition uncertainties are present in all scenarios no operative deterioration was found for scenarios 2 and 4 however for both scenarios 3 and 5 for three and two precipitation events respectively deterioration compared to the static optimal operation was observed causing additional overflows and overflow volumes for these events the additional overflows occurred at the downstream section of the system caused by the same mechanisms which caused the relative performance loss fig 7 although statistically significant statements cannot be made due to the relatively small sample size the risk of operative deterioration seems to be the case for the smaller event with relatively large deviation in performance of the pumping station fig 9 this is the type of precipitation event in which rtc typically has the highest potential vezzaro and grum 2014 kroll et al 2018 which can mean potentially larger risks than reported here given the relatively small dataset within this range of events given that an mpc system aims to maximise the system s capacity uncertainties in the downstream dynamic capacity can have a bigger influence on the system performance if this system is close to its maximum capacity which is the case for smaller events 5 discussion the uncertainty induced performance loss in this study fall within the range reported in literature see table 1 although the relative performance loss of 14 4 is more significant compared to the lowest bracket found 1 2 2 8 it is lower compared to the studies using real rainfall forecasts and the highest level of uncertainty jafari mousavi and kim 2020 zhang et al 2022 the latter using a bias of 25 is comparable to the performance loss associated with the reduced pumping capacity which is in the same range and is also considered a constant bias within the internal mpc model this is particularly interesting as zhang et al 2022 used a drl optimisation procedure indicating comparable results between different real time optimisation procedures it should be noted that the comparison with previous reported values remains difficult due to the case study specificity relative rtc potential and rainfall events used values here are reported in the form of the arpis van der werf kapelan and langeveld 2021 with the aim to allow for better comparative assessment in the future the modelling results obtained here show the importance of considering the risks of relative performance loss within the design stage of the mpc strategy using this method allows the design of the mpc to be more robust against the perceived risks and can give operators a more realistic insight in the implementable potential gains of mpc for their respective system this in turn will aid in the decision making process of investments for future rehabilitation projects of the uds methods to deal with the various sources of uncertainties have been proposed lund et al 2020 proposed a safety margin within their mpc structure of 5 allowing for random errors within the used model structure despite the relatively simple implementation of these safety margins the robustness against incorrect model parameters was improved without large losses in the theoretical performance of the system none of the previous studies reported a risk of operative deterioration within the results however often the results shown were compounded in a singular bar chat as per jafari mousavi and kim 2020 meaning that a literature comparison regarding the risk of operative deterioration could not be adequately done as the viability of an mpc strategy given the risk of operative deterioration depends on the sensitivity of the receiving water body to cso discharges this should be specifically investigated in future similar research for highly sensitive receiving water bodies where the frequency of cso discharges is the most important parameter the risks shown here might not be worth the relative benefits indeed frequencies of dissolved oxygen dips and ammonium peaks have been used in the studied catchment before as the optimisable indicator weijers et al 2012 the acceptability of the mpc associated risks should therefore be dependent on the used assessment framework as described in the urban pollution management manual 3 1 foundation for water research fwr 2018 robust risk appreciation frameworks similar to investment decisions as shown by sriwastava et al 2021 should be developed and put in place to enable informed decision making integrated models able to determine the impact of the cso events are necessary to appreciate the risks and benefits for every rtc system the risks identified here should therefore in future work be extended to impact based rtc strategies e g langeveld et al 2013 the risks identified per source of uncertainty should be studied for different catchments to better understand their respective impacts additionally from a practical implementation point of view various other uncertainties might cause an increase in the risk of operative deterioration e g measurement uncertainty communication issues in the rtc strategy these additional risks should be systematically assessed following the same method as presented here although the risks presented here were identified for an optimisation based control strategy the same risks can apply to heuristic control measures if not explicitly considered within the strategy 6 conclusion this research proposed a methodology to investigate the potential risks associated with using scenarios with various uncertain variables in a model predictive control mpc strategy applied to combined sewer systems csss five scenarios were defined to assess the relative impact of internal mpc model dynamic system capacity and precipitation forecast uncertainties the above risks were assessed on the case study of eindhoven in the netherlands the following conclusions can be drawn from the case study findings uncertainties associated with the mpc framework can have a significant influence on the practically achievable performance of the control strategy and should be investigated prior to implementation model uncertainties and unanticipated fluctuations in dynamic system capacity were found to have the largest influence on the performance unanticipated fluctuations in dynamic system capacity can lead to operative deterioration compared to a statically operated system when not considered within the mpc framework precipitation forecasts uncertainty can cause minor relative performance loss but can be used without significant risk of operative deterioration in an mpc strategy provided that the optimisation frequency is high enough the sources of uncertainty were not found to synergistically reduce the mpc potential nor increase the risk of operative deterioration the trade offs between the benefits of an mpc strategy and perceived risks should be explicitly considered before the implementation of mpc strategies in future research additional uncertainties considered outside the scope of this paper should be considered initial conditions of the runoff and routing internal mpc models and measurement uncertainties as well as additional combinations of these their respective contribution to the here identified risks should be further identified furthermore given the relative high influence of the internal mpc model uncertainty on the risks associated with performance loss a better understanding of the trade offs between computational speed and accuracy is necessary more detailed investigation into the exact mechanics behind the influence of uncertainties should be investigated to facilitate improved risk reduction in future mpc implementations given the large performance loss associated with the system capacity uncertainty and model uncertainty the development of efficient and robust rtc methods to manage these losses should be prioritised additional sources of performance loss such as operational performance of actuators have not been explicitly studied here and should be assessed following a similar framework as proposed here a comparison between heuristically and optimisation based controlled system and their respective risks is also recommended furthermore to further validate the results presented here additional simulations are needed on other case studies the sensitivity of model predictive control to uncertain dynamic capacity should be further assessed for a combined sewer system with multiple pumping stations within the system to further understand the dependency of mpc performance on changing dynamic capacities the dynamics between performance loss and rainfall characteristics should be further investigated as the initial results here show a higher level of risk associated with smaller rainfall events smaller rainfall events are found to be more susceptible to improvement through rtc strategies and the potential impact of these uncertainties on the mpc performance could therefore be higher than described here these results should therefore have to be validated on additional rainfall events and in other catchments credit authorship contribution statement j a van der werf conceptualization methodology writing original draft z kapelan supervision writing review editing j langeveld supervision

2499,in many environments climate change causes an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large infrequent disturbances lids lids make fragile areas as mountain basins even more vulnerable along with local communities that could be severely affected by extreme events among all lids windthrows are one of the most relevant and yet rather unpredictable disturbances affecting the alpine region windthrows can affect the forest cover and morphological settings at the basin scale changing the supply of sediments to river networks and affecting the sediment cascading processes this work aims at i identifying the contribution of suspended sediment load ssl from a windthrow managed affected area induced in an alpine basin by a recent lid vaia rainstorm 2018 ii assessing the annual seasonal and monthly variation in the ssl and iii analysing the changes in ssl fluxes and dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd year after the lid in comparison to those detected after a similar high magnitude event occurred in 1994 to do so two multiparameter sondes measuring the water level and the turbidity were installed upstream and downstream the windthrow affected area discharge measurements and water samples were collected to obtain the rating curves and calibrate the turbidity meters in order to derive suspended sediment loads ssl the results show that the windthrow affected area was significantly contributing suspended sediment during events occurring two years after vaia 2020 but less intensively in those occurred three years after the event itself 2021 both the events average intensity rainfalls and the total precipitation appear to be the best predictors of both the peak of suspended sediment concentration sscp the total suspended sediment ssl and the suspended sediment percentage variation among the two cross sections the seasonal and monthly analysis revealed to be in line with those detected prior the disturbance the analyzed lid affected the transport efficiency for near bankfull events but not the annual sediment yield as it was found after the previous high magnitude flood event recorded in 1994 unexpectedly the mean rate of ssl 42 t km 2 yr 1 is indeed comparable with what monitored during the decade before vaia 2004 2014 40 t km 2 yr 1 such surprising results may be explained by the fact that the rio cordon basin have had an alluvial response rather than colluvial during the vaia rainstorm event and that the basin s resilience may be in a different stage as compared to the one of 1994 when the catchment featured different cascading processes that completely overturn the suspended sediment dynamics and fluxes for about a decade keywords vaia rainstorm suspended sediment cascading processes mountain basin resilience data

downstream yager et al 2012 the occurrence of large disturbances as high magnitude floods determines in a short time large transport of coarse sediments but also cohesive soil and vegetation this overturns the entire equilibrium of a basin system renewing the availability of sediment and adjusting the pre existing trend of transport processes and dynamics nanson and huang 2018 sediment transport is commonly classified into bedload and suspended load einstein et al 1940 turowski et al 2010 suspended sediment transport refers to sediments displaced for long distances within the water column and not interacting with the channel bed einstein et al 1940 misset et al 2021 although the fine fraction may also originate directly from the riverbed resuspension park and hunt 2017 the suspended sediment is the result of the interplay between different factors such as the impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances thus climatic conditions rainfall intensities catchment

entailing alteration in the river system functioning lane et al 2019 in fact the increase in frequency of large disturbances as well as the decrease in ordinary events i e snowmelt and rainfall events bakker et al 2018 comiti et al 2019 is expected to completely rearrange the dynamic equilibrium of the mountain systems misset et al 2021 therefore it is becoming even more important to study the suspended sediment dynamics to understand soil degradation processes nadal romero et al 2013 and to analyse and predict the future ecological status of the riverine environment albers and petticrew 2013 recent literature shows that in alpine streams the suspended sediment is typically transported during flood events pagano et al 2019 however the relationship between the suspended sediment concentration ssc and water discharge q is dependent on many factors such as particle size basin topography erosional activity bed morphology and hydraulic processes mouri et al 2014 sun et al 2016

g asselman 1999 rovira and batalla 2006 gao and pasternack 2007 counterclockwise hysteresis is instead associated to suspended sediment coming from sediment sources far away from the monitoring site

degree of hysteretic loops providing an index based on the size and direction of the loop itself the idea of using normalized values of ssc and q improved the possibility of comparing events of different areas mao and carillo 2017 in this sense suspended sediment contribution from anthropogenic practices i e mining land use forest operation etc seems to cause considerable disturbance to the channel fluxes gomi et al 2005 glendell and brazier 2014 although the major portion of suspended sediment fluxes in mountain streams is commonly provided by large rainfall events coynel et al 2004 moatar et al 2006 duvert et al 2011 therefore in the context of climate change where large disturbances are becoming more frequent and challenging to predict yildiz et al 2022 a better understanding of sediment fluxes during and after extreme events is needed in order to improve land management and adaptation practices this work aims at fulfilling this gap analysing an alpine basin throughout the first 2 3 years following the catastrophic vaia rainstorm event rainato et al 2021 pellegrini et al 2021a more specifically it focuses on i identifying the contribution of ssl from a windthrow managed affected area caused by the vaia event in an alpine basin ii quantifying the annual seasonal and monthly variation of ssl and iii analysing the changes in suspended sediment fluxes and dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd year after the in comparison to those detected after a similar high magnitude event occurred in 1994 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the rio cordon basin is an alpine catchment located in the northeast of italy dolomites fig 1 a it has an extension of 5 km2 with an altitude ranging between 1763 m a s l and 2763 m a s l and a mean slope of 27 on the one hand dolomite and volcanic rocks wengen formation compose the geology of the upper part of the basin on the other hand sandstones and calcareous marly rocks buchenstein formation feature the lower part alpine pastures cover most part of the basin area 61 followed by shrubs 18 bare lands 14 and norway spruce forests picea abies 7 oss cazzador et al 2020 overall the basin can be divided into three different physiographic and altimetric areas the upper part constituted by exposed dolomites rocks the middle flat one confined by a waterfall and belonging to the wengen formation group and the lower part that is from a sedimentological point of view completely disconnected from the mid one and that is characterized by buchenstein formation and quaternary deposits in this area the active channel featured cascade step pool and riffle pool morphologies the bankfull width and discharge are 5 3 m and 2 3 m3 s lenzi et al 2006 rainato et al 2020 respectively between 1986 and 2018 the mean annual precipitation was around 1180 mm pellegrini et al 2021b while the mean temperature 2010 2021 was 3 9 c the rio cordon basin features a nivo pluvial regime favouring snowfalls either during the early autumn winter season and early spring or short and intense rainfall events during the rest of the year a permanent station for a long term monitoring program was installed in 1985 and allowed to characterize the climatic hydrological and sedimentological dynamics acting in this alpine basin fattorelli et al 1988 before the occurrence of vaia rainstorm the largest flood ever recorded at the experimental station occurred on 14th september 1994 it was a flash flood of an estimated return interval of 60 years triggered by an average event rainfall intensity of 16 mm h 1 which produced a peak water discharge of 10 4 m3 s lenzi et al 2003 these conditions caused the transport of over 900 m3 of bedload picco et al 2012 and 2432 9 t of suspended sediment load however the long term monitoring program was interrupted in the rio cordon in october 2018 due to the occurrence of another large disturbance i e the vaia rainstorm 2 2 vaia rainstorm description between 27th and 30th october 2018 the rio cordon was highly affected by the vaia rainstorm event chirici et al 2019 pellegrini et al 2021b rainato et al 2021 along the entire northeast of italy such event caused over 41 000 ha of forest loss and activated landslides debris flows floods and damages to villages hydraulic structures and infrastructures indeed wind gusts exceeding 200 km h 1 afternoon and evening of 29th october 2018 and cumulative precipitation over 500 mm were registered davolio et al 2020 giovannini et al 2021 for the rio cordon the analyses of rainato et al 2021 reported that the vaia induced precipitation was equal to 352 mm and lasted 80 h the maximum intensity between the 6 h and 72 h characterized the event with a recurrence interval ri of 50 years during the event however a hiatus of around 9 h was detected such interruption permitted to split the event into two distinct phases the first lasted 36 8 h and summed around 200 mm of rain while the second lasted 34 2 h and counted over 150 mm although the lower amount of precipitation the second phase registered the highest value of peak discharge 16 4 m3s 1 exceeding 100 years of ri rainato et al 2021 these conditions caused a bedload volume of about 6800 m3 overall the event created and reactivated over 25 new sediment sources among landslides debris flows channels and bank erosions martini et al 2022 however only 7 5 landslides and 2 debris flows sediment sources resulted as functionally connected to the channel network and therefore able to actively contribute in terms of sediment martini et al 2022 such analyses highlighted the fact that the rio cordon has had a predominant alluvial response especially in the lower part where the morphology of the channel was completely naturally restructured rainato et al 2021 in addition 139 trees of picea abies were blown down and uprooted picco et al 2020 producing large and intense bank failures in summer 2019 forest operations were made to remove the entire material leaving the slopes completely bare fig 1d and with huge amounts of loose fine material pellegrini et al 2021b 2 3 discharge and sediment monitoring the discharge and sediments monitoring were conducted in two different cross sections fig 1 one upstream hereafter csa and one downstream hereafter csb the windthrow affected area csa and csb are spaced 300 m and are located in a reach of the rio cordon characterized by the absence of tributaries since the end of august 2020 two multiparameter water quality sonde ott hydrolab ms5 and hydrolab hl4 were installed in order to monitor turbidity within a range between 0 and 3000 ntu 1 up to 100 ntu 3 from 100 to 400 ntu 5 from 400 to 3000 ntu mao and carrillo 2017 similarly two pressure transducer sensors were mounted to monitor the water level m across two cross sections rather stable due to the presence of large boulders additionally rainfall information was obtained through a s rgd m002 davis rain gauge smart sensor 4 0 accuracy rainfall water levels and turbidity data were acquired with a 15 min resolution to establish the two rating curves among the water level and the discharge 30 and 28 discharge salt dilution measurements were realized in csa and csb respectively to this end a variable quantity of 0 25 and 0 50 kg of nacl mixed to stream water was used as tracer comiti et al 2007 while a portable conductivity meters wtw cond340i was used to record the electrical conductivity variations then the discharge was computed according to moore 2005 obtaining a range of 0 07 1 54 m3 s and 0 07 1 61 m3 s in csa and csb respectively the obtained water level discharge rating curves exhibited a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 89 in csa and 0 85 in csb fig 2 moreover 24 water samples were collected in order to derive an empirical relationship between ntu and suspended sediment concentration ssc g l 1 applicable to both csa and csb the samples were collected randomly during the rainfall events of the monitoring period and covered a range of ntu between 1 and 2109 fig 2c the collected samples were filtered through a fiberglass filter dried at 105 c and quantified as concentration of suspended sediment in g l 1 the power law empirical regression fitted with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 92 the monitoring activities ended in november 2021 defining a monitoring period of 16 months august 2020 november 2021 2 4 dataset preparation and analysis to investigate the suspended sediment dynamics acting in the two monitored cross sections the analysis was divided into four different timescales event month season and annual regarding the flood event the starting and ending point of the flood were defined when the following dynamics were verified i a significant and fast increase in the water discharge and ii a water discharge call back to the initial flow fig 3 in this sense the analyses focused on 8 isolated flood events hereafter fe1 to fe8 and considered precipitation discharge and suspended sediment transport see in table 1 because one of the aims was to detect changes among the area upstream csa and downstream csb the windthrow affected area the variables presented two sets of data one for csa and one for csb fig 1 respectively for each cross section and event descriptive statistical analysis and their correlation matrices were produced to this end the pearson correlation test hereinafter cor test with a level of significance equal to 95 was used using r studio 2022 02 0 moreover the hysteresis relationship between q and ssc was described both the shape circular or eight shaped and the loop clockwise or counterclockwise of the hysteretic cycles were used to classify the events additionally to quantitatively assess the degree of hysteresis the index proposed by aich et al 2014 was used the normalized values of q and ssc were computed as to define a line starting from the value of qp and ending at the last value of the temporal series thus the final value of the index h is computed summing the distances from the farthest ssc value in the rising and falling limb of the loop mao and carrillo 2017 the positive or negative values of the index h define whether the loop is clockwise or counterclockwise respectively moreover the data were used to provide information concerning the variations of ssl between the two cross sections the results were then used to verify whether or not a regression among the percentages variation of ssl and hydrological data could be determined furthermore the analysis conducted at a month and seasonal scale took into consideration each month 16 months from august 2020 to november 2021 of the monitoring period and the three main seasons snowmelt 1st april 15th june summer 15th june 31st august and autumn 1st september 30th november the dates of starting and ending periods of the seasons were retrieved by rainato et al 2017 to this end only the data provided by the downstream section csb were used in order to provide possible comparisons with the historic suspended sediment budget measured at the measuring station 3 results 3 1 upstream csa and downstream csb comparing correlation matrices and changes in the sediment contribution at event scale during the eight events registered csa featured different variables as descriptors of the suspended sediment transport fig 4 a table 2 taking the sscm into consideration significant correlations cor test p value 0 05 were found with the precipitation i e with ptot imax and iav however the ptot and the iav were found significant cor test p value 0 05 when taken into account also the sscp the latter was also highly correlated cor test p value 0 05 with sscm variable when concentrating on the hydrological variables instead the descriptors for the qp were the ptot and the iav respectively ptot and iav were mutually correlated focusing on csb fig 4b the suspended sediment descriptors seemed similar but not identical to those of csa as far as the sscm is concerned along with the ptot cor test p value 0 05 the ru and the ssl also resulted significantly correlated a significant correlation was registered for the same descriptors when the sscp is considered unlike csa the ssl was also found positively and significantly correlated to the ptot and the ru respectively regarding the hydrological variables instead the results of the correlation matrix were equal to those of csa therefore the qp was positively correlated to ptot and iav ptot and iav that were again correlated to each other and to imax additionally the percentage variation between the two monitoring sites was computed table 2 the flood event fe1 produced a huge variation in terms of ssl i e 77 7 between csb and csa similarly fe2 featured a percentage variation in ssl of over 90 as far as fe3 and fe4 are concerned both events featured similar variations of ssl i e 10 3 the former and 14 3 the latter fe5 which was registered halfway between the snowmelt and spring season was the longest event ever monitored in this study and it led to a ssl variation of 34 1 during spring and summer 2021 instead three overall events were monitored fe6 featured a negative variation of 1 9 while fe7 and fe8 registered a ssl percentage variation of 18 9 and 24 4 respectively 3 2 upstream csa and downstream csb cross sections precipitation influence on ssl variations a further analysis considering the correlation among the variation in ssl and the three different precipitation variables imax ptot and iav was carried out although showing a slight positive correlation with the suspended sediment percentage variation imax did not provide any revealing trend fig 6 a r2 0 17 iav of each event fig 6b instead showed a positive correlation r2 0 63 with the variation in suspended sediment lastly the ptot was registered as the most correlated variable r2 0 74 fig 6c 3 3 upstream csa and downstream csb cross sections hysteresis patterns analysis in order to characterize the ssc q relationship for each event the data collected on both cross sections were analysed and quantified using the h index aich et al 2014 table 3 six out of eight events registered in both csa and csb featured a rather circular clockwise c hysteresis loop fig 7 a in fact the index of the c loops was always between 0 01 and 0 17 the two remaining events that were all monitored during the summer and autumn seasons 2020 registered for csb and csa eight shaped and circular counterclockwise loops fig 7b conversely the h index was found to be covering a higher range of negative values from 0 08 to 1 05 respectively the weakest value of 0 08 was represented by the fe1 in csa while the strongest 0 99 and 1 05 by the fe2 for both csa and csb fig 8 a overall the relations between the h index and qp showed a slight negative linear regression for both csa and csb fig 8b 3 4 annual monthly and seasonal averages variations herein the annual monthly and seasonal values of precipitation water discharge and suspended sediment load are analysed along the monitoring period august 2020 november 2021 the overall precipitation registered 1574 4 mm of which 523 mm attributable to the last portion of 2020 and the residual 1051 4 mm to the entire year 2021 the qm registered 0 34 m3 s while the total ssl measured 452 9 t 250 3 t produced in autumn 2020 while the remaining 202 6 t during the entire 2020 this information provided an overall suspended sediment yield of 42 t km 2 yr 1 for the period august 2020 november 2021 as far as the monthly precipitation is concerned the highest value was registered in october 2020 featuring over 279 mm of cumulative precipitation and 9 mm daily average while the lowest value of cumulative rainfall was detected in november 2020 13 6 mm the highest monthly qm was measured in june 2021 and was about 0 66 m3 s this value represents a response to the snowmelt and rain on snow recorded in this month especially over the first 15 days the lowest value of discharge instead was measured in november 2021 0 12 m3 s even if the precipitation featured a value of over 160 mm as for the precipitation the month with the highest total ssl was october 2020 with 194 3 t and was clearly related to the number of rainy days fallen detected during the month conversely the month exhibiting the lowest ssl was again november 2021 with 10 8 t fig 9 the most rainfall contributing season was summer 2021 with over 435 mm of cumulative rain the lowest was recorded during the snowmelt 2021 where the cumulative precipitation was 253 mm during the monitoring period the season with the highest value of qm was the snowmelt 2021 with a value of 0 50 m3 s the lowest was instead autumn 2021 with 0 13 m3 s unlike qm and the precipitation the highest ssl was registered in autumn 2020 in this case the ssl reached a value of over 250 t as for the minimum qm the lowest value of ssl was found in autumn 2021 with 40 t 4 discussions 4 1 sixteen months of monitoring controlling factors and differences between upstream and downstream windthrow affected area in the rio cordon eight events were registered during the monitoring period august 2020 november 2021 the factors controlling the suspended sediment load were identified among the extracted variables table 1 and the total precipitation ptot was found to be the most correlated to sscm and sscp measured at both the monitoring sites csa and csb as pointed out by penna et al 2011 the limited area of the rio cordon basin around 5 km2 can induce a rapid response to rainfall generating fast floods and powerful erosion processes which could explain the detected dynamics nonetheless the additional analysis showed a clear correlation between the percentage variation of ssl and both the iav and the ptot fig 6 this seems to suggest that the contribution of ssl from the windthrow affected area was controlled by the flood cumulative precipitation and average intensity 1 h rather than by the maximum intensity indicating that the duration of the events rather than the peak is more important in determining the amount of suspended sediments recruited from the bank and low lying berms overall unlike the observations of duvert et al 2012 who analysed over eight catchments between mexico french alps and spanish pyrenees and those of pagano et al 2019 in the rio cordon pre vaia the event peak discharge was not the best predictor of suspended sediment transport both in terms of ssl and sscp being this a novel result for the rio cordon further analysis should be needed however this result could be partially explained by the fast recovery of the rio cordon step pool configuration which occurred after barely two years from the vaia event pellegrini et al 2021b indeed in 2020 the step pool non dimensional steepness factor was 1 44 which is very close to 1 5 the value for which it s suggested that i flow resistance of the step pool morphology is maximized and for which ii the armoured layer is well developed abrahams and atkinson 1995 these conditions lead to a highly stable streambed and to a significant energy dissipation comiti et al 2019 which could clarify the observed complex relations between flow conditions and sediment fluxes also the structural and functional disconnectivity of the upper part of the basin martini et al 2022 limits the downstream sediment supply when the hysteresis patterns are taken into account it is worth noticing the different response of the catchment during the two years of monitoring summer autumn 2020 and 2021 in 2020 the rio cordon featured only counterclockwise loops in both csa and csb table 3 revealing the faster arrival of qp than sscp this suggests that two years after the vaia event the sediment availability may have been still abundant given the fact that vaia did not activate many new functionally connected sediment sources at the scale of basin martini et al 2022 the high sediment availability is likely to be due to in channel processes such as bank erosions and the progressive cleaning of finer sediments from the river network which is also confirmed by the increase of armouring and the reestablishment of a marked step pool morphology by means of pool scouring in the rio cordon pellegrini et al 2021b however the differences of ssl among hysteresis measured at csa and csb monitoring sites suggest that the windthrow affected area was active and functionally connected to the active channel during the first two events fe1 and fe2 interestingly such dynamic did not change the hysteresis loop of the events from counterclockwise to clockwise meaning that the sediment contribution from the upstream basin prevailed over the sediment originated from the windthrow affected area differently during 2021 the basin featured a faster response in terms of sediment transport rather than of water discharge showing a prevalence of clockwise hysteresis loops such results are consistent with what presented by seeger et al 2004 in the arnás catchment pyrenees and by bezak et al 2016 in small slovenian catchments which showed that ordinary events along channel networks with close and ready available sediment sources generate clockwise loops however as demonstrated by the computed index of hysteresis proposed by aich et al 2014 the loop appeared to be weak due to probably the ready available sediment located in the active channel and very close to the two monitoring sites as was found by mao and carrillo 2017 in the estero morales chilean basin however the results showed that the contribution sourced from the close in channel available material rather than from the windthrow affected area that did not provide any evidence of suspended sediment contribution during the 2021 events fig 5 once again this result can be explained by the exhaustion of the upstream sediment availability and by the presence of the hanging valley lying in the centre of the basin that represents a major topographical feature that highly influence the sediment dynamics thus the only sources able to contribute suspended sediment to the outlet are those located in the downstream connected half of the basin rainato et al 2018 lenzi and marchi 2000 martini et al 2022 these changes in the hysteresis loops and indexes suggest that after the vaia rainstorm the ready available is depleting progressively from upstream to downstream likely adjusting the sediment storage along the active channel until the outlet of the basin nonetheless it is possible that the ready available sediment could have been originated at least partially during the last event of october 2020 4 2 comparison with historical data by comparing the flood events occurred before and after the two large disturbances i e september 1994 and october 2018 fig 10 shows that at discharges 3 m3 s 1 the after lids events exhibited higher suspended sediment transport efficiency while at higher discharges 3 m3 s 1 the suspended sediment transport is rather comparable with the events monitored after the lids in this sense as way of example the before lid event of 3rd may 2003 exhibited a qp of 1 02 m3 s and a ssl equal to 0 2 t which is around one fortieth of the ssl 8 76 t registered in the fe3 qp 1 00 m3 s that fall within the after lids group also the before lid event of the 5th october 1992 that featured a qp of 2 91 m3 s and a ssl of 4 8 t diverged considerably from the after lid event of 16th october 1996 which exhibited a ssl of 294 4 t with a qp of 2 96 m3 s on the contrary the largest before lid event of 3rd july 1989 qp 4 39 featured a value of ssl 223 9 t in the same order of magnitude as compare to the after lid event of 7th october 1998 qp 4 73 m3 s which transported around 294 4 t in terms of sediment yield the 42 t km 2 yr 1 of suspended sediment featured in the period august 2020 november 2021 was comparable to the 40 t km 2 yr 1 measured in the stable and armoured period 2003 2014 rainato et al 2017 lenzi 2001 if on the one hand this value falls within the range of mean sediment delivery 50 5000 t km 2 yr 1 noticed in over 200 alpine basins by hinderer et al 2013 on the other hand this result suggested that vaia did not induce a subsequent increase in the sediment fluxes as instead observed in the rio cordon basin after the september 1994 flood event sediment yield 1994 2002 149 4 t km 2 yr 1 rainato et al 2017 despite the fact that the suspended sediment amounts mobilized two years after vaia were comparable to those monitored before it the results have stressed a higher transport efficiency for lower and near bankfull events qp 2 54 m3 s the limited influence of vaia on the suspended sediment amounts could be explained by the fact that the rio cordon exhibited an alluvial rather than a colluvial response during the event rainato et al 2021 in fact most sediments transported during the event were likely provided by the channel and banks and the number of sediment sources connected to the channel network remained rather constant martini et al 2022 the limited contribution of sediment sources at the basin scale was also somehow confirmed by the comparison of the two monitored cross sections which demonstrated the exhaustion of sediment supply by the windthrow affected area already after two years also pellegrini et al 2021b demonstrated that after barely two years of ordinary conditions in the rio cordon the step pool configuration was re established such process as already demonstrate by lenzi 2001 reinforces the observation that a substantial change in the suspended sediment delivery and availability was not evident however although this work took into account eight events over 16 months further analyses are required in the near future in order to implement the data with longer time monitoring to catch a larger magnitude range of floods and to see whether a formative flood allow the basin to jump to another resilience state additionally due i to health and safety issues imposed by the logging interventions in 2019 and ii to covid restrictions between march june 2020 the post event monitoring had to start in august 2020 which limited the chances of including in the analysis the effects of the event occurred between november 2018 and august 2020 however further fingerprinting investigations to understand which are the contributing sediment sources and how their functional connectivity changes during different seasons and or floods event would be highly recommended nonetheless as it seemed that the ready available sediment is quickly moving from upstream to downstream it would also be interesting to quantify the sediment storage along the active channel and therefore to understand how it moves 5 conclusions the severe vaia event produced different impacts on the alpine rio cordon basin producing exceptional responses from hydrological to sedimentological and geomorphic points of view as far as concerns the after event processes instead no clues but only open questions were given this work can be summarized taking inspiration by the two questions raised by rainato et al 2021 i what can be expected for the future ii has the october 2018 event represented the new ground zero for the rio cordon basin the answer to the first question although retrieved by sixteen months of suspended sediment monitoring is that the vaia lid seems not to have triggered the expected cascading processes as it occurred for the 1994 flood both the analysis at event and seasonal scale in fact show that the suspended sediment fluxes were pretty much in line with what registered during the pre event condition 2003 2014 demonstrating that the equilibrium of the basin seems not to have been overturned indeed not even the windthrow affected area seemed to have contribute sediment to the active channel sediment transport benefiting from a long term monitoring program that accounted two large and infrequent floods it was possible to investigate the alteration induced by them on the suspended sediment dynamics interestingly evidence of higher transport efficiency for the after lid events was mainly found for discharges lower than 3 m3 s fig 10 in that case apparently the post lid condition seems to be more efficient in terms of suspended sediment contribution however as the monitoring of the events after vaia covered only the suspended sediment analysis for lower than bankfull and near bankfull events further monitoring to register higher magnitude floods and bedload dynamics is surely needed the answer to the second question instead seems clearer and again far from the expected results apparently the ground zero was not achieved as instead seems to have happened after 1994 flood resilience seems to be the keyword that may explain the different dynamics that occurred after large disturbances if we consider the resilience as a ladder the different rungs can represent the stages of the rio cordon basin lower rungs mean low resilience and vice versa therefore if we consider the two large disturbances affecting the rio cordon in the last 35 years 1994 flood and the vaia rainstorm they can be placed at two different heights lower and higher as far as concerns the former and the latter respectively however to answer more precisely to these questions further investigation is needed in order to cover up either or both ordinary and high magnitude events and considering a whole analysis of sediment transport which takes into account suspended and bedload sediment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

2499,in many environments climate change causes an increase in the frequency and magnitude of large infrequent disturbances lids lids make fragile areas as mountain basins even more vulnerable along with local communities that could be severely affected by extreme events among all lids windthrows are one of the most relevant and yet rather unpredictable disturbances affecting the alpine region windthrows can affect the forest cover and morphological settings at the basin scale changing the supply of sediments to river networks and affecting the sediment cascading processes this work aims at i identifying the contribution of suspended sediment load ssl from a windthrow managed affected area induced in an alpine basin by a recent lid vaia rainstorm 2018 ii assessing the annual seasonal and monthly variation in the ssl and iii analysing the changes in ssl fluxes and dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd year after the lid in comparison to those detected after a similar high magnitude event occurred in 1994 to do so two multiparameter sondes measuring the water level and the turbidity were installed upstream and downstream the windthrow affected area discharge measurements and water samples were collected to obtain the rating curves and calibrate the turbidity meters in order to derive suspended sediment loads ssl the results show that the windthrow affected area was significantly contributing suspended sediment during events occurring two years after vaia 2020 but less intensively in those occurred three years after the event itself 2021 both the events average intensity rainfalls and the total precipitation appear to be the best predictors of both the peak of suspended sediment concentration sscp the total suspended sediment ssl and the suspended sediment percentage variation among the two cross sections the seasonal and monthly analysis revealed to be in line with those detected prior the disturbance the analyzed lid affected the transport efficiency for near bankfull events but not the annual sediment yield as it was found after the previous high magnitude flood event recorded in 1994 unexpectedly the mean rate of ssl 42 t km 2 yr 1 is indeed comparable with what monitored during the decade before vaia 2004 2014 40 t km 2 yr 1 such surprising results may be explained by the fact that the rio cordon basin have had an alluvial response rather than colluvial during the vaia rainstorm event and that the basin s resilience may be in a different stage as compared to the one of 1994 when the catchment featured different cascading processes that completely overturn the suspended sediment dynamics and fluxes for about a decade keywords vaia rainstorm suspended sediment cascading processes mountain basin resilience data

overturns the entire equilibrium of a basin system renewing the availability of sediment and adjusting the pre existing trend of transport processes and dynamics nanson and huang 2018 sediment transport is commonly classified into bedload and suspended load einstein et al 1940 turowski et al 2010 suspended sediment transport refers to sediments displaced for long distances within the water column and not interacting with the channel bed einstein et al 1940 misset et al 2021 although the fine fraction may also originate directly from the riverbed resuspension park and hunt 2017 the

entailing alteration in the river system functioning lane et al 2019 in fact the increase in frequency of large disturbances as well as the decrease in ordinary events i e snowmelt and rainfall events bakker et al 2018 comiti et al 2019 is expected to completely rearrange the dynamic equilibrium of the mountain systems misset et al 2021 therefore it is becoming even more important to study the suspended sediment dynamics to understand soil degradation processes nadal romero et al 2013 and to analyse and predict the future ecological status of the riverine environment albers and petticrew 2013 recent literature shows that in alpine streams the suspended sediment is typically transported during flood events pagano et al 2019 however the relationship between the suspended sediment concentration ssc and water discharge q is dependent on many factors such as particle size basin topography erosional activity bed morphology and hydraulic processes mouri et al 2014 sun et al 2016

g asselman 1999 rovira and batalla 2006 gao and pasternack 2007 counterclockwise hysteresis is instead associated to suspended sediment coming from sediment sources far away from the monitoring site

degree of hysteretic loops providing an index based on the size and direction of the loop itself the idea of using normalized values of ssc and q improved the possibility of comparing events of different areas mao and carillo 2017 in this sense suspended sediment contribution from anthropogenic practices i e mining land use forest operation etc seems to cause considerable disturbance to the channel fluxes gomi et al 2005 glendell and brazier 2014 although the major portion of suspended sediment fluxes in mountain streams is commonly provided by large rainfall events coynel et al 2004 moatar et al 2006 duvert et al 2011 therefore in the context of climate change where large disturbances are becoming more frequent and challenging to predict yildiz et al 2022 a better understanding of sediment fluxes during and after extreme events is needed in order to improve land management and adaptation practices this work aims at fulfilling this gap analysing an alpine basin throughout the first 2 3 years following the catastrophic vaia rainstorm event rainato et al 2021 pellegrini et al 2021a more specifically it focuses on i identifying the contribution of ssl from a windthrow managed affected area caused by the vaia event in an alpine basin ii quantifying the annual seasonal and monthly variation of ssl and iii analysing the changes in suspended sediment fluxes and dynamics in the 2nd and 3rd year after the in comparison to those detected after a similar high magnitude event occurred in 1994 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the rio cordon basin is an alpine catchment located in the northeast of italy dolomites fig 1 a it has an extension of 5 km2 with an altitude ranging between 1763 m a s l and 2763 m a s l and a mean slope of 27 on the one hand dolomite and volcanic rocks wengen formation compose the geology of the upper part of the basin on the other hand sandstones and calcareous marly rocks buchenstein formation feature the lower part alpine pastures cover most part of the basin area 61 followed by shrubs 18 bare lands 14 and norway spruce forests picea abies 7 oss cazzador et al 2020 overall the basin can be divided into three different physiographic and altimetric areas the upper part constituted by exposed dolomites rocks the middle flat one confined by a waterfall and belonging to the wengen formation group and the lower part that is from a sedimentological point of view completely disconnected from the mid one and that is characterized by buchenstein formation and quaternary deposits in this area the active channel featured cascade step pool and riffle pool morphologies the bankfull width and discharge are 5 3 m and 2 3 m3 s lenzi et al 2006 rainato et al 2020 respectively between 1986 and 2018 the mean annual precipitation was around 1180 mm pellegrini et al 2021b while the mean temperature 2010 2021 was 3 9 c the rio cordon basin features a nivo pluvial regime favouring snowfalls either during the early autumn winter season and early spring or short and intense rainfall events during the rest of the year a permanent station for a long term monitoring program was installed in 1985 and allowed to characterize the climatic hydrological and sedimentological dynamics acting in this alpine basin fattorelli et al 1988 before the occurrence of vaia rainstorm the largest flood ever recorded at the experimental station occurred on 14th september 1994 it was a flash flood of an estimated return interval of 60 years triggered by an average event rainfall intensity of 16 mm h 1 which produced a peak water discharge of 10 4 m3 s lenzi et al 2003 these conditions caused the transport of over 900 m3 of bedload picco et al 2012 and 2432 9 t of suspended sediment load however the long term monitoring program was interrupted in the rio cordon in october 2018 due to the occurrence of another large disturbance i e the vaia rainstorm 2 2 vaia rainstorm description between 27th and 30th october 2018 the rio cordon was highly affected by the vaia rainstorm event chirici et al 2019 pellegrini et al 2021b rainato et al 2021 along the entire northeast of italy such event caused over 41 000 ha of forest loss and activated landslides debris flows floods and damages to villages hydraulic structures and infrastructures indeed wind gusts exceeding 200 km h 1 afternoon and evening of 29th october 2018 and cumulative precipitation over 500 mm were registered davolio et al 2020 giovannini et al 2021 for the rio cordon the analyses of rainato et al 2021 reported that the vaia induced precipitation was equal to 352 mm and lasted 80 h the maximum intensity between the 6 h and 72 h characterized the event with a recurrence interval ri of 50 years during the event however a hiatus of around 9 h was detected such interruption permitted to split the event into two distinct phases the first lasted 36 8 h and summed around 200 mm of rain while the second lasted 34 2 h and counted over 150 mm although the lower amount of precipitation the second phase registered the highest value of peak discharge 16 4 m3s 1 exceeding 100 years of ri rainato et al 2021 these conditions caused a bedload volume of about 6800 m3 overall the event created and reactivated over 25 new sediment sources among landslides debris flows channels and bank erosions martini et al 2022 however only 7 5 landslides and 2 debris flows sediment sources resulted as functionally connected to the channel network and therefore able to actively contribute in terms of sediment martini et al 2022 such analyses highlighted the fact that the rio cordon has had a predominant alluvial response especially in the lower part where the morphology of the channel was completely naturally restructured rainato et al 2021 in addition 139 trees of picea abies were blown down and uprooted picco et al 2020 producing large and intense bank failures in summer 2019 forest operations were made to remove the entire material leaving the slopes completely bare fig 1d and with huge amounts of loose fine material pellegrini et al 2021b 2 3 discharge and sediment monitoring the discharge and sediments monitoring were conducted in two different cross sections fig 1 one upstream hereafter csa and one downstream hereafter csb the windthrow affected area csa and csb are spaced 300 m and are located in a reach of the rio cordon characterized by the absence of tributaries since the end of august 2020 two multiparameter water quality sonde ott hydrolab ms5 and hydrolab hl4 were installed in order to monitor turbidity within a range between 0 and 3000 ntu 1 up to 100 ntu 3 from 100 to 400 ntu 5 from 400 to 3000 ntu mao and carrillo 2017 similarly two pressure transducer sensors were mounted to monitor the water level m across two cross sections rather stable due to the presence of large boulders additionally rainfall information was obtained through a s rgd m002 davis rain gauge smart sensor 4 0 accuracy rainfall water levels and turbidity data were acquired with a 15 min resolution to establish the two rating curves among the water level and the discharge 30 and 28 discharge salt dilution measurements were realized in csa and csb respectively to this end a variable quantity of 0 25 and 0 50 kg of nacl mixed to stream water was used as tracer comiti et al 2007 while a portable conductivity meters wtw cond340i was used to record the electrical conductivity variations then the discharge was computed according to moore 2005 obtaining a range of 0 07 1 54 m3 s and 0 07 1 61 m3 s in csa and csb respectively the obtained water level discharge rating curves exhibited a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 89 in csa and 0 85 in csb fig 2 moreover 24 water samples were collected in order to derive an empirical relationship between ntu and suspended sediment concentration ssc g l 1 applicable to both csa and csb the samples were collected randomly during the rainfall events of the monitoring period and covered a range of ntu between 1 and 2109 fig 2c the collected samples were filtered through a fiberglass filter dried at 105 c and quantified as concentration of suspended sediment in g l 1 the power law empirical regression fitted with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 92 the monitoring activities ended in november 2021 defining a monitoring period of 16 months august 2020 november 2021 2 4 dataset preparation and analysis to investigate the suspended sediment dynamics acting in the two monitored cross sections the analysis was divided into four different timescales event month season and annual regarding the flood event the starting and ending point of the flood were defined when the following dynamics were verified i a significant and fast increase in the water discharge and ii a water discharge call back to the initial flow fig 3 in this sense the analyses focused on 8 isolated flood events hereafter fe1 to fe8 and considered precipitation discharge and suspended sediment transport see in table 1 because one of the aims was to detect changes among the area upstream csa and downstream csb the windthrow affected area the variables presented two sets of data one for csa and one for csb fig 1 respectively for each cross section and event descriptive statistical analysis and their correlation matrices were produced to this end the pearson correlation test hereinafter cor test with a level of significance equal to 95 was used using r studio 2022 02 0 moreover the hysteresis relationship between q and ssc was described both the shape circular or eight shaped and the loop clockwise or counterclockwise of the hysteretic cycles were used to classify the events additionally to quantitatively assess the degree of hysteresis the index proposed by aich et al 2014 was used the normalized values of q and ssc were computed as to define a line starting from the value of qp and ending at the last value of the temporal series thus the final value of the index h is computed summing the distances from the farthest ssc value in the rising and falling limb of the loop mao and carrillo 2017 the positive or negative values of the index h define whether the loop is clockwise or counterclockwise respectively moreover the data were used to provide information concerning the variations of ssl between the two cross sections the results were then used to verify whether or not a regression among the percentages variation of ssl and hydrological data could be determined furthermore the analysis conducted at a month and seasonal scale took into consideration each month 16 months from august 2020 to november 2021 of the monitoring period and the three main seasons snowmelt 1st april 15th june summer 15th june 31st august and autumn 1st september 30th november the dates of starting and ending periods of the seasons were retrieved by rainato et al 2017 to this end only the data provided by the downstream section csb were used in order to provide possible comparisons with the historic suspended sediment budget measured at the measuring station 3 results 3 1 upstream csa and downstream csb comparing correlation matrices and changes in the sediment contribution at event scale during the eight events registered csa featured different variables as descriptors of the suspended sediment transport fig 4 a table 2 taking the sscm into consideration significant correlations cor test p value 0 05 were found with the precipitation i e with ptot imax and iav however the ptot and the iav were found significant cor test p value 0 05 when taken into account also the sscp the latter was also highly correlated cor test p value 0 05 with sscm variable when concentrating on the hydrological variables instead the descriptors for the qp were the ptot and the iav respectively ptot and iav were mutually correlated focusing on csb fig 4b the suspended sediment descriptors seemed similar but not identical to those of csa as far as the sscm is concerned along with the ptot cor test p value 0 05 the ru and the ssl also resulted significantly correlated a significant correlation was registered for the same descriptors when the sscp is considered unlike csa the ssl was also found positively and significantly correlated to the ptot and the ru respectively regarding the hydrological variables instead the results of the correlation matrix were equal to those of csa therefore the qp was positively correlated to ptot and iav ptot and iav that were again correlated to each other and to imax additionally the percentage variation between the two monitoring sites was computed table 2 the flood event fe1 produced a huge variation in terms of ssl i e 77 7 between csb and csa similarly fe2 featured a percentage variation in ssl of over 90 as far as fe3 and fe4 are concerned both events featured similar variations of ssl i e 10 3 the former and 14 3 the latter fe5 which was registered halfway between the snowmelt and spring season was the longest event ever monitored in this study and it led to a ssl variation of 34 1 during spring and summer 2021 instead three overall events were monitored fe6 featured a negative variation of 1 9 while fe7 and fe8 registered a ssl percentage variation of 18 9 and 24 4 respectively 3 2 upstream csa and downstream csb cross sections precipitation influence on ssl variations a further analysis considering the correlation among the variation in ssl and the three different precipitation variables imax ptot and iav was carried out although showing a slight positive correlation with the suspended sediment percentage variation imax did not provide any revealing trend fig 6 a r2 0 17 iav of each event fig 6b instead showed a positive correlation r2 0 63 with the variation in suspended sediment lastly the ptot was registered as the most correlated variable r2 0 74 fig 6c 3 3 upstream csa and downstream csb cross sections hysteresis patterns analysis in order to characterize the ssc q relationship for each event the data collected on both cross sections were analysed and quantified using the h index aich et al 2014 table 3 six out of eight events registered in both csa and csb featured a rather circular clockwise c hysteresis loop fig 7 a in fact the index of the c loops was always between 0 01 and 0 17 the two remaining events that were all monitored during the summer and autumn seasons 2020 registered for csb and csa eight shaped and circular counterclockwise loops fig 7b conversely the h index was found to be covering a higher range of negative values from 0 08 to 1 05 respectively the weakest value of 0 08 was represented by the fe1 in csa while the strongest 0 99 and 1 05 by the fe2 for both csa and csb fig 8 a overall the relations between the h index and qp showed a slight negative linear regression for both csa and csb fig 8b 3 4 annual monthly and seasonal averages variations herein the annual monthly and seasonal values of precipitation water discharge and suspended sediment load are analysed along the monitoring period august 2020 november 2021 the overall precipitation registered 1574 4 mm of which 523 mm attributable to the last portion of 2020 and the residual 1051 4 mm to the entire year 2021 the qm registered 0 34 m3 s while the total ssl measured 452 9 t 250 3 t produced in autumn 2020 while the remaining 202 6 t during the entire 2020 this information provided an overall suspended sediment yield of 42 t km 2 yr 1 for the period august 2020 november 2021 as far as the monthly precipitation is concerned the highest value was registered in october 2020 featuring over 279 mm of cumulative precipitation and 9 mm daily average while the lowest value of cumulative rainfall was detected in november 2020 13 6 mm the highest monthly qm was measured in june 2021 and was about 0 66 m3 s this value represents a response to the snowmelt and rain on snow recorded in this month especially over the first 15 days the lowest value of discharge instead was measured in november 2021 0 12 m3 s even if the precipitation featured a value of over 160 mm as for the precipitation the month with the highest total ssl was october 2020 with 194 3 t and was clearly related to the number of rainy days fallen detected during the month conversely the month exhibiting the lowest ssl was again november 2021 with 10 8 t fig 9 the most rainfall contributing season was summer 2021 with over 435 mm of cumulative rain the lowest was recorded during the snowmelt 2021 where the cumulative precipitation was 253 mm during the monitoring period the season with the highest value of qm was the snowmelt 2021 with a value of 0 50 m3 s the lowest was instead autumn 2021 with 0 13 m3 s unlike qm and the precipitation the highest ssl was registered in autumn 2020 in this case the ssl reached a value of over 250 t as for the minimum qm the lowest value of ssl was found in autumn 2021 with 40 t 4 discussions 4 1 sixteen months of monitoring controlling factors and differences between upstream and downstream windthrow affected area in the rio cordon eight events were registered during the monitoring period august 2020 november 2021 the factors controlling the suspended sediment load were identified among the extracted variables table 1 and the total precipitation ptot was found to be the most correlated to sscm and sscp measured at both the monitoring sites csa and csb as pointed out by penna et al 2011 the limited area of the rio cordon basin around 5 km2 can induce a rapid response to rainfall generating fast floods and powerful erosion processes which could explain the detected dynamics nonetheless the additional analysis showed a clear correlation between the percentage variation of ssl and both the iav and the ptot fig 6 this seems to suggest that the contribution of ssl from the windthrow affected area was controlled by the flood cumulative precipitation and average intensity 1 h rather than by the maximum intensity indicating that the duration of the events rather than the peak is more important in determining the amount of suspended sediments recruited from the bank and low lying berms overall unlike the observations of duvert et al 2012 who analysed over eight catchments between mexico french alps and spanish pyrenees and those of pagano et al 2019 in the rio cordon pre vaia the event peak discharge was not the best predictor of suspended sediment transport both in terms of ssl and sscp being this a novel result for the rio cordon further analysis should be needed however this result could be partially explained by the fast recovery of the rio cordon step pool configuration which occurred after barely two years from the vaia event pellegrini et al 2021b indeed in 2020 the step pool non dimensional steepness factor was 1 44 which is very close to 1 5 the value for which it s suggested that i flow resistance of the step pool morphology is maximized and for which ii the armoured layer is well developed abrahams and atkinson 1995 these conditions lead to a highly stable streambed and to a significant energy dissipation comiti et al 2019 which could clarify the observed complex relations between flow conditions and sediment fluxes also the structural and functional disconnectivity of the upper part of the basin martini et al 2022 limits the downstream sediment supply when the hysteresis patterns are taken into account it is worth noticing the different response of the catchment during the two years of monitoring summer autumn 2020 and 2021 in 2020 the rio cordon featured only counterclockwise loops in both csa and csb table 3 revealing the faster arrival of qp than sscp this suggests that two years after the vaia event the sediment availability may have been still abundant given the fact that vaia did not activate many new functionally connected sediment sources at the scale of basin martini et al 2022 the high sediment availability is likely to be due to in channel processes such as bank erosions and the progressive cleaning of finer sediments from the river network which is also confirmed by the increase of armouring and the reestablishment of a marked step pool morphology by means of pool scouring in the rio cordon pellegrini et al 2021b however the differences of ssl among hysteresis measured at csa and csb monitoring sites suggest that the windthrow affected area was active and functionally connected to the active channel during the first two events fe1 and fe2 interestingly such dynamic did not change the hysteresis loop of the events from counterclockwise to clockwise meaning that the sediment contribution from the upstream basin prevailed over the sediment originated from the windthrow affected area differently during 2021 the basin featured a faster response in terms of sediment transport rather than of water discharge showing a prevalence of clockwise hysteresis loops such results are consistent with what presented by seeger et al 2004 in the arnás catchment pyrenees and by bezak et al 2016 in small slovenian catchments which showed that ordinary events along channel networks with close and ready available sediment sources generate clockwise loops however as demonstrated by the computed index of hysteresis proposed by aich et al 2014 the loop appeared to be weak due to probably the ready available sediment located in the active channel and very close to the two monitoring sites as was found by mao and carrillo 2017 in the estero morales chilean basin however the results showed that the contribution sourced from the close in channel available material rather than from the windthrow affected area that did not provide any evidence of suspended sediment contribution during the 2021 events fig 5 once again this result can be explained by the exhaustion of the upstream sediment availability and by the presence of the hanging valley lying in the centre of the basin that represents a major topographical feature that highly influence the sediment dynamics thus the only sources able to contribute suspended sediment to the outlet are those located in the downstream connected half of the basin rainato et al 2018 lenzi and marchi 2000 martini et al 2022 these changes in the hysteresis loops and indexes suggest that after the vaia rainstorm the ready available is depleting progressively from upstream to downstream likely adjusting the sediment storage along the active channel until the outlet of the basin nonetheless it is possible that the ready available sediment could have been originated at least partially during the last event of october 2020 4 2 comparison with historical data by comparing the flood events occurred before and after the two large disturbances i e september 1994 and october 2018 fig 10 shows that at discharges 3 m3 s 1 the after lids events exhibited higher suspended sediment transport efficiency while at higher discharges 3 m3 s 1 the suspended sediment transport is rather comparable with the events monitored after the lids in this sense as way of example the before lid event of 3rd may 2003 exhibited a qp of 1 02 m3 s and a ssl equal to 0 2 t which is around one fortieth of the ssl 8 76 t registered in the fe3 qp 1 00 m3 s that fall within the after lids group also the before lid event of the 5th october 1992 that featured a qp of 2 91 m3 s and a ssl of 4 8 t diverged considerably from the after lid event of 16th october 1996 which exhibited a ssl of 294 4 t with a qp of 2 96 m3 s on the contrary the largest before lid event of 3rd july 1989 qp 4 39 featured a value of ssl 223 9 t in the same order of magnitude as compare to the after lid event of 7th october 1998 qp 4 73 m3 s which transported around 294 4 t in terms of sediment yield the 42 t km 2 yr 1 of suspended sediment featured in the period august 2020 november 2021 was comparable to the 40 t km 2 yr 1 measured in the stable and armoured period 2003 2014 rainato et al 2017 lenzi 2001 if on the one hand this value falls within the range of mean sediment delivery 50 5000 t km 2 yr 1 noticed in over 200 alpine basins by hinderer et al 2013 on the other hand this result suggested that vaia did not induce a subsequent increase in the sediment fluxes as instead observed in the rio cordon basin after the september 1994 flood event sediment yield 1994 2002 149 4 t km 2 yr 1 rainato et al 2017 despite the fact that the suspended sediment amounts mobilized two years after vaia were comparable to those monitored before it the results have stressed a higher transport efficiency for lower and near bankfull events qp 2 54 m3 s the limited influence of vaia on the suspended sediment amounts could be explained by the fact that the rio cordon exhibited an alluvial rather than a colluvial response during the event rainato et al 2021 in fact most sediments transported during the event were likely provided by the channel and banks and the number of sediment sources connected to the channel network remained rather constant martini et al 2022 the limited contribution of sediment sources at the basin scale was also somehow confirmed by the comparison of the two monitored cross sections which demonstrated the exhaustion of sediment supply by the windthrow affected area already after two years also pellegrini et al 2021b demonstrated that after barely two years of ordinary conditions in the rio cordon the step pool configuration was re established such process as already demonstrate by lenzi 2001 reinforces the observation that a substantial change in the suspended sediment delivery and availability was not evident however although this work took into account eight events over 16 months further analyses are required in the near future in order to implement the data with longer time monitoring to catch a larger magnitude range of floods and to see whether a formative flood allow the basin to jump to another resilience state additionally due i to health and safety issues imposed by the logging interventions in 2019 and ii to covid restrictions between march june 2020 the post event monitoring had to start in august 2020 which limited the chances of including in the analysis the effects of the event occurred between november 2018 and august 2020 however further fingerprinting investigations to understand which are the contributing sediment sources and how their functional connectivity changes during different seasons and or floods event would be highly recommended nonetheless as it seemed that the ready available sediment is quickly moving from upstream to downstream it would also be interesting to quantify the sediment storage along the active channel and therefore to understand how it moves 5 conclusions the severe vaia event produced different impacts on the alpine rio cordon basin producing exceptional responses from hydrological to sedimentological and geomorphic points of view as far as concerns the after event processes instead no clues but only open questions were given this work can be summarized taking inspiration by the two questions raised by rainato et al 2021 i what can be expected for the future ii has the october 2018 event represented the new ground zero for the rio cordon basin the answer to the first question although retrieved by sixteen months of suspended sediment monitoring is that the vaia lid seems not to have triggered the expected cascading processes as it occurred for the 1994 flood both the analysis at event and seasonal scale in fact show that the suspended sediment fluxes were pretty much in line with what registered during the pre event condition 2003 2014 demonstrating that the equilibrium of the basin seems not to have been overturned indeed not even the windthrow affected area seemed to have contribute sediment to the active channel sediment transport benefiting from a long term monitoring program that accounted two large and infrequent floods it was possible to investigate the alteration induced by them on the suspended sediment dynamics interestingly evidence of higher transport efficiency for the after lid events was mainly found for discharges lower than 3 m3 s fig 10 in that case apparently the post lid condition seems to be more efficient in terms of suspended sediment contribution however as the monitoring of the events after vaia covered only the suspended sediment analysis for lower than bankfull and near bankfull events further monitoring to register higher magnitude floods and bedload dynamics is surely needed the answer to the second question instead seems clearer and again far from the expected results apparently the ground zero was not achieved as instead seems to have happened after 1994 flood resilience seems to be the keyword that may explain the different dynamics that occurred after large disturbances if we consider the resilience as a ladder the different rungs can represent the stages of the rio cordon basin lower rungs mean low resilience and vice versa therefore if we consider the two large disturbances affecting the rio cordon in the last 35 years 1994 flood and the vaia rainstorm they can be placed at two different heights lower and higher as far as concerns the former and the latter respectively however to answer more precisely to these questions further investigation is needed in order to cover up either or both ordinary and high magnitude events and considering a whole analysis of sediment transport which takes into account suspended and bedload sediment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
