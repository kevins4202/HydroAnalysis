11815,this paper aims to analyze how the regulatory experiences of the english and north american models can provide insights for the brazilian management of public water supply services the study employed qualitative methods and secondary data to compare the brazilian model with the other two models based on three main aspects namely technological economic tariff and environmental comparatively the experience of brazilian regulatory bodies demonstrates an opportunity for improving various aspects such as water loss control and the importance of using transparent and cohesive instruments to contribute to the development of the sector graphical abstract image 1 keywords universalization public service water supply regulation 1 introduction in recent years debates on universal access to basic sanitation services have emerged as an international agenda the international community acknowledged the importance of basic sanitation to the health and well being of society when this concept was incorporated into the united nations un sustainable development goals sdgs via goal 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all inadequate and poor sanitation services in the present day cause a staggering estimated 870 000 deaths world health statistics 2018 which occur disproportionately in low income communities and among children aged under 5 years the majority of deaths associated with unhealthy conditions occur in africa and southeast asia it is also worth mentioning the array of water safety planning resources on offer by the world health organisation who since 2006 world health organization who 2017a despite the existence of sdg 6 and the who s water safety planning resource inadequate hygiene conditions in low income countries continue to pose significant health risks in 2015 only 71 of the world population gained safe access to water that is the availability of clean water when needed world health statistics 2018 the estimated coverage of safe water supply is surprisingly low at 68 and 20 in urban and rural areas respectively world health organization 2017b as bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 point out freshwater resource management is one of the most pressing global challenges at present although technical solutions such as waste water reuse and desalination can contribute to the reduction of the pressure over water resources the need to consider such improvements continues in the light of interdisciplinary factors such as social economic legal regulatory political environmental cultural and institutional as previously mentioned sdg 6 aims to address the universal provision of drinking water and sanitation however this goal should not be considered in isolation because all the goals are arguably connected to the provision of water although in different ways as such considering the nexuses of issues such as groundwater renewable energy sources global food demand climate change and public health is necessary for the provision of safe water and sanitation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 brazil reflects the abovementioned scenario in terms of water sanitation the coverage of sanitation services across the country and between urban and rural areas is unequal gugliano carbonai 2013 according to data from the diagnosis of water and sewage services of the national sanitation information system brasil 2019 water supply to the population increased by a mere 2 6 between 2007 and 2017 ensuring equal access to public water supply indicates making this access universal which remains to be the opposite case in brazil as a reflection of the enormous challenges faced in brazil stating that only 49 9 of brazilian municipalities and 45 of the urban population have access to public water supply is worth mentioning brasil 2019 thus the current study asserts that learning about institutional dynamics is essential for understanding the conditions required for achieving universal water supply in sections 4 3 and 6 we present a historical perspective of brazil beginning with the enactment of the national sanitation plan planasa in 1971 planasa played a key regulatory role in the provision of sanitation services including the introduction of federal law no 11 445 2007 which established the sectorial guidelines for water supply and sanitation our study also outlines the key reforms to the institutional and regulatory framework for sanitation in 2020 through the passing of the 14 026 2020 act and 10 588 2020 decree brasil 2020 however an analysis of the politics at play and the impact of the bill goes beyond the scope of our study in the field of sanitation authors such as heller and castro 2007 and galvão and paganini 2009 raise concerns on the focus that the extant research places on purely physical chemical and as a whole and technological aspects thus we assert the necessity of conducting applied research that can aid in providing technical political and management solutions toward the universalization and maintenance an adequate provision of public services empirical studies are required to fill these research gaps especially in the more neglected global south such as in brazil and the rest of latin america because an ethnocentric bias in analysis seemingly exists research on this topic is mainly concentrated in the united states and canada which account for 69 of the total number of publication saetren 2005 alternatively research focused on latin america comprises only 2 of articles 2 of books and book chapters and 3 of doctoral theses which signals a relatively low level of development of the region in this field heller and castro 2007 in this article we aim to compare and contrast the regulatory experiences of english north american and brazilian public water supply services analyzing how the trajectory of england and the usa can be applied to brazil s management of public water supply we do this through an examination of secondary data focusing in particular on technological economic tariffs and environmental aspects we offer several recommendations for brazilian water supply model regarding aspects such as water loss transparency and regulatory instruments the use of participatory instruments in the regulatory processes of water supply can be viewed as a political administrative issue it requires state action and citizen participation to promote the idea that participatory processes are not restricted to politicians souza 2003 we contend that deliberative and participatory processes for planning and decision making purposes should be employed to understand the needs of citizens with regard to water supply for sanitation the relevant forms of participation for the purposes of water supply include roundtables participatory budgets public hearings and independent ombudsman offices we argue that the participation of citizens and social control are means of contributing to the implementation of the existing regulatory instruments in the discussion of results section 6 we address how the legislation of each legislation has been guiding the use of participatory instruments in brazil we contend that water management should be founded on a participatory approach which brings not only planners and policy makers but also citizens and consumers from all levels to the discussion this notion is in line with the main outcomes from the international conference on water and the environment icwe which was held in dublin ireland in 1992 icwe brought together experts to discuss the dublin principles icwe 1992 which call for a participatory approach wellens et al 2019 notably in this context united states regulatory model have promoted the principles of transparency and public participation for decades citizen participation in the creation of united states environmental policy dates back to the mid 1970s after the 1969 national environmental policy act löfstedt et al 2001 despite the idea of the integration of land and water management which dates back to the 1930s through the tennessee valley authority and was created in 1933 as a blueprint for the integration of land and water as well as land use planning methods van der voorn and quist 2018 p 10 it was only during the 1970s that concerns for the social and environmental impacts of water resources became national and international priorities in the following decades efforts shifted to the challenge of universal water supply and sanitation services wellens et al 2019 the safe drinking water act of 1974 title xiv of the public health service act and the clean water act of 1977 public law 95 217 were important steps for the subsequent establishment of additional restrictive laws respectively they are considered the federal institutional bases of the united states for restoring water bodies and preventing water pollution in the country and for health promotion van houtven et al 2000 the united kingdom privatized its public sanitation utilities in 1989 since the 1990s in particular the european union eu has increased its rigor in relation to water quality standards the year 1973 is a critical one due to the water act a law that allowed the restructuring of the sector in the eu the increasing establishment of regulations and regulatory bodies starting in 1990 points to the burgeoning importance of the theme in brazil the enactment of federal law no 11 445 2007 that is the national sanitation law lei nacional de saneamento básico lnsb was an important milestone in establishing the guidelines of the industry because it prompted the creation of regulatory agencies brasil 2007 despite this fact the country faces difficulties in service universalization especially in certain administrative entities i e states and municipalities given the importance of the subject and the lack of institutional studies water supply deserves an analysis from the perspective of universalization after more than 10 years of sanctioning law 11 455 2007 we can now better understand the effects of this regulatory framework despite the relevance of the regulation specialists argue that it continues to fail to fulfill its role in brazil carvalho and sampaio 2015 for this and among other reasons such as the lack of the universalization of water supply services bill number 14 026 was recently enacted july 15 2020 which altered the institutional framework for water supply and sanitation in brazil with the argument of the lack of investments for the universalization of the services and to ensure the economic sustainability of the operations legislators proposed changing the current legal framework act 11 445 of 2007 without considering that the subsequent changes can endanger social sustainability moreover the new one is not necessarily a means for achieving efficiency in resource allocation or service provision however this study does not intend to explore the interests involved in the recent approval the bill which remains an issue that may take considerable time to be carefully addressed and fully evaluated the shortcomings of the brazilian regulatory framework a history of uncertainty regarding service ownership fragmentation and incipient track record enable us to identify opportunities for improvement based on comparison with other models such as those of the united states and the united kingdom the premise is that observing the distinct well regarded practices adopted by these countries may contribute to the improvement of brazilian regulation in this context this study aims to comparatively analyze the brazilian north american and british experiences and to explore how the last two can guide brazil in its endeavor to improve this sector for this reason this study further analyzes the water supply regulations in brazil in comparative terms by assessing the specialized literature this paper which is structured in five sections in addition to the introduction and references intends to contribute to research in the field by addressing interdisciplinary aspects such as historical technological economic and environmental elements the theoretical and methodological aspects are presented after these initial clarifications the main results are then presented and discussed to elucidate the comparative aspects between the three models lastly we present the final considerations 2 theoretical framework according to araújo 2001 several sectors exist in which the principles of free competition are redundant in other words free competition offers a less than optimal solution in sectors with certain characteristics such sectors are characterized by market failure in which natural monopoly and relevant negative externalities exist this case is true of public infrastructure services including sanitation which constitute sectors subject to economic regulation by bringing together these characteristics under the condition of natural monopoly the fixed costs for infrastructure construction are extremely higher than the marginal costs to provide the service such that the entry of a second competitor into the market becomes economically inefficient araújo 2001 for this reason such services involve a single provider in the majority of cases however if this configuration allows for economies of scale and productive efficiency then it can generate asymmetries in bargaining power and the monopoly of power which constitutes a threat to the well being of service users in the sanitation industry which is characterized as a natural monopoly fixed costs are more significant than marginal costs in the case of water distribution networks for example the cost of building the infrastructure is high however the cost of adding another user to the network is nearly non significant moreover two other characteristics are present the provision of water supply generates a positive externality in the entire region covered and consumers will continue to use the services given their essentiality even if their prices are higher than the marginal costs due to a price inelastic demand this situation enables service providers to abuse the monopoly of power which once again underscores the need for industry regulation araújo 2001 given the economic characteristics of the sanitation industry it clearly presents important challenges from the point of view of economic regulation that is the equilibrium between economic efficiency universalization of access and the economics of contracts will not occur naturally moreover the design of a regulatory framework to address these issues is complex and difficult to implement in other words regulation should focus not only on the goal of expanding access to sanitation services for all citizens but also on pursuing the ideal conditions of a market that tends to fail due to natural monopoly and externalities three aspects should be explored in this regard namely the establishment of tariff technological development and environmental issues related to the provision of sanitation services because these elements are essential for achieving universalization and high standards of efficiency tariff regulation is an important policy for this industry because it enables the funding for the expansion of the infrastructure and access to services by the poorest households the reason underlying this notion is that tariff regulation pertains not only to the definition of a tariff to be charged but also to the set of subsidies and incentives that ensure the economics of service provision the national basic sanitation law lnsb in portuguese provides the possibility of adopting tariff and non tariff subsidies for users without payment capacity or in locations without economic scale to cover the full cost of sanitation services such that economic and financial sustainability are ensured brasil 2007 technology is the guiding force of sanitation service provision because it is present in the set of economic and social guidelines of the national basic sanitation policy pnsb in portuguese for stimulating the use of modern and efficient technologies compatible with the required levels of quality continuity and safety in the provision of services brasil 2007 notably however technological advancement does not happen smoothly and without conflict first technological innovation influences current institutions whereas the materialization of technical progress can only occur by disrupting old institutional arrangements in other words technological change itself can be a field of conflict between the government service providers regulators and users of infrastructure services these conflicts will increase the possibility of regulatory capture which may result in inefficient regulatory frameworks second countries and regions differ in terms of the direction and speed of technological progress because technological change is dependent on institutional and regulatory frameworks incentives or barriers in other words regulatory models with clear well defined incentives can drive technological change on the contrary regulatory models may result in technological backwardness when they are confusing biased by interests or when a regulatory capture occurs this outcome results in the failure of countries and regions to advance at the same speed or in the same direction as such a direct relationship exists between the quality of regulation and the opportunity for technological advancement in the sanitation sector across countries and regions finally the environmental aspects of regulation are intrinsic to the sanitation industry which indicates an inseparable relationship between quality sanitation services sustainability and regulation regarding this point however the role of regulatory agencies is beset with challenges and controversies the reason for this notion is that regulation mainly focuses on the economic and operational aspects of service provision and frequently overlooks the role of the development of standards inspections procedures and solutions in addressing the environmental issues involved thus although the pnsb has established the fundamental guidelines brazilian practices require further advancements in any case inferring that the provision of sanitation services without considering sustainability as a fundamental goal can result in health risks to the population is plausible once again this aspect highlights the importance of regulation 3 methodology this study is qualitative in nature and involves the analysis of secondary data which are obtained from management reports scientific articles and other publications including several documents and acts of legislation regarding government agencies of the countries under study the data on brazil were obtained from online databases and brazilian websites of various bodies such as the ministry of cities mc ministry of health ms ministry of the environment mma national water agency ana national council for the environment conama brazilian association of regulatory agencies abar and the national sanitation information system snis among others to obtain data for the united kingdom industry we searched the websites of the drinking water inspectorate dwi office of water services ofwat environment agency ea and the department for environment food and rural affairs defra among others for the united states we reviewed the websites of the united states environmental protection agency epa and of several associations such as the american water works association awwa national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc national association of water companies nawc american water works association research foundation awwarf and the international water association iwa among others comparative parameters were defined with a consideration of the historical and structural characteristics of the sector such as institutional evolution and the means through which services are provided e g main players involved and characteristics of regulators economic and tariff aspects and technological and environmental aspects which are considered essential to regulatory frameworks we selected the united kingdom and the united states for comparison with brazil because these countries represent several distinct regulatory paradigms of the sector the period of analysis that is beginning with the 1970s was selected due to the development of the main institutions of the sector in these countries and the changes that occurred in the previous decades the current study focuses on the assessment of the regulatory aspects of sanitation in brazil in comparison with the north american and english models instead of evaluating correlations between numerical variables this study is qualitative and involves documentary analysis notably although solid waste also is related to sanitation as well as drainage they were not objects of analysis because water supply and sewage disposal are services characterized by operation in a natural monopoly which justifies the establishment of the regulation as such we opted to analyze only water supply because disposal services operate using different technologies environmental principles and economics in this sense highlighting that regulatory and deregulatory practices differently apply across utility sectors is important for instance water providers are still monopolies in the electric sector for example transmission and distribution remain mostly monopolies and in terms of telecommunications basic exchange telephone services may or may not be regulated jones 2006 4 regulatory models 4 1 united kingdom context the united kingdom has a vast experience with regard the management of its public services over time it has become a reference due to its nationalization and nationalization alternatives as well as due to its experiments in regulation and privatization the country was one of the first to develop the model of concession of services to the private sector the evolution of institutional transformations undertaken by the sanitation sector of the united kingdom in recent decades can be portrayed for the purpose of characterization in approximately four main periods namely before 1973 from 1973 to 1985 from 1985 to 1989 and from 1989 to the present amparo and calmon 2000 until 1973 the sector was characterized by its fragmentation where the responsibility of sanitation and regulation was divided among numerous local organizations in this model hundreds of local municipal or inter municipal public organizations essentially provided water supply and sewage services the year 1973 was a pivotal one for the sector due to water act 1973 through which the entire sector which was then highly dispersed was restructured consequently 10 regional water authorities rwa were established nine in england and one in wales these authorities were responsible for controlling the water uses of each river basin in accordance with the principle of the integrated management of water resources this integrated approach to watershed management and control has gained international recognition and support from environmentalists and the technical and academic communities linked to the sector byatt 1991 bridgeman 2011 after the creation of these regional companies assets were transferred from local governments to the rwa which performed a series of functions from operational activities water supply and sewage to environmental regulation and community services e g drainage and flood protection however until 1983 municipal authorities still held representation on the rwa councils which were modified with the enactment of the new water act of 1983 this initiative provided the rwa councils with a more executive character and consummated the removal of municipalities from the management of the sector statutory private companies were legally maintained such that the institutional framework of the sector was composed of 29 private companies statutory and 10 nine english and one welsh rwas between 1973 and 1989 in 1986 the government submitted a bill to parliament proposing that rwas be transformed into public interest private companies public limited companies resistance to the original proposal emerged from environmental groups and those linked to the labour party and trade and consumer protection organizations however despite the strong criticism the government with a conservative majority sent a new privatization proposal to parliament with modifications in the original text it omitted the role of control and conservation of rivers and pollution from the responsibility of future private companies instead this responsibility would be assumed by a new public agency designed to regulate environmental issues related to the sector namely the national river authority nra in addition to this body an economic regulator would be instituted and would be in charge of protecting the interests of service users fostering competition promoting economic efficiency and complying with contractual obligations by the new private companies the sanitation sector underwent considerable institutional changes after privatization these changes include the separation of the government and regulatory activities into different bodies such as the ea nra dwi and ofwat among others the first challenge posed at the time of privatization would therefore be to make the regime work in a context of unpopularity especially caused by the significant increases in tariff byatt 2013 for example between 1989 and 2007 customers in england and wales have witnessed an increase of 44 in average bills notwithstanding the impact of a reduction in prices due to the 1999 review bridgeman 2011 p 319 by consistently overestimating financing costs ofwat has allowed companies to make windfall gains which have not been shared in a structured way to ensure customers get a fair deal house of commons 2015 p 3 moreover little investment in new reservoirs were made in england and wales in the period after privatization bridgeman 2011 p 323 after undergoing the periods of privatization and restructuring the english water sector had changed considerably since the decentralized model of 1973 the current regulatory structure of the sector was created by the water act of 1989 which defined the financing conditions of the system and the tariff policy furthermore it introduced a privatization model in which the separation between the provision of sanitation services and its regulation should be clear which led to the creation of regulatory bodies with distinct scopes therefore the regulatory framework implemented after the water act of 1989 created a bipartite structure with a functional separation between the regulators of economic and environmental quality against this background the study infers that since 1989 dissatisfaction emerged regarding the tariff and services provided after the delegation of the provision of sanitation services in england and wales to the private sector recent discussions point to the processes of the remunicipalization of public services including sanitation in europe the term remunicipalization refers to the process of bringing previously private or private services under local public control and management the current study is aware that the use of the term is not always adequate because services that are reclaimed have frequently been private or did not exist in this case municipalization would be more adequate in this study however the term aims to cover both instances kishimoto and petitjean 2017 p 157 4 2 north american context we appreciate several waves of institutional changes regarding the creation of regulatory agencies in the united states which apply to diverse areas such as market capital securities and exchange commission the environment united states epa food food and drug administration and defense of competition federal trade commission ftc the changes can be summarized in three waves namely 1 at the end of the 19th century with the creation of competition defense agencies and the control of natural monopolies 2 during the new deal in the 1930s during this period an intense creation existed among independent agencies whose model was that of the ftc these agencies performed legislative functions with autonomy to issue norms and executive functions to implement administrative decisions which may arbitrate conflicts between parties and 3 since the mid 1960s a period in which agencies that focused on social regulation were created the last wave extended until the 1990s this moment was marked by the highlight on social regulation in addition to a process of deregulation in the 1980s with regard to transformations in the sanitation sector this study highlights four relevant periods namely before 1965 from 1965 to 1975 from 1975 to 1989 and from 1990 onward at the beginning of the 20th century the north american management of water resources was nearly exclusively centered on water supply flood control and navigation at the time an agency as strong as the epa did not exist at the end of the century the focus shifted to the protection of the environment to ensure the availability of drinking water and to provide recreational and esthetic experiences based on water resources at the same time prior to the passage of the water resources planning act of 1965 the federal government was primarily responsible for managing water resources in the united states financial resources could be obtained by local interests to support the projects where several large installations have been established moreover several north american states have adopted strict standards of environmental regulation which frequently imposed stricter conditions on management practices than those established by federal laws viessman jr 1990 from 1965 onward the development of water projects continued however the role of state governments in resource management began to expand in addition the focus of public policy on water supply has changed to issues related to the quality of water and the environment although federal resources prevailed increased importance was attached to the states and the management of water resources in addition to water supply issues viessman jr 1990 thus the period between 1965 and 1975 was marked by a a decentralization process which was characterized by the increased importance of the role of the states b a shift in the approach from water supply to pollution control and c a legal requirement that environmental impacts should be discussed in the planning and management of water projects in general the period between 1975 and 1989 was marked by moments with a restrictions on the federal budget and agencies b the adoption of more restrictive measures by environmental regulators c the increased transfer of authority to the states d increasing public awareness that policy development and future actions in the sector should be based on comprehensive and integrated analyses e weakening of support from members of congress and f the intensifying notion that users of water resources should pay a greater share of the costs of the services they demand viessman jr 1990 since the 1970s several efforts were focused on institutional changes in the sector however until the mid 1990s no major incentives were provided for private participation in the sector mainly due to two factors the first is the lack of separation between ownership of assets and management of services the second suggests that public companies had tax advantages in terms of raising funds for investment in the capital markets with the entry of the english and french companies which were specialized in the management of water supply services this situation in the north american market changed which expanded private participation holanda 1995 beecher and kalmbach 2013 over time the north american regulatory model has undergone changes due to the inefficiencies caused including the constant legal demands defense of decisions with the judiciary and the conduct of regulation by public opinion instead of being based on science in such a litigious and populist environment regulators began to explore various alternative models from which regulated sectors were encouraged to work in line instead of opposing public interest and regulators in this context a meeting was held in denver in 1995 between regulatory entities that is the public utility commissions pucs to consider the actions of the commissions at the turn of the century the event was followed by similar conferences only among pucs in 1998 2002 and 2003 in subsequent events the proposals were refined however they maintained as necessary the paradigm shift in relation to the perception of the regulation of public utility services in general new negotiation models have led to an increase in public confidence in the policies developed compared with those in the early 1990s however determining whether these reforms have been mainly successful is premature given that the evidence is inconclusive even in the 2000s a considerable inherent distrust was notable between the regulators and the regulatee the regulators still want to slap fines on industry industry does not feel that it wants to work with such aggressive minded individuals lofstedt et al 2001 p 403 although the united states was a pioneer in the field of environmental law one of the major bottlenecks in sanitation in the united states is the historical lack of investment in the sector the investments required to maintain and improve the water and sewage system in the country as of 2010 were estimated to reach us 91 billion however the actual investment was only us 36 billion which translates to a deficit of us 55 billion confederaçao nacional da indústria 2017 alternatively in the united states the efficiency reflected in the use of technologies to reduce water losses and reuse was emphasized for example in long term planning as well as in community awareness and in the search for efficiency in residential consumption the history of decentralization and fragmentation of the north american sector may have led to the responsibility of local governments and the provision of services being basically public with the decentralization of regulatory activity this historical context bears similarities with the brazilian model as presented in the subsequent text 4 3 brazilian context in brazil the development of the sector for public services was initiated approximately at the end of the 19th century in the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro at the time the government predominantly delegated the provision of services to foreign companies via public concession within a flexible institutional and financial model which lasted until the early 1930s faria et al 2005 correia 2008 the transformations that the brazilian sanitation sector underwent in the 20th century can be characterized through four main periods namely before 1930 from the 1930s to the 1950s from the 1960s to the 1980s and from 1990 onward with emphasis on the period after 2007 the provision of sanitation services in the period between 1850 and 1930 was characterized by flexibility and permission for foreign companies to enter public utility sectors the growing pace of urbanization in brazil throughout the 1930s began to demand an increase in the infrastructure sectors including those related to basic sanitation systems in this context the regulation of the sector in brazil began to be structured on the basis of the water code which was passed through decree no 24 643 of july 1934 the code provided the government with the possibility of setting tariff state intervention and a process of nationalization of foreign concessionaires also began during this decade such that investments in the sector were derived from the government budget lucena 2006 the period between 1930 and 1950 was marked by the direct municipal management of services a structure prevailed in which the same agent formulated policies provided services and controlled the services provided in articles 13 and 26 the federal constitutions of 1934 and 1937 respectively defined the municipal competence for services of a local character this definition was reaffirmed by the federal constitution of 1946 article 28 assures the autonomy of municipalities in terms of the organization of local public services in the 1940s however the federal government became concerned with the issue of sanitation which was linked to health issues where a multiplicity of agencies acted in an uncoordinated manner in the early 1950s the constitution of municipal authorities and financing mechanisms led increased autonomy to the municipal management of services britto 2001 between 1950 and 1970 the stated directly delivered the provision of infrastructure with regulations which are generally limited to the issuance of norms by the executive power galvao jr paganni 2009 from the 1950s onward the bases for new changes in the sector were established whereas initiatives in favor of centralized management at the state level emerged throughout the 1960s in this manner services were eventually granted to state companies which enabled the sector to acquire a new configuration based on the centralizing process undertaken by the government over the 1960s and 1970s the structure of the sector was consolidated with the creation of various agencies programs and plans linked to state and federal public authorities this structure remained stable until the mid 1980s until the end of this decade the country enforced a model of regulation in which ownership was state owned turolla and ohira 2007 britto 2001 correia 2008 in other words the sanitation sector has underwent relevant transformations in recent decades the initiatives introduced during the 1960s were fundamental for the development of the sector which laid the foundation for investment based on the institution of several important mechanisms such as bnh sfs and planasa however the regulatory structure characterized by state ownership which was in force in the country until the end of the 1980s was unsatisfactory amid the economic crisis that the country underwent during this decade and the difficulties faced by the sanitation sector at the end of the 1980s the long period of institutional uncertainty including the ownership of sanitation services hindered greater investments which have historically occurred in brazil primarily in specific periods especially in the 1970s from the 1990s onward a new form of regulation of public utility services was discussed in the mid 1990s regulation in the form of regulatory agencies was effectively implemented in the country with the privatization processes of sectors such as energy and telephony the new institutional environment of the 2000s favored the creation of a regulatory framework for the sector which culminated in the enactment of federal law no 11 445 in january 5 2007 this law defines the main instruments for the planning inspection provision and regulation of public sanitation services in brazil and is currently the main piece in the regulatory framework of the sector in 2020 a new change in the institutional and regulatory framework for sanitation was approved with the enactment of law no 14 026 2020 the government intended to justify the changes given the low capacity for investment and regulation by the municipalities which were holders of services among other justifications for the new institutional framework the government also listed increased legal certainty improvement in regulatory quality a reduction in transaction costs increased efficiency of resources combated losses and private investments table 1 presents the institutional evolution of the sanitation sector in brazil the discussion prior to law 14 026 2020 can be characterized by a narrative against the expansion of private participation in the sanitation sector according to the new legal framework municipalities are obliged to open competitive bidding processes at the end of their contracts with the state basic sanitation companies which expands the possibilities for private action in this sense the main change brought about by law 14 026 2020 is the reason for deadlocks across interest groups law 14 026 2020 provides the national water agency with the competence to institute standards used as a national reference for the regulation of basic sanitation services the new legal framework points to the unification of regulatory rules and greater space for the private sector to act in relation to sanitation services however concession to the private sector or the public provision of the service per se does not seemingly define the efficiency of services instead the quality of management and in this context the quality of regulation is essential to ensure adequate provision in brazil the challenges for the universalization of services are still pressing with the presence of possibilities for advances and setbacks after the establishment of the new regulatory framework law 11 445 2007 contemplated several possibilities which were pointed out as justifications for changing the institutional framework arguably pursuing the goals established with the adjustments in the previous framework albeit with improvements remains possible 5 results 5 1 economic and tariff aspects the brazilian tariff is mainly defined by establishing a rate of return this model originated in the united states the reasoning is that the model promotes efficiency by guaranteeing a fixed rate of return for the concessionaire similar to the united states price regulation in the supply sector in brazil can occur at the local or state level which is established by municipal or state agencies in brazil however regulation is mainly a task for state regulatory agencies whereas in the united states it occurs mainly at the local level in the united states the public commissions pc of the states are also relevant state agencies in brazil and commissions in the united states are similar in that they have acquired increased technical and institutional capacities to exercise regulatory activities compared with the majority of local governments a positive aspect of the north american tariff system is the protection of all users including minors through transparency and participation in decision making processes users are notified of changes to the systems and may appeal directly to regulators because the commission has established an internal structure for this aspect which is composed of ratepayer advocates commissions are more independent compared with other government agencies for example california s commission employs a team selected for its technical skills and provides long term mandates and job stability which facilitates its independence however the commission only operate above a certain level and typically regulate private service providers marques 2011 rate fixing is subject to lobbying by interest groups in the three countries under study price control in the united states is influenced by various factors such as persons accountable for asset management public private and the influence of important associations such as the awwa the english regulatory model is characterized by an agency i e ofwat that centralizes decisions and acts independently in addition the rate fixing method tends to induce efficiency by introducing instruments such as the price cap limits price by defining a productivity factor and the yardstick competition involves comparing the performance of companies given costs quality levels complaints and consumer needs the yardstick competition is important mainly due to the fragmentation of services and considerable differences in company performance barbosa and brusca 2015 p 98 advocate price caps by arguing that the empirical results for england and wales have shown that the price cap method fixed by ofwat led to better performance in the industry and that the results for the united states suggested that the adoption of the method led to prices lower than the rate of return in many cases in brazil a direct negotiation occurred with the municipality or with regulatory agencies which do not always set a defined price system and may reduce the transparency of the profitability of the companies based on the english model the brazilian economic regulators may perceive the importance of the effectiveness of the decisions of a strong and legitimate economic regulatory body such as the ofwat due to the efficiency gains from the adoption of price setting instruments similar to english ones article 38 of federal law no 11 445 2007 introduced the yardstick competition scheme by establishing that periodic price reviews should aim to share productivity gains with users and that tariff mechanisms may be established to induce efficiency including productivity factors defined based on indicators of other companies in the industry brasil 2007 emphasis added although this law introduced comparative competition and represented a breakthrough in the fixing of prices it does not impose a single institutional framework and enables the use of instruments related to the english i e price cap and yardstick competition or north american system based on the rate of return in this sense another similarity is noted between the united states and brazil the possibility of establishing different criteria in the fixing of prices which was reiterated by barbosa and brusca 2015 p 96 as follows regulatory differences also indicate the existence of different criteria for setting tariffs in this sense economic regulation in brazil similar to the united states can aim for increased uniformity in tariff setting processes given the fragmentation of the sector on the one hand and the resulting regional specificities on the other hand in this respect the english method for fixing prices is positive because it induces companies to increase productivity and encourages citizens to use water rationally at the same time data from iwa 2018 indicate that regulation should be careful in associating tariff with the volume of water consumption because behavior related to water consumption is dependent not only on price but also on the elasticity of user demand for example although the domestic consumption of this resource in 2016 exceeded 400 l per capita per day in new york or in denver in the united states consumption rates in brazilian cities and states such as brasília and são paulo and in english cities such as london and manchester or in cardiff wales remain below 200 l daily per capita even given the relatively higher water prices of the north american sector iwa 2018 in washington dc for instance water consumption for households in 2014 was even higher which exceeded 600 l per day iwa 2016 5 2 technological aspects an important technological trend in brazilian water supply is the improvement in micro and macro water metering techniques that aim to reduce water loss which negatively impacts the financial health of service providers in brazil this rate for all utilities combined reached 36 7 in 2014 although the importance of managing water losses is recognized this rate has not changed significantly in the 2004 2014 period brasil 2017 high water loss rates in brazil are due to the slow improvement in micro and macro water metering techniques among other factors according to nascimento and heller 2005 a need emerges for new technologies to address various issues such as the renovation of aging networks which creates opportunities for innovation in materials and methods that bring economic and operational benefits brazilian rates are high in comparison with other countries such as germany japan australia and new zealand which reduced their losses to approximately 10 or less in 2014 no brazilian state reached rates below 20 brasil 2017 in the united states no federal policy exists regarding limits to water losses in distribution nevertheless the majority of states regulate excess losses in distribution at 10 15 as the acceptable maximum as such reaching conclusions for the entire country is difficult due to the lack of regulatory requirements at the national level although several states do not record their losses others have established loss control programs for example california reports loss rates at approximately 10 whereas rates in georgia are less than 10 in wisconsin rates range from 15 to 25 epa 2010 cnt 2014 despite the efforts of states to manage water loss the existence of loss related operational and normative instruments in the majority of states and the commitment of state governments and associations to enforce regulations relevant challenges remain which are mainly related to the uniformity of water loss management policies among different regions in north america in england water loss management has drawn attention to political issues the occurrence of leaks and the level at which repairs became economically unviable are subject to much debate due to the high cost of waste and the outdated infrastructure network in london more than half of the water supply network is more than 100 years old whereas approximately 30 is aged more than 150 years although no european regulation on this topic has been formulated problems emerging due to the aging of networks are becoming increasingly relevant bridgeman 2011 eea 2014 in recent years however england has witnessed a significant improvement in the management of losses in 2006 2007 a reduction of approximately 30 in distribution losses occurred in england and wales compared with that for 1994 1995 ofwat 2006 despite the fact the volume of losses remains significant in 2011 water loss totaled 2559 ml per day defra 2013 ofwat has set loss targets for each company to address this issue in terms of research and innovation the united states has a long tradition of conducting basic research in national laboratories owned by the united states department of energy doe but operated by private companies or universities the majority of the environmental research conducted at these facilities is funded by the doe and other federal agencies of the united states jaffe et al 2005 in brazil the federal government is the main funder of studies on sanitation similar to the united states research is conducted at universities where partnerships with businesses have become increasingly common including private service providers equipment manufacturers and even state sanitation utilities andrade neto 2011 in england cave review cave 2009 which is an important study on competition and innovation in the sector highlighted the role of economic regulation in the development of new technologies and recommended changes in the regulatory dynamics in england the degree of innovation in england is mainly dependent on the system established by the economic regulatory body i e ofwat the ofwat approach enables consumers to share a few of the efficiency gains of the company but renders difficult the investment in risky but potentially valuable innovations the lack of alignment between various stakeholders in the provision and regulation of services i e utilities regulators and the government constrains the capacity of the english industry to exploit technological innovations which is also the case in brazil the english industry faces several challenges related to innovation despite this notion investment in research and development r d in the late 2000s was less than those during the late 1980s which was the period of privatization 1989 r d investments remained relatively stable throughout the 1990s but declined steeply and continuously after the end of the decade moreover the volume of r d investments ranged from 45 million per year in the early 1990s to 18 million in the late 2000s cave 2009 within a risk averse environment english companies became reluctant to invest in innovation due to the regulatory pressure on tariff whereas conventional technology would exclude financial uncertainty about return on investment the united kingdom water industry research pointed out that incentives for innovation would be limited to the reduction of loss and the maintenance of the quality of drinking water less attention is given to issues that could lead to long term benefits such as energy efficiency despite the high energy costs that companies incurred in 2006 bridgeman 2011 in brazil much work remains to be done despite the legal incentives to use modern technologies and improve efficiency in technological terms efforts have been exerted to reduce losses optimize water use and reuse and improve rainwater storage systems thus overcoming bureaucratic obstacles is fundamental for the technological development of the sector the united states together with germany were the most active countries in registering patents related to the treatment of water and sewage between 2000 and 2006 in relation to water abstraction only however the volume was significantly lower with only 57 requests from eight countries including the united states at third place out of which seven registers were granted london economics 2009 between 2000 and 2006 the united states has maintained leadership in patent registration however political and institutional issues have hindered technological development and the uniformity of regulation among states which is similar to brazil 5 3 environmental aspects the united states has pioneered in the field of environmental law in fact it began establishing environmental regulations during the 1960s from 1970 onward awareness of environmental pollution increased whereas attention was given to the importance of the integrated management of land and water use during the 1980s and 1990s prior to the administration of the current north american president environmental regulatory rigor had been increasing across the decades recently however a worrying factor is the influence of the united states on international politics the aspects to be considered in the current global scenario are the environmental policies adopted by the united states after the inauguration of trump with the beginning of the consequent process of revoking the measures approved during the previous administration to combat climate change these aspects also include the withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement as such the effects of these decisions on the international community should be considered the water supply industry in the united states is mainly regulated by the safe drinking water act of 1974 which was amended in 1986 and 1996 and by the clean water act of 1977 which was amended in 1987 these environmental guidelines resulted in important actions for the protection of sources of drinking water at the local state and national levels the united states employs a complex legislative system for environmental regulation these local and state regulations serve as a laboratory for federal legislation in the sense that many federal measures have been previously tested at the state level to address environmental issues a scattering of laws and numerous executive orders has occurred the environmental legislation of the united states has served as a model for other countries including brazil where an excess of laws and orders issued also exists the united states regulatory framework however is more detailed due to the number of references to other statutes in addition to constant legislative changes and mandatory revisions at five year intervals capelari and capelari 2015 alternatively the english environmental legislation originates from important european directives for various reasons the english regulatory environment has limited the ability of the industry to exploit technological innovations which influenced environmental issues nevertheless significant advances have been made in the quality of drinking water and services after privatization including improvements in capital investments and reduction in inefficiencies in view of the emergence of important environmental issues english regulatory agencies expanded their goals beyond their initial economic functions during the 1980s by incorporating environmental issues to their new scope of action the increasing importance given to environmental policy has led to the establishment of environmental regulatory bodies in the 1990s and highlighted environmental demands which have grown significantly over the past 15 years stern 2010 after the english privatization and the assignment of new duties to the agency a series of conflicts emerged between economic goals and government policies regarding the environmental role of the economic regulator in the united states impacts on the costs and benefits of implementing environmental legal guidelines also led to heated discussions under intense lobbying historically the united states and brazil experienced situations in which business sectors opposed environmental regulations such that reactions to environmental policies oscillated according to the political will of the leaders the main normative instruments of the brazilian sector are law no 11 445 2007 the resolutions of the conama nos 357 march 17 2005 and 430 may 13 2011 and ordinance no 2914 december 12 2011 of the ministry of health brasil 2007 2005 2011a 2011b similar to the united states brazilian data on water quality vary significantly across regions as such data comparison is difficult due to the lack of uniformity and parameters for calculating indicators among other factors table 2 presents the regulatory models discussed from a comparative perspective highlighting the eight indicators used for comparison in table 2 is important the indicators are as follows 1 organization of service provision provides information on the organization of the country s service provision 2 ownership of assets describes the ownership of assets between private and public 3 management provides an overview of the types of management of sanitation models and broadly separates them between private and public 4 main bodies describes the main regulatory bodies involved in the model 5 degree of private participation denotes the involvement of private initiatives using the following scales very high greater than 95 1 high between 95 and 65 1 medium between 65 and 35 1 low between 35 and 5 1 and very low less than 5 6 technological issues addresses the main challenges found in the models 7 main method of tariff setting aims to compare the tariff charging methods and 8 main structural challenges aims to compare the challenges faced by models whether political institutional technological development and economic or environmental table 2 presents the main differences between the proposed models english united kingdom american and brazilian notably all models assumed dynamic formats over time which were altered and adapted through decades of social cultural and political development all historical factors which are addressed in section 4 were considered in the analysis and results according to the specific relevance of the development of each country the historical context which is marked by public and private initiatives mainly influenced the changes in the models up to the present and will continue to influence changes in future models 6 discussion of results access to health care is constitutionally guaranteed as the right of all and the duty of the state guaranteed by social and economic policies aimed at reducing the risk of disease and other conditions and at ensuring universal and equal access as stipulated in article 196 section ii on health of the federal constitution of 1988 although it is an issue of public relevance much work should be done to develop the sector and achieve service universalization thus the current study focused on the institutional and regulatory gaps of the sector which have historical roots in brazil the provision of sanitation services in the 1990s was marked by the following 1 a modernization effort that involved policy evaluation and performance measurement including the improvement of mechanisms such as the snis 2 several changes in the ministry responsible for supervising the industry 3 a certain degree of progress in sanitation services due to the launching of planasa 4 a fierce dispute over which entity should provide these services which led several municipalities and states to appeal to the constitutional court adi 1842 and 5 an incipient process of increasing private participation which was hampered by a context of significant dissent among different interest groups which temporarily suspended the conflict over service provision to defeat the proposal to privatize state owned utilities by the end of the 1990s the federal government focused its efforts on the liberalization of service provision several initiatives were adopted to make the sector more attractive to private investment such as the approval of federal law no 8987 february 13 1995 which provides for the concession of public services in the country in addition two bills were proposed in the senate i e pls 266 1996 and pl 4147 2001 which enabled the privatization of utilities sousa and costa 2013 in the 2000s the sector became subject to an intense process of institutional restructuring a new model began to be discussed which also aimed to reduce the participation of state owned utilities in the provision of services with their concession to the private initiative and to ensure increased control over water use the industry continues to maintain these characteristics a point worth remembering however is that the discussion did neither occur nor remains without controversies as such several political disputes arose between advocates of state and municipality protagonism who constituted the main interest groups federal law 11 445 2007 was finally enacted despite the obstacles to the adoption of a national law for establishing sanitation guidelines in general the regulatory structure of the water supply in england is centralized and bipartite with a functional separation between economic ofwat and environmental i e dwi and ea regulatory bodies whereas the united states and brazilian structures are institutionally pluralistic and decentralized with responsibilities shared between the local state and federal regulatory bodies and with the participation of various stakeholders these regulatory structural features are related to the manner in which services are provided and even to the history of the industry for each country in brazil a consensus exists among several researchers regarding the absence of institutional regulation after the end of planasa in the early 1990s sousa and costa 2013 carvalho and sampaio 2015 notably regulation is an intrinsically political activity which is subject to all the instabilities of the political process due to lobbies the temporal limitations of popular suffrage the influence of interest groups and opportunism nascimento 2015 p 229 230 in this context sousa and costa 2013 argue that the development of the brazilian public sanitation policy was obstructed due to decision making and institutional uncertainties the authors explain the notion of trajectory dependence which views public decisions as influenced by past choices and affirm that the clash of state and municipal interests influenced decision making in brazil which rendered difficult the achievement of a consensus on points essential for industry expansion arguably discussions in this field apart from those about state or municipal authority and public versus private service provision should consider elements that may distort resource allocation such as the evaluation of cross subsidies in addition the role of incentives in improving efficiency regulation and the role of public policies that aim to share productivity gains with users should be highlighted in the brazilian scenario of service fragmentation and still inexperienced regulatory agencies moreover the characteristics of the brazilian and north american industries share several similarities however the historical experiences of these countries are different to ensure that political cycles will not hinder regulatory activities given the technology available agencies need credibility which is related to their transparency and independence which can be reinforced by factors such as fixed managerial terms qualified and stable technical staff stable commitment of resources and other measures to ensure continuity in action regarding transparency in actions and decisions which are essential for regulatory bodies the low proportion of agencies holding public sessions and publicizing their deliberations indicates that much work needs to be done in brazil the percentage of investments audited by regulators is remarkably low municipal agencies or municipal consortia have yet to supervise 14 25 of the regulated municipalities on a yearly basis in relation to state agencies the percentage of regulated municipalities that lack economic financial supervision has reached 77 abar 2015 for investments the deficit for this type of supervision is approximately 35 for consortium and municipal agencies and 56 for state agencies abar 2015 carvalho and sampaio 2015 proposed that agencies created after the sanctioning of the law are more pro active than those created before 2007 the possibility of regulatory capture and the resulting inefficiency in regulatory enforcement highlight the importance of preventing capture processes as stated in the introduction establishing instruments for the control of society on regulatory activities serves this purpose exercised by trade unions ngos independent ombudsman offices political parties public policy management boards social control is a means for implementing the existing regulatory instruments and for contributing to the effectiveness of this activity in brazil article 2 of federal law 11 445 states that public basic sanitation services will be provided based on the following fundamental principles ix transparency of actions based on institutionalized information systems and decision making processes x social control brasil 2007 moreover chapter viii of law 11 455 2007 is a provision for the exercise of social control whereas article 47 of the same law establishes that such control may include the participation of collegiate bodies of an advisory nature regardless of the administrative level involved brasil 2007 in this sense the aforementioned law established the instruments essential to the systematization of the economic regulation of water supply and sanitation services it includes the planning of public policies for the sector based on transparency and the social control of actions and provided mechanisms for social control as one of the fundamental principles in the provision of these services however the new legal framework namely federal law 14 026 2020 brasil 2020 does not maintain transparency and social control as fundamental principles article 3 of both federal laws stipulates the legal understanding that social control indicates a set of mechanisms and procedures that guarantee society information technical representations and participation in policy formulation processes planning and evaluation related to public sanitation services brasil 2007 2020 nonetheless several authors e g galvão jr et al 2009 argue that the sector lacks a regulatory culture that encompasses the interest of the main actors involved in the provision of services i e granting power concessionaire and users and that prioritizes the principles of efficiency transparency and social control provided for in article 2 of law 11 445 brasil 2007 another notable issue is the need for uniformity in environmental monitoring tools the main regulations e g resolutions ordinances and laws that apply for environmental guidelines define the competent bodies to apply them as well as the parameters for assessing water quality and potability brasil 1997 2005 2011b despite this initiative the lack of uniformity of the existing instruments e g measurement of parameters and the asymmetry between administrative entities in the implementation of the instruments hinder development in this sector in addition to the lack of uniformity of economic tariff setting and environmental tools tasks the uniformity of technological solutions is relevant this notion is specifically true with regard to the management of distribution losses which influences water supply and is an important evaluation parameter especially in scenarios of scarcity of water resources an example scenario is the variation in water loss rates among different brazilian states and municipalities the brazilian water supply industry bears resemblance to that of the united states in terms of structure and tariff the united states is more advanced technologically mainly due to the country s leadership in r d and innovation which ensured its leadership in patent registration between 2000 and 2006 despite state efforts to manage water loss significant challenges remain which are mainly related to the uniformity of water loss management policies among different regions in the united states which is similar to brazil in brazil the main federal law on water supply and sanitation 11 445 2007 provides for the necessary cooperation between administrative entities the articulation of the urban development policies with environmental protection and health promotion brasil 2007 the effectiveness of the law would fill important gaps such as the lack of harmonization of policies for the industry the lack of cooperation between administrative entities and the integration of different bodies with common competences and problems related to incompatibility between the mechanisms for monitoring and assessing water quality in the country in fact addressing these issues would benefit service users however these issues which are regarded as deserving of priority measures remain as obstacles to the development of the sector as a whole regarding the responsibility for the management of services the question does not lay in deciding whether utilities should be state owned or private the consequences of privatization may be a disadvantage to low income users who have less means to pay for the consumption of an essential commodity such as water in this sense ideological disputes are a problem aggravated by the absence of reliable data to support empirical studies 7 final remarks this study aimed to comparatively analyze the brazilian north american and english experiences this analysis demonstrated that sharing these experiences could be positive for example by stressing the importance of creating regulatory bodies that can act in a transparent and legitimate manner and that are able to articulate the elaboration of public policies with other sectors in england ofwat is an economic regulator that proved to be sufficiently strong for fixing tariff in a manner that ensured the compliance of utilities with regulations apart from considering the interest of users thus brazil should aim to establish regulations that should be enforced as independently as possible to avoid regulatory capture by utilities and to preserve the public interest the literature argues that in brazil similar to the united states economic regulation should aim to achieve increased uniformity in the tariff setting processes given the fragmentation of the sector and regional specificities conca 2008 brasil 2007 in brazil however an institutional movement has been initiated to centralize the sector which occurred with the enactment of law no 14 026 2020 alternatively the english price setting model is viewed as positive because it induced companies in comparative terms to increase productivity and encouraged citizens to make rational use of water at the same time iwa 2016 2018 conversely as previously mentioned a positive aspect of the tariff system in the united states is the protection of all users including small ones through transparency and participation in decision making processes users are notified of changes in the system and may appeal directly to regulators as the commission has established an internal structure for this purpose in brazil household users only have access to incipient or pro forma participatory instruments which are provided by utilities only to formally comply with legislation compared with larger ones such as industrial users although price setting is a task subject to lobbying by interest groups in all three countries using participatory tools is essential to an effective regulatory activity and exceeds mere formality a notable example of participatory approaches is that of participatory budgeting which was initiated in porto alegre brazil in the late 1980s this approach inspired european countries such as germany spain and poland to adopt the format within their respective local contexts sintomer et al 2008 benefits accrued from using the participatory budget approach include enhanced communication between the government local political elites and citizens improvement in political culture induction of better coordination in civil society improvement in public services based on the proposals of citizens collaboration between individual state departments increased responsiveness of state entities and contribution to local knowledge in addressing key social issues sintomer 2008 in addition benefits from participatory instruments have been documented in diverse geographical contexts such as rural bangladesh van der voorn 2008 and the mercosur region argentina brazil paraguay the bolivarian republic of venezuela and uruguay which have adopted the participatory instrument since the 1990s gugliano and carbonai 2013 researchers indicate that participatory policies contribute to redirecting public spending to the socioeconomically disadvantaged portion of the population generate public transparency and accountability and generally raise levels of social participation in addition to other benefits however it should be mentioned that scholars in brazil also argued that forming a committee for gathering social organizations does not necessarily render the decision process participatory in terms of strategies available for the management of water supply and water resources we contend that policies involving citizens in public management represent an opportunity for enhancing the management capacity of the government gugliano and carbonai 2013 historically the united states and brazil experienced situations in which business sectors opposed environmental regulations such that reactions to environmental policies oscillated according to the political will of the authorities this tendency points to the importance of maintaining actions in the field of sanitation independent of political electoral cycles moreover although the united states was a pioneer in the field of environmental law one of the major bottlenecks in its sanitation is the historical lack of investment in the sector nevertheless a distinct emphasis has been placed on the use of technologies to reduce water loss and reuse in the search for efficiency in residential consumption the history of decentralization and fragmentation of the north american sector may have led to the responsibility of local governments the provision of services being basically public and the decentralization of regulatory activity this historical context bears similarities with brazil although important challenges remain for brazil in terms of reducing water loss and providing sewage services in the country alternatively the movement to privatize services in the united kingdom occurred in the late 1980s which was beset with controversy and led to increased bills for service users and increased political clashes in brazil the delegation of services to the private sector was avoided through political pressure currently the approval of the new legal framework in the country aims to increase the participation of the private sector which is also riddled with controversy in contrast to the british context in which the private sector has participated since 1989 the brazilian context does not currently display a strong independent and centralized regulation of the sector instead a proliferation of regulatory bodies has occurred within the scope of municipalities and states and with the recent centralization of activity to the national water agency which was previously responsible only for the water resources of the country the development of an informed methodologically consistent empirical research on sanitation and the political aspects of water supply can qualify policy formulation and improve the quality of debates in this regard long term results can be more oriented toward the interests of users furthermore studies on the management of sanitation and water services should note that public administration is subject to political processes such that future research should address this issue regarding the sanitation and water supply policy in brazil the country has yet to achieve the universalization of services national authorities question the political decisions that culminated in the approval of the new legal framework however the discussion on the new legal framework falls outside of the scope of the present study thus we suggest that future research should further examine this aspect because the consequences and effects continue to occur the reforms currently undertaken described in section 4 in the institutional framework of the public water supply and sanitation services in brazil is worthy of future research in terms of consequences as well as possible challenges the experience of the two countries analyzed for international comparison reinforces the concept that no single model for success exists instead various institutional frameworks and instruments that reflect historical situations are specific to each country however they may share similarities and frequently common challenges finally we hope that this comparative discussion contributes to the development of the sector in brazil in technical and political terms in the light of the experiences of the united states and the united kingdom the presentation of their experiences from different perspectives aimed to elucidate the importance of considering the formulation and evaluation of public policies related to water supply and sanitation in an interdisciplinary manner in this manner the conditions necessary to enable universal quality service can be created after all this human right remains universal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11815,this paper aims to analyze how the regulatory experiences of the english and north american models can provide insights for the brazilian management of public water supply services the study employed qualitative methods and secondary data to compare the brazilian model with the other two models based on three main aspects namely technological economic tariff and environmental comparatively the experience of brazilian regulatory bodies demonstrates an opportunity for improving various aspects such as water loss control and the importance of using transparent and cohesive instruments to contribute to the development of the sector graphical abstract image 1 keywords universalization public service water supply regulation 1 introduction in recent years debates on universal access to basic sanitation services have emerged as an international agenda the international community acknowledged the importance of basic sanitation to the health and well being of society when this concept was incorporated into the united nations un sustainable development goals sdgs via goal 6 ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all inadequate and poor sanitation services in the present day cause a staggering estimated 870 000 deaths world health statistics 2018 which occur disproportionately in low income communities and among children aged under 5 years the majority of deaths associated with unhealthy conditions occur in africa and southeast asia it is also worth mentioning the array of water safety planning resources on offer by the world health organisation who since 2006 world health organization who 2017a despite the existence of sdg 6 and the who s water safety planning resource inadequate hygiene conditions in low income countries continue to pose significant health risks in 2015 only 71 of the world population gained safe access to water that is the availability of clean water when needed world health statistics 2018 the estimated coverage of safe water supply is surprisingly low at 68 and 20 in urban and rural areas respectively world health organization 2017b as bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 point out freshwater resource management is one of the most pressing global challenges at present although technical solutions such as waste water reuse and desalination can contribute to the reduction of the pressure over water resources the need to consider such improvements continues in the light of interdisciplinary factors such as social economic legal regulatory political environmental cultural and institutional as previously mentioned sdg 6 aims to address the universal provision of drinking water and sanitation however this goal should not be considered in isolation because all the goals are arguably connected to the provision of water although in different ways as such considering the nexuses of issues such as groundwater renewable energy sources global food demand climate change and public health is necessary for the provision of safe water and sanitation bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 brazil reflects the abovementioned scenario in terms of water sanitation the coverage of sanitation services across the country and between urban and rural areas is unequal gugliano carbonai 2013 according to data from the diagnosis of water and sewage services of the national sanitation information system brasil 2019 water supply to the population increased by a mere 2 6 between 2007 and 2017 ensuring equal access to public water supply indicates making this access universal which remains to be the opposite case in brazil as a reflection of the enormous challenges faced in brazil stating that only 49 9 of brazilian municipalities and 45 of the urban population have access to public water supply is worth mentioning brasil 2019 thus the current study asserts that learning about institutional dynamics is essential for understanding the conditions required for achieving universal water supply in sections 4 3 and 6 we present a historical perspective of brazil beginning with the enactment of the national sanitation plan planasa in 1971 planasa played a key regulatory role in the provision of sanitation services including the introduction of federal law no 11 445 2007 which established the sectorial guidelines for water supply and sanitation our study also outlines the key reforms to the institutional and regulatory framework for sanitation in 2020 through the passing of the 14 026 2020 act and 10 588 2020 decree brasil 2020 however an analysis of the politics at play and the impact of the bill goes beyond the scope of our study in the field of sanitation authors such as heller and castro 2007 and galvão and paganini 2009 raise concerns on the focus that the extant research places on purely physical chemical and as a whole and technological aspects thus we assert the necessity of conducting applied research that can aid in providing technical political and management solutions toward the universalization and maintenance an adequate provision of public services empirical studies are required to fill these research gaps especially in the more neglected global south such as in brazil and the rest of latin america because an ethnocentric bias in analysis seemingly exists research on this topic is mainly concentrated in the united states and canada which account for 69 of the total number of publication saetren 2005 alternatively research focused on latin america comprises only 2 of articles 2 of books and book chapters and 3 of doctoral theses which signals a relatively low level of development of the region in this field heller and castro 2007 in this article we aim to compare and contrast the regulatory experiences of english north american and brazilian public water supply services analyzing how the trajectory of england and the usa can be applied to brazil s management of public water supply we do this through an examination of secondary data focusing in particular on technological economic tariffs and environmental aspects we offer several recommendations for brazilian water supply model regarding aspects such as water loss transparency and regulatory instruments the use of participatory instruments in the regulatory processes of water supply can be viewed as a political administrative issue it requires state action and citizen participation to promote the idea that participatory processes are not restricted to politicians souza 2003 we contend that deliberative and participatory processes for planning and decision making purposes should be employed to understand the needs of citizens with regard to water supply for sanitation the relevant forms of participation for the purposes of water supply include roundtables participatory budgets public hearings and independent ombudsman offices we argue that the participation of citizens and social control are means of contributing to the implementation of the existing regulatory instruments in the discussion of results section 6 we address how the legislation of each legislation has been guiding the use of participatory instruments in brazil we contend that water management should be founded on a participatory approach which brings not only planners and policy makers but also citizens and consumers from all levels to the discussion this notion is in line with the main outcomes from the international conference on water and the environment icwe which was held in dublin ireland in 1992 icwe brought together experts to discuss the dublin principles icwe 1992 which call for a participatory approach wellens et al 2019 notably in this context united states regulatory model have promoted the principles of transparency and public participation for decades citizen participation in the creation of united states environmental policy dates back to the mid 1970s after the 1969 national environmental policy act löfstedt et al 2001 despite the idea of the integration of land and water management which dates back to the 1930s through the tennessee valley authority and was created in 1933 as a blueprint for the integration of land and water as well as land use planning methods van der voorn and quist 2018 p 10 it was only during the 1970s that concerns for the social and environmental impacts of water resources became national and international priorities in the following decades efforts shifted to the challenge of universal water supply and sanitation services wellens et al 2019 the safe drinking water act of 1974 title xiv of the public health service act and the clean water act of 1977 public law 95 217 were important steps for the subsequent establishment of additional restrictive laws respectively they are considered the federal institutional bases of the united states for restoring water bodies and preventing water pollution in the country and for health promotion van houtven et al 2000 the united kingdom privatized its public sanitation utilities in 1989 since the 1990s in particular the european union eu has increased its rigor in relation to water quality standards the year 1973 is a critical one due to the water act a law that allowed the restructuring of the sector in the eu the increasing establishment of regulations and regulatory bodies starting in 1990 points to the burgeoning importance of the theme in brazil the enactment of federal law no 11 445 2007 that is the national sanitation law lei nacional de saneamento básico lnsb was an important milestone in establishing the guidelines of the industry because it prompted the creation of regulatory agencies brasil 2007 despite this fact the country faces difficulties in service universalization especially in certain administrative entities i e states and municipalities given the importance of the subject and the lack of institutional studies water supply deserves an analysis from the perspective of universalization after more than 10 years of sanctioning law 11 455 2007 we can now better understand the effects of this regulatory framework despite the relevance of the regulation specialists argue that it continues to fail to fulfill its role in brazil carvalho and sampaio 2015 for this and among other reasons such as the lack of the universalization of water supply services bill number 14 026 was recently enacted july 15 2020 which altered the institutional framework for water supply and sanitation in brazil with the argument of the lack of investments for the universalization of the services and to ensure the economic sustainability of the operations legislators proposed changing the current legal framework act 11 445 of 2007 without considering that the subsequent changes can endanger social sustainability moreover the new one is not necessarily a means for achieving efficiency in resource allocation or service provision however this study does not intend to explore the interests involved in the recent approval the bill which remains an issue that may take considerable time to be carefully addressed and fully evaluated the shortcomings of the brazilian regulatory framework a history of uncertainty regarding service ownership fragmentation and incipient track record enable us to identify opportunities for improvement based on comparison with other models such as those of the united states and the united kingdom the premise is that observing the distinct well regarded practices adopted by these countries may contribute to the improvement of brazilian regulation in this context this study aims to comparatively analyze the brazilian north american and british experiences and to explore how the last two can guide brazil in its endeavor to improve this sector for this reason this study further analyzes the water supply regulations in brazil in comparative terms by assessing the specialized literature this paper which is structured in five sections in addition to the introduction and references intends to contribute to research in the field by addressing interdisciplinary aspects such as historical technological economic and environmental elements the theoretical and methodological aspects are presented after these initial clarifications the main results are then presented and discussed to elucidate the comparative aspects between the three models lastly we present the final considerations 2 theoretical framework according to araújo 2001 several sectors exist in which the principles of free competition are redundant in other words free competition offers a less than optimal solution in sectors with certain characteristics such sectors are characterized by market failure in which natural monopoly and relevant negative externalities exist this case is true of public infrastructure services including sanitation which constitute sectors subject to economic regulation by bringing together these characteristics under the condition of natural monopoly the fixed costs for infrastructure construction are extremely higher than the marginal costs to provide the service such that the entry of a second competitor into the market becomes economically inefficient araújo 2001 for this reason such services involve a single provider in the majority of cases however if this configuration allows for economies of scale and productive efficiency then it can generate asymmetries in bargaining power and the monopoly of power which constitutes a threat to the well being of service users in the sanitation industry which is characterized as a natural monopoly fixed costs are more significant than marginal costs in the case of water distribution networks for example the cost of building the infrastructure is high however the cost of adding another user to the network is nearly non significant moreover two other characteristics are present the provision of water supply generates a positive externality in the entire region covered and consumers will continue to use the services given their essentiality even if their prices are higher than the marginal costs due to a price inelastic demand this situation enables service providers to abuse the monopoly of power which once again underscores the need for industry regulation araújo 2001 given the economic characteristics of the sanitation industry it clearly presents important challenges from the point of view of economic regulation that is the equilibrium between economic efficiency universalization of access and the economics of contracts will not occur naturally moreover the design of a regulatory framework to address these issues is complex and difficult to implement in other words regulation should focus not only on the goal of expanding access to sanitation services for all citizens but also on pursuing the ideal conditions of a market that tends to fail due to natural monopoly and externalities three aspects should be explored in this regard namely the establishment of tariff technological development and environmental issues related to the provision of sanitation services because these elements are essential for achieving universalization and high standards of efficiency tariff regulation is an important policy for this industry because it enables the funding for the expansion of the infrastructure and access to services by the poorest households the reason underlying this notion is that tariff regulation pertains not only to the definition of a tariff to be charged but also to the set of subsidies and incentives that ensure the economics of service provision the national basic sanitation law lnsb in portuguese provides the possibility of adopting tariff and non tariff subsidies for users without payment capacity or in locations without economic scale to cover the full cost of sanitation services such that economic and financial sustainability are ensured brasil 2007 technology is the guiding force of sanitation service provision because it is present in the set of economic and social guidelines of the national basic sanitation policy pnsb in portuguese for stimulating the use of modern and efficient technologies compatible with the required levels of quality continuity and safety in the provision of services brasil 2007 notably however technological advancement does not happen smoothly and without conflict first technological innovation influences current institutions whereas the materialization of technical progress can only occur by disrupting old institutional arrangements in other words technological change itself can be a field of conflict between the government service providers regulators and users of infrastructure services these conflicts will increase the possibility of regulatory capture which may result in inefficient regulatory frameworks second countries and regions differ in terms of the direction and speed of technological progress because technological change is dependent on institutional and regulatory frameworks incentives or barriers in other words regulatory models with clear well defined incentives can drive technological change on the contrary regulatory models may result in technological backwardness when they are confusing biased by interests or when a regulatory capture occurs this outcome results in the failure of countries and regions to advance at the same speed or in the same direction as such a direct relationship exists between the quality of regulation and the opportunity for technological advancement in the sanitation sector across countries and regions finally the environmental aspects of regulation are intrinsic to the sanitation industry which indicates an inseparable relationship between quality sanitation services sustainability and regulation regarding this point however the role of regulatory agencies is beset with challenges and controversies the reason for this notion is that regulation mainly focuses on the economic and operational aspects of service provision and frequently overlooks the role of the development of standards inspections procedures and solutions in addressing the environmental issues involved thus although the pnsb has established the fundamental guidelines brazilian practices require further advancements in any case inferring that the provision of sanitation services without considering sustainability as a fundamental goal can result in health risks to the population is plausible once again this aspect highlights the importance of regulation 3 methodology this study is qualitative in nature and involves the analysis of secondary data which are obtained from management reports scientific articles and other publications including several documents and acts of legislation regarding government agencies of the countries under study the data on brazil were obtained from online databases and brazilian websites of various bodies such as the ministry of cities mc ministry of health ms ministry of the environment mma national water agency ana national council for the environment conama brazilian association of regulatory agencies abar and the national sanitation information system snis among others to obtain data for the united kingdom industry we searched the websites of the drinking water inspectorate dwi office of water services ofwat environment agency ea and the department for environment food and rural affairs defra among others for the united states we reviewed the websites of the united states environmental protection agency epa and of several associations such as the american water works association awwa national association of regulatory utility commissioners naruc national association of water companies nawc american water works association research foundation awwarf and the international water association iwa among others comparative parameters were defined with a consideration of the historical and structural characteristics of the sector such as institutional evolution and the means through which services are provided e g main players involved and characteristics of regulators economic and tariff aspects and technological and environmental aspects which are considered essential to regulatory frameworks we selected the united kingdom and the united states for comparison with brazil because these countries represent several distinct regulatory paradigms of the sector the period of analysis that is beginning with the 1970s was selected due to the development of the main institutions of the sector in these countries and the changes that occurred in the previous decades the current study focuses on the assessment of the regulatory aspects of sanitation in brazil in comparison with the north american and english models instead of evaluating correlations between numerical variables this study is qualitative and involves documentary analysis notably although solid waste also is related to sanitation as well as drainage they were not objects of analysis because water supply and sewage disposal are services characterized by operation in a natural monopoly which justifies the establishment of the regulation as such we opted to analyze only water supply because disposal services operate using different technologies environmental principles and economics in this sense highlighting that regulatory and deregulatory practices differently apply across utility sectors is important for instance water providers are still monopolies in the electric sector for example transmission and distribution remain mostly monopolies and in terms of telecommunications basic exchange telephone services may or may not be regulated jones 2006 4 regulatory models 4 1 united kingdom context the united kingdom has a vast experience with regard the management of its public services over time it has become a reference due to its nationalization and nationalization alternatives as well as due to its experiments in regulation and privatization the country was one of the first to develop the model of concession of services to the private sector the evolution of institutional transformations undertaken by the sanitation sector of the united kingdom in recent decades can be portrayed for the purpose of characterization in approximately four main periods namely before 1973 from 1973 to 1985 from 1985 to 1989 and from 1989 to the present amparo and calmon 2000 until 1973 the sector was characterized by its fragmentation where the responsibility of sanitation and regulation was divided among numerous local organizations in this model hundreds of local municipal or inter municipal public organizations essentially provided water supply and sewage services the year 1973 was a pivotal one for the sector due to water act 1973 through which the entire sector which was then highly dispersed was restructured consequently 10 regional water authorities rwa were established nine in england and one in wales these authorities were responsible for controlling the water uses of each river basin in accordance with the principle of the integrated management of water resources this integrated approach to watershed management and control has gained international recognition and support from environmentalists and the technical and academic communities linked to the sector byatt 1991 bridgeman 2011 after the creation of these regional companies assets were transferred from local governments to the rwa which performed a series of functions from operational activities water supply and sewage to environmental regulation and community services e g drainage and flood protection however until 1983 municipal authorities still held representation on the rwa councils which were modified with the enactment of the new water act of 1983 this initiative provided the rwa councils with a more executive character and consummated the removal of municipalities from the management of the sector statutory private companies were legally maintained such that the institutional framework of the sector was composed of 29 private companies statutory and 10 nine english and one welsh rwas between 1973 and 1989 in 1986 the government submitted a bill to parliament proposing that rwas be transformed into public interest private companies public limited companies resistance to the original proposal emerged from environmental groups and those linked to the labour party and trade and consumer protection organizations however despite the strong criticism the government with a conservative majority sent a new privatization proposal to parliament with modifications in the original text it omitted the role of control and conservation of rivers and pollution from the responsibility of future private companies instead this responsibility would be assumed by a new public agency designed to regulate environmental issues related to the sector namely the national river authority nra in addition to this body an economic regulator would be instituted and would be in charge of protecting the interests of service users fostering competition promoting economic efficiency and complying with contractual obligations by the new private companies the sanitation sector underwent considerable institutional changes after privatization these changes include the separation of the government and regulatory activities into different bodies such as the ea nra dwi and ofwat among others the first challenge posed at the time of privatization would therefore be to make the regime work in a context of unpopularity especially caused by the significant increases in tariff byatt 2013 for example between 1989 and 2007 customers in england and wales have witnessed an increase of 44 in average bills notwithstanding the impact of a reduction in prices due to the 1999 review bridgeman 2011 p 319 by consistently overestimating financing costs ofwat has allowed companies to make windfall gains which have not been shared in a structured way to ensure customers get a fair deal house of commons 2015 p 3 moreover little investment in new reservoirs were made in england and wales in the period after privatization bridgeman 2011 p 323 after undergoing the periods of privatization and restructuring the english water sector had changed considerably since the decentralized model of 1973 the current regulatory structure of the sector was created by the water act of 1989 which defined the financing conditions of the system and the tariff policy furthermore it introduced a privatization model in which the separation between the provision of sanitation services and its regulation should be clear which led to the creation of regulatory bodies with distinct scopes therefore the regulatory framework implemented after the water act of 1989 created a bipartite structure with a functional separation between the regulators of economic and environmental quality against this background the study infers that since 1989 dissatisfaction emerged regarding the tariff and services provided after the delegation of the provision of sanitation services in england and wales to the private sector recent discussions point to the processes of the remunicipalization of public services including sanitation in europe the term remunicipalization refers to the process of bringing previously private or private services under local public control and management the current study is aware that the use of the term is not always adequate because services that are reclaimed have frequently been private or did not exist in this case municipalization would be more adequate in this study however the term aims to cover both instances kishimoto and petitjean 2017 p 157 4 2 north american context we appreciate several waves of institutional changes regarding the creation of regulatory agencies in the united states which apply to diverse areas such as market capital securities and exchange commission the environment united states epa food food and drug administration and defense of competition federal trade commission ftc the changes can be summarized in three waves namely 1 at the end of the 19th century with the creation of competition defense agencies and the control of natural monopolies 2 during the new deal in the 1930s during this period an intense creation existed among independent agencies whose model was that of the ftc these agencies performed legislative functions with autonomy to issue norms and executive functions to implement administrative decisions which may arbitrate conflicts between parties and 3 since the mid 1960s a period in which agencies that focused on social regulation were created the last wave extended until the 1990s this moment was marked by the highlight on social regulation in addition to a process of deregulation in the 1980s with regard to transformations in the sanitation sector this study highlights four relevant periods namely before 1965 from 1965 to 1975 from 1975 to 1989 and from 1990 onward at the beginning of the 20th century the north american management of water resources was nearly exclusively centered on water supply flood control and navigation at the time an agency as strong as the epa did not exist at the end of the century the focus shifted to the protection of the environment to ensure the availability of drinking water and to provide recreational and esthetic experiences based on water resources at the same time prior to the passage of the water resources planning act of 1965 the federal government was primarily responsible for managing water resources in the united states financial resources could be obtained by local interests to support the projects where several large installations have been established moreover several north american states have adopted strict standards of environmental regulation which frequently imposed stricter conditions on management practices than those established by federal laws viessman jr 1990 from 1965 onward the development of water projects continued however the role of state governments in resource management began to expand in addition the focus of public policy on water supply has changed to issues related to the quality of water and the environment although federal resources prevailed increased importance was attached to the states and the management of water resources in addition to water supply issues viessman jr 1990 thus the period between 1965 and 1975 was marked by a a decentralization process which was characterized by the increased importance of the role of the states b a shift in the approach from water supply to pollution control and c a legal requirement that environmental impacts should be discussed in the planning and management of water projects in general the period between 1975 and 1989 was marked by moments with a restrictions on the federal budget and agencies b the adoption of more restrictive measures by environmental regulators c the increased transfer of authority to the states d increasing public awareness that policy development and future actions in the sector should be based on comprehensive and integrated analyses e weakening of support from members of congress and f the intensifying notion that users of water resources should pay a greater share of the costs of the services they demand viessman jr 1990 since the 1970s several efforts were focused on institutional changes in the sector however until the mid 1990s no major incentives were provided for private participation in the sector mainly due to two factors the first is the lack of separation between ownership of assets and management of services the second suggests that public companies had tax advantages in terms of raising funds for investment in the capital markets with the entry of the english and french companies which were specialized in the management of water supply services this situation in the north american market changed which expanded private participation holanda 1995 beecher and kalmbach 2013 over time the north american regulatory model has undergone changes due to the inefficiencies caused including the constant legal demands defense of decisions with the judiciary and the conduct of regulation by public opinion instead of being based on science in such a litigious and populist environment regulators began to explore various alternative models from which regulated sectors were encouraged to work in line instead of opposing public interest and regulators in this context a meeting was held in denver in 1995 between regulatory entities that is the public utility commissions pucs to consider the actions of the commissions at the turn of the century the event was followed by similar conferences only among pucs in 1998 2002 and 2003 in subsequent events the proposals were refined however they maintained as necessary the paradigm shift in relation to the perception of the regulation of public utility services in general new negotiation models have led to an increase in public confidence in the policies developed compared with those in the early 1990s however determining whether these reforms have been mainly successful is premature given that the evidence is inconclusive even in the 2000s a considerable inherent distrust was notable between the regulators and the regulatee the regulators still want to slap fines on industry industry does not feel that it wants to work with such aggressive minded individuals lofstedt et al 2001 p 403 although the united states was a pioneer in the field of environmental law one of the major bottlenecks in sanitation in the united states is the historical lack of investment in the sector the investments required to maintain and improve the water and sewage system in the country as of 2010 were estimated to reach us 91 billion however the actual investment was only us 36 billion which translates to a deficit of us 55 billion confederaçao nacional da indústria 2017 alternatively in the united states the efficiency reflected in the use of technologies to reduce water losses and reuse was emphasized for example in long term planning as well as in community awareness and in the search for efficiency in residential consumption the history of decentralization and fragmentation of the north american sector may have led to the responsibility of local governments and the provision of services being basically public with the decentralization of regulatory activity this historical context bears similarities with the brazilian model as presented in the subsequent text 4 3 brazilian context in brazil the development of the sector for public services was initiated approximately at the end of the 19th century in the states of são paulo and rio de janeiro at the time the government predominantly delegated the provision of services to foreign companies via public concession within a flexible institutional and financial model which lasted until the early 1930s faria et al 2005 correia 2008 the transformations that the brazilian sanitation sector underwent in the 20th century can be characterized through four main periods namely before 1930 from the 1930s to the 1950s from the 1960s to the 1980s and from 1990 onward with emphasis on the period after 2007 the provision of sanitation services in the period between 1850 and 1930 was characterized by flexibility and permission for foreign companies to enter public utility sectors the growing pace of urbanization in brazil throughout the 1930s began to demand an increase in the infrastructure sectors including those related to basic sanitation systems in this context the regulation of the sector in brazil began to be structured on the basis of the water code which was passed through decree no 24 643 of july 1934 the code provided the government with the possibility of setting tariff state intervention and a process of nationalization of foreign concessionaires also began during this decade such that investments in the sector were derived from the government budget lucena 2006 the period between 1930 and 1950 was marked by the direct municipal management of services a structure prevailed in which the same agent formulated policies provided services and controlled the services provided in articles 13 and 26 the federal constitutions of 1934 and 1937 respectively defined the municipal competence for services of a local character this definition was reaffirmed by the federal constitution of 1946 article 28 assures the autonomy of municipalities in terms of the organization of local public services in the 1940s however the federal government became concerned with the issue of sanitation which was linked to health issues where a multiplicity of agencies acted in an uncoordinated manner in the early 1950s the constitution of municipal authorities and financing mechanisms led increased autonomy to the municipal management of services britto 2001 between 1950 and 1970 the stated directly delivered the provision of infrastructure with regulations which are generally limited to the issuance of norms by the executive power galvao jr paganni 2009 from the 1950s onward the bases for new changes in the sector were established whereas initiatives in favor of centralized management at the state level emerged throughout the 1960s in this manner services were eventually granted to state companies which enabled the sector to acquire a new configuration based on the centralizing process undertaken by the government over the 1960s and 1970s the structure of the sector was consolidated with the creation of various agencies programs and plans linked to state and federal public authorities this structure remained stable until the mid 1980s until the end of this decade the country enforced a model of regulation in which ownership was state owned turolla and ohira 2007 britto 2001 correia 2008 in other words the sanitation sector has underwent relevant transformations in recent decades the initiatives introduced during the 1960s were fundamental for the development of the sector which laid the foundation for investment based on the institution of several important mechanisms such as bnh sfs and planasa however the regulatory structure characterized by state ownership which was in force in the country until the end of the 1980s was unsatisfactory amid the economic crisis that the country underwent during this decade and the difficulties faced by the sanitation sector at the end of the 1980s the long period of institutional uncertainty including the ownership of sanitation services hindered greater investments which have historically occurred in brazil primarily in specific periods especially in the 1970s from the 1990s onward a new form of regulation of public utility services was discussed in the mid 1990s regulation in the form of regulatory agencies was effectively implemented in the country with the privatization processes of sectors such as energy and telephony the new institutional environment of the 2000s favored the creation of a regulatory framework for the sector which culminated in the enactment of federal law no 11 445 in january 5 2007 this law defines the main instruments for the planning inspection provision and regulation of public sanitation services in brazil and is currently the main piece in the regulatory framework of the sector in 2020 a new change in the institutional and regulatory framework for sanitation was approved with the enactment of law no 14 026 2020 the government intended to justify the changes given the low capacity for investment and regulation by the municipalities which were holders of services among other justifications for the new institutional framework the government also listed increased legal certainty improvement in regulatory quality a reduction in transaction costs increased efficiency of resources combated losses and private investments table 1 presents the institutional evolution of the sanitation sector in brazil the discussion prior to law 14 026 2020 can be characterized by a narrative against the expansion of private participation in the sanitation sector according to the new legal framework municipalities are obliged to open competitive bidding processes at the end of their contracts with the state basic sanitation companies which expands the possibilities for private action in this sense the main change brought about by law 14 026 2020 is the reason for deadlocks across interest groups law 14 026 2020 provides the national water agency with the competence to institute standards used as a national reference for the regulation of basic sanitation services the new legal framework points to the unification of regulatory rules and greater space for the private sector to act in relation to sanitation services however concession to the private sector or the public provision of the service per se does not seemingly define the efficiency of services instead the quality of management and in this context the quality of regulation is essential to ensure adequate provision in brazil the challenges for the universalization of services are still pressing with the presence of possibilities for advances and setbacks after the establishment of the new regulatory framework law 11 445 2007 contemplated several possibilities which were pointed out as justifications for changing the institutional framework arguably pursuing the goals established with the adjustments in the previous framework albeit with improvements remains possible 5 results 5 1 economic and tariff aspects the brazilian tariff is mainly defined by establishing a rate of return this model originated in the united states the reasoning is that the model promotes efficiency by guaranteeing a fixed rate of return for the concessionaire similar to the united states price regulation in the supply sector in brazil can occur at the local or state level which is established by municipal or state agencies in brazil however regulation is mainly a task for state regulatory agencies whereas in the united states it occurs mainly at the local level in the united states the public commissions pc of the states are also relevant state agencies in brazil and commissions in the united states are similar in that they have acquired increased technical and institutional capacities to exercise regulatory activities compared with the majority of local governments a positive aspect of the north american tariff system is the protection of all users including minors through transparency and participation in decision making processes users are notified of changes to the systems and may appeal directly to regulators because the commission has established an internal structure for this aspect which is composed of ratepayer advocates commissions are more independent compared with other government agencies for example california s commission employs a team selected for its technical skills and provides long term mandates and job stability which facilitates its independence however the commission only operate above a certain level and typically regulate private service providers marques 2011 rate fixing is subject to lobbying by interest groups in the three countries under study price control in the united states is influenced by various factors such as persons accountable for asset management public private and the influence of important associations such as the awwa the english regulatory model is characterized by an agency i e ofwat that centralizes decisions and acts independently in addition the rate fixing method tends to induce efficiency by introducing instruments such as the price cap limits price by defining a productivity factor and the yardstick competition involves comparing the performance of companies given costs quality levels complaints and consumer needs the yardstick competition is important mainly due to the fragmentation of services and considerable differences in company performance barbosa and brusca 2015 p 98 advocate price caps by arguing that the empirical results for england and wales have shown that the price cap method fixed by ofwat led to better performance in the industry and that the results for the united states suggested that the adoption of the method led to prices lower than the rate of return in many cases in brazil a direct negotiation occurred with the municipality or with regulatory agencies which do not always set a defined price system and may reduce the transparency of the profitability of the companies based on the english model the brazilian economic regulators may perceive the importance of the effectiveness of the decisions of a strong and legitimate economic regulatory body such as the ofwat due to the efficiency gains from the adoption of price setting instruments similar to english ones article 38 of federal law no 11 445 2007 introduced the yardstick competition scheme by establishing that periodic price reviews should aim to share productivity gains with users and that tariff mechanisms may be established to induce efficiency including productivity factors defined based on indicators of other companies in the industry brasil 2007 emphasis added although this law introduced comparative competition and represented a breakthrough in the fixing of prices it does not impose a single institutional framework and enables the use of instruments related to the english i e price cap and yardstick competition or north american system based on the rate of return in this sense another similarity is noted between the united states and brazil the possibility of establishing different criteria in the fixing of prices which was reiterated by barbosa and brusca 2015 p 96 as follows regulatory differences also indicate the existence of different criteria for setting tariffs in this sense economic regulation in brazil similar to the united states can aim for increased uniformity in tariff setting processes given the fragmentation of the sector on the one hand and the resulting regional specificities on the other hand in this respect the english method for fixing prices is positive because it induces companies to increase productivity and encourages citizens to use water rationally at the same time data from iwa 2018 indicate that regulation should be careful in associating tariff with the volume of water consumption because behavior related to water consumption is dependent not only on price but also on the elasticity of user demand for example although the domestic consumption of this resource in 2016 exceeded 400 l per capita per day in new york or in denver in the united states consumption rates in brazilian cities and states such as brasília and são paulo and in english cities such as london and manchester or in cardiff wales remain below 200 l daily per capita even given the relatively higher water prices of the north american sector iwa 2018 in washington dc for instance water consumption for households in 2014 was even higher which exceeded 600 l per day iwa 2016 5 2 technological aspects an important technological trend in brazilian water supply is the improvement in micro and macro water metering techniques that aim to reduce water loss which negatively impacts the financial health of service providers in brazil this rate for all utilities combined reached 36 7 in 2014 although the importance of managing water losses is recognized this rate has not changed significantly in the 2004 2014 period brasil 2017 high water loss rates in brazil are due to the slow improvement in micro and macro water metering techniques among other factors according to nascimento and heller 2005 a need emerges for new technologies to address various issues such as the renovation of aging networks which creates opportunities for innovation in materials and methods that bring economic and operational benefits brazilian rates are high in comparison with other countries such as germany japan australia and new zealand which reduced their losses to approximately 10 or less in 2014 no brazilian state reached rates below 20 brasil 2017 in the united states no federal policy exists regarding limits to water losses in distribution nevertheless the majority of states regulate excess losses in distribution at 10 15 as the acceptable maximum as such reaching conclusions for the entire country is difficult due to the lack of regulatory requirements at the national level although several states do not record their losses others have established loss control programs for example california reports loss rates at approximately 10 whereas rates in georgia are less than 10 in wisconsin rates range from 15 to 25 epa 2010 cnt 2014 despite the efforts of states to manage water loss the existence of loss related operational and normative instruments in the majority of states and the commitment of state governments and associations to enforce regulations relevant challenges remain which are mainly related to the uniformity of water loss management policies among different regions in north america in england water loss management has drawn attention to political issues the occurrence of leaks and the level at which repairs became economically unviable are subject to much debate due to the high cost of waste and the outdated infrastructure network in london more than half of the water supply network is more than 100 years old whereas approximately 30 is aged more than 150 years although no european regulation on this topic has been formulated problems emerging due to the aging of networks are becoming increasingly relevant bridgeman 2011 eea 2014 in recent years however england has witnessed a significant improvement in the management of losses in 2006 2007 a reduction of approximately 30 in distribution losses occurred in england and wales compared with that for 1994 1995 ofwat 2006 despite the fact the volume of losses remains significant in 2011 water loss totaled 2559 ml per day defra 2013 ofwat has set loss targets for each company to address this issue in terms of research and innovation the united states has a long tradition of conducting basic research in national laboratories owned by the united states department of energy doe but operated by private companies or universities the majority of the environmental research conducted at these facilities is funded by the doe and other federal agencies of the united states jaffe et al 2005 in brazil the federal government is the main funder of studies on sanitation similar to the united states research is conducted at universities where partnerships with businesses have become increasingly common including private service providers equipment manufacturers and even state sanitation utilities andrade neto 2011 in england cave review cave 2009 which is an important study on competition and innovation in the sector highlighted the role of economic regulation in the development of new technologies and recommended changes in the regulatory dynamics in england the degree of innovation in england is mainly dependent on the system established by the economic regulatory body i e ofwat the ofwat approach enables consumers to share a few of the efficiency gains of the company but renders difficult the investment in risky but potentially valuable innovations the lack of alignment between various stakeholders in the provision and regulation of services i e utilities regulators and the government constrains the capacity of the english industry to exploit technological innovations which is also the case in brazil the english industry faces several challenges related to innovation despite this notion investment in research and development r d in the late 2000s was less than those during the late 1980s which was the period of privatization 1989 r d investments remained relatively stable throughout the 1990s but declined steeply and continuously after the end of the decade moreover the volume of r d investments ranged from 45 million per year in the early 1990s to 18 million in the late 2000s cave 2009 within a risk averse environment english companies became reluctant to invest in innovation due to the regulatory pressure on tariff whereas conventional technology would exclude financial uncertainty about return on investment the united kingdom water industry research pointed out that incentives for innovation would be limited to the reduction of loss and the maintenance of the quality of drinking water less attention is given to issues that could lead to long term benefits such as energy efficiency despite the high energy costs that companies incurred in 2006 bridgeman 2011 in brazil much work remains to be done despite the legal incentives to use modern technologies and improve efficiency in technological terms efforts have been exerted to reduce losses optimize water use and reuse and improve rainwater storage systems thus overcoming bureaucratic obstacles is fundamental for the technological development of the sector the united states together with germany were the most active countries in registering patents related to the treatment of water and sewage between 2000 and 2006 in relation to water abstraction only however the volume was significantly lower with only 57 requests from eight countries including the united states at third place out of which seven registers were granted london economics 2009 between 2000 and 2006 the united states has maintained leadership in patent registration however political and institutional issues have hindered technological development and the uniformity of regulation among states which is similar to brazil 5 3 environmental aspects the united states has pioneered in the field of environmental law in fact it began establishing environmental regulations during the 1960s from 1970 onward awareness of environmental pollution increased whereas attention was given to the importance of the integrated management of land and water use during the 1980s and 1990s prior to the administration of the current north american president environmental regulatory rigor had been increasing across the decades recently however a worrying factor is the influence of the united states on international politics the aspects to be considered in the current global scenario are the environmental policies adopted by the united states after the inauguration of trump with the beginning of the consequent process of revoking the measures approved during the previous administration to combat climate change these aspects also include the withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement as such the effects of these decisions on the international community should be considered the water supply industry in the united states is mainly regulated by the safe drinking water act of 1974 which was amended in 1986 and 1996 and by the clean water act of 1977 which was amended in 1987 these environmental guidelines resulted in important actions for the protection of sources of drinking water at the local state and national levels the united states employs a complex legislative system for environmental regulation these local and state regulations serve as a laboratory for federal legislation in the sense that many federal measures have been previously tested at the state level to address environmental issues a scattering of laws and numerous executive orders has occurred the environmental legislation of the united states has served as a model for other countries including brazil where an excess of laws and orders issued also exists the united states regulatory framework however is more detailed due to the number of references to other statutes in addition to constant legislative changes and mandatory revisions at five year intervals capelari and capelari 2015 alternatively the english environmental legislation originates from important european directives for various reasons the english regulatory environment has limited the ability of the industry to exploit technological innovations which influenced environmental issues nevertheless significant advances have been made in the quality of drinking water and services after privatization including improvements in capital investments and reduction in inefficiencies in view of the emergence of important environmental issues english regulatory agencies expanded their goals beyond their initial economic functions during the 1980s by incorporating environmental issues to their new scope of action the increasing importance given to environmental policy has led to the establishment of environmental regulatory bodies in the 1990s and highlighted environmental demands which have grown significantly over the past 15 years stern 2010 after the english privatization and the assignment of new duties to the agency a series of conflicts emerged between economic goals and government policies regarding the environmental role of the economic regulator in the united states impacts on the costs and benefits of implementing environmental legal guidelines also led to heated discussions under intense lobbying historically the united states and brazil experienced situations in which business sectors opposed environmental regulations such that reactions to environmental policies oscillated according to the political will of the leaders the main normative instruments of the brazilian sector are law no 11 445 2007 the resolutions of the conama nos 357 march 17 2005 and 430 may 13 2011 and ordinance no 2914 december 12 2011 of the ministry of health brasil 2007 2005 2011a 2011b similar to the united states brazilian data on water quality vary significantly across regions as such data comparison is difficult due to the lack of uniformity and parameters for calculating indicators among other factors table 2 presents the regulatory models discussed from a comparative perspective highlighting the eight indicators used for comparison in table 2 is important the indicators are as follows 1 organization of service provision provides information on the organization of the country s service provision 2 ownership of assets describes the ownership of assets between private and public 3 management provides an overview of the types of management of sanitation models and broadly separates them between private and public 4 main bodies describes the main regulatory bodies involved in the model 5 degree of private participation denotes the involvement of private initiatives using the following scales very high greater than 95 1 high between 95 and 65 1 medium between 65 and 35 1 low between 35 and 5 1 and very low less than 5 6 technological issues addresses the main challenges found in the models 7 main method of tariff setting aims to compare the tariff charging methods and 8 main structural challenges aims to compare the challenges faced by models whether political institutional technological development and economic or environmental table 2 presents the main differences between the proposed models english united kingdom american and brazilian notably all models assumed dynamic formats over time which were altered and adapted through decades of social cultural and political development all historical factors which are addressed in section 4 were considered in the analysis and results according to the specific relevance of the development of each country the historical context which is marked by public and private initiatives mainly influenced the changes in the models up to the present and will continue to influence changes in future models 6 discussion of results access to health care is constitutionally guaranteed as the right of all and the duty of the state guaranteed by social and economic policies aimed at reducing the risk of disease and other conditions and at ensuring universal and equal access as stipulated in article 196 section ii on health of the federal constitution of 1988 although it is an issue of public relevance much work should be done to develop the sector and achieve service universalization thus the current study focused on the institutional and regulatory gaps of the sector which have historical roots in brazil the provision of sanitation services in the 1990s was marked by the following 1 a modernization effort that involved policy evaluation and performance measurement including the improvement of mechanisms such as the snis 2 several changes in the ministry responsible for supervising the industry 3 a certain degree of progress in sanitation services due to the launching of planasa 4 a fierce dispute over which entity should provide these services which led several municipalities and states to appeal to the constitutional court adi 1842 and 5 an incipient process of increasing private participation which was hampered by a context of significant dissent among different interest groups which temporarily suspended the conflict over service provision to defeat the proposal to privatize state owned utilities by the end of the 1990s the federal government focused its efforts on the liberalization of service provision several initiatives were adopted to make the sector more attractive to private investment such as the approval of federal law no 8987 february 13 1995 which provides for the concession of public services in the country in addition two bills were proposed in the senate i e pls 266 1996 and pl 4147 2001 which enabled the privatization of utilities sousa and costa 2013 in the 2000s the sector became subject to an intense process of institutional restructuring a new model began to be discussed which also aimed to reduce the participation of state owned utilities in the provision of services with their concession to the private initiative and to ensure increased control over water use the industry continues to maintain these characteristics a point worth remembering however is that the discussion did neither occur nor remains without controversies as such several political disputes arose between advocates of state and municipality protagonism who constituted the main interest groups federal law 11 445 2007 was finally enacted despite the obstacles to the adoption of a national law for establishing sanitation guidelines in general the regulatory structure of the water supply in england is centralized and bipartite with a functional separation between economic ofwat and environmental i e dwi and ea regulatory bodies whereas the united states and brazilian structures are institutionally pluralistic and decentralized with responsibilities shared between the local state and federal regulatory bodies and with the participation of various stakeholders these regulatory structural features are related to the manner in which services are provided and even to the history of the industry for each country in brazil a consensus exists among several researchers regarding the absence of institutional regulation after the end of planasa in the early 1990s sousa and costa 2013 carvalho and sampaio 2015 notably regulation is an intrinsically political activity which is subject to all the instabilities of the political process due to lobbies the temporal limitations of popular suffrage the influence of interest groups and opportunism nascimento 2015 p 229 230 in this context sousa and costa 2013 argue that the development of the brazilian public sanitation policy was obstructed due to decision making and institutional uncertainties the authors explain the notion of trajectory dependence which views public decisions as influenced by past choices and affirm that the clash of state and municipal interests influenced decision making in brazil which rendered difficult the achievement of a consensus on points essential for industry expansion arguably discussions in this field apart from those about state or municipal authority and public versus private service provision should consider elements that may distort resource allocation such as the evaluation of cross subsidies in addition the role of incentives in improving efficiency regulation and the role of public policies that aim to share productivity gains with users should be highlighted in the brazilian scenario of service fragmentation and still inexperienced regulatory agencies moreover the characteristics of the brazilian and north american industries share several similarities however the historical experiences of these countries are different to ensure that political cycles will not hinder regulatory activities given the technology available agencies need credibility which is related to their transparency and independence which can be reinforced by factors such as fixed managerial terms qualified and stable technical staff stable commitment of resources and other measures to ensure continuity in action regarding transparency in actions and decisions which are essential for regulatory bodies the low proportion of agencies holding public sessions and publicizing their deliberations indicates that much work needs to be done in brazil the percentage of investments audited by regulators is remarkably low municipal agencies or municipal consortia have yet to supervise 14 25 of the regulated municipalities on a yearly basis in relation to state agencies the percentage of regulated municipalities that lack economic financial supervision has reached 77 abar 2015 for investments the deficit for this type of supervision is approximately 35 for consortium and municipal agencies and 56 for state agencies abar 2015 carvalho and sampaio 2015 proposed that agencies created after the sanctioning of the law are more pro active than those created before 2007 the possibility of regulatory capture and the resulting inefficiency in regulatory enforcement highlight the importance of preventing capture processes as stated in the introduction establishing instruments for the control of society on regulatory activities serves this purpose exercised by trade unions ngos independent ombudsman offices political parties public policy management boards social control is a means for implementing the existing regulatory instruments and for contributing to the effectiveness of this activity in brazil article 2 of federal law 11 445 states that public basic sanitation services will be provided based on the following fundamental principles ix transparency of actions based on institutionalized information systems and decision making processes x social control brasil 2007 moreover chapter viii of law 11 455 2007 is a provision for the exercise of social control whereas article 47 of the same law establishes that such control may include the participation of collegiate bodies of an advisory nature regardless of the administrative level involved brasil 2007 in this sense the aforementioned law established the instruments essential to the systematization of the economic regulation of water supply and sanitation services it includes the planning of public policies for the sector based on transparency and the social control of actions and provided mechanisms for social control as one of the fundamental principles in the provision of these services however the new legal framework namely federal law 14 026 2020 brasil 2020 does not maintain transparency and social control as fundamental principles article 3 of both federal laws stipulates the legal understanding that social control indicates a set of mechanisms and procedures that guarantee society information technical representations and participation in policy formulation processes planning and evaluation related to public sanitation services brasil 2007 2020 nonetheless several authors e g galvão jr et al 2009 argue that the sector lacks a regulatory culture that encompasses the interest of the main actors involved in the provision of services i e granting power concessionaire and users and that prioritizes the principles of efficiency transparency and social control provided for in article 2 of law 11 445 brasil 2007 another notable issue is the need for uniformity in environmental monitoring tools the main regulations e g resolutions ordinances and laws that apply for environmental guidelines define the competent bodies to apply them as well as the parameters for assessing water quality and potability brasil 1997 2005 2011b despite this initiative the lack of uniformity of the existing instruments e g measurement of parameters and the asymmetry between administrative entities in the implementation of the instruments hinder development in this sector in addition to the lack of uniformity of economic tariff setting and environmental tools tasks the uniformity of technological solutions is relevant this notion is specifically true with regard to the management of distribution losses which influences water supply and is an important evaluation parameter especially in scenarios of scarcity of water resources an example scenario is the variation in water loss rates among different brazilian states and municipalities the brazilian water supply industry bears resemblance to that of the united states in terms of structure and tariff the united states is more advanced technologically mainly due to the country s leadership in r d and innovation which ensured its leadership in patent registration between 2000 and 2006 despite state efforts to manage water loss significant challenges remain which are mainly related to the uniformity of water loss management policies among different regions in the united states which is similar to brazil in brazil the main federal law on water supply and sanitation 11 445 2007 provides for the necessary cooperation between administrative entities the articulation of the urban development policies with environmental protection and health promotion brasil 2007 the effectiveness of the law would fill important gaps such as the lack of harmonization of policies for the industry the lack of cooperation between administrative entities and the integration of different bodies with common competences and problems related to incompatibility between the mechanisms for monitoring and assessing water quality in the country in fact addressing these issues would benefit service users however these issues which are regarded as deserving of priority measures remain as obstacles to the development of the sector as a whole regarding the responsibility for the management of services the question does not lay in deciding whether utilities should be state owned or private the consequences of privatization may be a disadvantage to low income users who have less means to pay for the consumption of an essential commodity such as water in this sense ideological disputes are a problem aggravated by the absence of reliable data to support empirical studies 7 final remarks this study aimed to comparatively analyze the brazilian north american and english experiences this analysis demonstrated that sharing these experiences could be positive for example by stressing the importance of creating regulatory bodies that can act in a transparent and legitimate manner and that are able to articulate the elaboration of public policies with other sectors in england ofwat is an economic regulator that proved to be sufficiently strong for fixing tariff in a manner that ensured the compliance of utilities with regulations apart from considering the interest of users thus brazil should aim to establish regulations that should be enforced as independently as possible to avoid regulatory capture by utilities and to preserve the public interest the literature argues that in brazil similar to the united states economic regulation should aim to achieve increased uniformity in the tariff setting processes given the fragmentation of the sector and regional specificities conca 2008 brasil 2007 in brazil however an institutional movement has been initiated to centralize the sector which occurred with the enactment of law no 14 026 2020 alternatively the english price setting model is viewed as positive because it induced companies in comparative terms to increase productivity and encouraged citizens to make rational use of water at the same time iwa 2016 2018 conversely as previously mentioned a positive aspect of the tariff system in the united states is the protection of all users including small ones through transparency and participation in decision making processes users are notified of changes in the system and may appeal directly to regulators as the commission has established an internal structure for this purpose in brazil household users only have access to incipient or pro forma participatory instruments which are provided by utilities only to formally comply with legislation compared with larger ones such as industrial users although price setting is a task subject to lobbying by interest groups in all three countries using participatory tools is essential to an effective regulatory activity and exceeds mere formality a notable example of participatory approaches is that of participatory budgeting which was initiated in porto alegre brazil in the late 1980s this approach inspired european countries such as germany spain and poland to adopt the format within their respective local contexts sintomer et al 2008 benefits accrued from using the participatory budget approach include enhanced communication between the government local political elites and citizens improvement in political culture induction of better coordination in civil society improvement in public services based on the proposals of citizens collaboration between individual state departments increased responsiveness of state entities and contribution to local knowledge in addressing key social issues sintomer 2008 in addition benefits from participatory instruments have been documented in diverse geographical contexts such as rural bangladesh van der voorn 2008 and the mercosur region argentina brazil paraguay the bolivarian republic of venezuela and uruguay which have adopted the participatory instrument since the 1990s gugliano and carbonai 2013 researchers indicate that participatory policies contribute to redirecting public spending to the socioeconomically disadvantaged portion of the population generate public transparency and accountability and generally raise levels of social participation in addition to other benefits however it should be mentioned that scholars in brazil also argued that forming a committee for gathering social organizations does not necessarily render the decision process participatory in terms of strategies available for the management of water supply and water resources we contend that policies involving citizens in public management represent an opportunity for enhancing the management capacity of the government gugliano and carbonai 2013 historically the united states and brazil experienced situations in which business sectors opposed environmental regulations such that reactions to environmental policies oscillated according to the political will of the authorities this tendency points to the importance of maintaining actions in the field of sanitation independent of political electoral cycles moreover although the united states was a pioneer in the field of environmental law one of the major bottlenecks in its sanitation is the historical lack of investment in the sector nevertheless a distinct emphasis has been placed on the use of technologies to reduce water loss and reuse in the search for efficiency in residential consumption the history of decentralization and fragmentation of the north american sector may have led to the responsibility of local governments the provision of services being basically public and the decentralization of regulatory activity this historical context bears similarities with brazil although important challenges remain for brazil in terms of reducing water loss and providing sewage services in the country alternatively the movement to privatize services in the united kingdom occurred in the late 1980s which was beset with controversy and led to increased bills for service users and increased political clashes in brazil the delegation of services to the private sector was avoided through political pressure currently the approval of the new legal framework in the country aims to increase the participation of the private sector which is also riddled with controversy in contrast to the british context in which the private sector has participated since 1989 the brazilian context does not currently display a strong independent and centralized regulation of the sector instead a proliferation of regulatory bodies has occurred within the scope of municipalities and states and with the recent centralization of activity to the national water agency which was previously responsible only for the water resources of the country the development of an informed methodologically consistent empirical research on sanitation and the political aspects of water supply can qualify policy formulation and improve the quality of debates in this regard long term results can be more oriented toward the interests of users furthermore studies on the management of sanitation and water services should note that public administration is subject to political processes such that future research should address this issue regarding the sanitation and water supply policy in brazil the country has yet to achieve the universalization of services national authorities question the political decisions that culminated in the approval of the new legal framework however the discussion on the new legal framework falls outside of the scope of the present study thus we suggest that future research should further examine this aspect because the consequences and effects continue to occur the reforms currently undertaken described in section 4 in the institutional framework of the public water supply and sanitation services in brazil is worthy of future research in terms of consequences as well as possible challenges the experience of the two countries analyzed for international comparison reinforces the concept that no single model for success exists instead various institutional frameworks and instruments that reflect historical situations are specific to each country however they may share similarities and frequently common challenges finally we hope that this comparative discussion contributes to the development of the sector in brazil in technical and political terms in the light of the experiences of the united states and the united kingdom the presentation of their experiences from different perspectives aimed to elucidate the importance of considering the formulation and evaluation of public policies related to water supply and sanitation in an interdisciplinary manner in this manner the conditions necessary to enable universal quality service can be created after all this human right remains universal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11816,the effect of varying initial soil moisture θ in of a given soil on the drawdown curve measured using the modified philip dunne infiltrometer mpdi and consequently on the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s value was investigated the laboratory tests completed using three different types of soil show that the drawdown curve was sensitive to θ in for all three soils this resulted in yielding κ s values that are sensitive to the values of θ in the lowest value of κ s was observed when the mpdi was used under wet conditions to obtain a consistent estimate of κ s a new correction factor was developed this factor can be multiplied with the geometrical coefficient used in the governing equations of the mpdi to make appropriate corrections after employing the correction factor the variations in κ s values for all three tested soils decreased from 66 61 and 59 to 26 16 and 26 respectively in situ experimental tests also show similar results and the coefficient of variation decreased from 81 to 61 after applying the correction factor the performance was further validated by testing the relative performance of the mpdi against the results obtained using minidisk infiltrometer mdi under varying θ in values results from the mdi show that the coefficient of variation for the κ s values of the three soils were 20 28 and 32 which are similar to the variations obtained after applying the correction factor in the mpdi model calculations the aforementioned results indicate that the correction method proposed in this study is a useful method for improving the overall performance of mpdi graphical abstract image 1 keywords infiltration modified philip dunne infiltrometer groundwater suction head initial soil moisture saturated hydraulic conductivity green ampt model 1 introduction water movement into the soil is the most important factor that affects many hydrological processes including groundwater recharge and surface water runoff liu et al 2011 schiff and dreibelbis 1949 soil properties such as the amount of fines initial moisture content θ in and saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s can greatly impact water transport rate through soil water systems the rate at which water infiltrates into an unsaturated soil varies between a maximum value when the soil is dry and to a minimum value when the soil is wet horton 1933 philip 1957 ruggenthaler et al 2016 ruggenthaler et al 2016 investigated the infiltration behavior in eight sites under dry moist and wet soil moisture conditions using the double ring infiltrometer the dry run was performed at the wilting point the moist run was performed at the field capacity the wet run used an artificial sprinkler to produce wet soil conditions results showed that the infiltration rate decreased with increasing θ in hino et al 1988 investigated the effect of θ in on the vertical movement of water through a one dimensional vertical infiltration system the system was a small cylindrical lysimeter that was supplied with artificial rainfall with two tensiometers placed at different depths results showed that as θ in increased the water movement through the soil became faster the slower movement of water in drier soil is related to the increased volume of water to fill in the voids of soil fan et al 2018 investigated the wetting front patterns of different types of soil for θ in values of 40 50 and 60 of field capacity a vertical line source moistube which contained uniformly distributed nano pores which worked as a subsurface source of water was used to introduce a constant amount of water results showed that the rate of the downward movement of the wetting front increased with the increase in θ in the acceleration of the wetting front movement with the increase in θ in is related to the reduced amount of water that is needed to fill in the voids in the soil the soil property that quantifies the ease at which water can move through the soil is the hydraulic conductivity k value mays 2010 the value of k for a given soil increase with the increase in the soil moisture content and it eventually reaches the maximum and a constant value when the soil is fully saturated this constant value is the saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s which is one of the crucial parameters that govern water transport in soil water systems under saturated conditions the soil with higher κ s can transmit water faster than the soil with lower κ s accurate measurement of κ s is important for the investigation of the hydrological processes and their relationship with groundwater recharge processes alagna et al 2016 alakayleh et al 2018 mckenzie and jacquier 1997 mohanty et al 1994 reynolds et al 2000 zhang and schaap 2019 many field and laboratory methods for measuring κ s are available however measuring κ s variations over a large field scale would require multiple tests using samples collected at many locations which could be time consuming therefore a variety of field methods have been developed to measure in situ κ s values the methods include the guelph permeameter reynolds and elrick 1986 the tension infiltrometer perroux and white 1988 the minidisk infiltrometer mdi zhang 1997 the double ring infiltrometer astm 2009 the philip dunne permeameter philip 1993 and the modified philip dunne infiltrometer mpdi ahmed et al 2014 the mpdi is a relatively simple measurement system where a tube is inserted 5 cm into the soil and then filled with water the user will measure the water drawdown data over time the soil moisture levels at the beginning i e the initial soil moisture content θ in and at the end of the test i e the final soil moisture content θ sf these values are used to determine the in situ κ s and the green ampt suction head ψ at the wetting front green and ampt 1911 previous studies have shown that under natural conditions water moves into the soil by the effect of two major forces gravity and capillary forces gray and norum 1967 the coarser the soil texture the greater the influence of the gravitational force on the contrary the finer the soil texture the stronger the capillary forces when a soil has a high moisture content value wet condition then the influence of capillary forces will decrease and the effect of gravitational force will increase fan et al 2018 gray and norum 1967 hino et al 1988 regalado et al 2005 the drawdown data collected using the mpdi under wet conditions or low suction head conditions should be carefully evaluated since the assumption that the flow is mostly driven by capillarity pressure force is no longer valid regalado et al 2005 study pointed out that when low suction head conditions or wet conditions are present near the wetting front results from the philip dunne permeameter must be analyzed with care since the predominant force transporting water will be the gravitational force alakayleh et al 2019 investigated the performance of the mpdi using a forward modeling algorithm their study showed that the κ s and ψ values estimated using the mpdi are insensitive to the soil moisture deficit δ θ θ s f θ i n assumed in the data analysis procedure ahmed et al 2014 therefore the users of mpdi can independently estimate δ θ based on the field observations consequently the estimated κ s and ψ are only sensitive to the drawdown data measured using the mpdi regalado et al 2005 found similar results and demonstrated the high level of sensitivity of κ s and ψ values estimated using the philip dunne permeameter to the measured drawdown data and relatively less sensitivity to δ θ since the drawdown curve patterns for a given soil can vary under different field conditions i e wet or dry soil one has to carefully analyze the drawdown data after considering the variations in θ in to evaluate the best estimates of κ s and ψ values while several published studies alakayleh 2019 garza et al 2017 nestingen et al 2018 have used the mpdi method and compared its performance with other techniques however none of them have tested the performance under varying θ in in this study we performed several experiments under both laboratory and field conditions using different types of soil to investigate the effects of varying θ in on the drawdown curves measured using the mpdi and its implication on estimating κ s and ψ values the soil parameter values obtained from mpdi were compared against those obtained using mdi under similar test conditions based on these experimental datasets we developed a correction factor that can be used to improve the performance of the mpdi when it is used under varying initial soil moisture conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the mpdi ahmed et al 2014 is a modified version of the philip dunne permeameter philip 1993 it is an efficient field technique that can be used to quickly measure the near surface soil κ s at multiple points the method involves collecting the unsteady infiltration data over a short period rather than waiting for the steady state infiltration as in the double ring infiltrometer method therefore mpdi tests are quick and they also require a minimal amount of water the original philip dunne permeameter is an open tube that is tightly inserted into a 15 cm borehole however the modified version mpdi developed by ahmed et al 2014 uses a transparent open ended tube with a radius of 5 cm which is beveled from one side for vertically inserting the tube into the soil the radius and inserting depth can be varied based on user needs water is rapidly poured into the device to an initial height h in and the height of water in the tube with time h t above the soil surface is monitored the initial and final soil moisture contents θ in and θ sf are also measured using an in situ method soil moisture probe or a laboratory method e g gravimetric measurements the data analysis method is developed based on the green ampt theory green and ampt 1911 to estimate κ s and ψ by modeling the water level variations observed inside the mpdi i e h t versus t data the green ampt model assumes a homogenous and isotropic soil profile and a uniform distribution of θ in at t 0 also the wetting front is assumed to be a sharp region with an upper zone that is fully saturated and a lower zone that is always maintained at θ in the actual disc shaped infiltration surface of the mpdi with a radius r₁ of 5 cm see fig 1 is substituted by a sphere with an equivalent surface area with a radius r 0 0 5 r ₁ the flow from the tube into the soil is assumed to be a capillarity pressure driven flow ignoring the gravity component would result in the spherically symmetrical flow system the assumed spherically symmetrical configuration is approximated to the actual three dimensional flow configuration by applying a geometrical coefficient based on exploratory calculations using conformal mapping philip 1993 see fig 1 and later ahmed et al 2014 have used a factor β π 2 8 in the governing equations used to analyze the mpdi s drawdown data equation 1 below shows the governing equation of the mpdi model as presented by ahmed et al 2014 1 δ h t k s l m a x

wetting front at time t l max is the depth of insertion of the mpdi into the soil ahmed et al 2014 used equation 1 to solve for κ s and ψ by minimizing the absolute difference between δh t determined using equation 1 and the measured change of head from the drawdown data another method for setting the optimization is to fit κ s and ψ values by minimizing the absolute difference between δt determined by rearranging equation 1 and measured time intervals data 2 2 laboratory experiments a mini mpdi with a radius of 1 27 cm a tube of 1 inch diameter that can be driven 1 27 cm into the soil was constructed and was used in our laboratory experiments the device was provided with a support base to stabilize the system fig 2 a the drawdown data for a series of experiments were measured using the mini mpdi to determine κ s and ψ values three different types of soil were used in our laboratory study for each soil several experiments were performed by changing the θ in value of the soil the three types of soil were prepared by mixing fine sand with a varying amount percent dry weights 8 15 and 30 of no 52 silcosil silt the silt was made of ground quartz purchased from the u s silica company the mastersizer 3000 made by malvern panalytical 2018 was used to determine the percentage of clay silt and sand in all three soils these percentage values were used in the textural triangle usda 2014 to determine the soil texture classes after the soil mix was prepared by mixing the fine sand with silt at a specific percentage level the mixture was packed in a testing bucket with a diameter of 29 cm and a depth of 37 cm θ in was measured gravimetrically by analyzing three soil samples taken during the packing of the middle and surface parts of the bucket where infiltration would occur the mpdi was inserted 1 27 cm into the soil near the center of the bucket water was rapidly poured to fill the mpdi to an initial height h in at time t 0 during the infiltration period the water level changes occurring inside the mpdi were recorded with time immediately after all the water has infiltrated into the soil the infiltrometer tube was removed from the bucket and soil samples were collected from the location where the tube was inserted to measure the final soil moisture content θ sf then the soil dry bulk density was measured by taking a soil core closely following the procedure described in astm f1815 11 2011 to convert the gravimetric moisture content into volumetric soil moisture content the collected data were analyzed using the procedure developed by ahmed et al 2014 to estimate κ s and ψ the soil was then removed and transferred to a bigger bucket and was mixed with additional water to obtain a higher θ in the soil was then repacked into the original test bucket using the same packing procedure to maintain a similar dry bulk density value the mpdi testing procedure was repeated to conduct the drawdown experiments under different wetter θ in fig 2 shows the mini mpdi and the experimental testing setup that were used in this study the mini mpdi was used in the laboratory since the soil is more homogenous than in the field where a standard mpdi with a radius of 5 cm was used water infiltrated from the standard mpdi can cover a volume of soil greater than the one that the mini mpdi would cover note a larger well representative sample volume is required to test a heterogeneous field system however a relatively smaller volume is sufficient for testing a homogenous experimental system for comparison a mdi made by meter group inc 2018 was used to estimate the value of κ s of the three soils that were tested using the mini mpdi the same packing and mixing procedures that were used for the mpdi were also used for mdi experiments the minidisk device is a transparent tube with a radius of 1 55 cm that is divided into two chambers the lower chamber contains a water volume of about 90 cm3 that is allowed to infiltrate into the soil the upper chamber controlled the suction and therefore the water infiltration rate a stainless steel porous disk is attached to the bottom of the infiltrometer to prevent water from leaking in the open air after both chambers were filled with water the suction was set to 6 cm and the bottom of the infiltrometer was placed on the soil and then water started to infiltrate into the soil during infiltration the volume of water inside the infiltrometer was recorded at regular time intervals then the volume of cumulative water infiltrated with time was calculated the test was repeated for different θ in for all the soils the procedures for data collection and analysis were performed following the methods described in meter group inc 2018 the user manual meter group inc 2018 includes a basic microsoft excel spreadsheet that was utilized in this study to calculate the κ value based on equations 2 4 described below the measured cumulative infiltration data from mdi were analyzed using the analysis procedure proposed by zhang 1997 to estimate k the cumulative infiltration data and the square root of time are fitted with the following equation philip 1957 2 i c 1 t 0 5 c 2 t where i is the cumulative infiltration t is time c 1 and c 2 are parameters related to the sorptivity and k respectively then the k value of the soil is calculated using the equation 3 k c 2 a 2 where a 2 is a dimensionless coefficient that can be obtained using the equation 4 a 2 11 65 n 0 1 1 e x p c n 1 9 α h α r 0 0 91 c 2 92 i f n 1 9 c 7 5 i f n 1 9 where n and α are the van genuchten moisture retention parameters for the soil r 0 is the radius of the infiltration disk h is the suction at the soil surface and c is constant as the suction applied at the soil surface resulted in near saturated hydraulic conductivity kargas et al 2017 radinja et al 2019 the following equation was used to estimate κ s gardner 1958 5 k s k e x p α g h where α g is the gardner parameter reported in létourneau and caron 2019 2 3 field experiments a standard mpdi with a radius of 5 cm that can be driven up to 5 cm into the soil was used to estimate the in situ κ s and ψ values of a silt loam soil the site is an agriculture field located in auburn alabama usa data were collected in situ for the water level drop observed inside the tube at various times the values of initial and final gravimetric soil moisture contents and soil dry bulk density were also estimated the drawdown data were collected at the same location using the mpdi for the same soil under both dry and wet conditions data for the dry condition were collected after several sunny days and data for wet conditions were collected after a rainy day the mdi was also used to estimate the in situ κ s at the same location where the mpdi was used the mdi s suction head was set to 5 cm for both dry and wet field conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory experiments the percentages of clay silt and sand measured using the mastersizer 3000 analysis for the sand mixes with 8 15 and 30 silt are presented in table 1 using these data the three soils were classified as loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively fig 3 shows the drawdown data points symbols measured using the mini mpdi for the three soils under varying θ in versus the simulated drawdown curves lines using the modified philip dunne theory proposed by ahmed et al 2014 the simulated drawdown curves fit the measured drawdown data well with r 2 values very close to 1 the drawdown curves start from the initial water height h in to the lowest height h t 2 cm that can be read in the device the support base of the mini mpdi would not allow us to read the depths close to a completely empty tube the h in values were 32 30 and 29 5 cm for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively results show that the total drawdown time t 2 which was recorded when h t 2 cm varied with the soil type for example under dry conditions where θ i n was maintained at 0 001 0 002 and 0 001 for the three soils t 2 values were 78 492 and 2652 s for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively our results show that the measured drawdown curves are significantly different for the same soil under varying θ i n for every soil the t 2 values are greater under wet than dry conditions the t 2 values under wet conditions fig 3 were 465 2722 and 12118 s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the corresponding t 2 values under dry conditions were 78 492 and 2652 s the wet conditions had an initial water content of 0 138 0 143 and 0 144 which are 68 62 and 58 of the final measured water content of 0 204 0 230 and 0 250 for the three soils the three soils were not able to hold additional water after reaching these final measured water content levels therefore very high θ i n values were not tested in this study ahmed et al 2014 performed the field infiltration measurements in grassed roadside drainage ditches using their mpdis at 32 sites and had θ i n with the percent of saturation ranging from 7 7 to 90 7 54 2 18 2 and 90 6 sites with the percent initial saturation 30 the aforementioned results indicated that the rate of water infiltration into dry soil can be higher than in wet soil which is similar to the observations made by others including gray and norum 1967 philip 1957a b ruggenthaler et al 2016 this is because there are more voids in dry soil that allow water to fill relatively fast but wet soil has much fewer voids to allow water to fill and therefore takes more time for the water to infiltrate the collected drawdown data for the three soils under varying θ i n and the corresponding θ i n and θ s f were analyzed using the procedure proposed by ahmed et al 2014 and the estimated κ s and ψ are reported in table 2 table 2 shows that the overall trend of κ s values estimated using the mpdi was decreasing with increasing the fine content which is as expected this trend was also observed by nestingen et al 2018 for the κ s values estimated using the mpdi for three types of sand with different grain size distributions the mpdi data did not provide a unique value for κ s when measured under varying θ i n conditions however in reality κ s should remain the same for a given soil whatever the value of θ i n at the time of performing the test this difference in κ s is caused by the difference in measured drawdown curve as the κ s value estimated using the mpdi theory is highly sensitive to the drawdown curve and less sensitive to δ θ therefore the estimated κ s values of every soil table 2 varied with θ i n the mean values and standard deviations of κ s are 1 63 10 2 and 1 08 10 2 cm s 2 20 10 3 and 1 34 10 3 cm s and 3 23 10 4 and 1 90 10 4 cm s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the coefficients of variation of κ s for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam were 66 61 and 59 respectively the lowest κ s value of every soil was observed when the mpdi was used under wet conditions note that the flow of water from the mpdi into the soil is assumed to be primarily driven by capillarity pressure force after ignoring the gravity effects previous studies have shown that the higher the θ in the lower the effect of the capillary force and the greater the effect of gravity force hino et al 1988 that means an underestimation of κ s is the consequence of neglecting the effects of the gravity force as the water infiltrated from mpdi is transported through the soil the estimated ψ values see table 2 were arbitrary and did not reflect the changes in the soil texture class and θ in this is similar to the results from alakayleh et al 2019 who concluded that the mpdi is not a robust method to estimate ψ values 3 1 1 development of a correction factor to estimate a unique value for κ s it is desirable to somehow account for the effect of θ in in the mpdi model to provide a better estimate of κ s and possibly correct ψ values that reflect the variation in θ in of a given soil we hypothesized that the constant coefficient β used in the mpdi governing equations should be allowed to vary with the soil texture class and also with the variation in θ in values to accomplish this we proposed a correction factor θ i n θ s f s that can be multiplied by β π 2 8 to get the modified geometrical coefficient β m π 2 8 θ i n θ s f s then the corrected value β m can be used in equation 1 rather than using β in the correction factor s is an empirical constant that will vary with the soil textural class and it appears to be correlated to the value of the bubbling pressure the estimated s values are 9 15 and 21 for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively which are linearly correlated with the bubbling pressure values reported in rawls et al 1982 the proposed correction in the geometrical coefficient β reflects the changes in the actual three dimensional flow configuration of a given soil for varying θ in fig 4 shows the geometrical analog of the mpdi for a given soil considering varying θ in this figure shows the shape of the wetting fronts when the gravity effects are ignored the right side of the figure and when the gravity is taken into account the left side of the figure for a given value of θ in note that the water head drop δ h h i n h t is maintained the same previous studies have shown that the wetting front could advance to a deeper depth with the increase in θ in also the finer the soil texture is the greater the effect of θ in fan et al 2018 hino et al 1988 the correction factor see table 2 varies with θ in for the same soil texture class since θ sf and s remain the same and is much greater for the wet condition than for dry condition to account for the effect of θ in within a given soil for example when the θ in value of the loamy sand table 2 is changed from 0 12 to 13 8 a 115 times increase the correction factor has the same level of increase also the correction factor varies with the soil texture class because of the change in θ sf and s the correction factor increases with the increase in the fine content of the soil this will account for the greater effect of θ in on the drawdown data of fine soil than coarse soil for example when θ in is the same for the three soil θ i n 0 09 the correction factor equals 3 8 5 7 and 7 8 for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively note that regalado et al 2005 have shown that the sensitivity of estimated κ s using the philip dunne permeameter to the factor β is small therefore a large difference in β value is needed to correct the large variation of κ s when estimated under varying θ in in a fine soil after using the correction factor the mpdi model can yield an almost unique estimate of κ s for a given soil regardless of the value of θ in the κ s and ψ values estimated using the mpdi theory when the correction factor was used in the governing equation are also reported in table 2 results show that κ s values of every soil measured under varying θ in were relatively uniform after applying the correction factor but the ψ values still appear to be arbitrary the mean values and standard deviations of κ s are 1 95 10 2 and 5 01 10 3 cm s 3 51 10 3 and 5 51 10 4 cm s and 5 62 10 4 and 1 44 10 4 cm s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the mean κ s values increased by 20 76 but the standard deviations decreased by 24 59 in comparison to ones before applying the correction factor the coefficients of variation decreased to 26 16 and 26 for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively fig 5 shows κ s values before and after applying the correction factor with the corresponding θ in values 3 1 2 comparing the relative performance of mpdi estimates against mdi measurements the mpdi results were compared against the mdi results for the three soils measured under varying θ in and the estimated κ s values are summarized in table 3 since the κ s values estimated using both methods have not been compared against any true reference values such as falling or constant head test results we did not complete any error analysis to quantify the accuracy of the method instead the coefficient of variation was used as a metric to compare the precision variations in κ s and therefore the relative performance of the mpdi against the mdi when both methods were used under varying θ in conditions the coefficients of variation of κ s estimated using the mdi were 20 28 and 32 for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively which are similar to the coefficients of variation after applying the correction factor section 3 1 1 in the mpdi equations 3 2 assessment of modified mpdi performance using field experiments fig 6 shows the measured drawdown data which starts from h in 31 cm to h t 3 3 cm similar to the laboratory results the field measured drawdown curves are significantly different for the same soil under varying θ in the total drawdown time t 3 which was recorded at h t 3 3 cm increased with θ in the t 3 values were 3600 and 9720 s under the dry and wet conditions respectively the dry soil has θ in of 0 096 and the wet soil has θ in of 0 238 with about 21 5 and 53 2 of θ sf respectively which were similar to two laboratory tests tables 2 and 3 for the mpdi and the mdi the collected drawdown data under the dry and wet conditions and the corresponding θ in and θ sf were analyzed using the analysis procedure proposed by ahmed et al 2014 and the obtained κ s and ψ are reported in table 4 results table 4 show a similar trend to the laboratory experimental results of decreasing κ s value when the test was conducted under the relatively wet condition and the arbitrary ψ values then κ s and ψ values were estimated after applying the correction factor and the results are reported in table 4 where the s value that was used in the correction factor is equal to 21 for the silt loam soil the coefficients of variation before and after applying the correction factor were 81 and 61 respectively the coefficient of variation value of the in situ tested soil is higher than the one of the laboratory tested soil reported in section 3 1 2 this could be related to the variations in the soil heterogeneity under laboratory and in situ conditions nestingen et al 2018 the mdi was then used under in situ conditions to measure κ s on the same location under dry and wet conditions the measured κ s values were 3 59 10 3 and 3 17 10 3 cm s for the dry and wet conditions respectively these values are of the same order of magnitude as the values estimated using the mpdi under the dry condition 4 conclusions we have investigated the effects of varying soil moisture levels θ in on the drawdown data measured using the mpdi and its impacts on the estimated values of κ s and ψ laboratory experiments were conducted using three types of soil including loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam results show that the overall trend of κ s values estimated using the mpdi was decreasing with increasing the fine content however for a given soil the drawdown curve was different when we varied the value of θ in and this resulted in estimating different κ s values the lowest κ s values were observed when the mpdi was used in wet soils results from the mpdi were compared against the ones estimated using the mdi which was also used under varying θ in conditions overall the coefficients of variation in the mdi estimated values of κ s were less than the ones estimated using the mpdi we proposed a correction factor to modify the mpdi equations to account for the effects of θ in the correction factor helped obtain a unique value of κ s the correction factor accounted for variations in θ in and it also accounted for variations in soil texture when the proposed correction factor was used the coefficient of variation in the estimated values of κ s decreased from 66 61 and 59 26 16 and 26 for the three soils the effectiveness of the correction factor was also tested by collecting in situ drawdown data under dry and wet conditions at a silt loam field site the coefficient of variation of κ s for this soil decreased from 81 to 61 in all our laboratory and in situ experiments the κ s values estimated using the mpdi after applying the correction factor were of the same order of magnitude as the ones estimated using the mdi our results show that the estimated ψ values in all the experiments were rather arbitrary and they did not reflect the changes in soil texture classes and the soil moisture content and this continues to be a major shortcoming of mpdi it should be noted that the mpdi was originally developed to evaluate the surface infiltration rate of stormwater infiltration practices at sites that are designed to have relatively high κ s values we have tested the mpdi on three different soils that cover a wide range of soil textural classes used in the infiltration practices and have developed a correction factor to account for variations in soil type and initial moisture content although the correction factor yielded promising results we recommend further studies to test the performance of the mpdi with the correction factor under different types of field condition funding this work was in part supported by a nation science foundation award number 2019561 declaration of

11816,the effect of varying initial soil moisture θ in of a given soil on the drawdown curve measured using the modified philip dunne infiltrometer mpdi and consequently on the estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s value was investigated the laboratory tests completed using three different types of soil show that the drawdown curve was sensitive to θ in for all three soils this resulted in yielding κ s values that are sensitive to the values of θ in the lowest value of κ s was observed when the mpdi was used under wet conditions to obtain a consistent estimate of κ s a new correction factor was developed this factor can be multiplied with the geometrical coefficient used in the governing equations of the mpdi to make appropriate corrections after employing the correction factor the variations in κ s values for all three tested soils decreased from 66 61 and 59 to 26 16 and 26 respectively in situ experimental tests also show similar results and the coefficient of variation decreased from 81 to 61 after applying the correction factor the performance was further validated by testing the relative performance of the mpdi against the results obtained using minidisk infiltrometer mdi under varying θ in values results from the mdi show that the coefficient of variation for the κ s values of the three soils were 20 28 and 32 which are similar to the variations obtained after applying the correction factor in the mpdi model calculations the aforementioned results indicate that the correction method proposed in this study is a useful method for improving the overall performance of mpdi graphical abstract image 1 keywords infiltration modified philip dunne infiltrometer groundwater suction head initial soil moisture saturated hydraulic conductivity green ampt model 1 introduction water movement into the soil is the most important factor that affects many hydrological processes including groundwater recharge and surface water runoff liu et al 2011 schiff and dreibelbis 1949 soil properties such as the amount of fines initial moisture content θ in and saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s can greatly impact water transport rate through soil water systems the rate at which water infiltrates into an unsaturated soil varies between a maximum value when the soil is dry and to a minimum value when the soil is wet horton 1933 philip 1957 ruggenthaler et al 2016 ruggenthaler et al 2016 investigated the infiltration behavior in eight sites under dry moist and wet soil moisture conditions using the double ring infiltrometer the dry run was performed at the wilting point the moist run was performed at the field capacity the wet run used an artificial sprinkler to produce wet soil conditions results showed that the infiltration rate decreased with increasing θ in hino et al 1988 investigated the effect of θ in on the vertical movement of water through a one dimensional vertical infiltration system the system was a small cylindrical lysimeter that was supplied with artificial rainfall with two tensiometers placed at different depths results showed that as θ in increased the water movement through the soil became faster the slower movement of water in drier soil is related to the increased volume of water to fill in the voids of soil fan et al 2018 investigated the wetting front patterns of different types of soil for θ in values of 40 50 and 60 of field capacity a vertical line source moistube which contained uniformly distributed nano pores which worked as a subsurface source of water was used to introduce a constant amount of water results showed that the rate of the downward movement of the wetting front increased with the increase in θ in the acceleration of the wetting front movement with the increase in θ in is related to the reduced amount of water that is needed to fill in the voids in the soil the soil property that quantifies the ease at which water can move through the soil is the hydraulic conductivity k value mays 2010 the value of k for a given soil increase with the increase in the soil moisture content and it eventually reaches the maximum and a constant value when the soil is fully saturated this constant value is the saturated hydraulic conductivity κ s which is one of the crucial parameters that govern water transport in soil water systems under saturated conditions the soil with higher κ s can transmit water faster than the soil with lower κ s accurate measurement of κ s is important for the investigation of the hydrological processes and their relationship with groundwater recharge processes alagna et al 2016 alakayleh et al 2018 mckenzie and jacquier 1997 mohanty et al 1994 reynolds et al 2000 zhang and schaap 2019 many field and laboratory methods for measuring κ s are available however measuring κ s variations over a large field scale would require multiple tests using samples collected at many locations which could be time consuming therefore a variety of field methods have been developed to measure in situ κ s values the methods include the guelph permeameter reynolds and elrick 1986 the tension infiltrometer perroux and white 1988 the minidisk infiltrometer mdi zhang 1997 the double ring infiltrometer astm 2009 the philip dunne permeameter philip 1993 and the modified philip dunne infiltrometer mpdi ahmed et al 2014 the mpdi is a relatively simple measurement system where a tube is inserted 5 cm into the soil and then filled with water the user will measure the water drawdown data over time the soil moisture levels at the beginning i e the initial soil moisture content θ in and at the end of the test i e the final soil moisture content θ sf these values are used to determine the in situ κ s and the green ampt suction head ψ at the wetting front green and ampt 1911 previous studies have shown that under natural conditions water moves into the soil by the effect of two major forces gravity and capillary forces gray and norum 1967 the coarser the soil texture the greater the influence of the gravitational force on the contrary the finer the soil texture the stronger the capillary forces when a soil has a high moisture content value wet condition then the influence of capillary forces will decrease and the effect of gravitational force will increase fan et al 2018 gray and norum 1967 hino et al 1988 regalado et al 2005 the drawdown data collected using the mpdi under wet conditions or low suction head conditions should be carefully evaluated since the assumption that the flow is mostly driven by capillarity pressure force is no longer valid regalado et al 2005 study pointed out that when low suction head conditions or wet conditions are present near the wetting front results from the philip dunne permeameter must be analyzed with care since the predominant force transporting water will be the gravitational force alakayleh et al 2019 investigated the performance of the mpdi using a forward modeling algorithm their study showed that the κ s and ψ values estimated using the mpdi are insensitive to the soil moisture deficit δ θ θ s f θ i n assumed in the data analysis procedure ahmed et al 2014 therefore the users of mpdi can independently estimate δ θ based on the field observations consequently the estimated κ s and ψ are only sensitive to the drawdown data measured using the mpdi regalado et al 2005 found similar results and demonstrated the high level of sensitivity of κ s and ψ values estimated using the philip dunne permeameter to the measured drawdown data and relatively less sensitivity to δ θ since the drawdown curve patterns for a given soil can vary under different field conditions i e wet or dry soil one has to carefully analyze the drawdown data after considering the variations in θ in to evaluate the best estimates of κ s and ψ values while several published studies alakayleh 2019 garza et al 2017 nestingen et al 2018 have used the mpdi method and compared its performance with other techniques however none of them have tested the performance under varying θ in in this study we performed several experiments under both laboratory and field conditions using different types of soil to investigate the effects of varying θ in on the drawdown curves measured using the mpdi and its implication on estimating κ s and ψ values the soil parameter values obtained from mpdi were compared against those obtained using mdi under similar test conditions based on these experimental datasets we developed a correction factor that can be used to improve the performance of the mpdi when it is used under varying initial soil moisture conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 background the mpdi ahmed et al 2014 is a modified version of the philip dunne permeameter philip 1993 it is an efficient field technique that can be used to quickly measure the near surface soil κ s at multiple points the method involves collecting the unsteady infiltration data over a short period rather than waiting for the steady state infiltration as in the double ring infiltrometer method therefore mpdi tests are quick and they also require a minimal amount of water the original philip dunne permeameter is an open tube that is tightly inserted into a 15 cm borehole however the modified version mpdi developed by ahmed et al 2014 uses a transparent open ended tube with a radius of 5 cm which is beveled from one side for vertically inserting the tube into the soil the radius and inserting depth can be varied based on user needs water is rapidly poured into the device to an initial height h in and the height of water in the tube with time h t above the soil surface is monitored the initial and final soil moisture contents θ in and θ sf are also measured using an in situ method soil moisture probe or a laboratory method e g gravimetric measurements the data analysis method is developed based on the green ampt theory green and ampt 1911 to estimate κ s and ψ by modeling the water level variations observed inside the mpdi i e h t versus t data the green ampt model assumes a homogenous and isotropic soil profile and a uniform distribution of θ in at t 0 also the wetting front is assumed to be a sharp region with an upper zone that is fully saturated and a lower zone that is always maintained at θ in the actual disc shaped infiltration surface of the mpdi with a radius r₁ of 5 cm see fig 1 is substituted by a sphere with an equivalent surface area with a radius r 0 0 5 r ₁ the flow from the tube into the soil is assumed to be a capillarity pressure driven flow ignoring the gravity component would result in the spherically symmetrical flow system the assumed spherically symmetrical configuration is approximated to the actual three dimensional flow configuration by applying a geometrical coefficient based on exploratory calculations using conformal mapping philip 1993 see fig 1 and later ahmed et al 2014 have used a factor β π 2 8 in the governing equations used to analyze the mpdi s drawdown data equation 1 below shows the governing equation of the mpdi model as presented by ahmed et al 2014 1 δ h t k s l m a x

wetting front at time t l max is the depth of insertion of the mpdi into the soil ahmed et al 2014 used equation 1 to solve for κ s and ψ by minimizing the absolute difference between δh t determined using equation 1 and the measured change of head from the drawdown data another method for setting the optimization is to fit κ s and ψ values by minimizing the absolute difference between δt determined by rearranging equation 1 and measured time intervals data 2 2 laboratory experiments a mini mpdi with a radius of 1 27 cm a tube of 1 inch diameter that can be driven 1 27 cm into the soil was constructed and was used in our laboratory experiments the device was provided with a support base to stabilize the system fig 2 a the drawdown data for a series of experiments were measured using the mini mpdi to determine κ s and ψ values three different types of soil were used in our laboratory study for each soil several experiments were performed by changing the θ in value of the soil the three types of soil were prepared by mixing fine sand with a varying amount percent dry weights 8 15 and 30 of no 52 silcosil silt the silt was made of ground quartz purchased from the u s silica company the mastersizer 3000 made by malvern panalytical 2018 was used to determine the percentage of clay silt and sand in all three soils these percentage values were used in the textural triangle usda 2014 to determine the soil texture classes after the soil mix was prepared by mixing the fine sand with silt at a specific percentage level the mixture was packed in a testing bucket with a diameter of 29 cm and a depth of 37 cm θ in was measured gravimetrically by analyzing three soil samples taken during the packing of the middle and surface parts of the bucket where infiltration would occur the mpdi was inserted 1 27 cm into the soil near the center of the bucket water was rapidly poured to fill the mpdi to an initial height h in at time t 0 during the infiltration period the water level changes occurring inside the mpdi were recorded with time immediately after all the water has infiltrated into the soil the infiltrometer tube was removed from the bucket and soil samples were collected from the location where the tube was inserted to measure the final soil moisture content θ sf then the soil dry bulk density was measured by taking a soil core closely following the procedure described in astm f1815 11 2011 to convert the gravimetric moisture content into volumetric soil moisture content the collected data were analyzed using the procedure developed by ahmed et al 2014 to estimate κ s and ψ the soil was then removed and transferred to a bigger bucket and was mixed with additional water to obtain a higher θ in the soil was then repacked into the original test bucket using the same packing procedure to maintain a similar dry bulk density value the mpdi testing procedure was repeated to conduct the drawdown experiments under different wetter θ in fig 2 shows the mini mpdi and the experimental testing setup that were used in this study the mini mpdi was used in the laboratory since the soil is more homogenous than in the field where a standard mpdi with a radius of 5 cm was used water infiltrated from the standard mpdi can cover a volume of soil greater than the one that the mini mpdi would cover note a larger well representative sample volume is required to test a heterogeneous field system however a relatively smaller volume is sufficient for testing a homogenous experimental system for comparison a mdi made by meter group inc 2018 was used to estimate the value of κ s of the three soils that were tested using the mini mpdi the same packing and mixing procedures that were used for the mpdi were also used for mdi experiments the minidisk device is a transparent tube with a radius of 1 55 cm that is divided into two chambers the lower chamber contains a water volume of about 90 cm3 that is allowed to infiltrate into the soil the upper chamber controlled the suction and therefore the water infiltration rate a stainless steel porous disk is attached to the bottom of the infiltrometer to prevent water from leaking in the open air after both chambers were filled with water the suction was set to 6 cm and the bottom of the infiltrometer was placed on the soil and then water started to infiltrate into the soil during infiltration the volume of water inside the infiltrometer was recorded at regular time intervals then the volume of cumulative water infiltrated with time was calculated the test was repeated for different θ in for all the soils the procedures for data collection and analysis were performed following the methods described in meter group inc 2018 the user manual meter group inc 2018 includes a basic microsoft excel spreadsheet that was utilized in this study to calculate the κ value based on equations 2 4 described below the measured cumulative infiltration data from mdi were analyzed using the analysis procedure proposed by zhang 1997 to estimate k the cumulative infiltration data and the square root of time are fitted with the following equation philip 1957 2 i c 1 t 0 5 c 2 t where i is the cumulative infiltration t is time c 1 and c 2 are parameters related to the sorptivity and k respectively then the k value of the soil is calculated using the equation 3 k c 2 a 2 where a 2 is a dimensionless coefficient that can be obtained using the equation 4 a 2 11 65 n 0 1 1 e x p c n 1 9 α h α r 0 0 91 c 2 92 i f n 1 9 c 7 5 i f n 1 9 where n and α are the van genuchten moisture retention parameters for the soil r 0 is the radius of the infiltration disk h is the suction at the soil surface and c is constant as the suction applied at the soil surface resulted in near saturated hydraulic conductivity kargas et al 2017 radinja et al 2019 the following equation was used to estimate κ s gardner 1958 5 k s k e x p α g h where α g is the gardner parameter reported in létourneau and caron 2019 2 3 field experiments a standard mpdi with a radius of 5 cm that can be driven up to 5 cm into the soil was used to estimate the in situ κ s and ψ values of a silt loam soil the site is an agriculture field located in auburn alabama usa data were collected in situ for the water level drop observed inside the tube at various times the values of initial and final gravimetric soil moisture contents and soil dry bulk density were also estimated the drawdown data were collected at the same location using the mpdi for the same soil under both dry and wet conditions data for the dry condition were collected after several sunny days and data for wet conditions were collected after a rainy day the mdi was also used to estimate the in situ κ s at the same location where the mpdi was used the mdi s suction head was set to 5 cm for both dry and wet field conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory experiments the percentages of clay silt and sand measured using the mastersizer 3000 analysis for the sand mixes with 8 15 and 30 silt are presented in table 1 using these data the three soils were classified as loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively fig 3 shows the drawdown data points symbols measured using the mini mpdi for the three soils under varying θ in versus the simulated drawdown curves lines using the modified philip dunne theory proposed by ahmed et al 2014 the simulated drawdown curves fit the measured drawdown data well with r 2 values very close to 1 the drawdown curves start from the initial water height h in to the lowest height h t 2 cm that can be read in the device the support base of the mini mpdi would not allow us to read the depths close to a completely empty tube the h in values were 32 30 and 29 5 cm for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively results show that the total drawdown time t 2 which was recorded when h t 2 cm varied with the soil type for example under dry conditions where θ i n was maintained at 0 001 0 002 and 0 001 for the three soils t 2 values were 78 492 and 2652 s for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively our results show that the measured drawdown curves are significantly different for the same soil under varying θ i n for every soil the t 2 values are greater under wet than dry conditions the t 2 values under wet conditions fig 3 were 465 2722 and 12118 s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the corresponding t 2 values under dry conditions were 78 492 and 2652 s the wet conditions had an initial water content of 0 138 0 143 and 0 144 which are 68 62 and 58 of the final measured water content of 0 204 0 230 and 0 250 for the three soils the three soils were not able to hold additional water after reaching these final measured water content levels therefore very high θ i n values were not tested in this study ahmed et al 2014 performed the field infiltration measurements in grassed roadside drainage ditches using their mpdis at 32 sites and had θ i n with the percent of saturation ranging from 7 7 to 90 7 54 2 18 2 and 90 6 sites with the percent initial saturation 30 the aforementioned results indicated that the rate of water infiltration into dry soil can be higher than in wet soil which is similar to the observations made by others including gray and norum 1967 philip 1957a b ruggenthaler et al 2016 this is because there are more voids in dry soil that allow water to fill relatively fast but wet soil has much fewer voids to allow water to fill and therefore takes more time for the water to infiltrate the collected drawdown data for the three soils under varying θ i n and the corresponding θ i n and θ s f were analyzed using the procedure proposed by ahmed et al 2014 and the estimated κ s and ψ are reported in table 2 table 2 shows that the overall trend of κ s values estimated using the mpdi was decreasing with increasing the fine content which is as expected this trend was also observed by nestingen et al 2018 for the κ s values estimated using the mpdi for three types of sand with different grain size distributions the mpdi data did not provide a unique value for κ s when measured under varying θ i n conditions however in reality κ s should remain the same for a given soil whatever the value of θ i n at the time of performing the test this difference in κ s is caused by the difference in measured drawdown curve as the κ s value estimated using the mpdi theory is highly sensitive to the drawdown curve and less sensitive to δ θ therefore the estimated κ s values of every soil table 2 varied with θ i n the mean values and standard deviations of κ s are 1 63 10 2 and 1 08 10 2 cm s 2 20 10 3 and 1 34 10 3 cm s and 3 23 10 4 and 1 90 10 4 cm s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the coefficients of variation of κ s for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam were 66 61 and 59 respectively the lowest κ s value of every soil was observed when the mpdi was used under wet conditions note that the flow of water from the mpdi into the soil is assumed to be primarily driven by capillarity pressure force after ignoring the gravity effects previous studies have shown that the higher the θ in the lower the effect of the capillary force and the greater the effect of gravity force hino et al 1988 that means an underestimation of κ s is the consequence of neglecting the effects of the gravity force as the water infiltrated from mpdi is transported through the soil the estimated ψ values see table 2 were arbitrary and did not reflect the changes in the soil texture class and θ in this is similar to the results from alakayleh et al 2019 who concluded that the mpdi is not a robust method to estimate ψ values 3 1 1 development of a correction factor to estimate a unique value for κ s it is desirable to somehow account for the effect of θ in in the mpdi model to provide a better estimate of κ s and possibly correct ψ values that reflect the variation in θ in of a given soil we hypothesized that the constant coefficient β used in the mpdi governing equations should be allowed to vary with the soil texture class and also with the variation in θ in values to accomplish this we proposed a correction factor θ i n θ s f s that can be multiplied by β π 2 8 to get the modified geometrical coefficient β m π 2 8 θ i n θ s f s then the corrected value β m can be used in equation 1 rather than using β in the correction factor s is an empirical constant that will vary with the soil textural class and it appears to be correlated to the value of the bubbling pressure the estimated s values are 9 15 and 21 for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively which are linearly correlated with the bubbling pressure values reported in rawls et al 1982 the proposed correction in the geometrical coefficient β reflects the changes in the actual three dimensional flow configuration of a given soil for varying θ in fig 4 shows the geometrical analog of the mpdi for a given soil considering varying θ in this figure shows the shape of the wetting fronts when the gravity effects are ignored the right side of the figure and when the gravity is taken into account the left side of the figure for a given value of θ in note that the water head drop δ h h i n h t is maintained the same previous studies have shown that the wetting front could advance to a deeper depth with the increase in θ in also the finer the soil texture is the greater the effect of θ in fan et al 2018 hino et al 1988 the correction factor see table 2 varies with θ in for the same soil texture class since θ sf and s remain the same and is much greater for the wet condition than for dry condition to account for the effect of θ in within a given soil for example when the θ in value of the loamy sand table 2 is changed from 0 12 to 13 8 a 115 times increase the correction factor has the same level of increase also the correction factor varies with the soil texture class because of the change in θ sf and s the correction factor increases with the increase in the fine content of the soil this will account for the greater effect of θ in on the drawdown data of fine soil than coarse soil for example when θ in is the same for the three soil θ i n 0 09 the correction factor equals 3 8 5 7 and 7 8 for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively note that regalado et al 2005 have shown that the sensitivity of estimated κ s using the philip dunne permeameter to the factor β is small therefore a large difference in β value is needed to correct the large variation of κ s when estimated under varying θ in in a fine soil after using the correction factor the mpdi model can yield an almost unique estimate of κ s for a given soil regardless of the value of θ in the κ s and ψ values estimated using the mpdi theory when the correction factor was used in the governing equation are also reported in table 2 results show that κ s values of every soil measured under varying θ in were relatively uniform after applying the correction factor but the ψ values still appear to be arbitrary the mean values and standard deviations of κ s are 1 95 10 2 and 5 01 10 3 cm s 3 51 10 3 and 5 51 10 4 cm s and 5 62 10 4 and 1 44 10 4 cm s for loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively the mean κ s values increased by 20 76 but the standard deviations decreased by 24 59 in comparison to ones before applying the correction factor the coefficients of variation decreased to 26 16 and 26 for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively fig 5 shows κ s values before and after applying the correction factor with the corresponding θ in values 3 1 2 comparing the relative performance of mpdi estimates against mdi measurements the mpdi results were compared against the mdi results for the three soils measured under varying θ in and the estimated κ s values are summarized in table 3 since the κ s values estimated using both methods have not been compared against any true reference values such as falling or constant head test results we did not complete any error analysis to quantify the accuracy of the method instead the coefficient of variation was used as a metric to compare the precision variations in κ s and therefore the relative performance of the mpdi against the mdi when both methods were used under varying θ in conditions the coefficients of variation of κ s estimated using the mdi were 20 28 and 32 for the loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam respectively which are similar to the coefficients of variation after applying the correction factor section 3 1 1 in the mpdi equations 3 2 assessment of modified mpdi performance using field experiments fig 6 shows the measured drawdown data which starts from h in 31 cm to h t 3 3 cm similar to the laboratory results the field measured drawdown curves are significantly different for the same soil under varying θ in the total drawdown time t 3 which was recorded at h t 3 3 cm increased with θ in the t 3 values were 3600 and 9720 s under the dry and wet conditions respectively the dry soil has θ in of 0 096 and the wet soil has θ in of 0 238 with about 21 5 and 53 2 of θ sf respectively which were similar to two laboratory tests tables 2 and 3 for the mpdi and the mdi the collected drawdown data under the dry and wet conditions and the corresponding θ in and θ sf were analyzed using the analysis procedure proposed by ahmed et al 2014 and the obtained κ s and ψ are reported in table 4 results table 4 show a similar trend to the laboratory experimental results of decreasing κ s value when the test was conducted under the relatively wet condition and the arbitrary ψ values then κ s and ψ values were estimated after applying the correction factor and the results are reported in table 4 where the s value that was used in the correction factor is equal to 21 for the silt loam soil the coefficients of variation before and after applying the correction factor were 81 and 61 respectively the coefficient of variation value of the in situ tested soil is higher than the one of the laboratory tested soil reported in section 3 1 2 this could be related to the variations in the soil heterogeneity under laboratory and in situ conditions nestingen et al 2018 the mdi was then used under in situ conditions to measure κ s on the same location under dry and wet conditions the measured κ s values were 3 59 10 3 and 3 17 10 3 cm s for the dry and wet conditions respectively these values are of the same order of magnitude as the values estimated using the mpdi under the dry condition 4 conclusions we have investigated the effects of varying soil moisture levels θ in on the drawdown data measured using the mpdi and its impacts on the estimated values of κ s and ψ laboratory experiments were conducted using three types of soil including loamy sand sandy loam and silt loam results show that the overall trend of κ s values estimated using the mpdi was decreasing with increasing the fine content however for a given soil the drawdown curve was different when we varied the value of θ in and this resulted in estimating different κ s values the lowest κ s values were observed when the mpdi was used in wet soils results from the mpdi were compared against the ones estimated using the mdi which was also used under varying θ in conditions overall the coefficients of variation in the mdi estimated values of κ s were less than the ones estimated using the mpdi we proposed a correction factor to modify the mpdi equations to account for the effects of θ in the correction factor helped obtain a unique value of κ s the correction factor accounted for variations in θ in and it also accounted for variations in soil texture when the proposed correction factor was used the coefficient of variation in the estimated values of κ s decreased from 66 61 and 59 26 16 and 26 for the three soils the effectiveness of the correction factor was also tested by collecting in situ drawdown data under dry and wet conditions at a silt loam field site the coefficient of variation of κ s for this soil decreased from 81 to 61 in all our laboratory and in situ experiments the κ s values estimated using the mpdi after applying the correction factor were of the same order of magnitude as the ones estimated using the mdi our results show that the estimated ψ values in all the experiments were rather arbitrary and they did not reflect the changes in soil texture classes and the soil moisture content and this continues to be a major shortcoming of mpdi it should be noted that the mpdi was originally developed to evaluate the surface infiltration rate of stormwater infiltration practices at sites that are designed to have relatively high κ s values we have tested the mpdi on three different soils that cover a wide range of soil textural classes used in the infiltration practices and have developed a correction factor to account for variations in soil type and initial moisture content although the correction factor yielded promising results we recommend further studies to test the performance of the mpdi with the correction factor under different types of field condition funding this work was in part supported by a nation science foundation award number 2019561 declaration of

drinking groundwater quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fuzzy logic takagi sugeno artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference abbreviations ann artificial neural network anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system 1 introduction in every country of this world the modelling of groundwater quality is essential for sustainable development in many parts of india people have no other option but to drink impure water which affects human health this problem becomes crucial in the areas which are in the development phase as urban development focuses on expansion rather that the effective use of natural resources further dense population cities and industrial areas need more water to fulfil their water requirement in the indian subcontinent a developing country the pollution in groundwater is increasing day by day due to the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture the concentration of nitrate no 3 in groundwater has been increased in western u p haryana west bengal rajasthan punjab and delhi malve and dhage 1996 many cases of fluorosis disease have been found in manipur orissa andhra pradesh bihar gujarat haryana karnataka kerala rajasthan maharashtra punjab delhi madhya pradesh jammu kashmir tamil nadu and uttar pradesh mariappan et al 2000 the primary source of groundwater pollution is human activities rather than environment changes along with this industries are the major source of pollution for example waste generated during the cleaner process algieri et al 2021 the groundwater quality assessment is extremely nonlinear stochastic and complex groundwater quality is a measurement which depends on many aspects such as quality parameter the environment of the aquifer and chemical reaction between groundwater and its surrounding the groundwater assessment methods can be classified into three group viz overlay and index methods process based simulation methods and statistical methods overlay and index methods based on superposing a series of maps are most popular and easy to use for the groundwater vulnerability assessment it depends on analyses of the maps using qualitative and quantitative data zekter et al 1995 the examples of these methods are drastic and goldberg methods process based simulation methods are based on mass transport models and are used to find the intrinsic vulnerability of an aquifer by one or more pollutants gurdak 2008 statistical methods can be used for categorizing groundwater regions based on some criteria and for accessing groundwater quality using some probability models gurdak 2008 such as principal component tri linear cluster analysis etc the biggest problem of these methods is their failure to handle the complexity associated with groundwater quality assessment the complexity is directly propositional to the number of parameters period and geological area of the problem under consideration for example the output of overlay and index methods is a complex map which in turn is difficult to understand furthermore in these methods the rating is always doubtful as it is either logical or comparative process based simulation methods deal with arithmetical and theoretical argumentation the results of these methods are good for a small geographic area another issue with these models is data collection which may result in origin of the error generally assumptions considered in these models are not realistic the assumptions such as on a land surface amount of pesticides is equal pesticide flux is fixed everywhere and dispersal of pesticide is insignificant as practically such situations are not realistic in every case such assumptions are hard to maintain in a laboratory and are not practical in real life along with this some other environment factors petrosino et al 2020 petrosino et al 2021 may also plays an important role in final groundwater quality assessment in recent years soft computing methods have attained proper recognition in groundwater quality assessment the applications of the soft computing methods have been used in ai based optimization of industrial membrane processes gaudio et al 2021 evolving genetic

crisp input data and second in anfis and shows the novelty of proposed research work 2 study area haridwar is one of the holy places in uttrakhand india with a population of 1 927 029 as per indian

of human health along with this recently industrial activities in the study area have been increased which may contaminate the groundwater therefore the study area need to be analysed in terms of quality of drinking groundwater 3 materials and methods in this study 454 samples of groundwater quality data has been collected from uttrakhand jal sansthan haridwar uttrakhand to give precise groundwater quality result the data has been collected from year 2015 2018 all parameters were analysed as per the guidelines prescribed by bureau of indian standard bis bureau of indian standard 1990

roshnabad sarai shivalik nagar and sitapur area of haridwar district the groundwater parameters viz calcium ca fluoride f magnesium mg sulphate so 4 2 and nitrate no 3 were used to analyse groundwater quality using matlab r2019b the basic statistics of selected parameters have been shown in table 1 3 1 fuzzy logic in groundwater quality assessment nowadays human knowledge and experience become gradually important since the traditional models are limited in their capability to observe the world and to do reasoning these models are challenged by uncertainty which occurs due to lack of information and inaccuracy of measurements the groundwater assessment process always consists ambiguity this ambiguity may be a result of wrong interpretation of the inputs the other need in groundwater assessment is natural language used for describing the groundwater quality results the natural language is vague in nature such as pure not good good excellent etc which in turn do not have crisp boundaries because they may be true in some cases and false in other cases these ideas can be called fuzzy or vague concepts it is important to perceive that there is a link between fuzziness and complexity both are proportional to each other as the complexity of a problem increases it tends to be fuzzy fuzzy logic means estimated reasoning possibility information granulation computing with words etc fuzzy logic provides a way to do the human reasoning capabilities and for converting linguistic variables into control activities which results in a high level computation lotfi a zadeh a system scientist and mathematician introduced fuzzy logic in 1965 as a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty zadeh 1965 the constituents of a fuzzy model have been shown in fig 1 fuzzification is a way or process by which crisp values are transformed into linguistic terms fuzzy values and characterized by the appropriate membership functions fuzzy values are related to the uncertainties exist in the crisp values for example the limits of calcium in drinking groundwater are from 75 mg l to 200 mg l for this the classes for i p may be low average and high here the range of low average and high can be set as low ranges between 0 and 100 average ranges between 50 and 230 and high ranges more than 180 fuzzy sets offer a way to handle the uncertainty associated with vagueness imprecision and lack of information sivanandam et al 2007 it is a collection of linguistic terms or variables for example high low average etc which represents the fuzziness prevailing in the system a fuzzy rule consists of if then rule based system fuzzy rule base is a collection of inference rules used in a fuzzy system to conclude an output on the basis of input fuzzy values the basic structure of a fuzzy rule is shown below premise x is a implication if x is a then y is b consequent y is b in classical logic the evidence x is a can only be true or false however in a fuzzy inference the evidence x is a and the resulting y is b can be true to a degree between 0 and 1 where 0 is false and 1 is true for a system fuzzy output may not be used in real world applications so a conversion from fuzzy value to single crisp value is needed defuzzification or rounding off is a method to change fuzzy output into crisp values for defuzzification seven methods can be used sivanandam et al 2007 these are given below 1 max membership principle 2 centroid 3 weighted average 4 mean max membership 5 centre of sums 6 centre of largest area 7 first of maxima or last of maxima 3 2 ann ann a nonlinear data modelling tool is an information processing network which is inspired by the working of a biological neural network giwa et al 2020 gaudio et al 2021 paola et al 2021 as a biological neural network is composed of neurons an ann is a collection of highly interconnected nodes called neurons in ann node unit cell neurode connection link edge connection strength weight and node output are same as neuron synapse synaptic efficiency and firing frequency respectively in a biological neural network a neuron receives input data from environment or from an internal node accomplish operations on the data and produces the output a neuron is said to be fired when its net output exceeds a certain threshold the output of each neuron is calculated by certain nonlinear function each input of ann is multiplied by a weight which indicates the strength of a particular neuron the efficiency of a particular input is based on its weights higher the weight high impact on ann an activation function intended to learn receives the sum of the product of each input and weight and produces the result for a flexible model and to meet with real world problems a bias value is added with the output this output is passed to next layer as an input wagh et al 2017 there are different types of activation functions such as threshold sigmoid hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units basically there are seven major constituents of an artificial neuron viz weighting factors summation function transfer function scaling output function error function and learning function 3 2 1 weighting factors a neuron receives many simultaneous inputs and every input has a relative weight the weight same as synaptic strengths of a biological neurons represents the strength of respective input weights the adaptive coefficients can be modified as per training sets learning rules or on the basis of network s precise topology 3 2 2 summation function in ann the inputs i1 i2 in and the respective weights w1 w2 wn are represented as vectors and the effective input is the product of these two vectors this simplistic summation function performs the multiplication of these two vectors and then adds all the products the summation function may be more complex for example it can select the minimum maximum majority product or several normalizing algorithms before passing result to the transfer function summation functions can apply an additional process on the result called the activation function the activation function is used to vary the output with respect to time 3 2 3 transfer function the transfer function compares the sum of the input and weight vectors with a threshold value to define the output of a neuron neuron generates a signal if the sum is greater than the threshold value otherwise no signal or an inhibitory signal is produced scaling and limiting the output of transfer function can be scaled to an upper or lower bound by multiplying the output with a scale factor and then by adding an offset value limiting is used to insure that the scaled result does not exceed an upper or lower bound 3 2 4 output function normally the output of a neuron is same as the output of transfer function but in some anns neurons may compete with each other for constraining low strength neurons this helps in determining which neuron is providing an output and incorporates in the learning 3 2 5 error function the error function calculates the difference between the current output and the desired output and transforms the error as per underlying problem this error is circulated backwards back propagated value to a previous layer to modify them before the next learning cycle 3 2 6 learning function the purpose of the learning function also called adaption function modifies the weight vectors as per adopted algorithm learning may be supervised or unsupervised in supervised learning there is a training data set or an observer checks the learning process in the absence of training data set or observer the network learns itself by some internal standards designed into the ann 3 3 anfis in data modelling a hybrid system is the best solutions for learning and reasoning in an uncertain and imprecise environment ozgur et al 2018 hybridization is achieved by combining two or more intelligent systems to mitigate limitations of an individual system in anns a real word problem should be converted into numerical before being input to an ann model some real world problems need linguistic terms to be solved by some system this is the point where fuzzy logic can play its important role such a hybrid system a more effective model can be used in the hydrological problems shwetank and chaudhary 2019 anfis was proposed by jang jang 1993 which uses a takagi sugeno kang tsk inference system to generate the if then rule a basic anfis architecture has five layers fig 2 for better understanding let a fuzzy inference system has only two inputs x and y two fuzzy rules r1 and r2 and one output z r1 if x is a1 and y is b1 then f1 p1x q1y r1 r2 if x is a2 and y is b2 then f2 p2x q2y r2 layer 1 in this layer using appropriate membership function fuzzification of inputs has been done at this stage each node can be represented by a node function 1 o i 1 μ a i x where x is the input at ith node and ai is the linguistic variable oi the membership function of ai specifies the degree to which the input x fulfils the quantifier ai layer 2 this layer may be called as firing layer it represents the antecedent part of a fuzzy rule at this stage every node multiplies the input signals and passes the resultant product to the node of next layer for example 2 w i μ a i x μ a i x for i 1 2 where w is the firing strength of a rule at ith node layer 3 the outputs of this stage are normalized firing strengths at this stage every node calculates the firing strength of ith rule using the formula 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 this layer may be called as normalization layer in which the defuzzification process has been carried out to produce the finest matching between input and output the process of this layer can be represented by the following formula 4 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r where w i is the output of previous and p i q i and r are the consequent parameters layer 5 this is output layer and the overall output is the summation of all incoming signals and can be represented by the formula 5 o i 5 w i f i i w i f i i w i during the training of anfis shape of membership is changed for better adaption i e to produce better matching between input and output 4 model development anfis has been recognised as a modelling tool for solving nonlinear and complex systems ann a black box method has the capability to learn and model complex and nonlinear relationship between input and output the fuzzy inference system can handle uncertainty which involves in real world problem using if then rule base anfis assimilates the benefits of ann and fis models on a single platform therefore anfis provides high level reasoning using fuzzy model and learning using ann the best anfis model can be achieved by selecting

drinking groundwater quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater fuzzy logic takagi sugeno artificial neural network adaptive neuro fuzzy inference abbreviations ann artificial neural network anfis adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system 1 introduction in every country of this world the modelling of groundwater quality is essential for sustainable development in many parts of india people have no other option but to drink impure water which affects human health this problem becomes crucial in the areas which are in the development phase as urban development focuses on expansion rather that the effective use of natural resources further dense population cities and industrial areas need more water to fulfil their water requirement in the indian subcontinent a developing country the pollution in groundwater is increasing day by day due to the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture the concentration of nitrate no 3 in groundwater has been increased in western u p haryana west bengal rajasthan punjab and delhi malve and dhage 1996 many cases of fluorosis disease have been found in manipur orissa andhra pradesh bihar gujarat haryana karnataka kerala rajasthan maharashtra punjab delhi madhya pradesh jammu kashmir tamil nadu and uttar pradesh mariappan et al 2000 the primary source of groundwater pollution is human activities rather than environment changes along with this industries are the major source of pollution for example waste generated during the cleaner process algieri et al 2021 the groundwater quality assessment is extremely nonlinear stochastic and complex groundwater quality is a measurement which depends on many aspects such as quality parameter the environment of the aquifer and chemical reaction between groundwater and its surrounding the groundwater assessment methods can be classified into three group viz overlay and index methods process based simulation methods and statistical methods overlay and index methods based on superposing a series of maps are most popular and easy to use for the groundwater vulnerability assessment it depends on analyses of the maps using qualitative and quantitative data zekter et al 1995 the examples of these methods are drastic and goldberg methods process based simulation methods are based on mass transport models and are used to find the intrinsic vulnerability of an aquifer by one or more pollutants gurdak 2008 statistical methods can be used for categorizing groundwater regions based on some criteria and for accessing groundwater quality using some probability models gurdak 2008 such as principal component tri linear cluster analysis etc the biggest problem of these methods is their failure to handle the complexity associated with groundwater quality assessment the complexity is directly propositional to the number of parameters period and geological area of the problem under consideration for example the output of overlay and index methods is a complex map which in turn is difficult to understand furthermore in these methods the rating is always doubtful as it is either logical or comparative process based simulation methods deal with arithmetical and theoretical argumentation the results of these methods are good for a small geographic area another issue with these models is data collection which may result in origin of the error generally assumptions considered in these models are not realistic the assumptions such as on a land surface amount of pesticides is equal pesticide flux is fixed everywhere and dispersal of pesticide is insignificant as practically such situations are not realistic in every case such assumptions are hard to maintain in a laboratory and are not practical in real life along with this some other environment factors petrosino et al 2020 petrosino et al 2021 may also plays an important role in final groundwater quality assessment in recent years soft computing methods have attained proper recognition in groundwater quality assessment the applications of the soft computing methods have been used in ai based optimization of industrial membrane processes gaudio et al 2021 evolving genetic

aims to show the applicability of hybridization of fuzzy logic and anfis for groundwater quality assessment for drinking purpose this research work has applied fis at two steps first to fuzzify the crisp input data and second in anfis and shows the novelty of proposed research work 2 study area haridwar is one of the holy places in uttrakhand india with a population of 1 927 029 as per indian census 2011 it is located at the lowermost hills of shivalik range foothills on 77 43 to 78 22 east longitude and 29 35 to 30040 north latitude and falls in survey of india degree sheet nos 53 j f g and k haridwar district came into existence on 28 12 1988 as part of saharanpur central commissionary on 24 september 1998 uttar pradesh judicial assembly approved the uttar pradesh reorganisation bill 1998 finally the parliament also approved the indian federal legislation uttar pradesh reorganisation act 2000 and thus on 9 november 2000 haridwar became part of the newly formed uttarakhand the district is subdivided into three tehsils i e haridwar laksar and roorkee with six development blocks i e bhagwanpur narsan narsan roorkee bahadrabad laksar and khanpur haridwar is one of the first towns where the holy river ganga touches the planes as at haridwar uttrakhand india people came from all over the world it become crucial to analyse the drinking groundwater so maintain the wellbeing of human health along with this recently industrial activities in the study area have been increased which may contaminate the groundwater therefore the study area need to be analysed in terms of quality of drinking groundwater 3 materials and methods in this study 454 samples of groundwater quality data has been collected from uttrakhand jal sansthan haridwar uttrakhand to give precise groundwater quality result the data has been collected from year 2015 2018 all parameters were analysed as per the guidelines prescribed by bureau of indian standard bis bureau of indian standard 1990 by uttrakhand jal sansthan this included sample form baugla bhadarpur jat bhadrabad bhagwanpur bhangeri haridwar city jamalpur kala kaitwada laldhang mithi beri mohammadpur narsan rasoolpur roorkee roshnabad sarai shivalik nagar and sitapur area of haridwar district the groundwater parameters viz calcium ca fluoride f magnesium mg sulphate so 4 2 and nitrate no 3 were used to analyse groundwater quality using matlab r2019b the basic statistics of selected parameters have been shown in table 1 3 1 fuzzy logic in groundwater quality assessment nowadays human knowledge and experience become gradually important since the traditional models are limited in their capability to observe the world and to do reasoning these models are challenged by uncertainty which occurs due to lack of information and inaccuracy of measurements the groundwater assessment process always consists ambiguity this ambiguity may be a result of wrong interpretation of the inputs the other need in groundwater assessment is natural language used for describing the groundwater quality results the natural language is vague in nature such as pure not good good excellent etc which in turn do not have crisp boundaries because they may be true in some cases and false in other cases these ideas can be called fuzzy or vague concepts it is important to perceive that there is a link between fuzziness and complexity both are proportional to each other as the complexity of a problem increases it tends to be fuzzy fuzzy logic means estimated reasoning possibility information granulation computing with words etc fuzzy logic provides a way to do the human reasoning capabilities and for converting linguistic variables into control activities which results in a high level computation lotfi a zadeh a system scientist and mathematician introduced fuzzy logic in 1965 as a mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty zadeh 1965 the constituents of a fuzzy model have been shown in fig 1 fuzzification is a way or process by which crisp values are transformed into linguistic terms fuzzy values and characterized by the appropriate membership functions fuzzy values are related to the uncertainties exist in the crisp values for example the limits of calcium in drinking groundwater are from 75 mg l to 200 mg l for this the classes for i p may be low average and high here the range of low average and high can be set as low ranges between 0 and 100 average ranges between 50 and 230 and high ranges more than 180 fuzzy sets offer a way to handle the uncertainty associated with vagueness imprecision and lack of information sivanandam et al 2007 it is a collection of linguistic terms or variables for example high low average etc which represents the fuzziness prevailing in the system a fuzzy rule consists of if then rule based system fuzzy rule base is a collection of inference rules used in a fuzzy system to conclude an output on the basis of input fuzzy values the basic structure of a fuzzy rule is shown below premise x is a implication if x is a then y is b consequent y is b in classical logic the evidence x is a can only be true or false however in a fuzzy inference the evidence x is a and the resulting y is b can be true to a degree between 0 and 1 where 0 is false and 1 is true for a system fuzzy output may not be used in real world applications so a conversion from fuzzy value to single crisp value is needed defuzzification or rounding off is a method to change fuzzy output into crisp values for defuzzification seven methods can be used sivanandam et al 2007 these are given below 1 max membership principle 2 centroid 3 weighted average 4 mean max membership 5 centre of sums 6 centre of largest area 7 first of maxima or last of maxima 3 2 ann ann a nonlinear data modelling tool is an information processing network which is inspired by the working of a biological neural network giwa et al 2020 gaudio et al 2021 paola et al 2021 as a biological neural network is composed of neurons an ann is a collection of highly interconnected nodes called neurons in ann node unit cell neurode connection link edge connection strength weight and node output are same as neuron synapse synaptic efficiency and firing frequency respectively in a biological neural network a neuron receives input data from environment or from an internal node accomplish operations on the data and produces the output a neuron is said to be fired when its net output exceeds a certain threshold the output of each neuron is calculated by certain nonlinear function each input of ann is multiplied by a weight which indicates the strength of a particular neuron the efficiency of a particular input is based on its weights higher the weight high impact on ann an activation function intended to learn receives the sum of the product of each input and weight and produces the result for a flexible model and to meet with real world problems a bias value is added with the output this output is passed to next layer as an input wagh et al 2017 there are different types of activation functions such as threshold sigmoid hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units basically there are seven major constituents of an artificial neuron viz weighting factors summation function transfer function scaling output function error function and learning function 3 2 1 weighting factors a neuron receives many simultaneous inputs and every input has a relative weight the weight same as synaptic strengths of a biological neurons represents the strength of respective input weights the adaptive coefficients can be modified as per training sets learning rules or on the basis of network s precise topology 3 2 2 summation function in ann the inputs i1 i2 in and the respective weights w1 w2 wn are represented as vectors and the effective input is the product of these two vectors this simplistic summation function performs the multiplication of these two vectors and then adds all the products the summation function may be more complex for example it can select the minimum maximum majority product or several normalizing algorithms before passing result to the transfer function summation functions can apply an additional process on the result called the activation function the activation function is used to vary the output with respect to time 3 2 3 transfer function the transfer function compares the sum of the input and weight vectors with a threshold value to define the output of a neuron neuron generates a signal if the sum is greater than the threshold value otherwise no signal or an inhibitory signal is produced scaling and limiting the output of transfer function can be scaled to an upper or lower bound by multiplying the output with a scale factor and then by adding an offset value limiting is used to insure that the scaled result does not exceed an upper or lower bound 3 2 4 output function normally the output of a neuron is same as the output of transfer function but in some anns neurons may compete with each other for constraining low strength neurons this helps in determining which neuron is providing an output and incorporates in the learning 3 2 5 error function the error function calculates the difference between the current output and the desired output and transforms the error as per underlying problem this error is circulated backwards back propagated value to a previous layer to modify them before the next learning cycle 3 2 6 learning function the purpose of the learning function also called adaption function modifies the weight vectors as per adopted algorithm learning may be supervised or unsupervised in supervised learning there is a training data set or an observer checks the learning process in the absence of training data set or observer the network learns itself by some internal standards designed into the ann 3 3 anfis in data modelling a hybrid system is the best solutions for learning and reasoning in an uncertain and imprecise environment ozgur et al 2018 hybridization is achieved by combining two or more intelligent systems to mitigate limitations of an individual system in anns a real word problem should be converted into numerical before being input to an ann model some real world problems need linguistic terms to be solved by some system this is the point where fuzzy logic can play its important role such a hybrid system a more effective model can be used in the hydrological problems shwetank and chaudhary 2019 anfis was proposed by jang jang 1993 which uses a takagi sugeno kang tsk inference system to generate the if then rule a basic anfis architecture has five layers fig 2 for better understanding let a fuzzy inference system has only two inputs x and y two fuzzy rules r1 and r2 and one output z r1 if x is a1 and y is b1 then f1 p1x q1y r1 r2 if x is a2 and y is b2 then f2 p2x q2y r2 layer 1 in this layer using appropriate membership function fuzzification of inputs has been done at this stage each node can be represented by a node function 1 o i 1 μ a i x where x is the input at ith node and ai is the linguistic variable oi the membership function of ai specifies the degree to which the input x fulfils the quantifier ai layer 2 this layer may be called as firing layer it represents the antecedent part of a fuzzy rule at this stage every node multiplies the input signals and passes the resultant product to the node of next layer for example 2 w i μ a i x μ a i x for i 1 2 where w is the firing strength of a rule at ith node layer 3 the outputs of this stage are normalized firing strengths at this stage every node calculates the firing strength of ith rule using the formula 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 i 1 2 layer 4 this layer may be called as normalization layer in which the defuzzification process has been carried out to produce the finest matching between input and output the process of this layer can be represented by the following formula 4 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r where w i is the output of previous and p i q i and r are the consequent parameters layer 5 this is output layer and the overall output is the summation of all incoming signals and can be represented by the formula 5 o i 5 w i f i i w i f i i w i during the training of anfis shape of membership is changed for better adaption i e to produce better matching between input and output 4 model development anfis has been recognised as a modelling tool for solving nonlinear and complex systems ann a black box method has the capability to learn and model complex and nonlinear relationship between input and output the fuzzy inference system can handle uncertainty which involves in real world problem using if then rule base anfis assimilates the benefits of ann and fis models on a single platform therefore anfis provides high level reasoning using fuzzy model and learning using ann the best anfis model can be achieved by selecting appropriate number of membership function fuzzification functions the type of output function the optimization algorithm training algorithm and the number of epochs this study is based on adaptive

kendal trend test and sen s slope estimation to investigate the direction of the trends and their changes we use pearson correlation to assess the association between socio economic development and groundwater withdrawals institutional and retrospective policy analyses were applied to analyze the institutional arrangements and the policy changes over time the findings show the rapid socio economic development and climate trends accelerate the groundwater extraction as well as groundwater depletion in khon kaen the royal thai government has implemented some measures to control groundwater extraction through groundwater decentralization processes to local governments however groundwater extraction was only reduced in the short term the findings reflect a lack of effective policies and low institutional capacity as the key challenges of groundwater management in the study area consequently the way forward requires the consideration of collaborative strategies among key actors to strengthen groundwater governance in the rapidly urbanizing area to balance groundwater use socio economic development and climate resilience further the capacity of groundwater governance should be enhanced at the local level beyond transboundary aquifer management to ensure sustainable groundwater extraction in the gms region to respond to the sustainable development goals graphical

people by 2030 i e khon kaen city will climb up to 138 545 people 19 51 by 2030 martinus and jia hui 2021 meanwhile groundwater continues to be developed to supply the higher demand from economic and population growth and it is more likely to be abstracted for business and domestic use in the urban area dam et al 2016 shrestha and saraphirom 2018 rapid urbanization in the mekong basin will also increase the demand for urban water uses resulting from domestic consumption martinus and jia hui 2021 it may result in groundwater depletion higher pumping costs seawater intrusion to the aquifer and land subsidence in the future dam et al 2016 tran et al 2022 groundwater governance is a key function to sustain groundwater resources and human activities groundwater governance represents the

interrelationships in the process of decision making megdal et al 2015 closas and villholth 2020 existing governance is one of the challenges of groundwater management with overlapping responsibilities among authorities in groundwater management tanaka 2014 a lack of groundwater knowledge and information inadequate effective policy responses to groundwater issues dam et al 2016 ngoc et al 2015 among the future challenge of groundwater governance in the gms is collaborative and mitigation strategies including transboundary aquifer management further the strength of the connection between groundwater policy science and strong cooperation among groundwater users is an important way to develop effective groundwater governance to overcome the limitations of understanding groundwater systems ngoc et al 2015 groundwater institutions are recognized as the key pillar of groundwater governance to overcome groundwater challenges institutions refer to rules policies measures organizations that govern the resource uses friend and thinphanga 2018 galaz 2005 huntjens et al 2012 rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 sondershaus and moss 2014 institutional capacity can overcome the challenges of groundwater overdrafts by controlling groundwater extraction friend and thinphanga 2018 however previous research indicates that there is a lack of policy adoption at the local level and inadequate management by the national governments of countries in the mekong region to cope with the challenges of sustainable groundwater management hao et al 2017 molle et al 2018 ngoc et al 2015 sustainable groundwater management in the urbanizing areas is a key challenge that water authorities in many countries are confronted with rapid building establishment industrial expansion including urban population growth threaten groundwater resources martinus and jia hui 2021 sousa et al 2014 several pieces of research have focused on the assessment of factors influencing groundwater level and supply see amini and hesami 2017 massoud et al 2018 prajapati et al 2021 pratoomchai et al 2014 sidhu et al 2021 however there is a lack of study on pressures or factors that influenced groundwater extraction which is the perspective of human actions see jalala et al 2011 majumdar et al 2020 furthermore governments in gms countries have paid little attention to groundwater since other water sources are seen as abundant thus the conditions of groundwater resources are currently inadequate studied while groundwater over exploitation and pollution is already occurring klessens et al 2022 ngoc et al 2015 recent studies found the existing policies related to groundwater need to be strengthened and the socio economic impacts on groundwater should be of concern cheyasit et al 2019 shrestha and saraphirom 2018 through a case study in khon kaen thailand a rapidly urbanizing city in the gms we aim to examine i the trends of socio economic development and climate pressures on groundwater resources ii how groundwater policies responded to extraction use and management of groundwater over the last two decades furthermore we analyze groundwater policies and unpack groundwater institutions to understand the roles and responsibilities among various organizations and how the operations are distributed to elicit the current situation of groundwater management in the study area 2 data and methods 2 1 study area we selected khon kaen as a case study as it is considered a rapidly urbanizing city in thailand sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 which is facing groundwater depletion dgr 2017 khon kaen is situated in the north eastern region of thailand 15 17 n latitude 101 103 e longitude covering an area of 10 886 km2 fig 1 khon kaen has been chosen by the government to be the central city of development since the implementation of the first national economic and social development plan pechpakdee 2020 yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 the region is experiencing groundwater depletion dgr 2017 due to economic growth urbanization and industrial expansion chantawongso 2019 economic development has emerged through the establishment and growth of multiple industries e g transportation hotels restaurants bars wholesale retail and garment industry chantawongso 2019 sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 these have also induced massive in bound migration from the rural areas sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 the increase in water demand in the study area resulted from population growth and business expansion artlert and chaleeraktrakoon 2013 chantawongso 2019 groundwater extraction by sectors was accounted for as follows in 2019 64 43 in the business sector 25 54 in the agricultural sector and 10 03 in domestic consumption dgr 2020 meanwhile the ubol ratana dam in this region also requires a large volume of water to generate electricity thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 the competition of water use will thus continue to intensify and impact the study area climate change is occurring coupled with ineffective urbanization management beringer and kaewsuk 2018 the absorbed surfaces and natural floodways in the city have declined with the lack of land use planning in the past ito et al 2016 additionally groundwater contamination resulting from socio economic development pressures is also a challenge heavy metal contamination was found in groundwater around factories e g natural gas plants and paper factories the level of manganese and cadmium were higher than specified by the groundwater quality standards muengpracha et al 2016 oic 2016 in other words rapid socio economic development has expanded the groundwater problems in the study area 2 2 source and types of data secondary data including groundwater extraction data groundwater level rainfall temperature and socio economic development 2000 2019 were gathered from the department of groundwater resources the thai meteorological department and the national statistic office in thailand fig 2 these criterion variables were selected based on prior research to assess groundwater extraction water demand pressures on water i e li 2016 marella 2014 national research council 2002 puapongsakorn 2017 in addition regulations and policies documents are used from the royal decree and reports from related departments i e monre dgr bgrr4 etc 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 mann kendal trend and sen s slope estimation time series data of groundwater extraction groundwater level climate and socio economic situation 2000 2019 were tested by mann kendal trend and sen s slope estimation in the r program the mann kendall mk test is a rank based distribution free test widely adopted in trend analysis of time series data the conventional mann kendall test mk test is used to evaluate the importance of monotonic deviations in climatological applications of multi temporal data mann 1945 such as water level rainfall temperature and stream movement anand et al 2020 nourani and mousavi 2016 sen s slope estimation is developed by sen 1968 to calculate the magnitude of trend in the long term temporal data where β is sen s slope estimate β 0 indicates an upward trend in a time series otherwise the data series presents a downward trend during the period the analysis aims to investigate the direction of the trends of each data and how they have changed 2 3 2 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to test the association among groundwater level groundwater extraction rainfall and temperature as well as socio economic development the correlation coefficient r is 1 to 1 the value is close 1 means strongly negative correlation and 1 means strongly positive correlation 0 means there is no correlation between variables schober et al 2018 2 3 3 institutional and retrospective policy analysis institutional analysis was used to unpack the institutional aspects i e policies laws regulations authorities organizations etc related to groundwater management this method can elicit the states of a function of groundwater institutions and how the institutions are implemented friend and thinphanga 2018 retrospective policy analysis is based on historical facts or earlier policy decisions the method aims to describe the causes and consequences of policies in the past and investigate the strengths and gaps of policies rules and regulations in the past until the present the output will be the key information to support decision makers egyankosh 2012 data and methods for the adopted methodology is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 long term groundwater extraction trends groundwater was extracted for the use of the three main sectors agricultural business and domestic use the annual groundwater extraction among the three sectors in the last two decades is presented in fig 3 it was found that the highest extraction in khon kaen is by the business sector additionally the trends of total groundwater extraction by all sectors are substantive increased the results from the mann kendal analysis and sen s slope estimation show groundwater extraction in the business sector have an upward trend and increase in 622 862 1 m3 y kendal s tau 1 p 0 01 sen s slope 622 862 1 m3 y domestic groundwater extraction has an upward trend and increase in 142 182 7 m3 y kendal s tau 0 39 p 0 01 and sen s slope 142 182 7 m3 y agricultural groundwater extraction has an upward trend and increase in 139 065 m3 y kendal s tau 0 79 p 0 01 and sen s slope 139 065 m3 y the distribution of pumping wells and private groundwater extraction in khon kaen is shown in fig 4 in 2020 it is found that there has been a total of 5609 wells 2881 public wells 2657 wells for domestic use 224 wells for agriculture another type includes 2728 private wells 551 wells for domestic use 1079 wells for business and 1098 wells for agriculture the highest extraction is concentrated in mueang khon kaen nong rua and chum pae districts 3 2 socio economic development trends the trends of socio economic development are presented in fig 5 population fig 5a urban area fig 5b tourist arrivals fig c total gpp gpp of agriculture gpp of industry and gpp of hotel and restaurants fig 5d the socio economic trends have been increasing at statistically significant rates in the last 20 years the population trend and tourist arrivals have increased by 3891 persons y and 219 273 persons y respectively fig 5a and b the agricultural area has decreased by 3228 73 ha y while the urban area has increased by 1750 46 ha y fig 5c the total gpp gpp shared agriculture industry hotel and restaurant have climbed up and accounted for 8572 45 876 29 3635 18 and 167 5 million baht y respectively fig 5d table 1 shows a correlation between total groundwater extraction and socio economic development in khon kaen it is found that the total groundwater extraction is highly positively correlated with the urban area r 0 97 at a significant level furthermore it is highly positively associated with tourist arrivals r 0 94 and gpp r 0 91 at significant level conversely total groundwater extraction is negatively correlated with agricultural land r 0 73 significantly the finding represents that total groundwater extraction and socio economic development have a strong correlation except for the area under agriculture although agricultural areas decreased total groundwater extraction increased this results from agricultural land being transformed to the urban area and the transition of the agricultural system to intensive agriculture in the study area 3 3 groundwater level monitoring trends the monitoring wells are located in the area of khon kaen city and phon district the status of groundwater level in monitoring wells between 2004 and 2020 was illustrated in fig 6 the groundwater level is measured from the soil surface it is found that the levels in the three monitoring wells are lower than other wells i e tapra 3 4 and 6 table 2 shows the results from the analysis of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimation on groundwater level five monitoring wells show a downward trend of groundwater level tapranao phon tapra 7 tapra 2 and tapra 1 while there are three monitoring wells with an upward trend in groundwater level tapra 3 tapra 4 and tapra 6 however there is no trend of the groundwater level of tapra 5 in brief there are downward trends in groundwater level in five of the nine monitoring wells in khon kaen however the upward trend of groundwater level occurs in the three monitoring well one monitoring well had no significant trend of groundwater level 3 4 long term rainfall and temperature trends the average temperature and average rainfall between 1980 and 2019 were shown in fig 7 the results show the average temperature has an upward trend and increase in 0 02 c y significantly kendal s tau 0 35 p 0 001 and sen s slope 0 02 c whereas average monthly rainfall showed no trend kendal s tau 6 923077e 02 p 0 54 and sen s slope 0 12 mm in the last 40 year 3 5 impacts of groundwater level on groundwater extraction table 3 shows the correlation between groundwater level and groundwater extraction among sectors groundwater level at phon monitoring wells has a negative high correlation to business groundwater use r 0 67 p 0 01 negative moderate correlation to agricultural groundwater use and total groundwater extraction r 0 58 p 0 05 r 0 58 p 0 05 it means that groundwater levels reduced significantly when business groundwater extraction increased groundwater levels reduced moderately when agricultural and total groundwater extraction increased however the groundwater levels in tapra 3 4 and 6 have a highly positive correlation to total groundwater withdrawals agricultural use and business use it may refer to the aquifer recharging in the monitoring wells domestic use was however not correlated with groundwater level in any monitoring wells 3 6 institutional arrangement of groundwater management the institutional arrangement of groundwater management in thailand is shown in fig 8 it is mainly mandated by state actors at the national level it starts with the top authorities the prime minister and cabinet have the role to consider and enforce the policies according to the cabinet s agreement national water resources committee nwrc is a policymaker of water management and the office of national water resources onwr adopt policies from nwrc to operate the functions of water management at the national level at the ministerial level the ministry of natural resources and environment monre is the key actor to mandate the natural resources issues including water and groundwater management the ministry has tasked the roles of groundwater management to the department of groundwater resources dgr plays a key role to propose policies plans and measures about groundwater resources these state authorities are the regulators and operators of groundwater management at the national level ccop 2019 dgr 2017 fornés azcoiti and pirarai 2014 gupta and babel 2005 peanmonkul 2020 prakongsri and santiboon 2020 srisuk and nettasana 2017 at the provincial level the government launched the action plans of decentralization to local authorities in 2008 to decentralize the mandates of the central government to local governments dgr adopt this plan to establish the bureau of groundwater resource regional 4 bgrr4 to manage groundwater in khon kaen for effective management of groundwater resources a decentralization policy was implemented in 2011 to task the groundwater management to the local authorities the pilot areas were chiang mai khon kaen and nakorn ratchasima the mayors and chairs of the subdistrict authority organization are the representatives of the director of dgr to implement the plans and mission to manage groundwater at the local level i e groundwater license well drilling well cleaning and maintenance etc in addition the bureau of natural resource and environment khon kaen bonre is the local organization under monre to mandate surface and groundwater management following the groundwater act and water supply in khon kaen dgr 2019 peanmonkul 2020 meanwhile provincial administrative organizations pao has the duty of controlling groundwater use allowance at the provincial level from dgr water sub committee was established by nwrc to mandate urgent issues of water management in khon kaen the mayors and chairs of subdistrict organizations have the duty of controlling groundwater use allowance at the municipal level from dgr the village committee and heads of the community manage water supply with users at the community level dgr 2019 peanmonkul 2020 the other groups are the non state actors including 1 water and environment institute for sustainability weis under industrial council which researches the efficient groundwater use in the industrial sector to develop and conserve groundwater in the eco industrial city khon kaen and nakorn ratchasima 2 groundwater resources research institute khon kaen university has been developing databases and conducting many types of groundwater related research in khon kaen 3 thailand environment institute foundation tei has been making recommendations on national environmental policy strategy and direction these actors are part of contributions to groundwater knowledge at the local level 3 7 groundwater policies globally many groundwater policies and regulations aim to balance groundwater uses elshall et al 2020 ross 2016 when policies have been formulated policies require instruments tools rules protocols and other procedures for their formulation they may include laws sets of rights registrations permits and regulations varady et al 2012 regulatory and economic groundwater policies are the dominant measures in thailand regulatory policies aim to control groundwater pumping in the critical zone due to its serious impacts in addition economic policy instruments i e groundwater tariff and conservation charges were implemented to reduce the groundwater abstraction and encourage use of alternative water sources buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 the timeline of policy implementation between 1977 and 2007 is presented in fig 9 regulatory policies were introduced to restrict massive groundwater pumping in thailand the groundwater act was introduced in 1977 and enforced all over thailand in 1994 in particular the regulations policies and measures have been intensively controlled in the groundwater critical zone bangkok and its vicinity 7 provinces due to the critical issue of land subsidence buapeng and foster 2008 gupta and babel 2005 lorphensri et al 2016 in the first period of enforcement there were some negative impacts from overexploitation of groundwater resources in bangkok i e groundwater level declination massive private pumping well drilling high chloride concentration etc until the amendment of the groundwater act in 1992 the positive impacts were the reduction of mwa abstraction and land subsidence rate groundwater was first charged in 1985 1 baht m3 it was increased to 3 50 baht m3 in 1994 4 baht m3 in 2000 and has been 8 50 baht m3 for critical zone charges since 2003 meanwhile groundwater users in other areas have been charged only 3 50 baht m3 since 1994 after increasing the groundwater charge from 1 baht m3 to 3 50 baht m3 in 1994 until 8 50 baht m3 in 2003 it is found that groundwater abstraction and land subsidence gradually decreased over time many industrial groundwater users having moved out of greater bangkok to escape the increasing groundwater charges buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 in 2004 an additional groundwater conservation charge was introduced to control groundwater use in bangkok and its vicinity since the over abstraction led to land subsidence and seawater intrusion the price started from 1 baht m3 in 2004 and gradually raised every three months until 8 50 baht m3 between 2006 and 2011 however with the groundwater abstraction found to be reduced in bangkok the government revised the groundwater conservation charge to 4 50 baht m3 in october 2012 economic measures were quite effective for controlling groundwater withdrawals and chloride concentrations in the critical in addition the land subsidence rate also recovered buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 the timeline of groundwater policy implementation since 2008 is presented in fig 10 by 2011 the policy of decentralization to local authority organizations managed groundwater resources was implemented as groundwater users did not pay the groundwater charges and conservation charges timely therefore local authorities needed to collect the groundwater charge more strictly khon kaen is also the pilot area of decentralization mayors municipalities and chairs of t a o tambon or subdistrict administrative organization are the representatives of the director of dgr to implement the plans and mission to manage groundwater at the local level i e well drilling cleaning and maintenance groundwater charges dgr 2017 regarding the policies related to groundwater contamination and level monitoring there have been policies adopted by dgr and other authorities dgr set up monitoring wells to monitor the groundwater level and contamination around the country in addition there is the ministerial regulation on groundwater contamination control in the factories announced by the minister of industry in 2016 and amendment in 2020 the rule required factories to report the result of soil and groundwater quality dgr 2021 the situation of groundwater resources in khon kaen and policy responses over time is presented in fig 11 although the groundwater act has been enacted since 1977 and amended in 1992 and 2003 to include the control measures i e groundwater quality control critical zoning licensing and tariff etc groundwater withdrawals have been climbing since 2003 in khon kaen after a decade it is found that the total groundwater withdrawals reduced 22 47 in 2012 1 year it may be linked to the decentralized policy implemented to manage groundwater resources in khon kaen after that groundwater withdrawals have been climbing up and was almost 19 million m3 year 109 40 in 2019 moreover the groundwater level in monitoring wells 5 in 9 wells has been on a downward trend in addition there has been inequality of water allocation in the province since industrial sectors got higher priority than the agricultural sector urbanek 2019 the data and analysis imply that the challenges of groundwater use in khon kaen are a lack of specific local policies in the economic sectors and cross sectoral policies to coordinate groundwater management to overcome the challenge of the increasing rate of groundwater withdrawals in khon kaen many of these water issues may be dealt with by strategic plans at the local level friend and thinphanga 2018 3 8 economic and social development plans khon kaen is steered by the national economic and social development plans since 1962 the government targeted khon kaen to be the second city and the center of the north eastern region in thailand infrastructure development was expanded as well as urbanization industrial commercial expansion and tourist destination yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 infrastructure development and international trading in khon kaen the 9th plan of nesdp led to the increase in groundwater withdrawals from 2003 to 2006 even with the groundwater act is being enforced moreover reference to the 8th plan of nesdp manufacturing development attracted more people to work in the province decentralization is the linkage of accountability power and financial capital from the central government to local authorities krutchon 2015 the national economic and social development board nesdb has also supported decentralization as a measure to promote a small government formulate development programs increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their implementation and reduce gaps between urban and rural areas jaica 2008 khon kaen smart city planning is included in the 12th national social and economic plan 2017 2021 a smart city is the new challenge of urban development with massive investment urbanization and migration occurring in the city pechpakdee 2020 despite the transitions of political structures and national policies khon kaen has been developed continuously for over a half century yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 meanwhile large numbers of development projects were implemented in the city the marginalized and vulnerable groups in slum communities have also been impacted especially with the development of the double track railway residents who live nearby the railway were forced to clear the houses and move out of the radian 20 m from the center of the railway marks 2019 these are the concerning issues that may imply the inequality of socio economic development in the smart city 4 discussion 4 1 climate and socio economic pressures on groundwater khon kaen is targeted to be the core area of the northeast region in thailand since 1967 the 2nd plan of national economic and social development the government has supported infrastructure and economic development to boost up khon kaen to be the second city to underline bangkok from 2003 to 2006 groundwater withdrawal is a significant increase in business use since there are many development programs in khon kaen the expansion of international trading among the gms countries led to attracting investments in both small and large projects of infrastructure development i e road expansion east west economic corridor ewec and logistic hub the smart city plan is under the national policy called thailand 4 0 khon kaen is also the pilot area to initiate khon kaen smart city the smart city plan aims to boost the economy with digital technology as well as urban planning jenrangsan and saengkord 2019 naprathansuk 2017 prawanne 2020 the average temperature demonstrated an upward trend while average rainfall has had no trend in the last 40 years in khon kaen several studies found that rising temperature will intensify the global water cycle and change precipitation patterns wang et al 2016 which affect groundwater level and natural groundwater recharge reduction salem et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2020 furthermore rainfall is the key supporter of natural aquifer recharges oke and alowo 2021 in this case rainfall has no trend however many pieces of research underlined a particular issue is rainfall extremes have an impact on water resources and supply systems owor et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 thomson et al 2019 furthermore the groundwater level in some monitoring wells shows a downward trend since 2004 some studies agreed with the uncertainty of rainfall resulted in the reduction of average annual groundwater storage shrestha and saraphirom 2018 pratoomchai et al 2014 at phon monitoring well the groundwater level was highly reduced when business groundwater extraction increased meanwhile groundwater levels reduced moderately when agricultural groundwater extraction increased the finding implied that there is a strong association between groundwater extracted by the business sector and groundwater level in monitoring wells groundwater use in the business sector increased again since 2016 as smart city plans were initiated in khon kaen it is possible that smart cities attracted workforces in different sectors especially the business sector prawanne 2020 thus business and industrial development in the smart city plan affected groundwater withdrawals in addition the industrial establishment increased from 2016 to 2017 however groundwater policies and measures cannot effectively control the large volume of groundwater withdrawals in the business sector in addition there are some issues in groundwater regulations in khon kaen including groundwater exploitation by local authorities dgr 2020 since local government authorities allowed groundwater resources to be used for tap water production for domestic use some local departments provide it to the industrial sector this is an illegal case under the groundwater act therefore dgr called for local departments to implement in accordance with the license under groundwater act dgr 2020 groundwater use in domestic households significantly increased with urban area expansion 22 53 household increase 10 12 and population growth 0 17 in khon kaen from 2005 to 2006 from 2011 to 2012 groundwater withdrawal in domestic use significant declined 57 66 when the socio economic development policy that is 10th nesdp 2007 2011 targeted the decentralization to local authorities it led to political changes in the administrative system and local administration was charged to provide and manage public services locally moreover groundwater license and decentralization to local authority organizations to manage groundwater resources were enforced to collect groundwater charges more strictly in 2012 the determination of groundwater zones and groundwater depths aimed to clarify the scope of groundwater resources the law determines water that is deeper than 15 m from the soil surface is a groundwater resource from 2014 to 2016 domestic groundwater use has increased by 7 60 6 98 0 65 increase in the household urban area and population growth respectively since 2017 domestic use declined it is possible that the national strategic plans monre dgr plans and groundwater license amendment can control the use of groundwater for domestic purposes in the future groundwater use in the agricultural sector has increased little since 2005 and was quite stable until 2014 the agricultural area has declined since 2006 the area was changed to an urban and built up area including farmers selling the land to a businessman van ninh and waisurasingha 2018 ongsomwang et al 2019 phatchaney and chamaratana 2018 there was a 58 35 decrease in groundwater withdrawals in the agricultural sector between 2011 and 2013 this reduction of groundwater withdrawals may result from the decentralization policy by 2014 a double increase in agricultural use gradually resulted from a 0 084 increase in agricultural land between 2013 and 2015 however 8 16 decrease in gpp agriculture between 2014 and 2019 the finding highlights the increasing trend of agricultural groundwater withdrawals in the study area while gpp agriculture declined between 2014 and 2019 it can be implied that groundwater is still inefficiently used by the agricultural sector according to chuenchum et al 2018 the study indicated that thailand needs to increase the effectiveness of the production processes and technology specifically in the agricultural sector to decrease the amount of water usage further the findings show the upward trends among anthropogenic development population number urban area number of tourists gpp gpp shared agriculture gpp shared industry and gpp shared hotel and restaurants the socio economic trends have been increasing significantly including the upward trends that need to be controlled to reduce groundwater use among sectors scholars highlighted the pressures from the population on groundwater ojeda olivares et al 2019 indicated that population growth has increased water consumption and the extreme pressure on groundwater supply thus the finding reflects that population growth is the key pressure on higher groundwater extraction since the strong correlation between groundwater extraction and population number sharp et al 2013 indicated that urbanization has an impact on the increasing rate of groundwater abstraction our data revealed that the highest groundwater pumping is for the business sector in khon kaen meanwhile the findings here show that the total groundwater withdrawal and groundwater use among economic sectors have been increasing significantly moreover the total groundwater withdrawal is highly positively correlated with an urban area tourist and gpp respectively another paper also agreed that population growth and urbanization of the modder river catchment resulted in increasing water demands and excessive pumping oke and alowo 2021 hence groundwater withdrawals are associated with socioeconomic developments significantly in this case we use gpp to examine the correlation between economic development and groundwater withdrawals to show the economic growth at the provincial level several scholars confirmed the influences of gdp on groundwater use they indicated that gdp per capita in the primary industry requires an increase in groundwater consumption qiu et al 2018 the findings suggested that socio economic trends i e population growth urban area and number of tourists in khon kaen have been increased whereas total gpp and gpp shared are also climbing it implies that as economic development population and urban area tended to increase groundwater resources were increasingly extracted from aquifer storage it should be managed closely by responsible authorities including multi stakeholders to immediately control and monitor groundwater extraction and implement artificial aquifer recharges in the study area 4 2 policies and governance response to pressures on groundwater resources groundwater governance can address the balance of water use between socio economic activities and ecosystem preservation unesco 2021 the rapid growth of the urban population economic development in the megacities including the massive migration to the urban area are challenged to sdg6 water and sanitation in addition the anthropogenic and climate pressures also interrupt good groundwater governance furthermore state led management may have been weakening since there is some complexity in the governmental organizations i e resource mismanagement inappropriate legal and institutional arrangements weak institutional capacity a lack of cooperation in multi level and a lack of budgets and investments mauroner et al 2021 unesco 2021 rapid socio economic development as well as climate situation may accelerate the groundwater withdrawals and have several impacts on groundwater level in khon kaen piyapong et al 2019 indicated the low institutional capacity in terms of users participation in groundwater management in thailand since a lack of capacity from governments to include groundwater users in the groundwater management process thus groundwater users are unwilling and have low motivation to participate in decision making implementation and monitoring processes some groundwater users did not percept the situation of the groundwater crisis piyapong et al 2019 this situation may lead to the lack of groundwater users awareness of groundwater use and the higher demand for groundwater in the uncertainty of complex groundwater management although national groundwater use policies measures and regulations introduced intensively in the last 20 years there has been an increase in groundwater extractions in khon kaen it is possible that this is due to the lack of cooperation among organizations and broader groups of stakeholders at the local level this paper is in line with mitter and schmid 2021 which highlighted the efficiency of regional specific groundwater policies that can help to sustain groundwater availability our study here study implied that local policies may help to reduce groundwater extraction to balance the ecosystem of groundwater resources in khon kaen similarly shrestha and saraphirom 2018 investigated policies related to groundwater resources in thailand they indicated that the limitation of groundwater access causes the pause of development in the state therefore it should be controlled by effective policies they recommended that since the agricultural and industrial sectors have withdrawn groundwater resources at a high rate policies related to agriculture and industries should address the impacts to cope with the issues to sustainable use in the future in the same way this current study revealed that the business sector is the bulk users in khon kaen thus local policies associated with groundwater use in the business sector should be formulated by ensuring multi stakeholder participation in the policy making process including economic policy instruments i e increasing groundwater tariff and conservation charges etc to overcome the challenges of a large amount of groundwater withdrawals in the business sector when it is compared to the control measures of groundwater use in bangkok and its vicinities it is found that many policies were implemented intensively i e increasing groundwater tariff and conservation charge expanding of metropolitan and provincial waterworks authorities to supply surface water instead etc after these policies were implemented groundwater abstraction and land subsidence were reduced many scholars confirmed the effectiveness of policy implementation in bangkok to cope with land subsidence and groundwater abstraction buapeng and foster 2008 gupta and babel 2005 lorphensri et al 2016 ngoc et al 2015 however groundwater policies are still ineffective to control groundwater withdrawals at the local level the groundwater tariff in khon kaen is only 3 50 baht m3 0 10 m3 since the city is outside the critical zone according to the groundwater act and people who lack tap water access are allowed to use groundwater for free further groundwater users do not have to pay conservation charges like bangkok and its vicinity moreover there is a lack of participatory groundwater monitoring at the community level i e groundwater contamination and depletion it is possible that groundwater is extracted at risk and groundwater users are not aware of the significance of groundwater resources if there are a lack of control measures in specific issues or areas the impacts of groundwater exploitation will occur unavoidably i e land subsidence seawater intrusion into aquifer groundwater depletion and contamination conflicts among users etc 5 conclusion groundwater has a key function to support socio economic development in khon kaen so far the socio economic development has increased over the last two decades population growth urban expansion tourist arrival gpp while the trends of groundwater extraction among economic sectors were found to rise especially massive groundwater use in the business sector furthermore socio economic development was strongly correlated to groundwater extraction rainfall and temperature were also the key climate pressures on groundwater level while groundwater level tended to decline the results of this study reveal that there have been inadequate and ineffective groundwater policies to control groundwater extraction in the study area in part due to the top down institutional arrangements though there have been economic instruments groundwater tariff is comparatively low and users do not need to pay conservation charges at the critical zone although dgr attempted to decentralize groundwater management at the local level decentralization policy is still weak due to a lack of knowledge in groundwater management of local governments moreover a lack of cooperation across organizations heterogeneous stakeholders groundwater users and weakness of institutional capacity may lead to the rising trends of groundwater extraction among sectors many urbanizing cities in the gms region also faced groundwater challenges similar to this case study area groundwater has been intensively used and has economic significance in vietnam dam et al 2016 however vietnam has confronted the issues of groundwater level drops in hanoi and ho chi minh city which are rapidly urbanizing areas the rapid increase in groundwater uses in hcmc is due to the economic development policies rapid industrialization and urbanization furthermore surface water work cannot respond to the higher water demand in the city consequently free of groundwater charges and uncontrollable groundwater exploitation are the key challenges of groundwater management in hcmc ohgaki 2007 similarly in cambodia industrial zones have been rapidly expanding and have led to problems of groundwater contamination from untreated industrial wastes recently trends of groundwater exploitation for industrial and agricultural use are getting higher thus the major challenges are overexploitation without legal control of groundwater use although groundwater management is partially included in the water resources law ngoc et al 2015 in conclusion the urbanizing cities faced similar challenges of groundwater management in the gms region the first challenge is socio economic development i e rapid urbanization industrialization population growth in the urban area another is groundwater use i e intensive use over exploitation level drops pollution lacks of strength policies and legal controls thus the way forward requires the consideration of good groundwater governance to balance between groundwater use in economic sectors and economic development to respond to sustainable development goals sdgs sdg6 water and sanitation and enhancing the capacity of groundwater governance at the local level beyond to transboundary aquifer management among gm s urbanizing cities to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawals furthermore the strength of institutional capacity is also a significant pillar to shape strong groundwater governance unesco 2021 thus the effective groundwater policies i e increasing the tariff conservation charges expanding provincial waterworks authorities to supply the surface water instead participatory groundwater monitoring amongst groundwater users etc the horizontal cooperation across sectors clear roles and responsibilities among organizations bottom up approaches decentralization and multi stakeholder engagement should be more addressed in groundwater management especially the local level to overcome the challenges of rapid socio economic development urbanization and climate resilience on groundwater resources in the urbanizing cities in the gms region funding sources

groundwater withdrawals have led to enormous pressures on vital resources socio economic development urbanization climate situation as well as groundwater governance through a case study in khon kaen thailand a rapidly urbanizing city in gms this study aimed to examine i the trends of socio economic development and climate pressures on groundwater resources ii how groundwater policies responded to extraction use and management of groundwater over the last two decades time series data of groundwater extraction groundwater level climate and socio economic situation 2000 2019 were tested by mann kendal trend test and sen s slope estimation to investigate the direction of the trends and their changes we use pearson correlation to assess the association between socio economic development and groundwater withdrawals institutional and retrospective policy analyses were applied to analyze the institutional arrangements and the policy changes over time the findings show the rapid socio economic development and climate trends accelerate the groundwater extraction as well as groundwater depletion in khon kaen the royal thai government has implemented some measures to control groundwater extraction through groundwater decentralization processes to local governments however groundwater extraction was only reduced in the short term the findings reflect a lack of effective policies and low institutional capacity as the key challenges of groundwater management in the study area consequently the way forward requires the consideration of collaborative strategies among key actors to strengthen groundwater governance in the rapidly urbanizing area to balance groundwater use socio economic development and climate resilience further the capacity of groundwater governance should be enhanced at the local level beyond transboundary aquifer management to ensure sustainable groundwater extraction in the gms region to respond to the sustainable development goals graphical

extraction which is the perspective of human actions see jalala et al 2011 majumdar et al 2020 furthermore governments in gms countries have paid little attention to groundwater since other water sources are seen as abundant thus the conditions of groundwater resources are currently inadequate studied while groundwater over exploitation and pollution is already occurring klessens et al 2022 ngoc et al 2015 recent studies found the existing policies related to groundwater need to be strengthened and the socio economic impacts on groundwater should be of concern cheyasit et al 2019 shrestha and saraphirom 2018 through a case study in khon kaen thailand a rapidly urbanizing city in the gms we aim to examine i the trends of socio economic development and climate pressures on groundwater resources ii how groundwater policies responded to extraction use and management of groundwater over the last two decades furthermore we analyze groundwater policies and unpack groundwater institutions to understand the roles and responsibilities among various organizations and how the operations are distributed to elicit the current situation of groundwater management in the study area 2 data and methods 2 1 study area we selected khon kaen as a case study as it is considered a rapidly urbanizing city in thailand sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 which is facing groundwater depletion dgr 2017 khon kaen is situated in the north eastern region of thailand 15 17 n latitude 101 103 e longitude covering an area of 10 886 km2 fig 1 khon kaen has been chosen by the government to be the central city of development since the implementation of the first national economic and social development plan pechpakdee 2020 yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 the region is experiencing groundwater depletion dgr 2017 due to economic growth urbanization and industrial expansion chantawongso 2019 economic development has emerged through the establishment and growth of multiple industries e g transportation hotels restaurants bars wholesale retail and garment industry chantawongso 2019 sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 these have also induced massive in bound migration from the rural areas sudhipongpracha and dahiya 2019 the increase in water demand in the study area resulted from population growth and business expansion artlert and chaleeraktrakoon 2013 chantawongso 2019 groundwater extraction by sectors was accounted for as follows in 2019 64 43 in the business sector 25 54 in the agricultural sector and 10 03 in domestic consumption dgr 2020 meanwhile the ubol ratana dam in this region also requires a large volume of water to generate electricity thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 the competition of water use will thus continue to intensify and impact the study area climate change is occurring coupled with ineffective urbanization management beringer and kaewsuk 2018 the absorbed surfaces and natural floodways in the city have declined with the lack of land use planning in the past ito et al 2016 additionally groundwater contamination resulting from socio economic development pressures is also a challenge heavy metal contamination was found in groundwater around factories e g natural gas plants and paper factories the level of manganese and cadmium were higher than specified by the groundwater quality standards muengpracha et al 2016 oic 2016 in other words rapid socio economic development has expanded the groundwater problems in the study area 2 2 source and types of data secondary data including groundwater extraction data groundwater level rainfall temperature and socio economic development 2000 2019 were gathered from the department of groundwater resources the thai meteorological department and the national statistic office in thailand fig 2 these criterion variables were selected based on prior research to assess groundwater extraction water demand pressures on water i e li 2016 marella 2014 national research council 2002 puapongsakorn 2017 in addition regulations and policies documents are used from the royal decree and reports from related departments i e monre dgr bgrr4 etc 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 mann kendal trend and sen s slope estimation time series data of groundwater extraction groundwater level climate and socio economic situation 2000 2019 were tested by mann kendal trend and sen s slope estimation in the r program the mann kendall mk test is a rank based distribution free test widely adopted in trend analysis of time series data the conventional mann kendall test mk test is used to evaluate the importance of monotonic deviations in climatological applications of multi temporal data mann 1945 such as water level rainfall temperature and stream movement anand et al 2020 nourani and mousavi 2016 sen s slope estimation is developed by sen 1968 to calculate the magnitude of trend in the long term temporal data where β is sen s slope estimate β 0 indicates an upward trend in a time series otherwise the data series presents a downward trend during the period the analysis aims to investigate the direction of the trends of each data and how they have changed 2 3 2 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was used to test the association among groundwater level groundwater extraction rainfall and temperature as well as socio economic development the correlation coefficient r is 1 to 1 the value is close 1 means strongly negative correlation and 1 means strongly positive correlation 0 means there is no correlation between variables schober et al 2018 2 3 3 institutional and retrospective policy analysis institutional analysis was used to unpack the institutional aspects i e policies laws regulations authorities organizations etc related to groundwater management this method can elicit the states of a function of groundwater institutions and how the institutions are implemented friend and thinphanga 2018 retrospective policy analysis is based on historical facts or earlier policy decisions the method aims to describe the causes and consequences of policies in the past and investigate the strengths and gaps of policies rules and regulations in the past until the present the output will be the key information to support decision makers egyankosh 2012 data and methods for the adopted methodology is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 long term groundwater extraction trends groundwater was extracted for the use of the three main sectors agricultural business and domestic use the annual groundwater extraction among the three sectors in the last two decades is presented in fig 3 it was found that the highest extraction in khon kaen is by the business sector additionally the trends of total groundwater extraction by all sectors are substantive increased the results from the mann kendal analysis and sen s slope estimation show groundwater extraction in the business sector have an upward trend and increase in 622 862 1 m3 y kendal s tau 1 p 0 01 sen s slope 622 862 1 m3 y domestic groundwater extraction has an upward trend and increase in 142 182 7 m3 y kendal s tau 0 39 p 0 01 and sen s slope 142 182 7 m3 y agricultural groundwater extraction has an upward trend and increase in 139 065 m3 y kendal s tau 0 79 p 0 01 and sen s slope 139 065 m3 y the distribution of pumping wells and private groundwater extraction in khon kaen is shown in fig 4 in 2020 it is found that there has been a total of 5609 wells 2881 public wells 2657 wells for domestic use 224 wells for agriculture another type includes 2728 private wells 551 wells for domestic use 1079 wells for business and 1098 wells for agriculture the highest extraction is concentrated in mueang khon kaen nong rua and chum pae districts 3 2 socio economic development trends the trends of socio economic development are presented in fig 5 population fig 5a urban area fig 5b tourist arrivals fig c total gpp gpp of agriculture gpp of industry and gpp of hotel and restaurants fig 5d the socio economic trends have been increasing at statistically significant rates in the last 20 years the population trend and tourist arrivals have increased by 3891 persons y and 219 273 persons y respectively fig 5a and b the agricultural area has decreased by 3228 73 ha y while the urban area has increased by 1750 46 ha y fig 5c the total gpp gpp shared agriculture industry hotel and restaurant have climbed up and accounted for 8572 45 876 29 3635 18 and 167 5 million baht y respectively fig 5d table 1 shows a correlation between total groundwater extraction and socio economic development in khon kaen it is found that the total groundwater extraction is highly positively correlated with the urban area r 0 97 at a significant level furthermore it is highly positively associated with tourist arrivals r 0 94 and gpp r 0 91 at significant level conversely total groundwater extraction is negatively correlated with agricultural land r 0 73 significantly the finding represents that total groundwater extraction and socio economic development have a strong correlation except for the area under agriculture although agricultural areas decreased total groundwater extraction increased this results from agricultural land being transformed to the urban area and the transition of the agricultural system to intensive agriculture in the study area 3 3 groundwater level monitoring trends the monitoring wells are located in the area of khon kaen city and phon district the status of groundwater level in monitoring wells between 2004 and 2020 was illustrated in fig 6 the groundwater level is measured from the soil surface it is found that the levels in the three monitoring wells are lower than other wells i e tapra 3 4 and 6 table 2 shows the results from the analysis of the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimation on groundwater level five monitoring wells show a downward trend of groundwater level tapranao phon tapra 7 tapra 2 and tapra 1 while there are three monitoring wells with an upward trend in groundwater level tapra 3 tapra 4 and tapra 6 however there is no trend of the groundwater level of tapra 5 in brief there are downward trends in groundwater level in five of the nine monitoring wells in khon kaen however the upward trend of groundwater level occurs in the three monitoring well one monitoring well had no significant trend of groundwater level 3 4 long term rainfall and temperature trends the average temperature and average rainfall between 1980 and 2019 were shown in fig 7 the results show the average temperature has an upward trend and increase in 0 02 c y significantly kendal s tau 0 35 p 0 001 and sen s slope 0 02 c whereas average monthly rainfall showed no trend kendal s tau 6 923077e 02 p 0 54 and sen s slope 0 12 mm in the last 40 year 3 5 impacts of groundwater level on groundwater extraction table 3 shows the correlation between groundwater level and groundwater extraction among sectors groundwater level at phon monitoring wells has a negative high correlation to business groundwater use r 0 67 p 0 01 negative moderate correlation to agricultural groundwater use and total groundwater extraction r 0 58 p 0 05 r 0 58 p 0 05 it means that groundwater levels reduced significantly when business groundwater extraction increased groundwater levels reduced moderately when agricultural and total groundwater extraction increased however the groundwater levels in tapra 3 4 and 6 have a highly positive correlation to total groundwater withdrawals agricultural use and business use it may refer to the aquifer recharging in the monitoring wells domestic use was however not correlated with groundwater level in any monitoring wells 3 6 institutional arrangement of groundwater management the institutional arrangement of groundwater management in thailand is shown in fig 8 it is mainly mandated by state actors at the national level it starts with the top authorities the prime minister and cabinet have the role to consider and enforce the policies according to the cabinet s agreement national water resources committee nwrc is a policymaker of water management and the office of national water resources onwr adopt policies from nwrc to operate the functions of water management at the national level at the ministerial level the ministry of natural resources and environment monre is the key actor to mandate the natural resources issues including water and groundwater management the ministry has tasked the roles of groundwater management to the department of groundwater resources dgr plays a key role to propose policies plans and measures about groundwater resources these state authorities are the regulators and operators of groundwater management at the national level ccop 2019 dgr 2017 fornés azcoiti and pirarai 2014 gupta and babel 2005 peanmonkul 2020 prakongsri and santiboon 2020 srisuk and nettasana 2017 at the provincial level the government launched the action plans of decentralization to local authorities in 2008 to decentralize the mandates of the central government to local governments dgr adopt this plan to establish the bureau of groundwater resource regional 4 bgrr4 to manage groundwater in khon kaen for effective management of groundwater resources a decentralization policy was implemented in 2011 to task the groundwater management to the local authorities the pilot areas were chiang mai khon kaen and nakorn ratchasima the mayors and chairs of the subdistrict authority organization are the representatives of the director of dgr to implement the plans and mission to manage groundwater at the local level i e groundwater license well drilling well cleaning and maintenance etc in addition the bureau of natural resource and environment khon kaen bonre is the local organization under monre to mandate surface and groundwater management following the groundwater act and water supply in khon kaen dgr 2019 peanmonkul 2020 meanwhile provincial administrative organizations pao has the duty of controlling groundwater use allowance at the provincial level from dgr water sub committee was established by nwrc to mandate urgent issues of water management in khon kaen the mayors and chairs of subdistrict organizations have the duty of controlling groundwater use allowance at the municipal level from dgr the village committee and heads of the community manage water supply with users at the community level dgr 2019 peanmonkul 2020 the other groups are the non state actors including 1 water and environment institute for sustainability weis under industrial council which researches the efficient groundwater use in the industrial sector to develop and conserve groundwater in the eco industrial city khon kaen and nakorn ratchasima 2 groundwater resources research institute khon kaen university has been developing databases and conducting many types of groundwater related research in khon kaen 3 thailand environment institute foundation tei has been making recommendations on national environmental policy strategy and direction these actors are part of contributions to groundwater knowledge at the local level 3 7 groundwater policies globally many groundwater policies and regulations aim to balance groundwater uses elshall et al 2020 ross 2016 when policies have been formulated policies require instruments tools rules protocols and other procedures for their formulation they may include laws sets of rights registrations permits and regulations varady et al 2012 regulatory and economic groundwater policies are the dominant measures in thailand regulatory policies aim to control groundwater pumping in the critical zone due to its serious impacts in addition economic policy instruments i e groundwater tariff and conservation charges were implemented to reduce the groundwater abstraction and encourage use of alternative water sources buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 the timeline of policy implementation between 1977 and 2007 is presented in fig 9 regulatory policies were introduced to restrict massive groundwater pumping in thailand the groundwater act was introduced in 1977 and enforced all over thailand in 1994 in particular the regulations policies and measures have been intensively controlled in the groundwater critical zone bangkok and its vicinity 7 provinces due to the critical issue of land subsidence buapeng and foster 2008 gupta and babel 2005 lorphensri et al 2016 in the first period of enforcement there were some negative impacts from overexploitation of groundwater resources in bangkok i e groundwater level declination massive private pumping well drilling high chloride concentration etc until the amendment of the groundwater act in 1992 the positive impacts were the reduction of mwa abstraction and land subsidence rate groundwater was first charged in 1985 1 baht m3 it was increased to 3 50 baht m3 in 1994 4 baht m3 in 2000 and has been 8 50 baht m3 for critical zone charges since 2003 meanwhile groundwater users in other areas have been charged only 3 50 baht m3 since 1994 after increasing the groundwater charge from 1 baht m3 to 3 50 baht m3 in 1994 until 8 50 baht m3 in 2003 it is found that groundwater abstraction and land subsidence gradually decreased over time many industrial groundwater users having moved out of greater bangkok to escape the increasing groundwater charges buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 in 2004 an additional groundwater conservation charge was introduced to control groundwater use in bangkok and its vicinity since the over abstraction led to land subsidence and seawater intrusion the price started from 1 baht m3 in 2004 and gradually raised every three months until 8 50 baht m3 between 2006 and 2011 however with the groundwater abstraction found to be reduced in bangkok the government revised the groundwater conservation charge to 4 50 baht m3 in october 2012 economic measures were quite effective for controlling groundwater withdrawals and chloride concentrations in the critical in addition the land subsidence rate also recovered buapeng and foster 2008 lorphensri et al 2016 the timeline of groundwater policy implementation since 2008 is presented in fig 10 by 2011 the policy of decentralization to local authority organizations managed groundwater resources was implemented as groundwater users did not pay the groundwater charges and conservation charges timely therefore local authorities needed to collect the groundwater charge more strictly khon kaen is also the pilot area of decentralization mayors municipalities and chairs of t a o tambon or subdistrict administrative organization are the representatives of the director of dgr to implement the plans and mission to manage groundwater at the local level i e well drilling cleaning and maintenance groundwater charges dgr 2017 regarding the policies related to groundwater contamination and level monitoring there have been policies adopted by dgr and other authorities dgr set up monitoring wells to monitor the groundwater level and contamination around the country in addition there is the ministerial regulation on groundwater contamination control in the factories announced by the minister of industry in 2016 and amendment in 2020 the rule required factories to report the result of soil and groundwater quality dgr 2021 the situation of groundwater resources in khon kaen and policy responses over time is presented in fig 11 although the groundwater act has been enacted since 1977 and amended in 1992 and 2003 to include the control measures i e groundwater quality control critical zoning licensing and tariff etc groundwater withdrawals have been climbing since 2003 in khon kaen after a decade it is found that the total groundwater withdrawals reduced 22 47 in 2012 1 year it may be linked to the decentralized policy implemented to manage groundwater resources in khon kaen after that groundwater withdrawals have been climbing up and was almost 19 million m3 year 109 40 in 2019 moreover the groundwater level in monitoring wells 5 in 9 wells has been on a downward trend in addition there has been inequality of water allocation in the province since industrial sectors got higher priority than the agricultural sector urbanek 2019 the data and analysis imply that the challenges of groundwater use in khon kaen are a lack of specific local policies in the economic sectors and cross sectoral policies to coordinate groundwater management to overcome the challenge of the increasing rate of groundwater withdrawals in khon kaen many of these water issues may be dealt with by strategic plans at the local level friend and thinphanga 2018 3 8 economic and social development plans khon kaen is steered by the national economic and social development plans since 1962 the government targeted khon kaen to be the second city and the center of the north eastern region in thailand infrastructure development was expanded as well as urbanization industrial commercial expansion and tourist destination yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 infrastructure development and international trading in khon kaen the 9th plan of nesdp led to the increase in groundwater withdrawals from 2003 to 2006 even with the groundwater act is being enforced moreover reference to the 8th plan of nesdp manufacturing development attracted more people to work in the province decentralization is the linkage of accountability power and financial capital from the central government to local authorities krutchon 2015 the national economic and social development board nesdb has also supported decentralization as a measure to promote a small government formulate development programs increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their implementation and reduce gaps between urban and rural areas jaica 2008 khon kaen smart city planning is included in the 12th national social and economic plan 2017 2021 a smart city is the new challenge of urban development with massive investment urbanization and migration occurring in the city pechpakdee 2020 despite the transitions of political structures and national policies khon kaen has been developed continuously for over a half century yongvanit and thungsakul 2013 meanwhile large numbers of development projects were implemented in the city the marginalized and vulnerable groups in slum communities have also been impacted especially with the development of the double track railway residents who live nearby the railway were forced to clear the houses and move out of the radian 20 m from the center of the railway marks 2019 these are the concerning issues that may imply the inequality of socio economic development in the smart city 4 discussion 4 1 climate and socio economic pressures on groundwater khon kaen is targeted to be the core area of the northeast region in thailand since 1967 the 2nd plan of national economic and social development the government has supported infrastructure and economic development to boost up khon kaen to be the second city to underline bangkok from 2003 to 2006 groundwater withdrawal is a significant increase in business use since there are many development programs in khon kaen the expansion of international trading among the gms countries led to attracting investments in both small and large projects of infrastructure development i e road expansion east west economic corridor ewec and logistic hub the smart city plan is under the national policy called thailand 4 0 khon kaen is also the pilot area to initiate khon kaen smart city the smart city plan aims to boost the economy with digital technology as well as urban planning jenrangsan and saengkord 2019 naprathansuk 2017 prawanne 2020 the average temperature demonstrated an upward trend while average rainfall has had no trend in the last 40 years in khon kaen several studies found that rising temperature will intensify the global water cycle and change precipitation patterns wang et al 2016 which affect groundwater level and natural groundwater recharge reduction salem et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2020 furthermore rainfall is the key supporter of natural aquifer recharges oke and alowo 2021 in this case rainfall has no trend however many pieces of research underlined a particular issue is rainfall extremes have an impact on water resources and supply systems owor et al 2009 taylor et al 2013 thomson et al 2019 furthermore the groundwater level in some monitoring wells shows a downward trend since 2004 some studies agreed with the uncertainty of rainfall resulted in the reduction of average annual groundwater storage shrestha and saraphirom 2018 pratoomchai et al 2014 at phon monitoring well the groundwater level was highly reduced when business groundwater extraction increased meanwhile groundwater levels reduced moderately when agricultural groundwater extraction increased the finding implied that there is a strong association between groundwater extracted by the business sector and groundwater level in monitoring wells groundwater use in the business sector increased again since 2016 as smart city plans were initiated in khon kaen it is possible that smart cities attracted workforces in different sectors especially the business sector prawanne 2020 thus business and industrial development in the smart city plan affected groundwater withdrawals in addition the industrial establishment increased from 2016 to 2017 however groundwater policies and measures cannot effectively control the large volume of groundwater withdrawals in the business sector in addition there are some issues in groundwater regulations in khon kaen including groundwater exploitation by local authorities dgr 2020 since local government authorities allowed groundwater resources to be used for tap water production for domestic use some local departments provide it to the industrial sector this is an illegal case under the groundwater act therefore dgr called for local departments to implement in accordance with the license under groundwater act dgr 2020 groundwater use in domestic households significantly increased with urban area expansion 22 53 household increase 10 12 and population growth 0 17 in khon kaen from 2005 to 2006 from 2011 to 2012 groundwater withdrawal in domestic use significant declined 57 66 when the socio economic development policy that is 10th nesdp 2007 2011 targeted the decentralization to local authorities it led to political changes in the administrative system and local administration was charged to provide and manage public services locally moreover groundwater license and decentralization to local authority organizations to manage groundwater resources were enforced to collect groundwater charges more strictly in 2012 the determination of groundwater zones and groundwater depths aimed to clarify the scope of groundwater resources the law determines water that is deeper than 15 m from the soil surface is a groundwater resource from 2014 to 2016 domestic groundwater use has increased by 7 60 6 98 0 65 increase in the household urban area and population growth respectively since 2017 domestic use declined it is possible that the national strategic plans monre dgr plans and groundwater license amendment can control the use of groundwater for domestic purposes in the future groundwater use in the agricultural sector has increased little since 2005 and was quite stable until 2014 the agricultural area has declined since 2006 the area was changed to an urban and built up area including farmers selling the land to a businessman van ninh and waisurasingha 2018 ongsomwang et al 2019 phatchaney and chamaratana 2018 there was a 58 35 decrease in groundwater withdrawals in the agricultural sector between 2011 and 2013 this reduction of groundwater withdrawals may result from the decentralization policy by 2014 a double increase in agricultural use gradually resulted from a 0 084 increase in agricultural land between 2013 and 2015 however 8 16 decrease in gpp agriculture between 2014 and 2019 the finding highlights the increasing trend of agricultural groundwater withdrawals in the study area while gpp agriculture declined between 2014 and 2019 it can be implied that groundwater is still inefficiently used by the agricultural sector according to chuenchum et al 2018 the study indicated that thailand needs to increase the effectiveness of the production processes and technology specifically in the agricultural sector to decrease the amount of water usage further the findings show the upward trends among anthropogenic development population number urban area number of tourists gpp gpp shared agriculture gpp shared industry and gpp shared hotel and restaurants the socio economic trends have been increasing significantly including the upward trends that need to be controlled to reduce groundwater use among sectors scholars highlighted the pressures from the population on groundwater ojeda olivares et al 2019 indicated that population growth has increased water consumption and the extreme pressure on groundwater supply thus the finding reflects that population growth is the key pressure on higher groundwater extraction since the strong correlation between groundwater extraction and population number sharp et al 2013 indicated that urbanization has an impact on the increasing rate of groundwater abstraction our data revealed that the highest groundwater pumping is for the business sector in khon kaen meanwhile the findings here show that the total groundwater withdrawal and groundwater use among economic sectors have been increasing significantly moreover the total groundwater withdrawal is highly positively correlated with an urban area tourist and gpp respectively another paper also agreed that population growth and urbanization of the modder river catchment resulted in increasing water demands and excessive pumping oke and alowo 2021 hence groundwater withdrawals are associated with socioeconomic developments significantly in this case we use gpp to examine the correlation between economic development and groundwater withdrawals to show the economic growth at the provincial level several scholars confirmed the influences of gdp on groundwater use they indicated that gdp per capita in the primary industry requires an increase in groundwater consumption qiu et al 2018 the findings suggested that socio economic trends i e population growth urban area and number of tourists in khon kaen have been increased whereas total gpp and gpp shared are also climbing it implies that as economic development population and urban area tended to increase groundwater resources were increasingly extracted from aquifer storage it should be managed closely by responsible authorities including multi stakeholders to immediately control and monitor groundwater extraction and implement artificial aquifer recharges in the study area 4 2 policies and governance response to pressures on groundwater resources groundwater governance can address the balance of water use between socio economic activities and ecosystem preservation unesco 2021 the rapid growth of the urban population economic development in the megacities including the massive migration to the urban area are challenged to sdg6 water and sanitation in addition the anthropogenic and climate pressures also interrupt good groundwater governance furthermore state led management may have been weakening since there is some complexity in the governmental organizations i e resource mismanagement inappropriate legal and institutional arrangements weak institutional capacity a lack of cooperation in multi level and a lack of budgets and investments mauroner et al 2021 unesco 2021 rapid socio economic development as well as climate situation may accelerate the groundwater withdrawals and have several impacts on groundwater level in khon kaen piyapong et al 2019 indicated the low institutional capacity in terms of users participation in groundwater management in thailand since a lack of capacity from governments to include groundwater users in the groundwater management process thus groundwater users are unwilling and have low motivation to participate in decision making implementation and monitoring processes some groundwater users did not percept the situation of the groundwater crisis piyapong et al 2019 this situation may lead to the lack of groundwater users awareness of groundwater use and the higher demand for groundwater in the uncertainty of complex groundwater management although national groundwater use policies measures and regulations introduced intensively in the last 20 years there has been an increase in groundwater extractions in khon kaen it is possible that this is due to the lack of cooperation among organizations and broader groups of stakeholders at the local level this paper is in line with mitter and schmid 2021 which highlighted the efficiency of regional specific groundwater policies that can help to sustain groundwater availability our study here study implied that local policies may help to reduce groundwater extraction to balance the ecosystem of groundwater resources in khon kaen similarly shrestha and saraphirom 2018 investigated policies related to groundwater resources in thailand they indicated that the limitation of groundwater access causes the pause of development in the state therefore it should be controlled by effective policies they recommended that since the agricultural and industrial sectors have withdrawn groundwater resources at a high rate policies related to agriculture and industries should address the impacts to cope with the issues to sustainable use in the future in the same way this current study revealed that the business sector is the bulk users in khon kaen thus local policies associated with groundwater use in the business sector should be formulated by ensuring multi stakeholder participation in the policy making process including economic policy instruments i e increasing groundwater tariff and conservation charges etc to overcome the challenges of a large amount of groundwater withdrawals in the business sector when it is compared to the control measures of groundwater use in bangkok and its vicinities it is found that many policies were implemented intensively i e increasing groundwater tariff and conservation charge expanding of metropolitan and provincial waterworks authorities to supply surface water instead etc after these policies were implemented groundwater abstraction and land subsidence were reduced many scholars confirmed the effectiveness of policy implementation in bangkok to cope with land subsidence and groundwater abstraction buapeng and foster 2008 gupta and babel 2005 lorphensri et al 2016 ngoc et al 2015 however groundwater policies are still ineffective to control groundwater withdrawals at the local level the groundwater tariff in khon kaen is only 3 50 baht m3 0 10 m3 since the city is outside the critical zone according to the groundwater act and people who lack tap water access are allowed to use groundwater for free further groundwater users do not have to pay conservation charges like bangkok and its vicinity moreover there is a lack of participatory groundwater monitoring at the community level i e groundwater contamination and depletion it is possible that groundwater is extracted at risk and groundwater users are not aware of the significance of groundwater resources if there are a lack of control measures in specific issues or areas the impacts of groundwater exploitation will occur unavoidably i e land subsidence seawater intrusion into aquifer groundwater depletion and contamination conflicts among users etc 5 conclusion groundwater has a key function to support socio economic development in khon kaen so far the socio economic development has increased over the last two decades population growth urban expansion tourist arrival gpp while the trends of groundwater extraction among economic sectors were found to rise especially massive groundwater use in the business sector furthermore socio economic development was strongly correlated to groundwater extraction rainfall and temperature were also the key climate pressures on groundwater level while groundwater level tended to decline the results of this study reveal that there have been inadequate and ineffective groundwater policies to control groundwater extraction in the study area in part due to the top down institutional arrangements though there have been economic instruments groundwater tariff is comparatively low and users do not need to pay conservation charges at the critical zone although dgr attempted to decentralize groundwater management at the local level decentralization policy is still weak due to a lack of knowledge in groundwater management of local governments moreover a lack of cooperation across organizations heterogeneous stakeholders groundwater users and weakness of institutional capacity may lead to the rising trends of groundwater extraction among sectors many urbanizing cities in the gms region also faced groundwater challenges similar to this case study area groundwater has been intensively used and has economic significance in vietnam dam et al 2016 however vietnam has confronted the issues of groundwater level drops in hanoi and ho chi minh city which are rapidly urbanizing areas the rapid increase in groundwater uses in hcmc is due to the economic development policies rapid industrialization and urbanization furthermore surface water work cannot respond to the higher water demand in the city consequently free of groundwater charges and uncontrollable groundwater exploitation are the key challenges of groundwater management in hcmc ohgaki 2007 similarly in cambodia industrial zones have been rapidly expanding and have led to problems of groundwater contamination from untreated industrial wastes recently trends of groundwater exploitation for industrial and agricultural use are getting higher thus the major challenges are overexploitation without legal control of groundwater use although groundwater management is partially included in the water resources law ngoc et al 2015 in conclusion the urbanizing cities faced similar challenges of groundwater management in the gms region the first challenge is socio economic development i e rapid urbanization industrialization population growth in the urban area another is groundwater use i e intensive use over exploitation level drops pollution lacks of strength policies and legal controls thus the way forward requires the consideration of good groundwater governance to balance between groundwater use in economic sectors and economic development to respond to sustainable development goals sdgs sdg6 water and sanitation and enhancing the capacity of groundwater governance at the local level beyond to transboundary aquifer management among gm s urbanizing cities to ensure sustainable groundwater withdrawals furthermore the strength of institutional capacity is also a significant pillar to shape strong groundwater governance unesco 2021 thus the effective groundwater policies i e increasing the tariff conservation charges expanding provincial waterworks authorities to supply the surface water instead participatory groundwater monitoring amongst groundwater users etc the horizontal cooperation across sectors clear roles and responsibilities among organizations bottom up approaches decentralization and multi stakeholder engagement should be more addressed in groundwater management especially the local level to overcome the challenges of rapid socio economic development urbanization and climate resilience on groundwater resources in the urbanizing cities in the gms region funding sources

11819,drinking water is limited in quantity and quality in fast growing cities in developing countries water quality has been impacted by competing demands by industry municipal supplies and agriculture this study investigates groundwater quality in three urban centres in the semiarid sokoto basin north western nigeria the study employed in situ and laboratory analyses and 30 water samples were analysed physical parameters ph temp ec and tds were analysed using hand held metres during sampling separate water samples were collected to determine chemical parameters ca2 cu2 fe3 k mg2 na zn2 cl co3 2 hc03 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 results indicate that most sampling locations in the study area have good quality water 10 of sampling locations fell in the poor water class based on the water quality index wqi iron fe3 and no3 were the major pollutants and occurred at concentrations above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines hydrogeochemical facies revealed ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water types there is no dominant water type in the cation triangle though the cl water type is formed in an anion triangle rock weathering controls groundwater quality primarily as revealed by multivariate statistical analysis and the gibbs model the hca results showed that though clusters 1 and 2 can be classified as no3 polluted boreholes the boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions the study therefore concludes that despite the increased urbanisation in the semiarid sokoto basin there is little evidence of groundwater quality deterioration the wqi and multivariate statistics provide a framework for researchers who may require more accurate results while considering multiple groundwater quality parameters this approach can be applied in other urban centres mainly in arid and semiarid environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index multivariate statistical analysis urban groundwater degradation silicate weathering gibbs model 1 introduction the quantity and quality of groundwater have been significantly impacted by increasing demands from municipal supplies industry and agriculture worldwide green et al 2011 larson et al 2013 sophocleous 2004 srinivasan et al 2013 estimates showed that by 2050 the urban water demand would grow by 80 over 27 of global cities would have more water demand exceeding surface water capacity flörke et al 2018 consequently 19 of global cities that depend on surface water transfers may have greater tension between the agricultural and urban sectors in eighty percent of the high conflict breakpoints improved agrarian water use could make adequate water for municipal supply flörke et al 2018 however groundwater is progressively developed in dry environments to augment the surface water deficit alfarrah and walraevens 2018 vaux 2010 this has resulted in institutional constraints on groundwater quality management rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 in semiarid regions such as the sokoto basin different pollutants are added to the surface and groundwater from agricultural activities especially irrigation farming and municipal sources mainly from sewage septic tanks naidoo and olaniran 2013 wali and alias 2020 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e yuce et al 2005 the impact of aridity and rapid urbanisation have made access to potable water decrease in quality and quantity in rapidly expanding cities in developing countries cohen 2006 vairavamoorthy et al 2008 van vliet et al 2021 water supply development processes are being taken with less attention to improved water supply particularly in developing regions leading to increased scarcity of potable water in urban areas amare et al 2017 consequently there is increased concern by policymakers researchers and managers about urban water security hoekstra et al 2018 lutz ley et al 2021 zhu and chang 2020 urbanisation is accompanied by water quality degradation metropolitan water allocation is generally gauged by per capita water accessibility at the municipal level krueger et al 2019 thus urbanisation has severe consequences on groundwater quality carlson et al 2011 devi and nair 2021 grimmeisen et al 2016 kapembo et al 2021 similarly the actual causes of groundwater pollution resulting from urbanisation are well documented they includemunicipal and industrial sewage and changing land use jiang et al 2008 lerner and harris 2009 li and merchant 2013 and overexploitation or depletion of groundwater sources custodio 2002 jia et al 2019 pradinaud et al 2019 consequently evaluating urban groundwater quality in semiarid areas such as the sokoto basin using the water quality index wqi is essential for groundwater quality rating and determine its suitability for public water supply there is a steady increase in groundwater quality analysis using wqi because understanding groundwater quality is a robust tool for improved and efficient groundwater quality management seifi et al 2020 for instance an evaluation of groundwater quality using improved wqi and human health risk in the semiarid northwest china region by zhang et al 2020 revealed that children are more susceptible to water pollution than adults groundwater quality assessment and analysis of factors impacting groundwater quality variability in shiraz iran showed that the hydrochemistry of groundwater was more influenced by human activities than the natural geogenic processes badeenezhad et al 2020 groundwater hydrochemical characterisation and quality evaluation using integrated wqi in a densely populated urban shaanxi china indicated that ancient groundwater pollution was a significant factor causing poor groundwater quality gao et al 2020 in the rift valley of ethiopia the wqi in urban abaya chemo showed that 64 and 7 of groundwater sources fell between good to excellent drinking water categories aragaw and gnanachandrasamy 2021 assessment of groundwater using wqi in urban ranchi india revealed that 5 71 40 00 and 54 28 of groundwater sources fell within poor good and excellent categories respectively roy et al 2021 in the sedimentary plain of the atibaia river brazil most of the studied groundwater sources have excellent indices and are suitable for drinking rupias et al 2021 on the other hand groundwater quality assessment in the basement complex areas of north central nigeria using wqi indicated a higher level of pollution using gis an evaluation of wqi in maharashtra district india revealed that groundwater is unsuitable for drinking dandge and patil 2022 since urbanisation is usually accompanied by groundwater quality degradation urban groundwater quality management requires continuous evaluation and long term monitoring to ensure accessibility to the water of good quality khan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a 2019b thus multivariate statistical modelling provides a user friendly tool for urban groundwater quality analysis groundwater quality analysis is a multivariate problem multivariate statistics has been successfully applied to assess the variability of groundwater and source identification at sampling or monitoring locations apollaro et al 2022 bhat et al 2021 de andrade et al 2008 jabbo et al 2022 nosrati and van den eeckhaut 2012 radelyuk et al 2021 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhao et al 2011 therefore multivariate statistical modelling presents a simple tool for groundwater quality analysis by reducing data into a more interpretable form the principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca are extensively applied to study the correlation between hydrochemical elements and identify sources of ions elkashouty et al 2021 halim et al 2010 ouyang 2005 wang et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 multivariate statistical modelling enables the classification of groundwater quality data obtained on more than one dependent variable or component since these ions tend to be correlated to some natural and human processes statistical dependence is regularly considered during data analysis long 2013 thus multivariate statistical modelling is a potentially promising tool for solving hydrogeochemical problems applying a robust statistical technique including multivariate statistical analysis to understand a complex water system the significance of urban groundwater quality monitoring has been demonstrated using multivariate statistical modelling bengraïne and marhaba 2003 boonkaewwan et al 2021 lusiana et al 2022 roy et al 2021 therefore it is a suitable tool for evaluating urban groundwater quality because the correlations between analytical variables generate better descriptors than the variables themselves parinet et al 2004 several research on urban groundwater quality has been carried out across the world results showed pollution of groundwater with a wide range of chemicals of human health concerns carlson et al 2011 lapworth et al 2018 mccance et al 2018 minnig et al 2018 pandith et al 2017 roy et al 2018 szekeres et al 2018 wali et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore assessing urban water quality is essential since it helps define the effects of clustered urban living on groundwater quality breton 1996 the arid and semiarid regions are most influenced by environmental change i e reduced rainfall and anthropogenic activities to a lesser degree dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 geological material and anthropogenic activities are known to predispose groundwater quality therefore increased urbanisation can cause groundwater pollution adversely affecting human health and the natural environment aithani et al 2020 jia et al 2018 zuccarello et al 2021 in addition uncontrolled effluent discharge from municipal sewage and farming activities and permeation of urban surface wash off can lead to groundwater pollution for instance the hydrochemistry of urban aquifers in hebei province china has become more diverse and complex hydrochemically due to human activities zhang et al 2019a 2019b in addition seepage from spoiled gutters presents a significant source of contaminated recharge in groundwater aquifers especially those found under porous media peralta and hibbs 2020 yao and sun 2020 most groundwater quality parameters are subject to significant variations in space and time dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 schot and pieber 2012 the natural manipulating factors result from changes in precipitation erosion and rock weathering the anthropogenic changes result from urban industrial and agricultural activities and overexploitation of aquifers chatton et al 2016 foster and chilton 2003 li et al 2019 these influences act together to generate varied water types in space and time therefore groundwater evaluation and monitoring using wqi are required to determine whether the observed changes or composition can be attributed to natural or anthropogenic origins of kebbi state s population of 3 80 million about 778 390 live in northern kebbi state and about 70 live in urban areas wali et al 2018a b c d therefore understanding the groundwater quality in urban kebbi state is critical hydrochemical characterisation of urban groundwater in urban areas of southwestern sokoto basin nigeria by waliet al 2018 showed that groundwater quality had been less impacted by urbanisation however findings may differ with land use and geology even within the same basin therefore this study uses water quality indices and multivariate statistical analysis to characterise groundwater in the urban centres of northern kebbi state northwestern sokoto basin 2 the study area 2 1 location and climate kebbi state is situated between latitude 100 8 and 130 15 north of the equator and longitude 30 30 e kebbi state occupies about 36 800 km2 as shown in fig 1 kebbi state has an estimated population of 3 80 million the climate is hot semiarid tropical and characterised by a long dry season between october and may rainfall is short but intensive it lasts between may june and september october there is an overall decrease in annual rainfall from southern to northern parts of the state fig 2 summarises yearly temperature precipitation and humidity in argungu birnin kebbi and jega for 2021 the temperature in sokoto basin is generally high and varies significantly with seasons mean maximum temperature reaches a peak in april at 40 c the mean minimum temperature is the lowest in december at 25 c fig 2a c the soil temperature examination indicates the hyperthermic soil temperature regime wali and bakari 2016 rainfall is highly variable and rises southward annual rainfall ranges from 500 mm to over 1200 mm in the south most precipitation falls in july august and september fig 2c e relative humidity reaches a peak in august 60 and is lowest in december relative humidity in the dry season ranges from 10 to 30 there is a general upsurge in relative humidity during the dry season from north to south the relative humidity reaches over 60 in july and august fig 2g i the evaporation rate is generally high and the study area can be classified as having a ustic soil moisture regime 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of kebbi state is characteristic of sokoto basin mainly sedimentary in character with some outcrops of basement complex rocks in the south kogbe 1981 wali and bakari 2016 moreover the underlying aquifers are characteristic of the aquifers of the sokoto basin gwandu and illo formations are the best known aquifers and are primarily sandy overlying the dukamaje and kalambaina formations wali et al 2019a 2019b illo and gwandu formations show many features in common and are thus treated together in most literature in southern kebbi state s upland areas pre cambrian basement complex groundwater is primarily obtainable in minor quantities from fissures or other tabular separations and the regoliths anderson and ogilbee 1973 the detailed geological and stratigraphical description of the sokoto basin is well documented in the literature emujakporue et al 2018 kogbe 1981 moody 1997 nwankwo 2015 omolabi and fagbohun 2019 the study area s geological and hydrogeological configurations have been further illustrated in the supplementary data attached to this paper the sampled locations are situated over the gwandu formation recharge into the gwandu aquifer is predominantly by infiltration from rainfall and overflow on the outcrop zone groundwater extraction is chiefly by withdrawal from shallow wells deep wells boreholes are increasingly constructed in urban centres adelana et al 2002a geyh and wirth 1980 boreholes tapping the aquifer contribute to the municipal water supply at birnin kebbi but the calculated withdrawal was less than 100 000 gpd anderson and ogilbee 1973 a geoelectric survey for groundwater exploration at birnin kebbi by usman 2019 showed that a single borehole can produce up to 7000 gallons per hour gph and up to 18 000 gph by airlift between 110 and 305 m in depth notwithstanding the potential presented by the hydrological setting many urban centres in kebbi state are still struggling with drinking water scarcity and rely on individual and community dug wells or boreholes for water supply some of these water sources dry up entirely during prolonged dry spells while water levels in aquifers are sensitive to rainfall changes their longer term hydrogeochemical properties remain very difficult to understand under the current environmental conditions anderson and ogilbee 1967 1973 macdonald et al 2012 mackie et al 2021 the groundwater table in the study area is often shallow making it vulnerable to pollution by anthropogenic activities the gwandu aquifer the most promising usually receives its recharge in the east where it outcrops making it prone to contamination the formation lies uncomfortably on the kalambaina formation the sediments are continental in derivation and consist of interbedded partially merged sands and clays anderson and ogilbee 1967 1973 obaje et al 2020 the clay beds are primarily dense enormous white red grey black and brown sands range from subtle to coarse in texture kogbe 1981 wali et al 2019a 2019b the geohydrologic section of sokoto basin north western nigeria showing principal aquifers and confining beds is presented in the supplementary data the study area has a succession of semi consolidated sedimentary rocks forming undulating plains broken by clay hills in their surface expression typically the hills are capped by resistant crusts of laterite or ironstone obaje 2009 offodile 2002 the hills are mostly less than 46 m high but locally the relief between the stream valley floors fadama and the hilltops reaches 92 m anderson and ogilbee 1973 the sokoto rima river network is the primary drainage system of the sokoto basin the headwaters of the rivers rima and sokoto and their branches rise in a pre cretaceous crystalline rock environment east of the sokoto basin and flow south westward across a terrain underlain by sedimentary rocks of illo and gundumi formations the rima and sokoto groups and the gwandu formation adelana et al 2003 paul and bayode 2012 wali et al 2019a 2019b river rima and river zamfara the principal tributaries of river niger essentially drain the study area 2 3 land use several trans human herds of livestock possessed by fulani graze widely in both the fallow farmland and uncultivated fields shifting cultivation was widespread in highland areas but it is diminishing with rapid population growth and urbanisation abdullahi et al 2014 eniolorunda et al 2017 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e kebbi state has an estimated population of 3 802 525 million a significant portion of its population now lives in urban areas wali et al 2018a b c d at locations where surface water is accessible or aquifers are relatively shallow villages have been set up coupled with intensive farming especially near the fadama floodplain both in dry and wet seasons abdullahi et al 2014 yahaya 2002 near ponds and wells traditional shadoof irrigation farming is practised the recent increase in irrigation farming and urbanisation and poor waste disposal mainly landfills from municipal and industrial sources have threatened groundwater quality landfills pose a significant threat to groundwater quality including no3 ec toc cd pb sb and as pollution since aquifers receive recharge from direct infiltration and runoff aharoni et al 2020 burri et al 2019 lapworth et al 2017 uma 1993 xanke et al 2017 a theorised model for the complex processes of land use types and how they affect groundwater quality in the semiarid sokoto basin is presented in the supplementary data increasing urbanisation implied more deforestation housing industries landfills municipal waste generation and increased groundwater withdrawal the changes in land use due to urbanisation are harmful to the study area s general hydrological and hydrochemical conditions generally there is a steady decline in dense vegetation and increased urban paved surfaces nigeria and the study area in particular are fast urbanising statistics have shown that the rate of urbanisation in nigeria has risen from 43 48 to 51 96 between 2010 and 2020 o neill 2021 significant drivers of urbanisation in the study area have been the urgent need for housing and the associated socioeconomic demands thus groundwater pollution from municipal and industrial sewage is expected to rise with increasing urbanisation in the sokoto basin 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure the study area was divided into three clusters argungu birnin kebbi and jega a total of 30 boreholes i e deep wells 40 m were studied physical parameters including temperature ec ph and tds were analysed in situ using hand held metres table 1 water quality metres were calibrated by deionised water before in situ measurements of physical parameters discrete samples were carried in a 1 l polyethene bottle for laboratory analysis sampling bottles were first rinsed with deionised water and dried before taking samples groundwater sampling was conducted during the dry season the rationale for groundwater sampling during the dry season is that the urban aquifers are more stable hydrochemically and are less influenced by groundwater recharge from rainfall infiltration during the wet season groundwater samples were kept in shielded boxes 5 c following marghade et al 2011 groundwater samples were analysed within 24 h therefore no acid treatment for groundwater samples was made ions including potassium sodium calcium copper iron magnesium and zinc were analysed by aas rs 12 5 model no item code s 929 phosphate and nitrate were analysed using automated colourimetry bluvisiontm discrete analyser also sulfate concentration was analysed using iron chromatography agilent 6890 plus gc with fpd 7683 autosampler finally bicarbonate carbonate and chloride were analysed by titration as shown in table 1 the analyses were conducted in triplicates and results were found reproducible within the 5 error limit 3 2 water quality index in this study wqi was computed the wqi which is measured as a formidable technique that can offer a wide ranging delineation of groundwater water quality is the degree that mirrors the combined effect of multiple water quality parameters rakotondrabe et al 2017 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e thus each chemical parameter was assigned discrete weights w i on a scale of 1 most negligible impact on water quality to 5 most significant impact on water quality which is built on their supposed influence on human health and based on its relative significance in the quality of drinking water elements that have grave health concerns and whose existence beyond the fundamental absorption limits might curb the water s usability for domestic and drinking purposes e g cl tds no3 and so4 2 were allotted the highest weight of 5 in contrast elements insignificant in water quality evaluation like k were assigned a minimum weight of 1 the intermediate parameters including ph ec th and tds hco3 cl ca2 mg2 were allocated weights between 2 and 4 depending on their relative weight in the water quality assessment the relative weight w i is calculated from eq 1 eq 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where the relative weight w i the weight of each element w i and n is the number of elements the computed relative weight w i values of each element are specified in table 2 subsequently the quality rating qi for individual parameters is assigned by dividing the intensity or concentration in each water sample by its reference values given by the who 2011 and the result is converted to a percentage by multiplying 100 eq 2 q i c i s i x 100 where the quality rating is q i the intensity of each chemical parameter in each water sample in mg l is c i and the drinking water standard for the individual chemical parameter in mg l based on the guidelines of the who 2011 is s i the si i value is first determined using eq 2 before wqi is computed the equation is thus eq 3 s i i w i x q i eq 4 w q i i 1 n s i where s i i is the sub index of the ith parameter q i presents the quality rating based on the concentration of the ith parameter the calculated wqi values are categorised into five classes in table 3 3 3 statistical analysis analysis of hydrochemical data is a multivariate problem hydrochemical data were first summarised and standardised using basic descriptive statistics mean minimum maximum and standard error table 3 subsequently pearson s correlation r was applied to test the correlation between physical and chemical components of groundwater following marghade et al 2011 however a non parametric test kruskal wallis was used to test a significant difference in groundwater composition between urban centres using several samples anova table 3 this approach allows for comparing several independent random samples and can be used as a non parametric replacement for the one way anova wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e wali et al 2019a 2019b https www statsdirect com help references reference list htm the kruskal wallis test statistic for k samples each of size n i is defined viz 5 t 1 s 2 i 1 k r i n i n n 1 2 4 where n is the sum all in and r i is the sum of the ranks from all samples drawn for the ith sample and 6 s 2 1 n 1 a l l r i j 2 n n 1 2 4 the test s null hypothesis is that all k distribution functions are equal the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the measurements produces more significant values than at least one of the other measurements 3 3 1 multivariate statistical modelling another way of applying multivariate analysis in water quality analysis is by chemical balance error cbe where the data on water quality can be subjected to internal consistency tests yidana et al 2018 therefore it is beneficial to apply cbe to test the internal consistency of hydrochemical data 7 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s x 100 where the entire absorptions of cations and anions are

cations and anions must not vary by more than 5 the variation of cations and anions is within 5 in the current analysis indicating the validity of the data employed 3 3 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca is widely applied for interpreting groundwater chemistry reducing the study location s analytic data is the prime objective of using pca which tends to be interconnected to a less significant interpretable set of principal components or pcs alias et al 2014 machiwal and jha 2015 wali et al 2021 although some corresponding data may be missing during transformation the system s explanation is considerably reduced hildebrandt et al 2008 the pca bilinear model can be rearranged following the matrix decomposition equation 8 x t p t e where a matrix data is given by x which is reduced into t scores of matrices and pt matrix of loadings plus e matrix residual 3 3 3 hierarchical clustering analysis the hca s critical role is discretising the hydrochemical elements in a raw data matrix or pc scores into individual clusters the user selects devoid of prior assumptions the hca is an unsubstantiated clustering method that exposes intrinsic groups or recognises a dataset s arrangement devoid of a previous hypothesis concerning the data thus the system s items can be grouped into bands based on their similarities lin et al 2012 wali et al 2021 the ward s algorithmic grouping procedure after the euclidean distance squared was applied it is considered a highly efficient method of clustering before the grouping analysis the spotted

groundwater are presented in table 4 and fig 3 a e as shown in table 4 the physical parameters ec ph and tds are within who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines groundwater temperature is above 30 c and differs significantly p 0 0209 between the studied urban centres i e argungu birnin kebbi and jega the variation of temperature 10 c in groundwater aquifers can lead to doubling chemical reactions mitchell and ferris 2005 saito et al 2016 above 30 c temperature affects palatable water taste assessing electrical conductivity in groundwater is essential since it is a valuable marker of the water s available ionic content day and nightingale 1984 nordstrom et al 1989 the ec informs the extent of salinity in groundwater however in arid environments such as the sokoto basin flash floods with polluted water may temporarily alter the ec level in groundwater though at the same time the water table may also rise reddy and nagabhushanam 2012 reddy et al 2011 the tds concentration did not differ significantly between the urban centres however there is a significant difference in ph p 0 0020 between the three urban centres mean ph at argungu and birnin kebbi showed slightly acidic groundwater whereas groundwater is alkaline at jega the most acidic water naturally occurred in the eastern section of the sokoto basin and the south the low ph is derived from pyrites oxidation anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e just after sokoto town at dange ph is 5 1 at borehole gsn 3512 3 7 at borehole gsn 3520 and it is 3 7 at 177 km borehole gsn 3519 along the sokoto gusau road groundwater in this zone has lower tds 28 79 mg 1 the major anion is so4 2 which is derived from pyrites oxidation anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e this process is responsible for lower ph in the sokoto basin even though the ph level has less impact on consumers it is essential to understand groundwater quality moderate ph in drinking water is required depending on groundwater composition and aquifer properties the significance of ph in groundwater quality analysis is that it controls other water quality parameters behaviour for instance when bicarbonate and carbonate ions interact with calcium or magnesium it advances as caco3 or mgco3 iglikowska et al 2020 wang et al 2011 2013 the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in groundwater aquifers drop relative to sodium and the sar index increases this causes an alkalising effect and elevated ph levels in groundwater the mean tds was higher in argungu suggesting more rock mineral dissolution however variation of tds in groundwater can indicate groundwater pollution from anthropogenic activities zhao et al 2013 however changes in ph and temperature can cause considerable changes in tds oyem et al 2014 temperature changes 5 10 c in groundwater cause noticeable tds variations wali et al 2018a b c d other aspects that control tds in aquifers include the minerals found in the aquifer the chronological extent to which the groundwater is in contact with the rock minerals and the groundwater s chemical state nelson 2002 table 4 and fig 3f r summarised the cation and anion chemistry of groundwater nitrate is the outstanding anion and occurs at levels above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines for drinking water quality apart from high fe3 and no3 all the analysed cations and anions are within who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines for drinking water quality as shown in table 4 this finding is concurrent with the previous studies on groundwater quality in sokoto basin the literature showed that groundwater sources have high iron 32 mg 1 and mn levels 2 mg 1 contents in the sokoto basin in most of the studied boreholes there were low ph and high iron resulting in corrosion of water pipes anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2018a b c d wali et al 2019a 2019b many groundwater sources tapping the rima aquifer in the vicinity of sokoto metropolis and elsewhere along the river sokoto floodplains including argungu and birnin kebbi have high fe3 14 mg 1 and adequate mn to contribute to the staining properties of the fe3 anderson and ogilbee 1973 in the same vein previous studies have reported no3 pollution in shallow groundwater around sokoto town uma 1993 therefore the high nitrate level in deep wells is derived from anthropogenic activities municipal sewage mainly soakaways since the study area s geology is primarily sandy allowing for groundwater recharge directly from infiltration of rainfall it is typical of the gwandu formation the primary geological formation in the study area obaje 2009 offodile 2002 notably nitrate is also derived from atmospheric n deposition water treatment soil organic material urban runoff landfills rotting containers metropolitan sewage chemical fertilisers and animal wastes fytianos and christophoridis 2004 volk 2014 conversely current contaminating activities i e agriculture would unceasingly influence the nitrate concentration in the study area similarly if the groundwater extraction is accelerated mainly by urbanisation and irrigation farming no3 exuberance can be faster in the inundated zone however nitrate movement tends to be lower as a lag time 20 years between the pollution activity and exposure to no3 as exemplified in the supplementary data volk 2014 the significance of no3 in drinking water above 50 mg l depends on the fact that high no3 can be hazardous to babies blue baby syndrome wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e thus it is essential to classify groundwater based on tds no3 and total hardness 4 2 groundwater classification based on tds total hardness and nitrate classification of groundwater based on tds revealed that groundwater samples from argungu birnin kebbi and jega fell in excellent class based on total hardness groundwater varied from soft to hard as summarised in table 5 the rima group s aquifer has moderately hard water anderson and ogilbee 1973 however based on nitrate pollution groundwater sources fall in severe class which presents a potential human health risk table 5 4 3 water quality index the water quality index wqi was computed and summarised in table 6 the wqi ranged from 47 23 to 181 38 in argungu 41 93 to 201 16 in birnin kebbi and 35 36 to 106 41 in jega based on wqi the urban aquifers of kebbi state contained water of good excellent quality as shown in the supplementary data for example in argungu and birnin kebbi 80 of samples are good water 10 are excellent water and 10 are poor in jega 70 are good water 20 are excellent water and 10 are poor although the literature on wqi in the sokoto basin was not accessible an assessment of groundwater quality using wqi from the adjacent niger basin showed that groundwater water was of medium quality except for a few unsuitable samples yisa et al 2012 4 4 silicate weathering and ion exchange process the scholler index cl na k cl was applied to assess the ion exchange process results indicate that all the analysed water samples n 30 have positive scholler indices indicating overall base exchange reactions chloro alkaline balance when ca2 and mg2 exchange with na and k the indices would be positive chloro alkaline balance chloro alkaline disequilibrium occurs when indices are negative however where alkaline rock is replaced with na ions hco3 ca2 mg2 it designates base exchange soft water hard water is developed if na ions are replaced with alkaline earths ca2 mg2 hco3 marghade et al 2011 the silicate weathering was studied using a molar ratio na cl developed by meybeck 1987 results showed that 55 of the analysed groundwater samples have a molar ratio of less than 1 it suggests that na was not derived from silicate weathering the cation exchange of ca2 mg2 and na can produce high levels of na marghade et al 2011 sodium is mainly found as na ions therefore it is connected to class 2 water hazards i e a high na level is associated with health risks anim gyampo et al 2019 however nacl presents little or no health risk associated with a class 1 water hazard the significance of na in drinking water is its combined effect with sulfate generally na absorption in groundwater is temperature dependent and the accompanying anion takdastan et al 2018 when the molar ratio is above 1 it informs deficiency in ca2 and mg2 equivalent to ca2 na cation exchange thus it leads to the development of soft water there is no deficiency of ca2 and mg2 in about 55 of the studied locations it implied that most of the study area s groundwater sources fall in a soft moderate hard water type marghade et al 2011 typically groundwater is in concurrent close interaction with many solid mineral phases since mineral solute reactions are sluggish and water meets varying mineral formations as it moves groundwater is seldom in perfect equilibrium with the mineral solids surrounding it fitts 2013 therefore understanding groundwater chemistry mechanisms is essential for efficient groundwater quality management 4 5 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry 4 5 1 gibbs model the major sources controlling world water chemistry was assessed using a plot of weight ratio of tds versus na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 for cations and anions fig 4 shows a plot of tds versus na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios for cations and anions the diagram indicates that rock weathering is the dominant process controlling groundwater in the study area this finding concurred with gibbs 1970 the detected mechanism originates from the study area s geographical and geological background sokoto basin has a semiarid climate the soil mostly contains sands and clays of diverse textural classes the na and k ions are primarily derived from silicate weathering reactions gibbs 1970 bicarbonate is somewhat high in the studied locations it was deemed reasonable owing to carbonate minerals in the sokoto basin anderson and ogilbee 1973 the hco3 is likewise derived from silicate weathering reaction and co2 from the organic matter and soil in this study acidity is primarily in the form of a low ph level comparable results have been reported elsewhere in the sokoto basin anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2018a b c d wali et al 2019a 2019b wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e 4 5 2 the hydrogeochemical facies groundwater hydrogeochemical facies were evaluated by plotting significant cations and anions concentrations using piper 1944 s trilinear diagram fig 5 this diagram reveals the resemblances and variances between water samples because groundwater samples with comparable qualities will tend to plot together as a group selvakumar et al 2017 the study area has ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water types in the cation triangle there is no dominant water type however in an anion triangle the cl water type was formed this finding is not concurrent with the previous studies on groundwater quality in the sokoto basin previous studies showed a ca mg or mg hco3 water type suitable for domestic industrial and agricultural uses alagbe 2006 the observed discrepancy can be related to urbanisation although ca2 mg2 and so4 2 occur naturally in sokoto basin as revealed by anderson and ogilbee 1973 there is increasing proof showing chloride contamination in urban aquifers resulting from anthropogenic activities szklarek et al 2022 however high chloride occurs naturally in arid and semiarid environments karroum et al 2017 the hydrochemistry of the gwandu aquifer kebbi state is highly variable previous studies show that the primary water type is a ca mg hco3 however a na hco3 variety is found at greater depths e g at kurdula and bacaka northern kebbi state anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2019a 2019b near the outcrop area where so4 2 is abundant a ca so4 water type exists or ca na no3 water type especially from shallow aquifers dug wells and the outcrop areas generally the gwandu aquifer waters and their overlying surface water bodies are soft or moderately hard anderson and ogilbee 1973 the tds content is typically low and ph ranges from 6 6 to 7 7 indicating slightly acidic to slightly alkaline conditions table 7 further shows groundwater characterisation following piper diagram the alkaline earth ca2 mg2 exceeded the alkalis na k in 10 of the sampling locations in argungu arg birnin kebbi brk and jega jeg however the alkalis na k exceeded the alkaline ca2 mg2 earths in 90 of arg brk and jeg sampling locations primarily the alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 are the most abundant elements on the earth correspondingly na is the only abundant alkali although k occurs commonly it is ordinarily less abundant than na karmegam et al 2011 other cation elements occur in significant quantities in very concentrated natural aquifers and some aquifers of unique composition for the graphical methods treated in piper 1944 4 6 statistical application 4 6 1 correlation analysis the underlying rock properties and anthropogenic activities that effective groundwater quality can be identified using correlation analysis adams et al 2001 aris et al 2007 erdogan et al 2020 güler et al 2012 for instance anthropogenic inputs can be measured through variations in tds marghade et al 2011 ions including sodium sulfate nitrate and chloride in groundwater aquifers can result from human sources mainly municipal wastes fertiliser application and organic wastes elumalai et al 2017 jalali 2011 spruill et al 2002 a positive correlation between tds and these ions is a strong indicator of groundwater pollution from anthropogenic activities marghade et al 2011 the tds correlates positively with mg2 r 0 757 na r 0 445 and nitrate r 0 407 at argungu at birnin kebbi tds correlates positively with calcium r 0 478 and magnesium 0 431 at jega tds correlates positively with copper r 0 478 and magnesium r 0 431 strong positive correlations between tds and these elements imply that the dissolved solids in groundwater result from these elements however positive correlations between sodium and tds in argungu suggests silicate weathering reaction in the same vein tds correlates negatively r 0 102 r 0 302 with no3 cl na molar ratio at argungu and birnin kebbi the former also correlates weakly r 0 047 with no3 cl na molar ratio at jega likewise weak correlations 0 251 0 128 between tds and no3 cl hco3 molar ratio at argungu and birnin kebbi the former correlates negatively r 0 138 with no3 cl hco3 the negative and weak positive correlations indicate little or no anthropogenic inputs substantial portions of hco3 in groundwater are expected to result from carbonate dissolution marghade et al 2011 thus ca hco3 water type is produced when co2 is freed into solution by carbonate dissolution correlation between hco3 and na ca and mg2 give vibrant evidence of the stoichiometry process hco3 and ca2 were negatively correlated r 0 558 r 0 305 at argungu and jega the two ions correlated weakly r 0 241 at birnin kebbi it indicates that ca2 was not derived from calcite rocks marghade et al 2011 other non carbonate sources of ca2 include apatite fluorite and marble wali et al 2019a 2019b a weak correlation between ca2 and so4 2 r 0 256 r 0 314 indicates that most of the analysed water samples in argungu and jega are closer to the 1 1 line suggesting that ca2 in the study area might be derived from gypsum poor correlations between hco3 and ca2 and so4 2 indicate that gypsum s dissolution is the basis for ca2 and so4 2 marghade et al 2011 mineral gypsum is commonly associated with sulfur lodes and rock salts benison and bowen 2013 moncur et al 2009 chloride correlates negatively with na suggesting that na is not derived from halite the negative correlation between cl and no3 at argungu and a weak positive correlation at jega r 0 027 suggest that these pollutants were not derived from anthropogenic inputs there is a significant positive correlation r 0 623 between cl and no3 at birnin kebbi suggesting groundwater pollution from sewage a very weak correlation between so4 2 and mg2 r 0 17 suggests that so4 2 might have originated from the weathering of magnesium sulfate minerals marghade et al 2011 wali et al 2018a b c d a charge equilibrium occurs between cations and anions when ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 so4 2 originate from gypsum dissolution of dolomite and calcite no lack of ca2 mg2 relative to hco3 so4 2 and hco3 so4 2 relative to ca2 mg2 consequently there is no need for balance by major anion i e chloride owing to a lack of excess positive charge of ca2 and mg2 it implies that ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 are derived from gypsum dolomite and calcite marghade et al 2011 the detailed result of the correlation analysis is presented in the supplementary file attached to this paper 4 6 2 principal component analysis the pca was carried out to evaluate the groundwater data s interrelationships lin et al 2012 selvakumar et al 2017 the pca results comprising the loadings eigenvalues and percentages of the total variance are presented in table 8 the removal of three factors was built on the proportion of variance accumulated including an amount above 80 lin et al 2012 table 8 and fig 6 showed that these three factors explained 65 31 64 34 and 62 75 of the total variance within the data matrix for argungu birnin kebbi and jega based on the scree test the three factors with typical factor loadings suggest at least three perceptible influences controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area component 1 explained 36 44 26 95 and 27 11 of the total variance for argungu birnin kebbi and jega respectively in addition it had high positive loadings on ec tds k zn2 and po4 3 at argungu na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 at birnin kebbi as well as ec tds th hco3 and po4 3 at jega respectively component 1 can be related exclusively to rock weathering since it corresponded to high positive loadings on ions derived primarily from rock minerals it therefore suggests a geological control of groundwater chemistry component 2 which explained 18 04 20 47 and 20 28 corresponded to high positive loadings on temperature hco3 and no3 at argungu temperature cl co3 2 po4 3 and no3 at birnin kebbi as well as tds na zn2 and no3 at jega therefore component 2 can be divided between two fractional influences i e geological and anthropogenic controls the observed high positive loadings on no3 in all the three urban centres suggest anthropogenic inputs component 3 explained 15 3 16 92 and 15 36 of the total variance it corresponded to high positive loadings on ca2 fe3 and cl at argungu temperature ec tds zn2 and so4 2 at birnin kebbi th k cu2 fe3 and no3 at jega high positive loadings on ec and temperature were deemed reasonable because the temperature is closely associated with ec in aquifers the ec is a parameter of considerable importance to a water analyst it is related to the ionic water content it also informs the range of ions concentrations in water that are likely to fall wali et al 2018a b c d similarly the observed high positive loadings on total hardness th in component 1 are reasonable since th in aquifers is primarily derived from ca2 and mg2 caco3 dissolution furthermore high positive loading on hco3 in argungu and jega was deemed reasonable since co2 is released into solution by carbonate dissolution forming ca hco3 water type therefore high positive loadings on hco3 na ca2 and mg2 provide strong evidence connecting to the process of stoichiometry thus pearson s r and pca are concordant based on pca groundwater in urban kebbi state is more a product of rock weathering than anthropogenic activities the effort to analyse the raw matrix data centred on y mean i e the mean concentration of individual parameters has been deducted from individual matrix cells in the same column is shown in the biplot of pc1 and pc2 as shown in fig 6 the two components explained 50 01 47 42 and 47 39 of the data set s variability for three urban centres the results are remarkable as the parameters show a dispersivity pattern all the eighteen initially analysed parameters are visible on the biplot indicating wide variability in the data matrix these elements are selected based on their absolute sizes i e high elemental absorptions which can be established using the raw data matrix it provides the needed information for the hydrochemical and geographical understanding of the data however the observed negative loadings on ph in some factors were deemed reasonable since ph usually attained a converse relationship with ions of carbonate origin lin et al 2012 4 6 3 hierarchical cluster analysis using hca boreholes with similar hydrochemical characteristics can be grouped into a cluster the graphics collection of the clustering processes in this study is offered as a dendrogram based on the dendrogram shown in fig 7 three groups of boreholes can be discerned the first group comprises arg1 arg9 jeg8 brk5 brk3 brk2 brk1 jeg10 jeg2 and jeg7 group 2 is comprised of boreholes arg2 jeg4 arg4 arg8 brk8 arg3 brk6 jeg6 brk4 brk9 jeg3 brk10 jeg9 and jeg5 group 3 is comprised of boreholes arg 7 and arg10 generally the lithology of these boreholes comprised sandy formations of different textural classes the first group sample boreholes have high groundwater temperatures hco3 cl k cu2 fe3 and zn2 therefore it implied that these sampling locations were strongly affected by rock weathering correspondingly this cluster has lower no3 tds mg2 na ph po4 3 ca2 th co3 2 and so4 2 sampling locations with moderate ec tds mg2 na and high no3 formed the second cluster the third cluster has a higher concentration of po4 3 ca2 th co3 2 so4 2 and ph although both clusters 1 and 2 are denoted as urban boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions than boreholes in the first and second clusters 4 7 sources of urban groundwater degradation fast growing urban centres with inadequate wastewater disposal systems a common phenomenon in most developing countries have a potentially significant effect on increasing groundwater recharge than cities with sewerage systems putra and baier 2008 it can be inferred that almost all urbanisation processes can increase the groundwater recharge rate fig 8 however the effect of urbanisation on the quality of recharge is commonly low especially if wastewater is a vital component putra and baier 2008 in cities in developing countries that lack adequate sewage disposal systems 90 of abstracted groundwater may return as groundwater recharge one of the significant recharge sources would be wastewater intrusion from septic tanks i e soakaways and latrines fig 8 it is particularly applicable for cities situated on shallow aquifers and cities found along with a river system such as argungu birnin kebbi and jega however based on the current analysis there is less evidence to show groundwater pollution in urban kebbi state apart from high no3 groundwater composition is more influenced by rock weathering than anthropogenic inputs higher no3 concentration in sokoto basin was reported much earlier by uma 1993 therefore it will be difficult to infer that the reported values of no3 in this study are a consequence of increased urbanisation all the three urban centres were primarily rural when such results were revealed the study area also has a long history of human settlement and agriculture which relied heavily on organic fertilisers often manure slurries in ancient times groundwater dating 14c 13c and 3h by adelana et al 2002b reveals that aquifers of sokoto basin hold suitable quality groundwater of holocene age i e 100 to 10 000 years bp comparably a study on no3 pollution by selck et al 2018 in a semi arid alluvial basin revealed that most of the no3 polluted boreholes contained ancient groundwater signifying that no3 pollution is derived from reinfiltering groundwater from irrigation fields as is perhaps the case for the sokoto basin thus isotope analysis is required for effective groundwater quality monitoring and management the effect of urban recharge sources will always be more extensive than precipitation recharge in semiarid and arid regions coelho et al 2017 de vries and simmers 2002 haritash et al 2016 lerner 2002 however urban recharge may only balance the loss of precipitation recharge caused by the impervious surfaces in humid areas and the overall effect of urbanisation will be more insignificant in semiarid and arid regions putra and baier 2008 pollution of urban groundwater occurs when human made stuff such as road salts chemicals gasoline and oil are transported into the aquifer and cause it to become hazardous and unsuitable for use other primary sources of pollutants or impurities are hazardous waste locations landfills storage tanks septic systems as well as the pervasive application of road salts organic and inorganic fertilisers pesticides and other chemicals khatri and tyagi 2014 kumaraswamy et al 2020 nigro et al 2017 the increase of these contaminants in urban environments has presented a thought provoking topic of groundwater quality management difficulties 5 conclusion the literature is unanimous about the need to understand urbanisation s impact on groundwater quality this study s results increased one s knowledge of the critical processes controlling groundwater quality in urban areas this study found that fe3 and no3 concentrations occur above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines the study also revealed slightly acidic groundwater in argungu and birnin kebbi urban centres groundwater classification based on tds showed that tds levels were less than 500 mg l which is required for drinking additionally most sampling locations are soft however groundwater classification based on nitrate pollution showed that most sampling locations fell in the severe class the calculated wqi values also indicate that most sampling locations in the study area have water of satisfactory quality only 10 of sampling locations fell in the poor class the pca results showed that groundwater quality is controlled by the natural geogenic processes rather than anthropogenic inputs however significant correlations between tds and no3 cl na molar ratio tds and no3 cl hco3 molar ratio is a strong indicator of groundwater contamination from anthropogenic activities no3 is the major pollutant in the study area and it is derived from the fadama floodplain areas where most effluents are collected here is where most of the recharge to the aquifers is derived besides most of the irrigation farming takes place over these floodplains based on hca three groups of boreholes can be discerned although clusters 1 and 2 were classified as no3 polluted boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions than boreholes in the first and second clusters based on the piper diagram groundwater in the study area falls in the ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water type classes although there is no dominant water type in the cation triangle cl water type occurred in the anion triangle based on the gibbs model the rock weathering process controls groundwater in the study area therefore this study inferred less evidence to show the impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality in the study area however apart from high no3 all other indices used in this analysis indicated that the natural geogenic processes influence groundwater composition therefore these findings would have theoretical and practical implications 5 1 theoretical implications this study has shown how wqi and multivariate statistical analysis can benefit groundwater quality analysis thus results will enrich the literature on how wqi and multivariate statistics can be applied for groundwater quality analysis the specific implications are i theoretically this study provides the basis for groundwater quality evaluation in urban areas using wqi and multivariate statistical modelling with an acceptable level of accuracy ii this study s wqi and multivariate modelling can develop groundwater quality monitoring strategies to improve groundwater quality monitoring with associated cost reduction concerning groundwater quality analysis iii the wqi and multivariate modelling can further enrich the literature concerning a systematic approach to assessing monitoring and managing groundwater quality issues especially in semiarid environments therefore the current result may have many practical implications 5 2 practical implications this study used wqi and multivariate statistical modelling to understand the sources of ions in groundwater the practical implications are i it provides baseline data that will help to detect future changes concerning groundwater quality in the sokoto basin ii it enables the classification of drinking water sources and identification of sources of ions within urban groundwater aquifers iii it will provide policymakers with a simple tool for further analysis of issues relating to groundwater quality analysis and monitoring iv the results of this study can be applied to study nearly all types of semi arid environments concerning

are injurious to groundwater quality vi likewise it can aid decision makers in strategically enhancing the overall groundwater quality evaluation under different environmental settings with other land use practices vii this study revealed that the wqi and multivariate statistical analysis are robust tools for identifying complex relationships between different physicochemical parameters viii results indicate that the wqi and multivariate statistical modelling is suitable for environmental agencies seeking long lasting and cost effective improvement of their groundwater quality monitoring therefore future research concerning improving groundwater quality monitoring systems in semi arid environments should adopt wqi and multivariate statistical modelling the wqi and multivariate statistics provide a framework for researchers who may require more accurate results while considering multiple groundwater quality parameters the more the data set is used the more precise results are obtained this study provides a baseline and user friendly tool for decision makers to evaluate groundwater quality in their respective countries by substantially decreasing the cost and time of

11819,drinking water is limited in quantity and quality in fast growing cities in developing countries water quality has been impacted by competing demands by industry municipal supplies and agriculture this study investigates groundwater quality in three urban centres in the semiarid sokoto basin north western nigeria the study employed in situ and laboratory analyses and 30 water samples were analysed physical parameters ph temp ec and tds were analysed using hand held metres during sampling separate water samples were collected to determine chemical parameters ca2 cu2 fe3 k mg2 na zn2 cl co3 2 hc03 no3 po4 3 and so4 2 results indicate that most sampling locations in the study area have good quality water 10 of sampling locations fell in the poor water class based on the water quality index wqi iron fe3 and no3 were the major pollutants and occurred at concentrations above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines hydrogeochemical facies revealed ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water types there is no dominant water type in the cation triangle though the cl water type is formed in an anion triangle rock weathering controls groundwater quality primarily as revealed by multivariate statistical analysis and the gibbs model the hca results showed that though clusters 1 and 2 can be classified as no3 polluted boreholes the boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions the study therefore concludes that despite the increased urbanisation in the semiarid sokoto basin there is little evidence of groundwater quality deterioration the wqi and multivariate statistics provide a framework for researchers who may require more accurate results while considering multiple groundwater quality parameters this approach can be applied in other urban centres mainly in arid and semiarid environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index multivariate statistical analysis urban groundwater degradation silicate weathering gibbs model 1 introduction the quantity and quality of groundwater have been significantly impacted by increasing demands from municipal supplies industry and agriculture worldwide green et al 2011 larson et al 2013 sophocleous 2004 srinivasan et al 2013 estimates showed that by 2050 the urban water demand would grow by 80 over 27 of global cities would have more water demand exceeding surface water capacity flörke et al 2018 consequently 19 of global cities that depend on surface water transfers may have greater tension between the agricultural and urban sectors in eighty percent of the high conflict breakpoints improved agrarian water use could make adequate water for municipal supply flörke et al 2018 however groundwater is progressively developed in dry environments to augment the surface water deficit alfarrah and walraevens 2018 vaux 2010 this has resulted in institutional constraints on groundwater quality management rahimi feyzabad et al 2021 in semiarid regions such as the sokoto basin different pollutants are added to the surface and groundwater from agricultural activities especially irrigation farming and municipal sources mainly from sewage septic tanks naidoo and olaniran 2013 wali and alias 2020 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e yuce et al 2005 the impact of aridity and rapid urbanisation have made access to potable water decrease in quality and quantity in rapidly expanding cities in developing countries cohen 2006 vairavamoorthy et al 2008 van vliet et al 2021 water supply development processes are being taken with less attention to improved water supply particularly in developing regions leading to increased scarcity of potable water in urban areas amare et al 2017 consequently there is increased concern by policymakers researchers and managers about urban water security hoekstra et al 2018 lutz ley et al 2021 zhu and chang 2020 urbanisation is accompanied by water quality degradation metropolitan water allocation is generally gauged by per capita water accessibility at the municipal level krueger et al 2019 thus urbanisation has severe consequences on groundwater quality carlson et al 2011 devi and nair 2021 grimmeisen et al 2016 kapembo et al 2021 similarly the actual causes of groundwater pollution resulting from urbanisation are well documented they includemunicipal and industrial sewage and changing land use jiang et al 2008 lerner and harris 2009 li and merchant 2013 and overexploitation or depletion of groundwater sources custodio 2002 jia et al 2019 pradinaud et al 2019 consequently evaluating urban groundwater quality in semiarid areas such as the sokoto basin using the water quality index wqi is essential for groundwater quality rating and determine its suitability for public water supply there is a steady increase in groundwater quality analysis using wqi because understanding groundwater quality is a robust tool for improved and efficient groundwater quality management seifi et al 2020 for instance an evaluation of groundwater quality using improved wqi and human health risk in the semiarid northwest china region by zhang et al 2020 revealed that children are more susceptible to water pollution than adults groundwater quality assessment and analysis of factors impacting groundwater quality variability in shiraz iran showed that the hydrochemistry of groundwater was more influenced by human activities than the natural geogenic processes badeenezhad et al 2020 groundwater hydrochemical characterisation and quality evaluation using integrated wqi in a densely populated urban shaanxi china indicated that ancient groundwater pollution was a significant factor causing poor groundwater quality gao et al 2020 in the rift valley of ethiopia the wqi in urban abaya chemo showed that 64 and 7 of groundwater sources fell between good to excellent drinking water categories aragaw and gnanachandrasamy 2021 assessment of groundwater using wqi in urban ranchi india revealed that 5 71 40 00 and 54 28 of groundwater sources fell within poor good and excellent categories respectively roy et al 2021 in the sedimentary plain of the atibaia river brazil most of the studied groundwater sources have excellent indices and are suitable for drinking rupias et al 2021 on the other hand groundwater quality assessment in the basement complex areas of north central nigeria using wqi indicated a higher level of pollution using gis an evaluation of wqi in maharashtra district india revealed that groundwater is unsuitable for drinking dandge and patil 2022 since urbanisation is usually accompanied by groundwater quality degradation urban groundwater quality management requires continuous evaluation and long term monitoring to ensure accessibility to the water of good quality khan et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a 2019b thus multivariate statistical modelling provides a user friendly tool for urban groundwater quality analysis groundwater quality analysis is a multivariate problem multivariate statistics has been successfully applied to assess the variability of groundwater and source identification at sampling or monitoring locations apollaro et al 2022 bhat et al 2021 de andrade et al 2008 jabbo et al 2022 nosrati and van den eeckhaut 2012 radelyuk et al 2021 shrestha and kazama 2007 zhao et al 2011 therefore multivariate statistical modelling presents a simple tool for groundwater quality analysis by reducing data into a more interpretable form the principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca are extensively applied to study the correlation between hydrochemical elements and identify sources of ions elkashouty et al 2021 halim et al 2010 ouyang 2005 wang et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 multivariate statistical modelling enables the classification of groundwater quality data obtained on more than one dependent variable or component since these ions tend to be correlated to some natural and human processes statistical dependence is regularly considered during data analysis long 2013 thus multivariate statistical modelling is a potentially promising tool for solving hydrogeochemical problems applying a robust statistical technique including multivariate statistical analysis to understand a complex water system the significance of urban groundwater quality monitoring has been demonstrated using multivariate statistical modelling bengraïne and marhaba 2003 boonkaewwan et al 2021 lusiana et al 2022 roy et al 2021 therefore it is a suitable tool for evaluating urban groundwater quality because the correlations between analytical variables generate better descriptors than the variables themselves parinet et al 2004 several research on urban groundwater quality has been carried out across the world results showed pollution of groundwater with a wide range of chemicals of human health concerns carlson et al 2011 lapworth et al 2018 mccance et al 2018 minnig et al 2018 pandith et al 2017 roy et al 2018 szekeres et al 2018 wali et al 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore assessing urban water quality is essential since it helps define the effects of clustered urban living on groundwater quality breton 1996 the arid and semiarid regions are most influenced by environmental change i e reduced rainfall and anthropogenic activities to a lesser degree dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 geological material and anthropogenic activities are known to predispose groundwater quality therefore increased urbanisation can cause groundwater pollution adversely affecting human health and the natural environment aithani et al 2020 jia et al 2018 zuccarello et al 2021 in addition uncontrolled effluent discharge from municipal sewage and farming activities and permeation of urban surface wash off can lead to groundwater pollution for instance the hydrochemistry of urban aquifers in hebei province china has become more diverse and complex hydrochemically due to human activities zhang et al 2019a 2019b in addition seepage from spoiled gutters presents a significant source of contaminated recharge in groundwater aquifers especially those found under porous media peralta and hibbs 2020 yao and sun 2020 most groundwater quality parameters are subject to significant variations in space and time dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 schot and pieber 2012 the natural manipulating factors result from changes in precipitation erosion and rock weathering the anthropogenic changes result from urban industrial and agricultural activities and overexploitation of aquifers chatton et al 2016 foster and chilton 2003 li et al 2019 these influences act together to generate varied water types in space and time therefore groundwater evaluation and monitoring using wqi are required to determine whether the observed changes or composition can be attributed to natural or anthropogenic origins of kebbi state s population of 3 80 million about 778 390 live in northern kebbi state and about 70 live in urban areas wali et al 2018a b c d therefore understanding the groundwater quality in urban kebbi state is critical hydrochemical characterisation of urban groundwater in urban areas of southwestern sokoto basin nigeria by waliet al 2018 showed that groundwater quality had been less impacted by urbanisation however findings may differ with land use and geology even within the same basin therefore this study uses water quality indices and multivariate statistical analysis to characterise groundwater in the urban centres of northern kebbi state northwestern sokoto basin 2 the study area 2 1 location and climate kebbi state is situated between latitude 100 8 and 130 15 north of the equator and longitude 30 30 e kebbi state occupies about 36 800 km2 as shown in fig 1 kebbi state has an estimated population of 3 80 million the climate is hot semiarid tropical and characterised by a long dry season between october and may rainfall is short but intensive it lasts between may june and september october there is an overall decrease in annual rainfall from southern to northern parts of the state fig 2 summarises yearly temperature precipitation and humidity in argungu birnin kebbi and jega for 2021 the temperature in sokoto basin is generally high and varies significantly with seasons mean maximum temperature reaches a peak in april at 40 c the mean minimum temperature is the lowest in december at 25 c fig 2a c the soil temperature examination indicates the hyperthermic soil temperature regime wali and bakari 2016 rainfall is highly variable and rises southward annual rainfall ranges from 500 mm to over 1200 mm in the south most precipitation falls in july august and september fig 2c e relative humidity reaches a peak in august 60 and is lowest in december relative humidity in the dry season ranges from 10 to 30 there is a general upsurge in relative humidity during the dry season from north to south the relative humidity reaches over 60 in july and august fig 2g i the evaporation rate is generally high and the study area can be classified as having a ustic soil moisture regime 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the geology of kebbi state is characteristic of sokoto basin mainly sedimentary in character with some outcrops of basement complex rocks in the south kogbe 1981 wali and bakari 2016 moreover the underlying aquifers are characteristic of the aquifers of the sokoto basin gwandu and illo formations are the best known aquifers and are primarily sandy overlying the dukamaje and kalambaina formations wali et al 2019a 2019b illo and gwandu formations show many features in common and are thus treated together in most literature in southern kebbi state s upland areas pre cambrian basement complex groundwater is primarily obtainable in minor quantities from fissures or other tabular separations and the regoliths anderson and ogilbee 1973 the detailed geological and stratigraphical description of the sokoto basin is well documented in the literature emujakporue et al 2018 kogbe 1981 moody 1997 nwankwo 2015 omolabi and fagbohun 2019 the study area s geological and hydrogeological configurations have been further illustrated in the supplementary data attached to this paper the sampled locations are situated over the gwandu formation recharge into the gwandu aquifer is predominantly by infiltration from rainfall and overflow on the outcrop zone groundwater extraction is chiefly by withdrawal from shallow wells deep wells boreholes are increasingly constructed in urban centres adelana et al 2002a geyh and wirth 1980 boreholes tapping the aquifer contribute to the municipal water supply at birnin kebbi but the calculated withdrawal was less than 100 000 gpd anderson and ogilbee 1973 a geoelectric survey for groundwater exploration at birnin kebbi by usman 2019 showed that a single borehole can produce up to 7000 gallons per hour gph and up to 18 000 gph by airlift between 110 and 305 m in depth notwithstanding the potential presented by the hydrological setting many urban centres in kebbi state are still struggling with drinking water scarcity and rely on individual and community dug wells or boreholes for water supply some of these water sources dry up entirely during prolonged dry spells while water levels in aquifers are sensitive to rainfall changes their longer term hydrogeochemical properties remain very difficult to understand under the current environmental conditions anderson and ogilbee 1967 1973 macdonald et al 2012 mackie et al 2021 the groundwater table in the study area is often shallow making it vulnerable to pollution by anthropogenic activities the gwandu aquifer the most promising usually receives its recharge in the east where it outcrops making it prone to contamination the formation lies uncomfortably on the kalambaina formation the sediments are continental in derivation and consist of interbedded partially merged sands and clays anderson and ogilbee 1967 1973 obaje et al 2020 the clay beds are primarily dense enormous white red grey black and brown sands range from subtle to coarse in texture kogbe 1981 wali et al 2019a 2019b the geohydrologic section of sokoto basin north western nigeria showing principal aquifers and confining beds is presented in the supplementary data the study area has a succession of semi consolidated sedimentary rocks forming undulating plains broken by clay hills in their surface expression typically the hills are capped by resistant crusts of laterite or ironstone obaje 2009 offodile 2002 the hills are mostly less than 46 m high but locally the relief between the stream valley floors fadama and the hilltops reaches 92 m anderson and ogilbee 1973 the sokoto rima river network is the primary drainage system of the sokoto basin the headwaters of the rivers rima and sokoto and their branches rise in a pre cretaceous crystalline rock environment east of the sokoto basin and flow south westward across a terrain underlain by sedimentary rocks of illo and gundumi formations the rima and sokoto groups and the gwandu formation adelana et al 2003 paul and bayode 2012 wali et al 2019a 2019b river rima and river zamfara the principal tributaries of river niger essentially drain the study area 2 3 land use several trans human herds of livestock possessed by fulani graze widely in both the fallow farmland and uncultivated fields shifting cultivation was widespread in highland areas but it is diminishing with rapid population growth and urbanisation abdullahi et al 2014 eniolorunda et al 2017 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e kebbi state has an estimated population of 3 802 525 million a significant portion of its population now lives in urban areas wali et al 2018a b c d at locations where surface water is accessible or aquifers are relatively shallow villages have been set up coupled with intensive farming especially near the fadama floodplain both in dry and wet seasons abdullahi et al 2014 yahaya 2002 near ponds and wells traditional shadoof irrigation farming is practised the recent increase in irrigation farming and urbanisation and poor waste disposal mainly landfills from municipal and industrial sources have threatened groundwater quality landfills pose a significant threat to groundwater quality including no3 ec toc cd pb sb and as pollution since aquifers receive recharge from direct infiltration and runoff aharoni et al 2020 burri et al 2019 lapworth et al 2017 uma 1993 xanke et al 2017 a theorised model for the complex processes of land use types and how they affect groundwater quality in the semiarid sokoto basin is presented in the supplementary data increasing urbanisation implied more deforestation housing industries landfills municipal waste generation and increased groundwater withdrawal the changes in land use due to urbanisation are harmful to the study area s general hydrological and hydrochemical conditions generally there is a steady decline in dense vegetation and increased urban paved surfaces nigeria and the study area in particular are fast urbanising statistics have shown that the rate of urbanisation in nigeria has risen from 43 48 to 51 96 between 2010 and 2020 o neill 2021 significant drivers of urbanisation in the study area have been the urgent need for housing and the associated socioeconomic demands thus groundwater pollution from municipal and industrial sewage is expected to rise with increasing urbanisation in the sokoto basin 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical procedure the study area was divided into three clusters argungu birnin kebbi and jega a total of 30 boreholes i e deep wells 40 m were studied physical parameters including temperature ec ph and tds were analysed in situ using hand held metres table 1 water quality metres were calibrated by deionised water before in situ measurements of physical parameters discrete samples were carried in a 1 l polyethene bottle for laboratory analysis sampling bottles were first rinsed with deionised water and dried before taking samples groundwater sampling was conducted during the dry season the rationale for groundwater sampling during the dry season is that the urban aquifers are more stable hydrochemically and are less influenced by groundwater recharge from rainfall infiltration during the wet season groundwater samples were kept in shielded boxes 5 c following marghade et al 2011 groundwater samples were analysed within 24 h therefore no acid treatment for groundwater samples was made ions including potassium sodium calcium copper iron magnesium and zinc were analysed by aas rs 12 5 model no item code s 929 phosphate and nitrate were analysed using automated colourimetry bluvisiontm discrete analyser also sulfate concentration was analysed using iron chromatography agilent 6890 plus gc with fpd 7683 autosampler finally bicarbonate carbonate and chloride were analysed by titration as shown in table 1 the analyses were conducted in triplicates and results were found reproducible within the 5 error limit 3 2 water quality index in this study wqi was computed the wqi which is measured as a formidable technique that can offer a wide ranging delineation of groundwater water quality is the degree that mirrors the combined effect of multiple water quality parameters rakotondrabe et al 2017 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e thus each chemical parameter was assigned discrete weights w i on a scale of 1 most negligible impact on water quality to 5 most significant impact on water quality which is built on their supposed influence on human health and based on its relative significance in the quality of drinking water elements that have grave health concerns and whose existence beyond the fundamental absorption limits might curb the water s usability for domestic and drinking purposes e g cl tds no3 and so4 2 were allotted the highest weight of 5 in contrast elements insignificant in water quality evaluation like k were assigned a minimum weight of 1 the intermediate parameters including ph ec th and tds hco3 cl ca2 mg2 were allocated weights between 2 and 4 depending on their relative weight in the water quality assessment the relative weight w i is calculated from eq 1 eq 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where the relative weight w i the weight of each element w i and n is the number of elements the computed relative weight w i values of each element are specified in table 2 subsequently the quality rating qi for individual parameters is assigned by dividing the intensity or concentration in each water sample by its reference values given by the who 2011 and the result is converted to a percentage by multiplying 100 eq 2 q i c i s i x 100 where the quality rating is q i the intensity of each chemical parameter in each water sample in mg l is c i and the drinking water standard for the individual chemical parameter in mg l based on the guidelines of the who 2011 is s i the si i value is first determined using eq 2 before wqi is computed the equation is thus eq 3 s i i w i x q i eq 4 w q i i 1 n s i where s i i is the sub index of the ith parameter q i presents the quality rating based on the concentration of the ith parameter the calculated wqi values are categorised into five classes in table 3 3 3 statistical analysis analysis of hydrochemical data is a multivariate problem hydrochemical data were first summarised and standardised using basic descriptive statistics mean minimum maximum and standard error table 3 subsequently pearson s correlation r was applied to test the correlation between physical and chemical components of groundwater following marghade et al 2011 however a non parametric test kruskal wallis was used to test a significant difference in groundwater composition between urban centres using several samples anova table 3 this approach allows for comparing several independent random samples and can be used as a non parametric replacement for the one way anova wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e wali et al 2019a 2019b https www statsdirect com help references reference list htm the kruskal wallis test statistic for k samples each of size n i is defined viz 5 t 1 s 2 i 1 k r i n i n n 1 2 4 where n is the sum all in and r i is the sum of the ranks from all samples drawn for the ith sample and 6 s 2 1 n 1 a l l r i j 2 n n 1 2 4 the test s null hypothesis is that all k distribution functions are equal the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the measurements produces more significant values than at least one of the other measurements 3 3 1 multivariate statistical modelling another way of applying multivariate analysis in water quality analysis is by chemical balance error cbe where the data on water quality can be subjected to internal consistency tests yidana et al 2018 therefore it is beneficial to apply cbe to test the internal consistency of hydrochemical data 7 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s x 100 where the entire absorptions of cations and anions are in meq l substituting the values of the sums of cations 90 78 and anions 100 34 in the equation using eq 7 c b e c a t i o n s 90 78 a n i o n s 100 34 c a t i o n s 90 78 a n i o n s 100 34 x 100 c b e 90 78 100 34 90 78 100 34 9 56 191 35 0 050 x 100 5 011 typically the cations and anions must accurately balance and under normal circumstances where the study recovers most of the elements the cations and anions must not vary by more than 5 the variation of cations and anions is within 5 in the current analysis indicating the validity of the data employed 3 3 2 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca is widely applied for interpreting groundwater chemistry reducing the study location s analytic data is the prime objective of using pca which tends to be interconnected to a less significant interpretable set of principal components or pcs alias et al 2014 machiwal and jha 2015 wali et al 2021 although some corresponding data may be missing during transformation the system s explanation is considerably reduced hildebrandt et al 2008 the pca bilinear model can be rearranged following the matrix decomposition equation 8 x t p t e where a matrix data is given by x which is reduced into t scores of matrices and pt matrix of loadings plus e matrix residual 3 3 3 hierarchical clustering analysis the hca s critical role is discretising the hydrochemical elements in a raw data matrix or pc scores into individual clusters the user selects devoid of prior assumptions the hca is an unsubstantiated clustering method that exposes intrinsic groups or recognises a dataset s arrangement devoid of a previous hypothesis concerning the data thus the system s items can be grouped into bands based on their similarities lin et al 2012 wali et al 2021 the ward s algorithmic grouping procedure after the euclidean distance squared was applied it is considered a highly efficient method of clustering before the grouping analysis the spotted hydrochemical data xji was harmonised by z scale conversion as given below machiwal and jha 2015 9 z x j i x j s j where x ji value of the jth hydrochemical factor measured at the ith location ẋ j

groundwater are presented in table 4 and fig 3 a e as shown in table 4 the physical parameters ec ph and tds are within who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines groundwater temperature is above 30 c and differs significantly p 0 0209 between the studied urban centres i e argungu birnin kebbi and jega the variation of temperature 10 c in groundwater aquifers can lead to doubling chemical reactions mitchell and ferris 2005 saito et al 2016 above 30 c temperature affects palatable water taste assessing electrical conductivity in groundwater is essential since it is a valuable marker of the water s available ionic content day and nightingale 1984 nordstrom et al 1989 the ec informs the extent of salinity in groundwater however in arid environments such as the sokoto basin flash floods with polluted water may temporarily alter the ec level in groundwater though at the same time the water table may also rise reddy and nagabhushanam 2012 reddy et al 2011 the tds concentration did not differ significantly between the urban centres however there is a significant difference in ph p 0 0020 between the three urban centres mean ph at argungu and birnin kebbi showed slightly acidic groundwater whereas groundwater is alkaline at jega the most acidic water naturally occurred in the eastern section of the sokoto basin and the south the low ph is derived from pyrites oxidation anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e just after sokoto town at dange ph is 5 1 at borehole gsn 3512 3 7 at borehole gsn 3520 and it is 3 7 at 177 km borehole gsn 3519 along the sokoto gusau road groundwater in this zone has lower tds 28 79 mg 1 the major anion is so4 2 which is derived from pyrites oxidation anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e this process is responsible for lower ph in the sokoto basin even though the ph level has less impact on consumers it is essential to understand groundwater quality moderate ph in drinking water is required depending on groundwater composition and aquifer properties the significance of ph in groundwater quality analysis is that it controls other water quality parameters behaviour for instance when bicarbonate and carbonate ions interact with calcium or magnesium it advances as caco3 or mgco3 iglikowska et al 2020 wang et al 2011 2013 the concentrations of calcium and magnesium in groundwater aquifers drop relative to sodium and the sar index increases this causes an alkalising effect and elevated ph levels in groundwater the mean tds was higher in argungu suggesting more rock mineral dissolution however variation of tds in groundwater can indicate groundwater pollution from anthropogenic activities zhao et al 2013 however changes in ph and temperature can cause considerable changes in tds oyem et al 2014 temperature changes 5 10 c in groundwater cause noticeable tds variations wali et al 2018a b c d other aspects that control tds in aquifers include the minerals found in the aquifer the chronological extent to which the groundwater is in contact with the rock minerals and the groundwater s chemical state nelson 2002 table 4 and fig 3f r summarised the cation and anion chemistry of groundwater nitrate is the outstanding anion and occurs at levels above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines for drinking water quality apart from high fe3 and no3 all the analysed cations and anions are within who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines for drinking water quality as shown in table 4 this finding is concurrent with the previous studies on groundwater quality in sokoto basin the literature showed that groundwater sources have high iron 32 mg 1 and mn levels 2 mg 1 contents in the sokoto basin in most of the studied boreholes there were low ph and high iron resulting in corrosion of water pipes anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2018a b c d wali et al 2019a 2019b many groundwater sources tapping the rima aquifer in the vicinity of sokoto metropolis and elsewhere along the river sokoto floodplains including argungu and birnin kebbi have high fe3 14 mg 1 and adequate mn to contribute to the staining properties of the fe3 anderson and ogilbee 1973 in the same vein previous studies have reported no3 pollution in shallow groundwater around sokoto town uma 1993 therefore the high nitrate level in deep wells is derived from anthropogenic activities municipal sewage mainly soakaways since the study area s geology is primarily sandy allowing for groundwater recharge directly from infiltration of rainfall it is typical of the gwandu formation the primary geological formation in the study area obaje 2009 offodile 2002 notably nitrate is also derived from atmospheric n deposition water treatment soil organic material urban runoff landfills rotting containers metropolitan sewage chemical fertilisers and animal wastes fytianos and christophoridis 2004 volk 2014 conversely current contaminating activities i e agriculture would unceasingly influence the nitrate concentration in the study area similarly if the groundwater extraction is accelerated mainly by urbanisation and irrigation farming no3 exuberance can be faster in the inundated zone however nitrate movement tends to be lower as a lag time 20 years between the pollution activity and exposure to no3 as exemplified in the supplementary data volk 2014 the significance of no3 in drinking water above 50 mg l depends on the fact that high no3 can be hazardous to babies blue baby syndrome wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e thus it is essential to classify groundwater based on tds no3 and total hardness 4 2 groundwater classification based on tds total hardness and nitrate classification of groundwater based on tds revealed that groundwater samples from argungu birnin kebbi and jega fell in excellent class based on total hardness groundwater varied from soft to hard as summarised in table 5 the rima group s aquifer has moderately hard water anderson and ogilbee 1973 however based on nitrate pollution groundwater sources fall in severe class which presents a potential human health risk table 5 4 3 water quality index the water quality index wqi was computed and summarised in table 6 the wqi ranged from 47 23 to 181 38 in argungu 41 93 to 201 16 in birnin kebbi and 35 36 to 106 41 in jega based on wqi the urban aquifers of kebbi state contained water of good excellent quality as shown in the supplementary data for example in argungu and birnin kebbi 80 of samples are good water 10 are excellent water and 10 are poor in jega 70 are good water 20 are excellent water and 10 are poor although the literature on wqi in the sokoto basin was not accessible an assessment of groundwater quality using wqi from the adjacent niger basin showed that groundwater water was of medium quality except for a few unsuitable samples yisa et al 2012 4 4 silicate weathering and ion exchange process the scholler index cl na k cl was applied to assess the ion exchange process results indicate that all the analysed water samples n 30 have positive scholler indices indicating overall base exchange reactions chloro alkaline balance when ca2 and mg2 exchange with na and k the indices would be positive chloro alkaline balance chloro alkaline disequilibrium occurs when indices are negative however where alkaline rock is replaced with na ions hco3 ca2 mg2 it designates base exchange soft water hard water is developed if na ions are replaced with alkaline earths ca2 mg2 hco3 marghade et al 2011 the silicate weathering was studied using a molar ratio na cl developed by meybeck 1987 results showed that 55 of the analysed groundwater samples have a molar ratio of less than 1 it suggests that na was not derived from silicate weathering the cation exchange of ca2 mg2 and na can produce high levels of na marghade et al 2011 sodium is mainly found as na ions therefore it is connected to class 2 water hazards i e a high na level is associated with health risks anim gyampo et al 2019 however nacl presents little or no health risk associated with a class 1 water hazard the significance of na in drinking water is its combined effect with sulfate generally na absorption in groundwater is temperature dependent and the accompanying anion takdastan et al 2018 when the molar ratio is above 1 it informs deficiency in ca2 and mg2 equivalent to ca2 na cation exchange thus it leads to the development of soft water there is no deficiency of ca2 and mg2 in about 55 of the studied locations it implied that most of the study area s groundwater sources fall in a soft moderate hard water type marghade et al 2011 typically groundwater is in concurrent close interaction with many solid mineral phases since mineral solute reactions are sluggish and water meets varying mineral formations as it moves groundwater is seldom in perfect equilibrium with the mineral solids surrounding it fitts 2013 therefore understanding groundwater chemistry mechanisms is essential for efficient groundwater quality management 4 5 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry 4 5 1 gibbs model the major sources controlling world water chemistry was assessed using a plot of weight ratio of tds versus na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 for cations and anions fig 4 shows a plot of tds versus na k na k ca2 and cl cl hco3 ratios for cations and anions the diagram indicates that rock weathering is the dominant process controlling groundwater in the study area this finding concurred with gibbs 1970 the detected mechanism originates from the study area s geographical and geological background sokoto basin has a semiarid climate the soil mostly contains sands and clays of diverse textural classes the na and k ions are primarily derived from silicate weathering reactions gibbs 1970 bicarbonate is somewhat high in the studied locations it was deemed reasonable owing to carbonate minerals in the sokoto basin anderson and ogilbee 1973 the hco3 is likewise derived from silicate weathering reaction and co2 from the organic matter and soil in this study acidity is primarily in the form of a low ph level comparable results have been reported elsewhere in the sokoto basin anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2018a b c d wali et al 2019a 2019b wali et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e 4 5 2 the hydrogeochemical facies groundwater hydrogeochemical facies were evaluated by plotting significant cations and anions concentrations using piper 1944 s trilinear diagram fig 5 this diagram reveals the resemblances and variances between water samples because groundwater samples with comparable qualities will tend to plot together as a group selvakumar et al 2017 the study area has ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water types in the cation triangle there is no dominant water type however in an anion triangle the cl water type was formed this finding is not concurrent with the previous studies on groundwater quality in the sokoto basin previous studies showed a ca mg or mg hco3 water type suitable for domestic industrial and agricultural uses alagbe 2006 the observed discrepancy can be related to urbanisation although ca2 mg2 and so4 2 occur naturally in sokoto basin as revealed by anderson and ogilbee 1973 there is increasing proof showing chloride contamination in urban aquifers resulting from anthropogenic activities szklarek et al 2022 however high chloride occurs naturally in arid and semiarid environments karroum et al 2017 the hydrochemistry of the gwandu aquifer kebbi state is highly variable previous studies show that the primary water type is a ca mg hco3 however a na hco3 variety is found at greater depths e g at kurdula and bacaka northern kebbi state anderson and ogilbee 1973 wali et al 2019a 2019b near the outcrop area where so4 2 is abundant a ca so4 water type exists or ca na no3 water type especially from shallow aquifers dug wells and the outcrop areas generally the gwandu aquifer waters and their overlying surface water bodies are soft or moderately hard anderson and ogilbee 1973 the tds content is typically low and ph ranges from 6 6 to 7 7 indicating slightly acidic to slightly alkaline conditions table 7 further shows groundwater characterisation following piper diagram the alkaline earth ca2 mg2 exceeded the alkalis na k in 10 of the sampling locations in argungu arg birnin kebbi brk and jega jeg however the alkalis na k exceeded the alkaline ca2 mg2 earths in 90 of arg brk and jeg sampling locations primarily the alkaline earths ca2 and mg2 are the most abundant elements on the earth correspondingly na is the only abundant alkali although k occurs commonly it is ordinarily less abundant than na karmegam et al 2011 other cation elements occur in significant quantities in very concentrated natural aquifers and some aquifers of unique composition for the graphical methods treated in piper 1944 4 6 statistical application 4 6 1 correlation analysis the underlying rock properties and anthropogenic activities that effective groundwater quality can be identified using correlation analysis adams et al 2001 aris et al 2007 erdogan et al 2020 güler et al 2012 for instance anthropogenic inputs can be measured through variations in tds marghade et al 2011 ions including sodium sulfate nitrate and chloride in groundwater aquifers can result from human sources mainly municipal wastes fertiliser application and organic wastes elumalai et al 2017 jalali 2011 spruill et al 2002 a positive correlation between tds and these ions is a strong indicator of groundwater pollution from anthropogenic activities marghade et al 2011 the tds correlates positively with mg2 r 0 757 na r 0 445 and nitrate r 0 407 at argungu at birnin kebbi tds correlates positively with calcium r 0 478 and magnesium 0 431 at jega tds correlates positively with copper r 0 478 and magnesium r 0 431 strong positive correlations between tds and these elements imply that the dissolved solids in groundwater result from these elements however positive correlations between sodium and tds in argungu suggests silicate weathering reaction in the same vein tds correlates negatively r 0 102 r 0 302 with no3 cl na molar ratio at argungu and birnin kebbi the former also correlates weakly r 0 047 with no3 cl na molar ratio at jega likewise weak correlations 0 251 0 128 between tds and no3 cl hco3 molar ratio at argungu and birnin kebbi the former correlates negatively r 0 138 with no3 cl hco3 the negative and weak positive correlations indicate little or no anthropogenic inputs substantial portions of hco3 in groundwater are expected to result from carbonate dissolution marghade et al 2011 thus ca hco3 water type is produced when co2 is freed into solution by carbonate dissolution correlation between hco3 and na ca and mg2 give vibrant evidence of the stoichiometry process hco3 and ca2 were negatively correlated r 0 558 r 0 305 at argungu and jega the two ions correlated weakly r 0 241 at birnin kebbi it indicates that ca2 was not derived from calcite rocks marghade et al 2011 other non carbonate sources of ca2 include apatite fluorite and marble wali et al 2019a 2019b a weak correlation between ca2 and so4 2 r 0 256 r 0 314 indicates that most of the analysed water samples in argungu and jega are closer to the 1 1 line suggesting that ca2 in the study area might be derived from gypsum poor correlations between hco3 and ca2 and so4 2 indicate that gypsum s dissolution is the basis for ca2 and so4 2 marghade et al 2011 mineral gypsum is commonly associated with sulfur lodes and rock salts benison and bowen 2013 moncur et al 2009 chloride correlates negatively with na suggesting that na is not derived from halite the negative correlation between cl and no3 at argungu and a weak positive correlation at jega r 0 027 suggest that these pollutants were not derived from anthropogenic inputs there is a significant positive correlation r 0 623 between cl and no3 at birnin kebbi suggesting groundwater pollution from sewage a very weak correlation between so4 2 and mg2 r 0 17 suggests that so4 2 might have originated from the weathering of magnesium sulfate minerals marghade et al 2011 wali et al 2018a b c d a charge equilibrium occurs between cations and anions when ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 so4 2 originate from gypsum dissolution of dolomite and calcite no lack of ca2 mg2 relative to hco3 so4 2 and hco3 so4 2 relative to ca2 mg2 consequently there is no need for balance by major anion i e chloride owing to a lack of excess positive charge of ca2 and mg2 it implies that ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 are derived from gypsum dolomite and calcite marghade et al 2011 the detailed result of the correlation analysis is presented in the supplementary file attached to this paper 4 6 2 principal component analysis the pca was carried out to evaluate the groundwater data s interrelationships lin et al 2012 selvakumar et al 2017 the pca results comprising the loadings eigenvalues and percentages of the total variance are presented in table 8 the removal of three factors was built on the proportion of variance accumulated including an amount above 80 lin et al 2012 table 8 and fig 6 showed that these three factors explained 65 31 64 34 and 62 75 of the total variance within the data matrix for argungu birnin kebbi and jega based on the scree test the three factors with typical factor loadings suggest at least three perceptible influences controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area component 1 explained 36 44 26 95 and 27 11 of the total variance for argungu birnin kebbi and jega respectively in addition it had high positive loadings on ec tds k zn2 and po4 3 at argungu na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 at birnin kebbi as well as ec tds th hco3 and po4 3 at jega respectively component 1 can be related exclusively to rock weathering since it corresponded to high positive loadings on ions derived primarily from rock minerals it therefore suggests a geological control of groundwater chemistry component 2 which explained 18 04 20 47 and 20 28 corresponded to high positive loadings on temperature hco3 and no3 at argungu temperature cl co3 2 po4 3 and no3 at birnin kebbi as well as tds na zn2 and no3 at jega therefore component 2 can be divided between two fractional influences i e geological and anthropogenic controls the observed high positive loadings on no3 in all the three urban centres suggest anthropogenic inputs component 3 explained 15 3 16 92 and 15 36 of the total variance it corresponded to high positive loadings on ca2 fe3 and cl at argungu temperature ec tds zn2 and so4 2 at birnin kebbi th k cu2 fe3 and no3 at jega high positive loadings on ec and temperature were deemed reasonable because the temperature is closely associated with ec in aquifers the ec is a parameter of considerable importance to a water analyst it is related to the ionic water content it also informs the range of ions concentrations in water that are likely to fall wali et al 2018a b c d similarly the observed high positive loadings on total hardness th in component 1 are reasonable since th in aquifers is primarily derived from ca2 and mg2 caco3 dissolution furthermore high positive loading on hco3 in argungu and jega was deemed reasonable since co2 is released into solution by carbonate dissolution forming ca hco3 water type therefore high positive loadings on hco3 na ca2 and mg2 provide strong evidence connecting to the process of stoichiometry thus pearson s r and pca are concordant based on pca groundwater in urban kebbi state is more a product of rock weathering than anthropogenic activities the effort to analyse the raw matrix data centred on y mean i e the mean concentration of individual parameters has been deducted from individual matrix cells in the same column is shown in the biplot of pc1 and pc2 as shown in fig 6 the two components explained 50 01 47 42 and 47 39 of the data set s variability for three urban centres the results are remarkable as the parameters show a dispersivity pattern all the eighteen initially analysed parameters are visible on the biplot indicating wide variability in the data matrix these elements are selected based on their absolute sizes i e high elemental absorptions which can be established using the raw data matrix it provides the needed information for the hydrochemical and geographical understanding of the data however the observed negative loadings on ph in some factors were deemed reasonable since ph usually attained a converse relationship with ions of carbonate origin lin et al 2012 4 6 3 hierarchical cluster analysis using hca boreholes with similar hydrochemical characteristics can be grouped into a cluster the graphics collection of the clustering processes in this study is offered as a dendrogram based on the dendrogram shown in fig 7 three groups of boreholes can be discerned the first group comprises arg1 arg9 jeg8 brk5 brk3 brk2 brk1 jeg10 jeg2 and jeg7 group 2 is comprised of boreholes arg2 jeg4 arg4 arg8 brk8 arg3 brk6 jeg6 brk4 brk9 jeg3 brk10 jeg9 and jeg5 group 3 is comprised of boreholes arg 7 and arg10 generally the lithology of these boreholes comprised sandy formations of different textural classes the first group sample boreholes have high groundwater temperatures hco3 cl k cu2 fe3 and zn2 therefore it implied that these sampling locations were strongly affected by rock weathering correspondingly this cluster has lower no3 tds mg2 na ph po4 3 ca2 th co3 2 and so4 2 sampling locations with moderate ec tds mg2 na and high no3 formed the second cluster the third cluster has a higher concentration of po4 3 ca2 th co3 2 so4 2 and ph although both clusters 1 and 2 are denoted as urban boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions than boreholes in the first and second clusters 4 7 sources of urban groundwater degradation fast growing urban centres with inadequate wastewater disposal systems a common phenomenon in most developing countries have a potentially significant effect on increasing groundwater recharge than cities with sewerage systems putra and baier 2008 it can be inferred that almost all urbanisation processes can increase the groundwater recharge rate fig 8 however the effect of urbanisation on the quality of recharge is commonly low especially if wastewater is a vital component putra and baier 2008 in cities in developing countries that lack adequate sewage disposal systems 90 of abstracted groundwater may return as groundwater recharge one of the significant recharge sources would be wastewater intrusion from septic tanks i e soakaways and latrines fig 8 it is particularly applicable for cities situated on shallow aquifers and cities found along with a river system such as argungu birnin kebbi and jega however based on the current analysis there is less evidence to show groundwater pollution in urban kebbi state apart from high no3 groundwater composition is more influenced by rock weathering than anthropogenic inputs higher no3 concentration in sokoto basin was reported much earlier by uma 1993 therefore it will be difficult to infer that the reported values of no3 in this study are a consequence of increased urbanisation all the three urban centres were primarily rural when such results were revealed the study area also has a long history of human settlement and agriculture which relied heavily on organic fertilisers often manure slurries in ancient times groundwater dating 14c 13c and 3h by adelana et al 2002b reveals that aquifers of sokoto basin hold suitable quality groundwater of holocene age i e 100 to 10 000 years bp comparably a study on no3 pollution by selck et al 2018 in a semi arid alluvial basin revealed that most of the no3 polluted boreholes contained ancient groundwater signifying that no3 pollution is derived from reinfiltering groundwater from irrigation fields as is perhaps the case for the sokoto basin thus isotope analysis is required for effective groundwater quality monitoring and management the effect of urban recharge sources will always be more extensive than precipitation recharge in semiarid and arid regions coelho et al 2017 de vries and simmers 2002 haritash et al 2016 lerner 2002 however urban recharge may only balance the loss of precipitation recharge caused by the impervious surfaces in humid areas and the overall effect of urbanisation will be more insignificant in semiarid and arid regions putra and baier 2008 pollution of urban groundwater occurs when human made stuff such as road salts chemicals gasoline and oil are transported into the aquifer and cause it to become hazardous and unsuitable for use other primary sources of pollutants or impurities are hazardous waste locations landfills storage tanks septic systems as well as the pervasive application of road salts organic and inorganic fertilisers pesticides and other chemicals khatri and tyagi 2014 kumaraswamy et al 2020 nigro et al 2017 the increase of these contaminants in urban environments has presented a thought provoking topic of groundwater quality management difficulties 5 conclusion the literature is unanimous about the need to understand urbanisation s impact on groundwater quality this study s results increased one s knowledge of the critical processes controlling groundwater quality in urban areas this study found that fe3 and no3 concentrations occur above who 2011 and nsdwq 2007 reference guidelines the study also revealed slightly acidic groundwater in argungu and birnin kebbi urban centres groundwater classification based on tds showed that tds levels were less than 500 mg l which is required for drinking additionally most sampling locations are soft however groundwater classification based on nitrate pollution showed that most sampling locations fell in the severe class the calculated wqi values also indicate that most sampling locations in the study area have water of satisfactory quality only 10 of sampling locations fell in the poor class the pca results showed that groundwater quality is controlled by the natural geogenic processes rather than anthropogenic inputs however significant correlations between tds and no3 cl na molar ratio tds and no3 cl hco3 molar ratio is a strong indicator of groundwater contamination from anthropogenic activities no3 is the major pollutant in the study area and it is derived from the fadama floodplain areas where most effluents are collected here is where most of the recharge to the aquifers is derived besides most of the irrigation farming takes place over these floodplains based on hca three groups of boreholes can be discerned although clusters 1 and 2 were classified as no3 polluted boreholes arg7 and arg10 revealed relatively different groundwater compositions than boreholes in the first and second clusters based on the piper diagram groundwater in the study area falls in the ca mg so4 cl and ca cl water type classes although there is no dominant water type in the cation triangle cl water type occurred in the anion triangle based on the gibbs model the rock weathering process controls groundwater in the study area therefore this study inferred less evidence to show the impact of urbanisation on groundwater quality in the study area however apart from high no3 all other indices used in this analysis indicated that the natural geogenic processes influence groundwater composition therefore these findings would have theoretical and practical implications 5 1 theoretical implications this study has shown how wqi and multivariate statistical analysis can benefit groundwater quality analysis thus results will enrich the literature on how wqi and multivariate statistics can be applied for groundwater quality analysis the specific implications are i theoretically this study provides the basis for groundwater quality evaluation in urban areas using wqi and multivariate statistical modelling with an acceptable level of accuracy ii this study s wqi and multivariate modelling can develop groundwater quality monitoring strategies to improve groundwater quality monitoring with associated cost reduction concerning groundwater quality analysis iii the wqi and multivariate modelling can further enrich the literature concerning a systematic approach to assessing monitoring and managing groundwater quality issues especially in semiarid environments therefore the current result may have many practical implications 5 2 practical implications this study used wqi and multivariate statistical modelling to understand the sources of ions in groundwater the practical implications are i it provides baseline data that will help to detect future changes concerning groundwater quality in the sokoto basin ii it enables the classification of drinking water sources and identification of sources of ions within urban groundwater aquifers iii it will provide policymakers with a simple tool for further analysis of issues relating to groundwater quality analysis and monitoring iv the results of this study can be applied to study nearly all types of semi arid environments concerning groundwater quality assessment v additionally these results are expected to provide the basis for groundwater pollution detection and proffer recommendations on how to lessen the human activities that are injurious to groundwater quality vi likewise it can aid decision makers in strategically enhancing the overall groundwater quality evaluation under different environmental settings with other land use practices vii this study revealed that the wqi and multivariate statistical analysis are robust tools for identifying complex relationships between different physicochemical parameters viii results indicate that the wqi and multivariate statistical modelling is suitable for environmental agencies seeking long lasting and cost effective improvement of their groundwater quality monitoring therefore future research concerning improving groundwater quality monitoring systems in semi arid environments should adopt wqi and multivariate statistical modelling the wqi and multivariate statistics provide a framework for researchers who may require more accurate results while considering multiple groundwater quality parameters the more the data set is used the more precise results are obtained this study provides a baseline and user friendly tool for decision makers to evaluate groundwater quality in their respective countries by substantially decreasing the cost and time of
