4375,gully land consolidation glc is a slope gully reclamation program that was implemented after grain for green project on the loess plateau china through the glc project the chinese government planned to increase the area of cropland by 337 80 km2 from 2013 to 2017 to quantify the impact of glc on runoff and sediment transport the coupled swat soil and water assessment tool model which was integrated with a process based terrace algorithm was employed in this research the results showed that the improved swat model was proven to be a powerful tool for detecting the effect of glc on flow and sediment discharge the effect of glc on flow and sediment loading was concentrated in the flooding period its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 yr and sediment trap efficiency was 3979 t km2 yr showing that it had good flow and sediment reduction benefits however the glc project drastically altered the water and sediment flux equilibrium and excessive expansion was likely to lose parts of riparian ecosystem functions of the downstream river in view of this we integrated the improved swat embedded in the terrace module double mass curve and pettitt test to identify the recommended ratio of glc area to the total area in the yanhe watershed the results demonstrated that if the reclaimed gully area accounted for 0 8 61 km2 of the total area 7608 km2 the runoff abruptly changed therefore the reclaimed gully area should remain within 0 8 of the total area in the yanhe watershed if so glc not only alleviates the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological restoration but also gives full play to its functions of reducing flood and restricting sediment transport keywords land reclamation hydrological processes sediment load swat the loess plateau 1 introduction many countries have implemented land reclamation around the world aiming to develop social economy by removing space restrictions merging fragmented landforms or mining resources crecente et al 2002 fang et al 2017 li et al 2014 moffat and mcneill 1994 pašakarnis and maliene 2010 therefore land reclamation is of importance to realize sustainable land use and environmental improvement guo et al 2014 the loess plateau in china is one of the most seriously eroded areas in the world fu et al 2011 sun et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 with hyper concentrated flows and transport of contaminated sediments being common issued in the region he et al 2004 xu 1999 zhang et al 2020 to moderate the degradation of ecosystem the chinese government has carried out several land reclamation projects on the loess plateau being the gully land consolidation glc one of them the purpose of the glc is to improve the ecosystem services but the approach is different from the general land reclamation the glc project adopts engineering measures to renovate and efficiently use the stable gullies to alleviate the contradiction between ecological restoration and economic development in this region glc is another slope gully renovation project that was implemented after the grain for green project gfg on the loess plateau china li et al 2014 liu and li 2014 zhao 2014 to control severe soil erosion the chinese government launched the gfg project and afforested and grassed on the steep slope croplands 25 within the loess plateau region that covered an area of 640 000 km2 in 1999 bai et al 2019 tsunekawa et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 afforestation and grassland extended to 179 200 km2 and the vegetation coverage increased by 28 from 1999 to 2013 which greatly improved the ecosystem services of the loess plateau chen et al 2015a however the arable land was sharply reduced with the gfg carried out and an area of farmland that was converted to forestland and grassland was up to 48 300 km2 based on the standard of a per capita demand of 0 1 ha farmland zhao 2014 the gfg threatened the minimum arable land and the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological protection was increasingly aggravated for the sake of protecting the achievements of gfg and alleviating the conflicts between food security and ecological restoration the chinese government made an investment of 51 72 billion rmb approximately 7 72 billion usd to conduct the glc program in yan an city located in the central loess plateau and planned to create available cropland of 337 80 km2 in the gullies from 2013 to 2017 chen et al 2015b the loess plateau is located in northwest china its surface is covered by the deposited thick loess the loess being loose porous and homogeneous can be easily eroded by water and the soil erosion modules range from 5000 t km2 yr to 10 000 t km2 yr fu et al 2011 sun et al 2014 more than 70 of the loess plateau is hilly gully region in which 30 50 is occupied by gullies he et al 2004 because they collect water and soil from the drained areas above gullies are generally the ideal place to develop agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions according to the study of li et al 2016 the crop yield in gully is three and five times higher than on terraces and slopes respectively despite the presence of 27 000 gullies which length more than 500 m in the loess plateau jin 2014 most of them are narrow and irregular thus not favorable to agricultural activities liu et al 2013 therefore the glc project cut and levelled the stable gullies into gully terraces so as to form the high standard farmland it can consolidate the gfg achievement and improve the ecosystem services in the loess plateau in 2012 the glc project was launched in yan an city and the gullies were extended by cutting the gentle and stable slope foot 20 and leveling the gully cropland the gully slope was reduced and the natural flow channel was buried which had a great influence on watershed hydrological processes and sediment transport lou 2016 investigated how the glc affected the velocity depth and flow peak of surface runoff through simulated rainfall experiments and the result showed that glc reduced the velocity and increased the depth of surface runoff and also decreased the peak discharge a consistent conclusion was drawn under the same conditions by sun 2017 but it hardly reflected the effects of glc to hydrological processes in the entire catchment gullies served as drainage channels to gather surface runoff and transport sediment in a catchment driving water and sediment flux and influencing the river ecosystem therefore exploring the recommended ratio of glc area to the watershed area is of great importance to ensure the sustainable development of environment hence this study used the terrace algorithm which was incorporated into the soil and water assessment tool swat the principle of water balance is the basic framework of swat devia et al 2015 according to input data such as the watershed topography land use and meteorology the swat model divides the watershed into several hydrological response units hrus the hydrological processes and sediment transport are estimated by the equation of water balance and the modified universal soil loess equation musle williams and singh 1995 then the parameters that influence the surface runoff groundwater evapotranspiration and soil erosion are calibrated to improve the model accuracy arabi et al 2008 and waidler et al 2011 researched the impact of terraces on watershed hydrological processes with swat by adjusting the soil conservation service curve number scs cn universal soil loess equation control practice factor usle p factor and slope length although the model accuracy was satisfied the terraces split the original slope into several terrace units and reduced the original slope length slowing down the runoff speed and creating a storage volume to intercept the slope surface runoff and eroded sediment therefore the simulation with the general swat model not integrated with the terrace algorithm overlooked the effect of local terrain changes on hydrological processes based on analyzing the impact of terrace on surface runoff infiltration and evaporation shao et al 2013 developed a process based algorithm to simulate the environment of terraces and incorporated it into the swat model since terraces have complex influence on watershed hydrological processes the terrace algorithm was designed to operate at the level of each single hru essentially the algorithm split the hru into terraced and non terraced areas according to the terrace geometry the terrace module simulates the infiltration runoff evapotranspiration and sediment transport processes in terraced area two kinds of outflow were considered in this algorithm drainage outflow which was drained to water storage facilities or the stream and overland outflow which only happened when the surface runoff exceeded the terrace storage capacity for model verification shao 2013 applied the terrace algorithm to 6 separated terraces in the marais des cygnes basin which belonged to southeast franklin county us and bench terraces which were located in the red soil region of southwest china the result confirmed that the process based terrace module that was inserted into the swat model could well reveal watershed hydrological processes in theory and the coupled swat integrated terrace module into swat had a good performance in simulating runoff and sediment yield li et al 2015 and zhang 2014 explored the influence of terrace on runoff and sediment load through the terrace module in the jinghe river basin and the yanhe watershed respectively the results showed that the process based terrace algorithm could expose the impact of terraces on precipitation redistribution and sediment transport processes to explore the impact of glc on watershed surface runoff and sediment transport and to detect the threshold of glc in the yanhe watershed the improved swat double mass curve dmc and pettitt test were employed the aim of this study was not only to provide a new method to evaluate the effects of glc on water and sediment flux but also to guide watershed land use planning and water resource management 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area as the primary tributary of the yellow river the yanhe watershed 36 21 n 37 19 n 108 39 e 110 29 e with an area of 7608 km2 is located in the central loess plateau fig 1 the slope steepness in the range of 0 20 accounts for 23 and more than 20 accounts for 77 of the total area this region belongs to the northern subtropical arid region with an average annual rainfall of 519 mm and over 60 of the precipitation is concentrated in the flooding period july to september therefore the surface runoff is apt to be formed due to frequent rainstorms chen and brissette 2014 and poor soil water infiltration capacity deep soil layer and uniform soil texture with silt and clay in this region the mean annual runoff and sediment load are 2 89 108 m3 equivalent to 36 mm surface runoff depth and 8 76 104 t respectively in terms of the multiyear observations of the ganguyi gauging station zhou and li 2015 which is the outlet of the basin that controls an area of 5858 km2 the strong energy of runoff caused severe soil erosion so approximately 90 of the territory is composed of gullies and ridges which has great potential to implement the glc project in the yanhe watershed 2 2 data collection digital elevation data dem is the basic data to reflect the topography of the basin and the resolution of dem directly determines the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model tan et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 a 30 m 30 m dem obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn was used in this research soil is the medium of rainfall converts to runoff and infiltration and the properties of soil such as type structure and texture are the main factors that adjust the water balance in a watershed the soil data including a soil type map 1 1000000 and soil properties adopted in this study were derived from the west database center http westdc westgis ac cn land use indicates spatial allocation and indirectly dominates the water cycle ghafari et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 based on the land use map obtained from the national catalogue service for geographic information http www webmap cn with spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m in 2010 the yanhe region comprised cultivated land forests grasslands shrub land wetlands water bodies construction land and bare land the daily climatic available data were obtained from 3 weather stations within the yanhe watershed during 2000 2016 as the typical weather stations in this region li and zhou 2015 yang and lu 2018 the ansai yan an and ganguyi weather stations are distributed in upper middle and lower reaches of the watershed respectively these can reflect the average monthly scale climate fluctuation of the yanhe watershed besides this study aimed to detect the impact of glc project on runoff and sediment transport in monthly scale it has a low sensitivity to short term climate change in local area therefore the uncertainty in simulated monthly runoff and sediment yield is acceptable the monthly runoff and sediment yield at the ganguyi gauging station were used to calibrate and validate the swat model 3 methodology 3 1 brief description of terrace algorithm a terrace unit formed a storage volume like trigonal prismatic by cutting and leveling the slope fig 2 which intercepts the generated runoff and sediment from above the maximum storage volume can be calculated as shao et al 2013 1 v mx n t

the effects of soil texture antecedent soil water content and land use management on surface runoff generation and been widely validated and used around the world dasaro and grillone 2012 geetha et al

liu and li 2017 the excavation was backfilled into the gully and leveled in steps and formed gully terraces fig 3b to facilitate agricultural mechanization the width of a created gully terrace unit should keep within 20 80 m and the length should be in 50 100 m fig 3c yan an water affairs bureau 2011 liu and li 2017 the storage volume of a gully terrace unit can be calculated with the slope terrace as follows 5 v mx n t 2 l b t a n α 0 2 1 tan α 0 1 tan α c w where α 0 and α c are the angles of the original slope and dam slope respectively the yan an city covers an area of 37 052 km2 of which the yanhe watershed accounts for 20 53 since the glc project was conducted in 2012 the area of the glc project reached 84 04 km2 189 89 km2 and 336 67 km2 which accounted for 0 23 0 51 and 0 91 of the whole area of yan an city in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively based on previous research the drainage density was 0 32 km km2 in the yanhe watershed song et al 2012 wang 2014 therefore the total length of the gullies in the yanhe watershed was 2435 km due to the long and narrow gully landform features the created gully terraces had a width of 20 80 m and a length of 50 100 m keeping the same ratio of glc in yan an city the reclaimed gully length in the yanhe watershed was 350 km 776 km and 1385 km which accounted for 14 32 and 57 of the total gully length in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively in view of this four scenarios table 1 were defined in terms of the glc project in 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 and the impact of glc on flow and sediment transport was revealed by the terrace algorithm embedded within the swat model in the yanhe watershed 3 3 swat accuracy evaluation in the swat model runoff is affected by 27 parameters and sediment load is influenced by 18 parameters ahn

right conclusions only if 1 there is a causal relationship between the variables being compared 2 the variables have a positive correlation and 3 the reference variable is comprised of observations

assessment of rainfall to stream to examine the effect of rainfall distribution on streamflow in the yanhe watershed we analysed the rainfall data from 2000 to 2016 fig 4 the results showed that 54 of precipitation in the yanhe watershed was concentrated in flooding period and 46 of them was distributed in non flood period the concentrated rainfall was easy to generate surface runoff because of thick soil layer fine sandy loam and silt loam on the loess plateau huang and shao 2019 kang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 besides we used the swat model and iha indictor of hydrologic alteration model developed by nature conservancy nature conservancy 2009 to comprehensively evaluate the baseflow in the yanhe watershed and separated surface runoff from streamflow fig 4 exhibited that the impact of precipitation on stream was mainly occurred in flooding period the surface runoff generated by rainfall took account 79 of the streamflow during the flooding period but the average runoff coefficient was only 0 05 in flooding period from 2000 to 2016 since 1999 the loess plateau conducted the gfg and glc project successively both of them restrained the surface runoff generation and influx especially the glc project it has great influence on runoff confluence and sediment transport 4 2 calibration and validation of swat through the parameter sensitivity analysis with soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup seven parameters sensitive to runoff and five parameters sensitive to sediment load were selected in the modeling of the yanhe watershed table 2 then the optimal values of the parameters were determined by the latin hypercube sampling method the results indicated that soil properties basin management and stream characteristics were the main factors affecting runoff and soil erosion in this region based on the land use in 2010 this study used the r2 nse rsr and pbias statistics as references to calibrate the monthly runoff and sediment load with the measured data at the ganguyi gauging station in the yanhe watershed during the calibration period 2003 2008 the results showed that the simulation matched the observation well figs 5 and 6 the monthly r2 nse rsr and pbias values were 0 94 0 67 0 58 and 19 for the runoff and 0 68 0 60 0 55 and 15 for the sediment load table 3 according to the research on the model performance evaluation moriasi et al 2007 the model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if the nse 0 5 rsr 0 5 pbias 25 for runoff and pbias 55 for sediment in the swat model model validation was conducted using data from 2009 to 2012 based on the calibrated parameters the monthly r2 nse rsr and pbias values were 0 62 0 62 0 62 and 7 for the runoff and 0 43 0 81 0 44 and 21 for the sediment load in the validation period 2009 2012 the simulated did not match the observed runoff mainly in winter and early spring months the one possible reason for the difference can be related to the fact that swat model calculated snow melt with simple temperature based equations ignoring the impacts of land use cover slope gradient and aspect on snow melt debele et al 2010 grusson et al 2015 it led to the deviations between the observed and simulated runoff the lack of reservoir management data could also have determined the underestimation of runoff in early spring months because there is no available measured sediment load data during the low flow periods we only compared the observed monthly sediment yield to the simulated monthly sediment yield during the high flow periods overall the simulated monthly runoff and sediment load matched well with the observed monthly sediment it could achieve the simulation accuracy for the monthly runoff and sediment load in the yanhe watershed 4 3 applicability analysis of the terrace algorithm to assess the applicability of the terrace module under glc conditions the general swat project was constructed with the land use in 2010 and the climate from 2013 to 2016 which was simulated the monthly runoff and sediment yield before the implementation of glc in the yanhe watershed in addition based on the general swat project the terrace module was conducted according to the ratio of reclaimed gully length to the total gully length in 2013 and 2015 finally the monthly observed runoff and sediment load were compared with the simulated runoff and sediment load for 2013 and 2015 the results showed that the r2 values of monthly runoff and sediment load were 0 99 and 0 97 respectively after linear regression fig 7 likewise the nse values were 0 83 and 0 82 and the pbias values were 21 and 17 respectively this proved that the terrace algorithm integrated into the swat model had a good performance researching the impacts of glc on runoff and sediment transport 4 4 assessing the impact of glc on runoff and sediment transport fig 8 presents the monthly runoff variation under different ratios of glc in the yanhe watershed s2010 denoted that there wasn t launched the glc project and s2013 s2015 and s2017 referred to the 14 32 and 57 of gully length namely 0 23 0 51 and 0 91 of gully area was reclaimed into the gully terraces in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively the results indicated that the impact of glc on runoff was concentrated in the flooding period july through september 14 32 and 57 of the reclaimed gully length could decrease the streamflow by 6 34 11 00 and 18 13 respectively and its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 yr the streamflow exhibited a little fluctuation in the four scenarios during the non flood period and it increased slightly in the driest season december and january therefore the glc project had the function of promoting runoff infiltration in the flooding period and recharging rivers in the non flood period in the yanhe watershed rainfall is concentrated in flooding periods and 60 70 of rainfall events occur in the form of high intensity rainstorms liang et al 2015 surface runoff is generated because rain intensity exceeds the actual infiltration capacity hortonian runoff smith and goodrich 2006 once the heavy rain generates sheet flow the hilly gully dominated region provides the kinetic energy to the overland flow which is apt to develop into powerful runoff and flow into the natural drainage channels however the glc project created the gully terrace arable land by widening the original gully space filling the natural channels and levelling the reclaimed land which diminished the kinetic energy of the runoff and increased the infiltration when the surface runoff flowed into the reclaimed gully terraces the capability of increasing the runoff infiltration in flooding periods and compensating for the dry periods was enhanced with the extension of the glc area surface runoff was hard to develop in non flood periods because of low rainfall and weak rainfall intensity even if runoff was generated the small area of created gully terraces could restrict surface runoff thus the glc stores the runoff on the gully terrace volume in flooding periods and recharges the stream during non flood periods fig 9 shows that the glc project made a difference in the sediment load at the monthly scale which was simulated via the terrace algorithm integrated into the swat model s2010 represented the sediment load variation before launching the glc in the yanhe watershed and s2013 s2015 and s2017 represented 14 32 and 57 of gully length was reclaimed into gully terraces in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively compared without conducting the glc project the sediment load decreased by 32 62 53 95 and 88 68 with 14 32 and 57 gully length reclaimed into terraces during the flooding period respectively comparing with the 14 and 32 of the glc there was a dramatic reduction in sediment load when the reclaimed gully length accounted for 57 of the total gully length the ability of reclaimed gully terraces to restrict sediment transport was greater than that of flow and reclaimed gully terraces trapped sediment transport all the time even if during the non flood period the sediment trap efficiency of glc was up to 3979 t km2 yr therefore the glc project had good control over soil erosion the function of glc to restrict sediment transport was closely associated with surface runoff the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau was caused by concentrated high intensity rainstorms during the flooding period zheng and wang 2014 the surface runoff provided the driving force for soil erosion and sediment transport and the created gully terraces not only dissipated part of the flow energy but also trapped most of the sediment hence the glc project played an important role in soil and water conservation 4 5 recommended ratio of glc this study demonstrates that the glc project had a great influence on water and sediment flux during the flooding period the terrace module and dmc searcy and hardison 1960 weiss and wilson 1953 were employed to detect the recommended ratio of the glc project in the yanhe watershed from 2001 to 2016 this synthesis firstly used the terrace module to simulate the monthly runoff in different ratios 0 60 of reclaimed gully length from 2007 to 2016 then the dmc was utilized to detect the runoff variation during the flooding period fig 10 the results showed that breakage of dmc slope appeared once the glc was launched and the deviation from the original trend increased as the glc project extension from 0 to 60 of gully length besides the slope decreased from 239 111 m3 mm to 97 557 m3 mm to identify the prominent break of the dmc slope the pettitt test was applied to test the trend of the dmc slope the method quantitatively examines the slope of the dmc itself and the break in the slope taking account of the effect of precipitation on the occurrence of the slope break gao et al 2017 it reflected the response of runoff change on different gully terraced areas under the same rainfall conditions fig 11 illustrates the dmc slope change before and after implemented the glc project in the yanhe watershed when the length of created gully terraces accounts for 50 of the total gully length that accounts for 0 8 61 km2 of the total watershed area the dmc slope has a significant change p 5 this means that gullies as the confluence sections of surface runoff when the area of glc accounts for 0 8 of the total watershed area the runoff generated by precipitation will be restrained by the created gully terraces and it will make the streamflow have a significant reduction this change perhaps threaten the water demand of the river system eco environment and cause the river to lose part of its ecological functions thus the recommended ratio of glc should be kept within 0 8 in the yanhe watershed 5 conclusion the terrace algorithm which was integrated into the swat was used to investigate the impact of the gully land consolidation project on runoff and sediment discharge in recent decades the improved swat had a good performance detecting the fluctuation of runoff and sediment transport it proposed a new method to evaluate the effect of land consolidation on water and sediment flux in a catchment which would provide a reference for optimizing land use structure and distribution the influence of gully land consolidation on runoff and sediment transport was concentrated in the flooding period its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 year and the sediment trap efficiency was 3979 t km2 yr but runoff slightly increased during the most dry period december and january gully land consolidation promoted runoff infiltration during the flooding period and recharged rivers during the non flood period and effectively controlled soil erosion especially in the flooding period therefore the gully land consolidation project executed on the loess plateau not only alleviated the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological protection but also contributed to soil conservation when implemented within a proper range on the loess plateau based on the simulation results of the improved swat the recommended ratio of gully land consolidation was identified by the combination of the double mass curve and pettitt test the reclaimed gully area should remain within 0 8 of the total area in the yanhe watershed if the reclaimed area expands out of the scale it may cause a series of ecological and environmental problems credit authorship contribution statement youcai kang conceptualization

planned to increase the area of cropland by 337 80 km2 from 2013 to 2017 to quantify the impact of glc on runoff and sediment transport the coupled swat soil and water assessment tool model which was integrated with a process based terrace algorithm was employed in this research the results showed that the improved swat model was proven to be a powerful tool for detecting the effect of glc on flow and sediment discharge the effect of glc on flow and sediment loading was concentrated in the flooding period its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 yr and sediment trap efficiency was 3979 t km2 yr showing that it had good flow and sediment reduction benefits however the glc project drastically altered the water and sediment flux equilibrium and excessive expansion was likely to lose parts of riparian ecosystem functions of the downstream river in view of this we integrated the improved swat embedded in the terrace module double mass curve and pettitt test to identify the recommended ratio of glc area to the total area in the yanhe watershed the results demonstrated that if the reclaimed gully area accounted for 0 8 61 km2 of the total area 7608 km2 the runoff abruptly changed therefore the reclaimed gully area should remain within 0 8 of the total area in the yanhe watershed if so glc not only alleviates the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological restoration but also gives full play to its functions of reducing flood and restricting sediment transport keywords land reclamation hydrological processes sediment load swat the loess plateau 1 introduction many countries have implemented land reclamation around the world aiming to develop social economy by removing space restrictions merging fragmented landforms or mining resources crecente et al 2002 fang et al 2017 li et al 2014 moffat and mcneill 1994 pašakarnis and maliene 2010 therefore land reclamation is of importance to realize sustainable land use and environmental improvement guo et al 2014 the loess plateau in china is one of the most seriously eroded areas in the world fu et al 2011 sun et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 with hyper concentrated flows and transport of contaminated sediments being common issued in the region he et al 2004 xu 1999 zhang et al 2020 to moderate the degradation of ecosystem the chinese government has carried out several land reclamation projects on the loess plateau being the gully land consolidation glc one of them the purpose of the glc is to improve the ecosystem services but the approach is different from the general land reclamation the glc project adopts engineering measures to renovate and efficiently use the stable gullies to alleviate the contradiction between ecological restoration and economic development in this region glc is another slope gully renovation project that was implemented after the grain for green project gfg on the loess plateau china li et al 2014 liu and li 2014 zhao 2014 to control severe soil erosion the chinese government launched the gfg project and afforested and grassed on the steep slope croplands 25 within the loess plateau region that covered an area of 640 000 km2 in 1999 bai et al 2019 tsunekawa et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 afforestation and grassland extended to 179 200 km2 and the vegetation coverage increased by 28 from 1999 to 2013 which greatly improved the ecosystem services of the loess plateau chen et al 2015a however the arable land was sharply reduced with the gfg carried out and an area of farmland that was converted to forestland and grassland was up to 48 300 km2 based on the standard of a per capita demand of 0 1 ha farmland zhao 2014 the gfg threatened the minimum arable land and the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological protection was increasingly aggravated for the sake of protecting the achievements of gfg and alleviating the conflicts between food security and ecological restoration the chinese government made an investment of 51 72 billion rmb approximately 7 72 billion usd to conduct the glc program in yan an city located in the central loess plateau and planned to create available cropland of 337 80 km2 in the gullies from 2013 to 2017 chen et al 2015b the loess plateau is located in northwest china its surface is covered by the deposited thick loess the loess being loose porous and homogeneous can be easily eroded by water and the soil erosion modules range from 5000 t km2 yr to 10 000 t km2 yr fu et al 2011 sun et al 2014 more than 70 of the loess plateau is hilly gully region in which 30 50 is occupied by gullies he et al 2004 because they collect water and soil from the drained areas above gullies are generally the ideal place to develop agriculture in the arid and semi arid regions according to the study of li et al 2016 the crop yield in gully is three and five times higher than on terraces and slopes respectively despite the presence of 27 000 gullies which length more than 500 m in the loess plateau jin 2014 most of them are narrow and irregular thus not favorable to agricultural activities liu et al 2013 therefore the glc project cut and levelled the stable gullies into gully terraces so as to form the high standard farmland it can consolidate the gfg achievement and improve the ecosystem services in the loess plateau in 2012 the glc project was launched in yan an city and the gullies were extended by cutting the gentle and stable slope foot 20 and leveling the gully cropland the gully slope was reduced and the natural flow channel was buried which had a great influence on watershed hydrological processes and sediment transport lou 2016 investigated how the glc affected the velocity depth and flow peak of surface runoff through simulated rainfall experiments and the result showed that glc reduced the velocity and increased the depth of surface runoff and also decreased the peak discharge a consistent conclusion was drawn under the same conditions by sun 2017 but it hardly reflected the effects of glc to hydrological processes in the entire catchment gullies served as drainage channels to gather surface runoff and transport sediment in a catchment driving water and sediment flux and influencing the river ecosystem therefore exploring the recommended ratio of glc area to the watershed area is of great importance to ensure the sustainable development of environment hence this study used the terrace algorithm which was incorporated into the soil and water assessment tool swat the principle of water balance is the basic framework of swat devia et al 2015 according to input data such as the watershed topography land use and meteorology the swat model divides the watershed into several hydrological response units hrus the hydrological processes and sediment transport are estimated by the equation of water balance and the modified universal soil loess equation musle williams and singh 1995 then the parameters that influence the surface runoff groundwater evapotranspiration and soil erosion are calibrated to improve the model accuracy arabi et al 2008 and waidler et al 2011 researched the impact of terraces on watershed hydrological processes with swat by adjusting the soil conservation service curve number scs cn universal soil loess equation control practice factor usle p factor and slope length although the model accuracy was satisfied the terraces split the original slope into several terrace units and reduced the original slope length slowing down the runoff speed and creating a storage volume to intercept the slope surface runoff and eroded sediment therefore the simulation with the general swat model not integrated with the terrace algorithm overlooked the effect of local terrain changes on hydrological processes based on analyzing the impact of terrace on surface runoff infiltration and evaporation shao et al 2013 developed a process based algorithm to simulate the environment of terraces and incorporated it into the swat model since terraces have complex influence on watershed hydrological processes the terrace algorithm was designed to operate at the level of each single hru essentially the algorithm split the hru into terraced and non terraced areas according to the terrace geometry the terrace module simulates the infiltration runoff evapotranspiration and sediment transport processes in terraced area two kinds of outflow were considered in this algorithm drainage outflow which was drained to water storage facilities or the stream and overland outflow which only happened when the surface runoff exceeded the terrace storage capacity for model verification shao 2013 applied the terrace algorithm to 6 separated terraces in the marais des cygnes basin which belonged to southeast franklin county us and bench terraces which were located in the red soil region of southwest china the result confirmed that the process based terrace module that was inserted into the swat model could well reveal watershed hydrological processes in theory and the coupled swat integrated terrace module into swat had a good performance in simulating runoff and sediment yield li et al 2015 and zhang 2014 explored the influence of terrace on runoff and sediment load through the terrace module in the jinghe river basin and the yanhe watershed respectively the results showed that the process based terrace algorithm could expose the impact of terraces on precipitation redistribution and sediment transport processes to explore the impact of glc on watershed surface runoff and sediment transport and to detect the threshold of glc in the yanhe watershed the improved swat double mass curve dmc and pettitt test were employed the aim of this study was not only to provide a new method to evaluate the effects of glc on water and sediment flux but also to guide watershed land use planning and water resource management 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area as the primary tributary of the yellow river the yanhe watershed 36 21 n 37 19 n 108 39 e 110 29 e with an area of 7608 km2 is located in the central loess plateau fig 1 the slope steepness in the range of 0 20 accounts for 23 and more than 20 accounts for 77 of the total area this region belongs to the northern subtropical arid region with an average annual rainfall of 519 mm and over 60 of the precipitation is concentrated in the flooding period july to september therefore the surface runoff is apt to be formed due to frequent rainstorms chen and brissette 2014 and poor soil water infiltration capacity deep soil layer and uniform soil texture with silt and clay in this region the mean annual runoff and sediment load are 2 89 108 m3 equivalent to 36 mm surface runoff depth and 8 76 104 t respectively in terms of the multiyear observations of the ganguyi gauging station zhou and li 2015 which is the outlet of the basin that controls an area of 5858 km2 the strong energy of runoff caused severe soil erosion so approximately 90 of the territory is composed of gullies and ridges which has great potential to implement the glc project in the yanhe watershed 2 2 data collection digital elevation data dem is the basic data to reflect the topography of the basin and the resolution of dem directly determines the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model tan et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 a 30 m 30 m dem obtained from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn was used in this research soil is the medium of rainfall converts to runoff and infiltration and the properties of soil such as type structure and texture are the main factors that adjust the water balance in a watershed the soil data including a soil type map 1 1000000 and soil properties adopted in this study were derived from the west database center http westdc westgis ac cn land use indicates spatial allocation and indirectly dominates the water cycle ghafari et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 based on the land use map obtained from the national catalogue service for geographic information http www webmap cn with spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m in 2010 the yanhe region comprised cultivated land forests grasslands shrub land wetlands water bodies construction land and bare land the daily climatic available data were obtained from 3 weather stations within the yanhe watershed during 2000 2016 as the typical weather stations in this region li and zhou 2015 yang and lu 2018 the ansai yan an and ganguyi weather stations are distributed in upper middle and lower reaches of the watershed respectively these can reflect the average monthly scale climate fluctuation of the yanhe watershed besides this study aimed to detect the impact of glc project on runoff and sediment transport in monthly scale it has a low sensitivity to short term climate change in local area therefore the uncertainty in simulated monthly runoff and sediment yield is acceptable the monthly runoff and sediment yield at the ganguyi gauging station were used to calibrate and validate the swat model 3 methodology 3 1 brief description of terrace algorithm a terrace unit formed a storage volume like trigonal prismatic by cutting and leveling the slope fig 2 which intercepts the generated runoff and sediment from above the maximum storage volume can be calculated as shao et al 2013 1 v mx n t

liu and li 2017 the excavation was backfilled into the gully and leveled in steps and formed gully terraces fig 3b to facilitate agricultural mechanization the width of a created gully terrace unit should keep within 20 80 m and the length should be in 50 100 m fig 3c yan an water affairs bureau 2011 liu and li 2017 the storage volume of a gully terrace unit can be calculated with the slope terrace as follows 5 v mx n t 2 l b t a n α 0 2 1 tan α 0 1 tan α c w where α 0 and α c are the angles of the original slope and dam slope respectively the yan an city covers an area of 37 052 km2 of which the yanhe watershed accounts for 20 53 since the glc project was conducted in 2012 the area of the glc project reached 84 04 km2 189 89 km2 and 336 67 km2 which accounted for 0 23 0 51 and 0 91 of the whole area of yan an city in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively based on previous research the drainage density was 0 32 km km2 in the yanhe watershed song et al 2012 wang 2014 therefore the total length of the gullies in the yanhe watershed was 2435 km due to the long and narrow gully landform features the created gully terraces had a width of 20 80 m and a length of 50 100 m keeping the same ratio of glc in yan an city the reclaimed gully length in the yanhe watershed was 350 km 776 km and 1385 km which accounted for 14 32 and 57 of the total gully length in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively in view of this four scenarios table 1 were defined in terms of the glc project in 2010 2013 2015 and 2017 and the impact of glc on flow and sediment transport was revealed by the terrace algorithm embedded within the swat model in the yanhe watershed 3 3 swat accuracy evaluation in the swat model runoff is affected by 27 parameters and sediment load is influenced by 18 parameters ahn

right conclusions only if 1 there is a causal relationship between the variables being compared 2 the variables have a positive correlation and 3 the reference variable is comprised of observations

assessment of rainfall to stream to examine the effect of rainfall distribution on streamflow in the yanhe watershed we analysed the rainfall data from 2000 to 2016 fig 4 the results showed that 54 of precipitation in the yanhe watershed was concentrated in flooding period and 46 of them was distributed in non flood period the concentrated rainfall was easy to generate surface runoff because of thick soil layer fine sandy loam and silt loam on the loess plateau huang and shao 2019 kang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 besides we used the swat model and iha indictor of hydrologic alteration model developed by nature conservancy nature conservancy 2009 to comprehensively evaluate the baseflow in the yanhe watershed and separated surface runoff from streamflow fig 4 exhibited that the impact of precipitation on stream was mainly occurred in flooding period the surface runoff generated by rainfall took account 79 of the streamflow during the flooding period but the average runoff coefficient was only 0 05 in flooding period from 2000 to 2016 since 1999 the loess plateau conducted the gfg and glc project successively both of them restrained the surface runoff generation and influx especially the glc project it has great influence on runoff confluence and sediment transport 4 2 calibration and validation of swat through the parameter sensitivity analysis with soil and water assessment tool calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup seven parameters sensitive to runoff and five parameters sensitive to sediment load were selected in the modeling of the yanhe watershed table 2 then the optimal values of the parameters were determined by the latin hypercube sampling method the results indicated that soil properties basin management and stream characteristics were the main factors affecting runoff and soil erosion in this region based on the land use in 2010 this study used the r2 nse rsr and pbias statistics as references to calibrate the monthly runoff and sediment load with the measured data at the ganguyi gauging station in the yanhe watershed during the calibration period 2003 2008 the results showed that the simulation matched the observation well figs 5 and 6 the monthly r2 nse rsr and pbias values were 0 94 0 67 0 58 and 19 for the runoff and 0 68 0 60 0 55 and 15 for the sediment load table 3 according to the research on the model performance evaluation moriasi et al 2007 the model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if the nse 0 5 rsr 0 5 pbias 25 for runoff and pbias 55 for sediment in the swat model model validation was conducted using data from 2009 to 2012 based on the calibrated parameters the monthly r2 nse rsr and pbias values were 0 62 0 62 0 62 and 7 for the runoff and 0 43 0 81 0 44 and 21 for the sediment load in the validation period 2009 2012 the simulated did not match the observed runoff mainly in winter and early spring months the one possible reason for the difference can be related to the fact that swat model calculated snow melt with simple temperature based equations ignoring the impacts of land use cover slope gradient and aspect on snow melt debele et al 2010 grusson et al 2015 it led to the deviations between the observed and simulated runoff the lack of reservoir management data could also have determined the underestimation of runoff in early spring months because there is no available measured sediment load data during the low flow periods we only compared the observed monthly sediment yield to the simulated monthly sediment yield during the high flow periods overall the simulated monthly runoff and sediment load matched well with the observed monthly sediment it could achieve the simulation accuracy for the monthly runoff and sediment load in the yanhe watershed 4 3 applicability analysis of the terrace algorithm to assess the applicability of the terrace module under glc conditions the general swat project was constructed with the land use in 2010 and the climate from 2013 to 2016 which was simulated the monthly runoff and sediment yield before the implementation of glc in the yanhe watershed in addition based on the general swat project the terrace module was conducted according to the ratio of reclaimed gully length to the total gully length in 2013 and 2015 finally the monthly observed runoff and sediment load were compared with the simulated runoff and sediment load for 2013 and 2015 the results showed that the r2 values of monthly runoff and sediment load were 0 99 and 0 97 respectively after linear regression fig 7 likewise the nse values were 0 83 and 0 82 and the pbias values were 21 and 17 respectively this proved that the terrace algorithm integrated into the swat model had a good performance researching the impacts of glc on runoff and sediment transport 4 4 assessing the impact of glc on runoff and sediment transport fig 8 presents the monthly runoff variation under different ratios of glc in the yanhe watershed s2010 denoted that there wasn t launched the glc project and s2013 s2015 and s2017 referred to the 14 32 and 57 of gully length namely 0 23 0 51 and 0 91 of gully area was reclaimed into the gully terraces in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively the results indicated that the impact of glc on runoff was concentrated in the flooding period july through september 14 32 and 57 of the reclaimed gully length could decrease the streamflow by 6 34 11 00 and 18 13 respectively and its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 yr the streamflow exhibited a little fluctuation in the four scenarios during the non flood period and it increased slightly in the driest season december and january therefore the glc project had the function of promoting runoff infiltration in the flooding period and recharging rivers in the non flood period in the yanhe watershed rainfall is concentrated in flooding periods and 60 70 of rainfall events occur in the form of high intensity rainstorms liang et al 2015 surface runoff is generated because rain intensity exceeds the actual infiltration capacity hortonian runoff smith and goodrich 2006 once the heavy rain generates sheet flow the hilly gully dominated region provides the kinetic energy to the overland flow which is apt to develop into powerful runoff and flow into the natural drainage channels however the glc project created the gully terrace arable land by widening the original gully space filling the natural channels and levelling the reclaimed land which diminished the kinetic energy of the runoff and increased the infiltration when the surface runoff flowed into the reclaimed gully terraces the capability of increasing the runoff infiltration in flooding periods and compensating for the dry periods was enhanced with the extension of the glc area surface runoff was hard to develop in non flood periods because of low rainfall and weak rainfall intensity even if runoff was generated the small area of created gully terraces could restrict surface runoff thus the glc stores the runoff on the gully terrace volume in flooding periods and recharges the stream during non flood periods fig 9 shows that the glc project made a difference in the sediment load at the monthly scale which was simulated via the terrace algorithm integrated into the swat model s2010 represented the sediment load variation before launching the glc in the yanhe watershed and s2013 s2015 and s2017 represented 14 32 and 57 of gully length was reclaimed into gully terraces in 2013 2015 and 2017 respectively compared without conducting the glc project the sediment load decreased by 32 62 53 95 and 88 68 with 14 32 and 57 gully length reclaimed into terraces during the flooding period respectively comparing with the 14 and 32 of the glc there was a dramatic reduction in sediment load when the reclaimed gully length accounted for 57 of the total gully length the ability of reclaimed gully terraces to restrict sediment transport was greater than that of flow and reclaimed gully terraces trapped sediment transport all the time even if during the non flood period the sediment trap efficiency of glc was up to 3979 t km2 yr therefore the glc project had good control over soil erosion the function of glc to restrict sediment transport was closely associated with surface runoff the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau was caused by concentrated high intensity rainstorms during the flooding period zheng and wang 2014 the surface runoff provided the driving force for soil erosion and sediment transport and the created gully terraces not only dissipated part of the flow energy but also trapped most of the sediment hence the glc project played an important role in soil and water conservation 4 5 recommended ratio of glc this study demonstrates that the glc project had a great influence on water and sediment flux during the flooding period the terrace module and dmc searcy and hardison 1960 weiss and wilson 1953 were employed to detect the recommended ratio of the glc project in the yanhe watershed from 2001 to 2016 this synthesis firstly used the terrace module to simulate the monthly runoff in different ratios 0 60 of reclaimed gully length from 2007 to 2016 then the dmc was utilized to detect the runoff variation during the flooding period fig 10 the results showed that breakage of dmc slope appeared once the glc was launched and the deviation from the original trend increased as the glc project extension from 0 to 60 of gully length besides the slope decreased from 239 111 m3 mm to 97 557 m3 mm to identify the prominent break of the dmc slope the pettitt test was applied to test the trend of the dmc slope the method quantitatively examines the slope of the dmc itself and the break in the slope taking account of the effect of precipitation on the occurrence of the slope break gao et al 2017 it reflected the response of runoff change on different gully terraced areas under the same rainfall conditions fig 11 illustrates the dmc slope change before and after implemented the glc project in the yanhe watershed when the length of created gully terraces accounts for 50 of the total gully length that accounts for 0 8 61 km2 of the total watershed area the dmc slope has a significant change p 5 this means that gullies as the confluence sections of surface runoff when the area of glc accounts for 0 8 of the total watershed area the runoff generated by precipitation will be restrained by the created gully terraces and it will make the streamflow have a significant reduction this change perhaps threaten the water demand of the river system eco environment and cause the river to lose part of its ecological functions thus the recommended ratio of glc should be kept within 0 8 in the yanhe watershed 5 conclusion the terrace algorithm which was integrated into the swat was used to investigate the impact of the gully land consolidation project on runoff and sediment discharge in recent decades the improved swat had a good performance detecting the fluctuation of runoff and sediment transport it proposed a new method to evaluate the effect of land consolidation on water and sediment flux in a catchment which would provide a reference for optimizing land use structure and distribution the influence of gully land consolidation on runoff and sediment transport was concentrated in the flooding period its runoff interception efficiency was 169 350 m3 km2 year and the sediment trap efficiency was 3979 t km2 yr but runoff slightly increased during the most dry period december and january gully land consolidation promoted runoff infiltration during the flooding period and recharged rivers during the non flood period and effectively controlled soil erosion especially in the flooding period therefore the gully land consolidation project executed on the loess plateau not only alleviated the contradiction between agricultural development and ecological protection but also contributed to soil conservation when implemented within a proper range on the loess plateau based on the simulation results of the improved swat the recommended ratio of gully land consolidation was identified by the combination of the double mass curve and pettitt test the reclaimed gully area should remain within 0 8 of the total area in the yanhe watershed if the reclaimed area expands out of the scale it may cause a series of ecological and environmental problems credit authorship contribution statement youcai kang conceptualization

4376,water is the most important factor limiting the growth of sand binding vegetation sbv in desert ecosystems this study explored the water sources and water use strategies of sbv under a natural precipitation gradient six typical sbv species were selected comprising three tree species pinus sylvestris haloxylon ammodendron and populus euphratica and three shrub species artemesia ordosica caragana korshinshii and tmarix ramosissima the stable isotope values δd δ 18o of xylem water and potential water sources precipitation soil water and groundwater of these species under a precipitation gradient in the sandy regions of northern china were measured in addition the relative contributions of the different potential water sources to water use by sbv were analyzed using the mixsiar model the results indicated that the local meteoric water lines lmwls of the six sbv species were located on the right side of the global meteoric water line gmwl with the degree of deviation gradually increasing with a decrease in precipitation the results showed that t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used groundwater gw whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water among those species using soil water p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water 20 80 cm p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest soil water utilization rate of 14 whereas p euphratica showed the lowest soil water utilization rate of 2 the different sbv species showed significantly different soil water utilization rates due to the influence of plant root distribution p 0 001 among the six sbv species trees showed a higher gw utilization rate compared to shrubs at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively whereas shrubs showed a higher deep soil water utilization rate 140 200 cm compared to trees at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively the precipitation utilization rates amongst the six sbv species were highest in spring followed by autumn and summer the utilization of gw by sbv will be intensified in the future due to climate change however the stability of t ramosissima may pose a threat due to its low utilization rate of gw keywords stable isotopes sandy soils sand binding vegetable water source northern china 1 introduction water availability is the most important factor limiting growth of sand binding vegetation sbv in sandy regions dai et al 2015 dube and pickup 2001 the selection of plant water sources depends on the distribution of available water in the habitat and the ability of plants to obtain water vargas et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019 precipitation and groundwater gw are the main water sources for sbv in these regions harkes et al 2010 li et al 2017 short term water resource enrichment resulting from each precipitation events in arid sandy regions plays an important role in the growth of plants li et al 2014 schwinning and sala 2004 water use strategies of sbv differ under different precipitation conditions jia et al 2008 miller et al 2001 pan et al 2020 in general under high precipitation sbv mainly used shallow soil water while gw is mainly used when precipitation is low huang et al 2020 however the study by pan et al 2020 also showed that under the same precipitation conditions the water use strategies of different sbv are also different zhang et al 2007 showed that precipitation in the mid high latitudes of the northern hemisphere will increase significantly from now until the middle of the 21st century particularly in the sandy regions of northern china this future increase in precipitation is likely to lead to a change in water use strategies of sbv li et al 2017 therefore there is value in further examination of the influence of an increase in natural precipitation on water sources water use efficiency and stability of sandy regions by studying the variations in water use strategies of sbv in northern china under a natural precipitation gradient plants of different functional types barbeta et al 2015 fornara and tilman 2008 schenk and jackson 2002 or ages fatichi et al 2014 liu et al 2010 sanaphre villanueva et al 2017 in natural ecosystems use different depths of water sources due to the different types or distribution depths of plant roots this differentiation in water use among different plant species will affect the water balance of an ecosystem the responses of vegetation to climate change and the natural distribution of species in specific areas fowler 1986 neilson 1995 porporato et al 2004 ruffault et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2010 plants mainly absorb water through their roots the traditional whole root excavation method to determine the source of plant water is time consuming and arduous meinzer et al 2001 and it is very destructive to plants and the ecological environment stable isotope technology is considered to be a less destructive and accurate method of identifying the water sources of plants and soil and has been widely used in arid and semi arid areas characterized by fragile environments and scarce vegetation eggemeyer et al 2009 yang et al 2011 besides for in a very small number of halophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 isotopic fractionation does not occur before the water absorbed by the roots of terrestrial plants is transported through the xylem to the young not suberization branches or leaves dawson et al 2002 ehleringer and dawson 1992 therefore a comparison of the isotopic value δd δ 18o of xylem water with that of each potential water source can determine the proportion of each water source used by plants previous studies have used the linear mixing model to calculate the relative contributions of these water sources to plants pan et al 2020 white et al 1985 however the use of the isotopic values of d and 18o by this model limits its capacity to identify three types of water sources at most the main models including iso source mixsir siar and mixsiar are able to identify the relative contributions of more than three potential sources of water to plants wang et al 2019 however the results of these models vary greatly wang et al 2017 2019 the iso source model is the most widely used model for calculating plant water sources evaristo et al 2017 liao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 mabit et al 2018 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 however this model is based on simple conservation of mass and does not take into account the effects of random measurement errors and isotope fractionation in contrast the mixsiar model not only integrates the advantages of the mixsir and siar models but also includes modules for source data input form and classification variables which can effectively improve the calculation accuracy of the model ma and song 2016 a study by wang et al 2017 on plant water sources in semi arid areas found that the mixsiar model showed a better performance in simulating plant water sources compared to that of the iso source and mixsir models however few studies have used the mixsiar model to evaluate water sources of sbv in northern china the sandy region of northern china 35 n 50 n 75 e 125 e begins from the horqin sandy land in the east and extends to the taklimakan desert in the west with a total area of 3 2 105 km2 ma et al 2019 the chinese government has over the last 50 years launched a series of ecological construction projects including shelterbelts in the three northern regions and returning farmland to forests these projects have aimed to effectively curb the hazards of sandstorms and prevent further expansion of sandy land fu et al 2011 sun et al 2018 xie et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 the dominant sbv plant species in this area are pinus sylvestrisa artemesia ordosica caragana korshinshii tmarix ramosissima haloxylon ammodendron and populus euphratica previous studies on these sbv species have mostly focused on their physiological characteristics drought resistance and ecological processes li et al 2019 wang et al 2007a zeng et al 2019 and relatively few studies have focused on their water sources in addition there has to date not been a comparative analysis of water use strategies of dominant sbv species along the natural precipitation gradient in northern china current terrestrial process models assume the mixing of different water sources in soil and the water originating from gw surface runoff and plant transpiration all originate from the same mixed water source soil water however the latest research shows that water sources for plant transpiration and the supply of gw and river water originate from different water source pools in soil brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 soil water can be divided into soil mobile water and bound water scholl and murphy 2014 no isotope exchange occurs between these categories and plants prefer to use soil bound water evaristo et al 2015 good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 this phenomenon is also known as the stable isotope two water worlds tww hypothesis the tww poses a challenge to the parameterization of plant physiological processes and runoff processes in existing land surface models however tww is influenced by many factors such as temperature precipitation and soil type and shows obvious differences under different climate and underlying surface conditions dubbert et al 2019 vargas et al 2017 the present study determined the δd and δ 18o values of precipitation xylem water soil water and gw at six national field observation stations of the chinese academy of sciences to verify whether the water sources of typical sbv in northern china satisfy the tww hypothesis the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the contributions of each potential water source precipitation soil water and gw to the different sbv species throughout the growing season 2 analyze the water sources of sbv in northern china under the natural precipitation gradient 3 whether existence of the tww phenomenon in sandy regions northern china 4 explore water use strategies of sbv in relation to climate change the results of the present study can provide a scientific basis for the optimal allocation of regional water resources and the comprehensive control of desertification 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the sandy region of northern china 35 n 50 n 75 e 125 e spans four climatic zones from west to east 1 the extreme arid zone 2 the arid zone 3 the semi arid zone and 4 the semi humid zone annual precipitation of this region ranges from 50 mm to 600 mm from west to east the sandy region of northern china mainly includes the taklimakan desert the gurbantunggut desert the hexi sandy land the tengger desert the mu us desert and the horqin sandy land from west to east with a total area of 3 2 105 km2 fig 1 ma et al 2018 the main sbv species vary across the different sandy regions due to differences in climate li et al 2014 the dominant sbv species among the different sandy regions are p sylvestris in the horqin sandy land a ordosica in the mu us sandy land caragana korshinshii in the tengger desert t ramosissima in the hexi sandy land haloxylon ammodendron in the gurbantunggut desert and populus euphratica in the taklimakan desert among them p sylvestris h ammodendron and p euphratica are trees whereas a ordosica c korshinshii and t ramosissima are shrubs the present study selected six national field observation stations zgt zhanggutai yc yanchi spt shapotou lz linze fk fukang aks aksu occupying sandy land as sampling points table 1 shows more detailed information for the sample points 2 2 sample collection plant soil precipitation and gw samples were collected during the growing season of 2016 extending from april 1 to november 1 from the six sample plots sampling was conducted twice during the middle of each month for a total of 14 times per water sources all sampling processes were completed between 10 00 11 00 local time to reduce the influence of external conditions such as light intensity on isotope results all sampling sites are located in flat sandy lands plant soil and gw samples were collected during sunny weather in which there had been no rainfall for at least two days prior to sampling each plant xylem sample was taken as an amalgamation of samples from three plants with good growth and relatively consistent height small lignified stems of 0 3 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length were promptly peeled and placed into a 10 ml glass bottle sealed with parafilm and frozen at 18 c for preservation three soil profiles were dug at a position 2 m away from the above plant sample points to a depth of 2 m and soil samples were collected from the soil layers of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 60 cm 60 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm and 180 200 cm collected soil samples were divided into two parts with the first group sealed in 10 ml glass bottles using parafilm and stored at 18 c for later analysis of δd and δ 18o in soil water whereas the second group were placed in an aluminum box and oven dried in the laboratory to determine soil moisture content samples of natural precipitation during the test period daily precipitation 0 1 mm were collected in 10 ml glass bottles sealed with parafilm and refrigerated at 2 c in addition gw samples were collected from monitoring wells at the six field stations for each station three gw samples were placed in 10 ml glass bottles sealed with parafilm and refrigerated at 2 c temperature and precipitation data for each sampling point during the sampling periods were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 isotopic analyses water from xylem and soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system ehleringer et al 1998 in the laboratory of the chinese academy of sciences captured water was then transferred into 2 ml sealed glass vials and stored at 2 c until analyses the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of all liquid water samples were then measured using an isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system and a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i usa with repeat abilities precisions of 0 1 and 0 3 for δ 18o and δd respectively zhou et al 2019 due to organic matter in plant water samples the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms finniga mat 253 was used to determine the δd and δ 18o in plant water with precisions of 0 2 for δ 18o and of 0 1 for δd zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the 17 samples without organic contamination were randomly selected from each sample site and determined by iris and irms the results showed that there was no significant difference between the two methods p 0 05 the stable isotope content in the tested water samples was expressed as the difference to the 1000 ppm of the stable isotope ratio relative to that of the werner standard mean ocean water vsmow 1 δ d o r sample r standard 1 1000 in eq 1 rsample and rstandard are the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions 18o 16o d 1h of the sample and standard water vsmow respectively there is a significant linear correlation between δd and δ 18o of global terrestrial meteoric precipitation δd 8δ 18o 10 with the linear regression line referred to as the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 proposed the relationship expressed in eq 2 to quantitatively express the magnitude and mode of the fractionation reaction of the isotopic eigenvalue 2 d δ d 8 δ o in eq 2 the multiplier of 8 approximates the observed ratio in global meteoric waters whereas d excess represents the difference between δd and δ 18o fractionations 2 4 methods for ecohydrological separation the precipitation offset values pos is commonly used method in quantitative evaluation of ecohydrological separation evaristo et al 2015 based on the δd δ 18o relationship the ecohydrological separation performed in the mixing process of precipitation and soil water can be qualitatively analyzed scholl and murphy 2014 due to thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic nonequilibrium fractionation in the evaporation process of soil water the hdo and h2 18o in soil water are gradually enriched bowling et al 2017 mccutcheon et al 2017 at the same time the δd δ 18o relationship of soil evaporation water vapor is offset from the local meteoric water lines lmwl forming the soil evaporation line it has been found that the δd δ 18o relationship of each water pools have two forms namely complete separation or certain connectivity brooks et al 2010 geris et al 2015 if there is any complete separation the δd δ 18o of soil moving water is similar to that of precipitation but different from that of soil bound water if there is certain connectivity the δd δ 18o of soil moving water is not quite similar to that of precipitation and is also affected by soil bound water the isotopic characteristic values of plant water soil water and gw were calculated according to which their degrees of offset from lmwl were assessed the quantitative method is as follows 3 pos δ d a δ 18 o b s in eq 3 pos represents the precipitation offset values a and b are the slope and intercept of lmwl respectively s is the uncertainty of δd and δ 18o is the standard deviation 2 5 data analysis the mixsiar model is widely used to calculate the proportion of water sources used by plants ma and song 2016 wang et al 2019 the model considers the uncertainty of source value classification and prior continuous covariate information the model also integrates the latest developments within the bayesian mixing model the mixsiar model was implemented in the r software stock and semmens 2013 two parameters need to be set before running the model 1 the average and standard deviation sd of the source isotopic compositions were input into the bayesian models 2 the running length of malcalfe chain monte carlo mcmc was set to an extended value soil water in different soil layers was considered as the potential source of sbv soil water content root distribution and isotopic composition of soil water were used as the basis for the classification of potential water sources 1 the topsoil 0 20 cm was greatly affected by rainfall and evaporation and the soil water content and soil water isotopic composition changed greatly 2 the shallow soil 20 80 cm showed small changes in soil water content and soil water isotopic composition whereas there were greater changes to the distribution of roots 3 the middle soil 80 140 cm layer showed a smaller change in soil water content and soil water isotopic composition compared to that in shallow soil 4 the bottom soil 140 200 cm layer showed the least change in soil water content and the isotopic composition of soil water was relatively stable one way analysis of variance anova followed by post hoc turkey s test at p 0 05 were conducted to test for significant differences in isotope ratios of different water sources in different plants prior to analysis all variables conformed to normality assumptions and homogeneity levene s test all statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 variations in soil water content soil water content was low across the entire northern sandy region and soil water content varied among the six sbv species fig 2 the rank of the sbv species in terms of the water content of the soil they were growing in was a ordosica 2 45 0 16 p sylvestris 1 75 0 27 t ramosissima 1 59 0 11 h ammodendron 0 99 0 13 c korshinshii 0 78 0 11 p euphratica 0 45 0 11 soil water contents of a ordosica p sylvestris and t ramosissima first increased and then decreases with increasing soil depth with the maximum soil contents appearing at 40 cm and 120 cm respectively the soil moisture contents for c korshinskii and p euphratica increased with increasing soil depth with a maximum value at 200 cm these different trends may be attributed to a ordosica having relatively shallow roots which easily form a water resistant layer at the soil surface ma et al 2017 thereby reducing subsoil evaporation the relatively low soil water content of c korshinshii could be attributed to the small structure its leaves the lower leaf area of this species provides less shade which increases subsoil evaporation she et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 3 2 seasonal variation in precipitation isotopes precipitation gradually decreased from a to f at the six sample points and there was a significant difference between δd and δ 18o fig 3 the d excess measure has been proposed to measure the degree to which precipitation deviates from the gmwl due to geographic location or climatic factors this measure not only reflects the degree of atmospheric influence on δd and δ 18o during precipitation condensation but also that of moisture and wind speed in the source area of water vapor benetti et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 lacelle 2011 precipitation at the six sample points during the growing season mainly occurred during july and august accounting for 31 66 of the total precipitation during the growing season the rank of the six sampling points in terms of precipitation of these two months was zgt 194 2 mm yc 124 3 mm lz 101 5 mm spt 80 5 mm aks 69 2 mm kf 49 1 mm the rank of the six sampling points in terms of d excess of precipitation of these two months was zgt 14 2 yc 12 4 aks 9 7 spt 6 2 lz 5 9 fk 3 3 this result can be attributed to the strong convergence of water vapor during summer and strong evaporation of raindrops as they fall through the atmosphere these processes result in δ 18o rich local water vapor entering the precipitation cloud cluster thereby decreasing d excess of precipitation and increasing δ 18o pan et al 2020 parkes et al 2017 samuels crow et al 2014 3 3 isotopic composition of soil water gw and xylem water as shown in fig 4 a linear relationship was established between the values of δd and δ 18o in precipitation soil water xylem water and gw samples at the six sites the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls at the six sample sites were clearly smaller than that of the gmwl and stable isotope δd δ 18o ratios of precipitation generally larger than the gmwl the results showed that the stable isotope values δd δ 18o were affected by secondary evaporation during precipitation in the sandy areas of northern china with the effect of secondary evaporation increasing with decreasing precipitation a f the isotopic values of the sites zgt yc spt and fk coincided with the lmwl indicating that precipitation in these areas may be a potential source of gw recharge the isotopic values of zgt and fk were similar to those of xylem water indicating that gw may be the main source of water for p sylvestris and h ammodendron in addition the xylem water isotopic value of site spt fell on the right side of the lmwl indicating that c korshinshii utilized soil water that was affected by evaporation and that underwent isotopic fractionation the degree to which the isotope level of soil water deviated from the lmwl gradually decreased with increasing soil depth the precipitation gradient also resulted in clear differences in the utilization of soil water of different soil layers by sbv p 0 05 from the semi humid area a to the extremely arid area f the δ 18o values of xylem water the δ 18o values of the xylem water of p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinskii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica were 8 31 5 64 5 28 7 92 8 14 and 8 72 respectively were similar to the δ 18o values of surface shallow middle and deep soil water respectively these results suggested that vegetation gradually utilized soil water from deeper layers as precipitation decreased the δ 18o values of soil water of the different sbv species decreased with increasing soil depth with the maximum value occurring in the surface soil layers fig 5 the xylem of c korshinskii showed the largest δ 18o whereas that of p euphratica was the lowest at 5 28 and 8 72 respectively among the six species of sbv gw of h ammodendron had the largest δ 18o value whereas that of p sylvestris was the lowest at 8 43 and 10 89 respectively there were dramatic changes in the soil water δ 18o values in the 0 100 cm soil layer of p sylvestris a ordosica and h ammodendron ranging from 2 16 to 10 41 there were dramatic changes in the δ 18o values of soil water of the 0 140 cm soil layer for c korshinskii and t ramosissima ranging from 2 96 to 9 21 there were dramatic changes in soil water δ 18o across the entire 0 200 cm soil layer for p euphratica these results indicated that the soil layers experienced strong evaporation the δ 18o values of soil water in the 100 200 cm soil layer for the six sbv species were close to that of gw with the corresponding soil layer of p sylvestris and a ordosica being 100 cm that of c korshinshii and t ramosissima being 140 cm that of h ammodendron being 180 cm and that of p euphratica being 200 cm these results indicate that soil water may be replenished by gw in addition the δ 18o values of soil water in the 40 160 cm soil layer for the six sbv species were close to the δ 18o values of xylem water with the soil layers of p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica being 100 cm 40 60 cm 40 cm 80 100 cm 100 140 cm and 120 160 cm respectively these results suggest that soil water may be a potential source of water for the sbv species the table 2 show that the pos values of xylem water soil water and ground water are both negative and the pos of xylem water and soil water are significantly different from those of ground water p 0 01 this result indicates that plant water and ground water are supplied from different soil water pools and the ecohydrological separation occurs in the process of water source supply hence there are two non uniform and incomplete mixed water sources in the soil of the sandy region of northern china which maintain the water requirement and evapotranspiration of sbv respectively 3 4 quantitative analysis of water sources of sand binding vegetation the mixsiar model was used to estimate the relative contributions of the potential water sources to the six sbv species fig 6 among the six sbv species t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used gw at rates of 46 54 and 62 respectively whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water at rates of 65 81 and 54 respectively p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest precipitation utilization rates among the of six sbv species at 14 respectively whereas p euphratica showed the lowest at 2 however p euphratica showed the highest gw utilization rate at 62 a ordosica showed the lowest precipitation and gw utilization rates at 9 and 10 respectively whereas this species had the highest soil water utilization rate at 81 the highest soil water use efficiencies of the six sbv species gradually shifted from shallow soil layers to deep layers with decreasing precipitation a f p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water whereas c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used deep soil water 4 discussion 4 1 utilization strategies of sand binding vegetation for different water sources plants tend to place more dependence on stable water sources in arid regions the utilization of stable deep soil water and gw increases the resilience of plants and ensures their survival in water deficient environments dai et al 2015 plants adopt different water use strategies since the degree of water stress experienced by plants differs among the different seasons payero et al 2009 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 mccole and stern 2007 examined the water use patterns of juniperus ashei in the edwards plateau over different seasons and determined that vegetation depended most on gw during the summer whereas soil water below 10 cm was mainly used during winter in the present study the six sbv species utilized precipitation most during spring followed by autumn and summer table 3 which is consistent with the research results of xu et al 2018 however this result could not be attributed to total precipitation in spring and autumn exceeding that in summer but rather to the fact that evaporation over spring and autumn in sandy regions in northern china is weaker than that in summer and so the effective precipitation available to vegetation increases over spring and autumn gw is the main source of water for sbv li et al 2017 walton et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 accounting for 32 74 of all water sources of sbv li et al 2017 the gw utilization rates of all sbv species examined in the present study exceeded 46 2 sbv have a higher dependence on gw in areas with low precipitation arndt et al 2004 elmore et al 2006 zheng et al 2012 in the present study the gw utilization rates of t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica in arid and extremely arid regions all exceeded 53 2 among the different seasons p sylvestris showed a higher gw utilization rate exceeding 52 4 due to its deep root system which allowed better use of gw in an arid environment song et al 2020 zeng et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 although the precipitation gradient was the main factor driving the water utilization strategies of the sbv species examined xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 there were significant differences among different plant function types bao et al 2020 liu et al 2017 since shrubs generally have shallower root depths compared to that of trees leung et al 2015 the gw utilization rates of shrubs in the natural environment are below those of trees in the present study the gw utilization rate of trees exceeded that of shrubs at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively fig 7 the soil water utilization rates of trees and shrubs also differed among the different soil layers since the roots of shrubs tend to be shallow and mainly distributed in surface and shallow soil their soil water utilization rates in surface and shallow soil tend to exceed those of trees whereas their deep soil water utilization rates tend to be lower than those of trees pan et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however the deep soil utilization rates of shrubs exceeded those of trees in the present study at 11 45 and 9 45 respectively this can be mainly attributed to a shallower overall distribution of shrub roots since the roots in the surface soil remain dormant under dry climate conditions shrubs are forced to rely on deep roots for absorption of soil water kulmatiski et al 2020 xu and li 2006 shrubs tend to increase their use of shallow soil water as precipitation increases and surface dormant roots are activated dai et al 2015 geißler et al 2019 luo et al 2019 however huang and zhang 2015 showed that c korshinshii in shapotou with a forest age of more than 30 years mainly used soil water from a depth of 60 150 cm the c korshinshii examined in the present study were 3 yr in age and had shallow root distributions indicating that root distribution was an important factor influencing the water use strategies of sbv this result further indicates that there are some limitations associated with determining the water sources of plants through the examination of root structure fitter 1987 nagel et al 2009 thorburn and ehleringer 1995 and the distribution of plant roots is not necessarily an indication of where water is absorbed 4 2 effects of climate change on plant water sources water sources differ among different functional plants pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 precipitation is the main factor limiting the growth and development of sbv in arid and semi arid regions harkes et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 lai et al 2019 the difference in precipitation available to p euphratica in the extreme arid region compared to that available to p sylvestris in the sub humid region resulted in different sbv landscapes ranging from sparse woodland to dense woodland fig 8 the rate at which vegetation utilize precipitation is influenced by the amount of available precipitation and physiological properties of vegetation poorter et al 2019 sankaran and staver 2019 the results of the present study showed that although a ordosica is located in semi arid areas annual precipitation is relatively high however since the root distribution of a ordosica is relatively shallow a large amount of available water is lost through the high transpiration rates of surface soil and leaves resulting in the low utilization rates of precipitation and shallow soil water but higher utilization rates of deeper soil water 20 200 cm of a ordosica therefore p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest precipitation utilization rates 14 in the present study the depth of plant roots determines the degree to which soil water from different soil layers is absorbed and utilized chen et al 2018 schwinning et al 2020 wang et al 2017 plant responses to surface soil water sometimes require sufficient amounts of precipitation for the activation of surface roots bowles et al 2018 gan et al 2013 nie et al 2011 therefore precipitation exceeding a certain threshold is required for the activation of sbv root systems for absorbing surface soil water in arid or semi arid regions soylu et al 2014 wang et al 2007a which is consistent with the results of the present study however the present study also found that the sbv precipitation utilization rate of surface soil water also decreased 20 2 with decreasing precipitation there are also differences in gw utilization rates among different sbv species due to differences in root depth nagel et al 2009 schwinning et al 2020 the results of the present study showed that although p sylvestris is located in a sub humid area since the root system of this species was able to extend to the gw level p sylvestris had a higher gw utilization rate compared to that of a ordosica water is the most important factor limiting ecosystem processes and functions in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2017 within the context of global climate change changes in precipitation patterns will have an important influence on water sources water utilization strategies and vegetation distributions of individual plant species pan et al 2020 wang et al 2007b xu et al 2011 the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 found that the global average surface temperature increased by 0 85 c between 1880 and 2012 ipcc 2013 rising at a rate of 0 12 c yr 1 from 1951 to 2012 stocker and plattner 2014 other studies have shown that the arid region of northwest china is currently undergoing a warm wet phase which will continue in the future geng et al 2014 chen et al 2019 found that future increased precipitation in the arid areas of northwest china will mainly be distributed in desert areas huang et al 2017 determined that the most significant changes to precipitation will be in arid and extreme arid regions whereas changes to precipitation in the sub humid regions will not change significantly it has also been demonstrated that the warming of the arid region in northwest china will increase surface evapotranspiration li et al 2014 ma et al 2018 with the most significant change in the drought region wang et al 2015 it is predicted that the sandy region of northern china will experience increases in both future evapotranspiration and precipitation ma et al 2018 brooks et al 2010 used the isotope method to study the water flow process in a watershed in the united states their study found that soil water can be divided into soil mobile water and soil bound water with plants preferring to use the latter this not only satisfies the tww hypothesis but also indicates that plants utilize different sources of water to different degrees excessive evapotranspiration will increase the degree of aridity elguindi et al 2014 huang et al 2016 forcing vegetation to use more soil bound water sprenger et al 2016 this strategy is only sustainable in the long term when there is sufficient rainfall to replenish bound water in the soil cheng et al 2006 williams and ehleringer 2000 therefore gw may be used to a greater degree by sbv in northern china in the future among the sbv species in arid areas the shrub t ramosissima utilizes gw to a lower degree as compared to the tree h ammodendron with the physiological attributes of the former characterized by leaves which experience high transpiration and relatively shallow roots therefore the vulnerability of t ramosissima to changes in climate should be emphasized when assessing the stability of sbv to the future climate change in northern china 4 3 limitations and prospects the present study used the mixsiar model to evaluated the water use strategies of sbv in the sandy areas of northern china although existing studies have shown the simulation accuracy of the mixsiar model to exceed that of the iso source and mixsir models in arid areas wang et al 2019 there have been few comparative studies among different sbv models in addition the present study divided sbv into trees and shrubs with the results evaluated based on the fact that the root length of trees exceeds that of shrubs of the same stand age leung et al 2015 although the present study obtained good research results subsequent studies should measure the specific root length of sbv and systematically quantify the influence of root length on the water use strategy of sbv meanwhile the sampling period of this study was the 2016 growing season and there was a lack of comparative studies on long time series 2 years growing seasons we will follow up this experiment in subsequent studies so as to explore the water use strategy of sbv in a more comprehensive way 5 conclusions the present study used the stable isotope δd δ 18o method to study the water sources and utilization rates of six typical sbv species p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica across a precipitation gradient in the sandy region of northern china the lmwl of each of the six sbv species fell to the right of the gmwl demonstrating that the stable isotope values δd δ 18o during precipitation processes in the sandy regions of northern china are strongly affected by secondary evaporation with the effect increasing with decreasing precipitation p sylvestris and t ramosissima showed the highest precipitation utilization rate whereas p euphratica showed the lowest at 14 and 2 respectively t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used gw at rates of 46 54 and 62 respectively whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water at rates of 65 81 and 54 respectively the highest soil water use efficiencies of sbvs across the different soil layers gradually shifted from shallow layers to deep layers as precipitation decreased from the semi humid region to the extremely arid region p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water whereas c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used deep soil water within the context of global climate change although it is predicted that temperature and precipitation will increase in the sandy regions of northern china evapotranspiration will also increase particularly in arid areas therefore increased focus should be placed on sbv in arid areas when assessing the impact of future climate change on the stability of sbv in northern china in particular on t ramosissima which was found to be less resilient to changes in climate it is suggested that a long term comprehensive sbv monitoring system be established in arid areas to prevent the overexploitation of gw and effectively guarantee the survival of sbv in arid areas credit authorship contribution statement xiaofei ma conceptualization methodology software data curation writing

4376,water is the most important factor limiting the growth of sand binding vegetation sbv in desert ecosystems this study explored the water sources and water use strategies of sbv under a natural precipitation gradient six typical sbv species were selected comprising three tree species pinus sylvestris haloxylon ammodendron and populus euphratica and three shrub species artemesia ordosica caragana korshinshii and tmarix ramosissima the stable isotope values δd δ 18o of xylem water and potential water sources precipitation soil water and groundwater of these species under a precipitation gradient in the sandy regions of northern china were measured in addition the relative contributions of the different potential water sources to water use by sbv were analyzed using the mixsiar model the results indicated that the local meteoric water lines lmwls of the six sbv species were located on the right side of the global meteoric water line gmwl with the degree of deviation gradually increasing with a decrease in precipitation the results showed that t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used groundwater gw whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water among those species using soil water p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water 20 80 cm p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest soil water utilization rate of 14 whereas p euphratica showed the lowest soil water utilization rate of 2 the different sbv species showed significantly different soil water utilization rates due to the influence of plant root distribution p 0 001 among the six sbv species trees showed a higher gw utilization rate compared to shrubs at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively whereas shrubs showed a higher deep soil water utilization rate 140 200 cm compared to trees at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively the precipitation utilization rates amongst the six sbv species were highest in spring followed by autumn and summer the utilization of gw by sbv will be intensified in the future due to climate change however the stability of t ramosissima may pose a threat due to its low utilization rate of gw keywords stable isotopes sandy soils sand binding vegetable water source northern china 1 introduction water availability is the most important factor limiting growth of sand binding vegetation sbv in sandy regions dai et al 2015 dube and pickup 2001 the selection of plant water sources depends on the distribution of available water in the habitat and the ability of plants to obtain water vargas et al 2017 wang et al 2017 2019 precipitation and groundwater gw are the main water sources for sbv in these regions harkes et al 2010 li et al 2017 short term water resource enrichment resulting from each precipitation events in arid sandy regions plays an important role in the growth of plants li et al 2014 schwinning and sala 2004 water use strategies of sbv differ under different precipitation conditions jia et al 2008 miller et al 2001 pan et al 2020 in general under high precipitation sbv mainly used shallow soil water while gw is mainly used when precipitation is low huang et al 2020 however the study by pan et al 2020 also showed that under the same precipitation conditions the water use strategies of different sbv are also different zhang et al 2007 showed that precipitation in the mid high latitudes of the northern hemisphere will increase significantly from now until the middle of the 21st century particularly in the sandy regions of northern china this future increase in precipitation is likely to lead to a change in water use strategies of sbv li et al 2017 therefore there is value in further examination of the influence of an increase in natural precipitation on water sources water use efficiency and stability of sandy regions by studying the variations in water use strategies of sbv in northern china under a natural precipitation gradient plants of different functional types barbeta et al 2015 fornara and tilman 2008 schenk and jackson 2002 or ages fatichi et al 2014 liu et al 2010 sanaphre villanueva et al 2017 in natural ecosystems use different depths of water sources due to the different types or distribution depths of plant roots this differentiation in water use among different plant species will affect the water balance of an ecosystem the responses of vegetation to climate change and the natural distribution of species in specific areas fowler 1986 neilson 1995 porporato et al 2004 ruffault et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2010 plants mainly absorb water through their roots the traditional whole root excavation method to determine the source of plant water is time consuming and arduous meinzer et al 2001 and it is very destructive to plants and the ecological environment stable isotope technology is considered to be a less destructive and accurate method of identifying the water sources of plants and soil and has been widely used in arid and semi arid areas characterized by fragile environments and scarce vegetation eggemeyer et al 2009 yang et al 2011 besides for in a very small number of halophytes ellsworth and williams 2007 isotopic fractionation does not occur before the water absorbed by the roots of terrestrial plants is transported through the xylem to the young not suberization branches or leaves dawson et al 2002 ehleringer and dawson 1992 therefore a comparison of the isotopic value δd δ 18o of xylem water with that of each potential water source can determine the proportion of each water source used by plants previous studies have used the linear mixing model to calculate the relative contributions of these water sources to plants pan et al 2020 white et al 1985 however the use of the isotopic values of d and 18o by this model limits its capacity to identify three types of water sources at most the main models including iso source mixsir siar and mixsiar are able to identify the relative contributions of more than three potential sources of water to plants wang et al 2019 however the results of these models vary greatly wang et al 2017 2019 the iso source model is the most widely used model for calculating plant water sources evaristo et al 2017 liao et al 2018 liu et al 2019 mabit et al 2018 sun et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 however this model is based on simple conservation of mass and does not take into account the effects of random measurement errors and isotope fractionation in contrast the mixsiar model not only integrates the advantages of the mixsir and siar models but also includes modules for source data input form and classification variables which can effectively improve the calculation accuracy of the model ma and song 2016 a study by wang et al 2017 on plant water sources in semi arid areas found that the mixsiar model showed a better performance in simulating plant water sources compared to that of the iso source and mixsir models however few studies have used the mixsiar model to evaluate water sources of sbv in northern china the sandy region of northern china 35 n 50 n 75 e 125 e begins from the horqin sandy land in the east and extends to the taklimakan desert in the west with a total area of 3 2 105 km2 ma et al 2019 the chinese government has over the last 50 years launched a series of ecological construction projects including shelterbelts in the three northern regions and returning farmland to forests these projects have aimed to effectively curb the hazards of sandstorms and prevent further expansion of sandy land fu et al 2011 sun et al 2018 xie et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 the dominant sbv plant species in this area are pinus sylvestrisa artemesia ordosica caragana korshinshii tmarix ramosissima haloxylon ammodendron and populus euphratica previous studies on these sbv species have mostly focused on their physiological characteristics drought resistance and ecological processes li et al 2019 wang et al 2007a zeng et al 2019 and relatively few studies have focused on their water sources in addition there has to date not been a comparative analysis of water use strategies of dominant sbv species along the natural precipitation gradient in northern china current terrestrial process models assume the mixing of different water sources in soil and the water originating from gw surface runoff and plant transpiration all originate from the same mixed water source soil water however the latest research shows that water sources for plant transpiration and the supply of gw and river water originate from different water source pools in soil brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2015 soil water can be divided into soil mobile water and bound water scholl and murphy 2014 no isotope exchange occurs between these categories and plants prefer to use soil bound water evaristo et al 2015 good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 this phenomenon is also known as the stable isotope two water worlds tww hypothesis the tww poses a challenge to the parameterization of plant physiological processes and runoff processes in existing land surface models however tww is influenced by many factors such as temperature precipitation and soil type and shows obvious differences under different climate and underlying surface conditions dubbert et al 2019 vargas et al 2017 the present study determined the δd and δ 18o values of precipitation xylem water soil water and gw at six national field observation stations of the chinese academy of sciences to verify whether the water sources of typical sbv in northern china satisfy the tww hypothesis the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the contributions of each potential water source precipitation soil water and gw to the different sbv species throughout the growing season 2 analyze the water sources of sbv in northern china under the natural precipitation gradient 3 whether existence of the tww phenomenon in sandy regions northern china 4 explore water use strategies of sbv in relation to climate change the results of the present study can provide a scientific basis for the optimal allocation of regional water resources and the comprehensive control of desertification 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the sandy region of northern china 35 n 50 n 75 e 125 e spans four climatic zones from west to east 1 the extreme arid zone 2 the arid zone 3 the semi arid zone and 4 the semi humid zone annual precipitation of this region ranges from 50 mm to 600 mm from west to east the sandy region of northern china mainly includes the taklimakan desert the gurbantunggut desert the hexi sandy land the tengger desert the mu us desert and the horqin sandy land from west to east with a total area of 3 2 105 km2 fig 1 ma et al 2018 the main sbv species vary across the different sandy regions due to differences in climate li et al 2014 the dominant sbv species among the different sandy regions are p sylvestris in the horqin sandy land a ordosica in the mu us sandy land caragana korshinshii in the tengger desert t ramosissima in the hexi sandy land haloxylon ammodendron in the gurbantunggut desert and populus euphratica in the taklimakan desert among them p sylvestris h ammodendron and p euphratica are trees whereas a ordosica c korshinshii and t ramosissima are shrubs the present study selected six national field observation stations zgt zhanggutai yc yanchi spt shapotou lz linze fk fukang aks aksu occupying sandy land as sampling points table 1 shows more detailed information for the sample points 2 2 sample collection plant soil precipitation and gw samples were collected during the growing season of 2016 extending from april 1 to november 1 from the six sample plots sampling was conducted twice during the middle of each month for a total of 14 times per water sources all sampling processes were completed between 10 00 11 00 local time to reduce the influence of external conditions such as light intensity on isotope results all sampling sites are located in flat sandy lands plant soil and gw samples were collected during sunny weather in which there had been no rainfall for at least two days prior to sampling each plant xylem sample was taken as an amalgamation of samples from three plants with good growth and relatively consistent height small lignified stems of 0 3 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length were promptly peeled and placed into a 10 ml glass bottle sealed with parafilm and frozen at 18 c for preservation three soil profiles were dug at a position 2 m away from the above plant sample points to a depth of 2 m and soil samples were collected from the soil layers of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 60 cm 60 100 cm 100 120 cm 120 140 cm 140 160 cm 160 180 cm and 180 200 cm collected soil samples were divided into two parts with the first group sealed in 10 ml glass bottles using parafilm and stored at 18 c for later analysis of δd and δ 18o in soil water whereas the second group were placed in an aluminum box and oven dried in the laboratory to determine soil moisture content samples of natural precipitation during the test period daily precipitation 0 1 mm were collected in 10 ml glass bottles sealed with parafilm and refrigerated at 2 c in addition gw samples were collected from monitoring wells at the six field stations for each station three gw samples were placed in 10 ml glass bottles sealed with parafilm and refrigerated at 2 c temperature and precipitation data for each sampling point during the sampling periods were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 3 isotopic analyses water from xylem and soil samples was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system ehleringer et al 1998 in the laboratory of the chinese academy of sciences captured water was then transferred into 2 ml sealed glass vials and stored at 2 c until analyses the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of all liquid water samples were then measured using an isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system and a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2130 i usa with repeat abilities precisions of 0 1 and 0 3 for δ 18o and δd respectively zhou et al 2019 due to organic matter in plant water samples the stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms finniga mat 253 was used to determine the δd and δ 18o in plant water with precisions of 0 2 for δ 18o and of 0 1 for δd zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 the 17 samples without organic contamination were randomly selected from each sample site and determined by iris and irms the results showed that there was no significant difference between the two methods p 0 05 the stable isotope content in the tested water samples was expressed as the difference to the 1000 ppm of the stable isotope ratio relative to that of the werner standard mean ocean water vsmow 1 δ d o r sample r standard 1 1000 in eq 1 rsample and rstandard are the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions 18o 16o d 1h of the sample and standard water vsmow respectively there is a significant linear correlation between δd and δ 18o of global terrestrial meteoric precipitation δd 8δ 18o 10 with the linear regression line referred to as the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 proposed the relationship expressed in eq 2 to quantitatively express the magnitude and mode of the fractionation reaction of the isotopic eigenvalue 2 d δ d 8 δ o in eq 2 the multiplier of 8 approximates the observed ratio in global meteoric waters whereas d excess represents the difference between δd and δ 18o fractionations 2 4 methods for ecohydrological separation the precipitation offset values pos is commonly used method in quantitative evaluation of ecohydrological separation evaristo et al 2015 based on the δd δ 18o relationship the ecohydrological separation performed in the mixing process of precipitation and soil water can be qualitatively analyzed scholl and murphy 2014 due to thermodynamic equilibrium and dynamic nonequilibrium fractionation in the evaporation process of soil water the hdo and h2 18o in soil water are gradually enriched bowling et al 2017 mccutcheon et al 2017 at the same time the δd δ 18o relationship of soil evaporation water vapor is offset from the local meteoric water lines lmwl forming the soil evaporation line it has been found that the δd δ 18o relationship of each water pools have two forms namely complete separation or certain connectivity brooks et al 2010 geris et al 2015 if there is any complete separation the δd δ 18o of soil moving water is similar to that of precipitation but different from that of soil bound water if there is certain connectivity the δd δ 18o of soil moving water is not quite similar to that of precipitation and is also affected by soil bound water the isotopic characteristic values of plant water soil water and gw were calculated according to which their degrees of offset from lmwl were assessed the quantitative method is as follows 3 pos δ d a δ 18 o b s in eq 3 pos represents the precipitation offset values a and b are the slope and intercept of lmwl respectively s is the uncertainty of δd and δ 18o is the standard deviation 2 5 data analysis the mixsiar model is widely used to calculate the proportion of water sources used by plants ma and song 2016 wang et al 2019 the model considers the uncertainty of source value classification and prior continuous covariate information the model also integrates the latest developments within the bayesian mixing model the mixsiar model was implemented in the r software stock and semmens 2013 two parameters need to be set before running the model 1 the average and standard deviation sd of the source isotopic compositions were input into the bayesian models 2 the running length of malcalfe chain monte carlo mcmc was set to an extended value soil water in different soil layers was considered as the potential source of sbv soil water content root distribution and isotopic composition of soil water were used as the basis for the classification of potential water sources 1 the topsoil 0 20 cm was greatly affected by rainfall and evaporation and the soil water content and soil water isotopic composition changed greatly 2 the shallow soil 20 80 cm showed small changes in soil water content and soil water isotopic composition whereas there were greater changes to the distribution of roots 3 the middle soil 80 140 cm layer showed a smaller change in soil water content and soil water isotopic composition compared to that in shallow soil 4 the bottom soil 140 200 cm layer showed the least change in soil water content and the isotopic composition of soil water was relatively stable one way analysis of variance anova followed by post hoc turkey s test at p 0 05 were conducted to test for significant differences in isotope ratios of different water sources in different plants prior to analysis all variables conformed to normality assumptions and homogeneity levene s test all statistical analyses were performed using spss software version 17 0 spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 variations in soil water content soil water content was low across the entire northern sandy region and soil water content varied among the six sbv species fig 2 the rank of the sbv species in terms of the water content of the soil they were growing in was a ordosica 2 45 0 16 p sylvestris 1 75 0 27 t ramosissima 1 59 0 11 h ammodendron 0 99 0 13 c korshinshii 0 78 0 11 p euphratica 0 45 0 11 soil water contents of a ordosica p sylvestris and t ramosissima first increased and then decreases with increasing soil depth with the maximum soil contents appearing at 40 cm and 120 cm respectively the soil moisture contents for c korshinskii and p euphratica increased with increasing soil depth with a maximum value at 200 cm these different trends may be attributed to a ordosica having relatively shallow roots which easily form a water resistant layer at the soil surface ma et al 2017 thereby reducing subsoil evaporation the relatively low soil water content of c korshinshii could be attributed to the small structure its leaves the lower leaf area of this species provides less shade which increases subsoil evaporation she et al 2013 zhao et al 2019 3 2 seasonal variation in precipitation isotopes precipitation gradually decreased from a to f at the six sample points and there was a significant difference between δd and δ 18o fig 3 the d excess measure has been proposed to measure the degree to which precipitation deviates from the gmwl due to geographic location or climatic factors this measure not only reflects the degree of atmospheric influence on δd and δ 18o during precipitation condensation but also that of moisture and wind speed in the source area of water vapor benetti et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 lacelle 2011 precipitation at the six sample points during the growing season mainly occurred during july and august accounting for 31 66 of the total precipitation during the growing season the rank of the six sampling points in terms of precipitation of these two months was zgt 194 2 mm yc 124 3 mm lz 101 5 mm spt 80 5 mm aks 69 2 mm kf 49 1 mm the rank of the six sampling points in terms of d excess of precipitation of these two months was zgt 14 2 yc 12 4 aks 9 7 spt 6 2 lz 5 9 fk 3 3 this result can be attributed to the strong convergence of water vapor during summer and strong evaporation of raindrops as they fall through the atmosphere these processes result in δ 18o rich local water vapor entering the precipitation cloud cluster thereby decreasing d excess of precipitation and increasing δ 18o pan et al 2020 parkes et al 2017 samuels crow et al 2014 3 3 isotopic composition of soil water gw and xylem water as shown in fig 4 a linear relationship was established between the values of δd and δ 18o in precipitation soil water xylem water and gw samples at the six sites the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls at the six sample sites were clearly smaller than that of the gmwl and stable isotope δd δ 18o ratios of precipitation generally larger than the gmwl the results showed that the stable isotope values δd δ 18o were affected by secondary evaporation during precipitation in the sandy areas of northern china with the effect of secondary evaporation increasing with decreasing precipitation a f the isotopic values of the sites zgt yc spt and fk coincided with the lmwl indicating that precipitation in these areas may be a potential source of gw recharge the isotopic values of zgt and fk were similar to those of xylem water indicating that gw may be the main source of water for p sylvestris and h ammodendron in addition the xylem water isotopic value of site spt fell on the right side of the lmwl indicating that c korshinshii utilized soil water that was affected by evaporation and that underwent isotopic fractionation the degree to which the isotope level of soil water deviated from the lmwl gradually decreased with increasing soil depth the precipitation gradient also resulted in clear differences in the utilization of soil water of different soil layers by sbv p 0 05 from the semi humid area a to the extremely arid area f the δ 18o values of xylem water the δ 18o values of the xylem water of p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinskii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica were 8 31 5 64 5 28 7 92 8 14 and 8 72 respectively were similar to the δ 18o values of surface shallow middle and deep soil water respectively these results suggested that vegetation gradually utilized soil water from deeper layers as precipitation decreased the δ 18o values of soil water of the different sbv species decreased with increasing soil depth with the maximum value occurring in the surface soil layers fig 5 the xylem of c korshinskii showed the largest δ 18o whereas that of p euphratica was the lowest at 5 28 and 8 72 respectively among the six species of sbv gw of h ammodendron had the largest δ 18o value whereas that of p sylvestris was the lowest at 8 43 and 10 89 respectively there were dramatic changes in the soil water δ 18o values in the 0 100 cm soil layer of p sylvestris a ordosica and h ammodendron ranging from 2 16 to 10 41 there were dramatic changes in the δ 18o values of soil water of the 0 140 cm soil layer for c korshinskii and t ramosissima ranging from 2 96 to 9 21 there were dramatic changes in soil water δ 18o across the entire 0 200 cm soil layer for p euphratica these results indicated that the soil layers experienced strong evaporation the δ 18o values of soil water in the 100 200 cm soil layer for the six sbv species were close to that of gw with the corresponding soil layer of p sylvestris and a ordosica being 100 cm that of c korshinshii and t ramosissima being 140 cm that of h ammodendron being 180 cm and that of p euphratica being 200 cm these results indicate that soil water may be replenished by gw in addition the δ 18o values of soil water in the 40 160 cm soil layer for the six sbv species were close to the δ 18o values of xylem water with the soil layers of p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica being 100 cm 40 60 cm 40 cm 80 100 cm 100 140 cm and 120 160 cm respectively these results suggest that soil water may be a potential source of water for the sbv species the table 2 show that the pos values of xylem water soil water and ground water are both negative and the pos of xylem water and soil water are significantly different from those of ground water p 0 01 this result indicates that plant water and ground water are supplied from different soil water pools and the ecohydrological separation occurs in the process of water source supply hence there are two non uniform and incomplete mixed water sources in the soil of the sandy region of northern china which maintain the water requirement and evapotranspiration of sbv respectively 3 4 quantitative analysis of water sources of sand binding vegetation the mixsiar model was used to estimate the relative contributions of the potential water sources to the six sbv species fig 6 among the six sbv species t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used gw at rates of 46 54 and 62 respectively whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water at rates of 65 81 and 54 respectively p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest precipitation utilization rates among the of six sbv species at 14 respectively whereas p euphratica showed the lowest at 2 however p euphratica showed the highest gw utilization rate at 62 a ordosica showed the lowest precipitation and gw utilization rates at 9 and 10 respectively whereas this species had the highest soil water utilization rate at 81 the highest soil water use efficiencies of the six sbv species gradually shifted from shallow soil layers to deep layers with decreasing precipitation a f p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water whereas c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used deep soil water 4 discussion 4 1 utilization strategies of sand binding vegetation for different water sources plants tend to place more dependence on stable water sources in arid regions the utilization of stable deep soil water and gw increases the resilience of plants and ensures their survival in water deficient environments dai et al 2015 plants adopt different water use strategies since the degree of water stress experienced by plants differs among the different seasons payero et al 2009 rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 mccole and stern 2007 examined the water use patterns of juniperus ashei in the edwards plateau over different seasons and determined that vegetation depended most on gw during the summer whereas soil water below 10 cm was mainly used during winter in the present study the six sbv species utilized precipitation most during spring followed by autumn and summer table 3 which is consistent with the research results of xu et al 2018 however this result could not be attributed to total precipitation in spring and autumn exceeding that in summer but rather to the fact that evaporation over spring and autumn in sandy regions in northern china is weaker than that in summer and so the effective precipitation available to vegetation increases over spring and autumn gw is the main source of water for sbv li et al 2017 walton et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 accounting for 32 74 of all water sources of sbv li et al 2017 the gw utilization rates of all sbv species examined in the present study exceeded 46 2 sbv have a higher dependence on gw in areas with low precipitation arndt et al 2004 elmore et al 2006 zheng et al 2012 in the present study the gw utilization rates of t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica in arid and extremely arid regions all exceeded 53 2 among the different seasons p sylvestris showed a higher gw utilization rate exceeding 52 4 due to its deep root system which allowed better use of gw in an arid environment song et al 2020 zeng et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 although the precipitation gradient was the main factor driving the water utilization strategies of the sbv species examined xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 there were significant differences among different plant function types bao et al 2020 liu et al 2017 since shrubs generally have shallower root depths compared to that of trees leung et al 2015 the gw utilization rates of shrubs in the natural environment are below those of trees in the present study the gw utilization rate of trees exceeded that of shrubs at 65 74 and 47 29 respectively fig 7 the soil water utilization rates of trees and shrubs also differed among the different soil layers since the roots of shrubs tend to be shallow and mainly distributed in surface and shallow soil their soil water utilization rates in surface and shallow soil tend to exceed those of trees whereas their deep soil water utilization rates tend to be lower than those of trees pan et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 however the deep soil utilization rates of shrubs exceeded those of trees in the present study at 11 45 and 9 45 respectively this can be mainly attributed to a shallower overall distribution of shrub roots since the roots in the surface soil remain dormant under dry climate conditions shrubs are forced to rely on deep roots for absorption of soil water kulmatiski et al 2020 xu and li 2006 shrubs tend to increase their use of shallow soil water as precipitation increases and surface dormant roots are activated dai et al 2015 geißler et al 2019 luo et al 2019 however huang and zhang 2015 showed that c korshinshii in shapotou with a forest age of more than 30 years mainly used soil water from a depth of 60 150 cm the c korshinshii examined in the present study were 3 yr in age and had shallow root distributions indicating that root distribution was an important factor influencing the water use strategies of sbv this result further indicates that there are some limitations associated with determining the water sources of plants through the examination of root structure fitter 1987 nagel et al 2009 thorburn and ehleringer 1995 and the distribution of plant roots is not necessarily an indication of where water is absorbed 4 2 effects of climate change on plant water sources water sources differ among different functional plants pan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 precipitation is the main factor limiting the growth and development of sbv in arid and semi arid regions harkes et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 lai et al 2019 the difference in precipitation available to p euphratica in the extreme arid region compared to that available to p sylvestris in the sub humid region resulted in different sbv landscapes ranging from sparse woodland to dense woodland fig 8 the rate at which vegetation utilize precipitation is influenced by the amount of available precipitation and physiological properties of vegetation poorter et al 2019 sankaran and staver 2019 the results of the present study showed that although a ordosica is located in semi arid areas annual precipitation is relatively high however since the root distribution of a ordosica is relatively shallow a large amount of available water is lost through the high transpiration rates of surface soil and leaves resulting in the low utilization rates of precipitation and shallow soil water but higher utilization rates of deeper soil water 20 200 cm of a ordosica therefore p sylvestris and c korshinshii showed the highest precipitation utilization rates 14 in the present study the depth of plant roots determines the degree to which soil water from different soil layers is absorbed and utilized chen et al 2018 schwinning et al 2020 wang et al 2017 plant responses to surface soil water sometimes require sufficient amounts of precipitation for the activation of surface roots bowles et al 2018 gan et al 2013 nie et al 2011 therefore precipitation exceeding a certain threshold is required for the activation of sbv root systems for absorbing surface soil water in arid or semi arid regions soylu et al 2014 wang et al 2007a which is consistent with the results of the present study however the present study also found that the sbv precipitation utilization rate of surface soil water also decreased 20 2 with decreasing precipitation there are also differences in gw utilization rates among different sbv species due to differences in root depth nagel et al 2009 schwinning et al 2020 the results of the present study showed that although p sylvestris is located in a sub humid area since the root system of this species was able to extend to the gw level p sylvestris had a higher gw utilization rate compared to that of a ordosica water is the most important factor limiting ecosystem processes and functions in arid and semi arid regions li et al 2017 within the context of global climate change changes in precipitation patterns will have an important influence on water sources water utilization strategies and vegetation distributions of individual plant species pan et al 2020 wang et al 2007b xu et al 2011 the fifth ipcc assessment report ar5 found that the global average surface temperature increased by 0 85 c between 1880 and 2012 ipcc 2013 rising at a rate of 0 12 c yr 1 from 1951 to 2012 stocker and plattner 2014 other studies have shown that the arid region of northwest china is currently undergoing a warm wet phase which will continue in the future geng et al 2014 chen et al 2019 found that future increased precipitation in the arid areas of northwest china will mainly be distributed in desert areas huang et al 2017 determined that the most significant changes to precipitation will be in arid and extreme arid regions whereas changes to precipitation in the sub humid regions will not change significantly it has also been demonstrated that the warming of the arid region in northwest china will increase surface evapotranspiration li et al 2014 ma et al 2018 with the most significant change in the drought region wang et al 2015 it is predicted that the sandy region of northern china will experience increases in both future evapotranspiration and precipitation ma et al 2018 brooks et al 2010 used the isotope method to study the water flow process in a watershed in the united states their study found that soil water can be divided into soil mobile water and soil bound water with plants preferring to use the latter this not only satisfies the tww hypothesis but also indicates that plants utilize different sources of water to different degrees excessive evapotranspiration will increase the degree of aridity elguindi et al 2014 huang et al 2016 forcing vegetation to use more soil bound water sprenger et al 2016 this strategy is only sustainable in the long term when there is sufficient rainfall to replenish bound water in the soil cheng et al 2006 williams and ehleringer 2000 therefore gw may be used to a greater degree by sbv in northern china in the future among the sbv species in arid areas the shrub t ramosissima utilizes gw to a lower degree as compared to the tree h ammodendron with the physiological attributes of the former characterized by leaves which experience high transpiration and relatively shallow roots therefore the vulnerability of t ramosissima to changes in climate should be emphasized when assessing the stability of sbv to the future climate change in northern china 4 3 limitations and prospects the present study used the mixsiar model to evaluated the water use strategies of sbv in the sandy areas of northern china although existing studies have shown the simulation accuracy of the mixsiar model to exceed that of the iso source and mixsir models in arid areas wang et al 2019 there have been few comparative studies among different sbv models in addition the present study divided sbv into trees and shrubs with the results evaluated based on the fact that the root length of trees exceeds that of shrubs of the same stand age leung et al 2015 although the present study obtained good research results subsequent studies should measure the specific root length of sbv and systematically quantify the influence of root length on the water use strategy of sbv meanwhile the sampling period of this study was the 2016 growing season and there was a lack of comparative studies on long time series 2 years growing seasons we will follow up this experiment in subsequent studies so as to explore the water use strategy of sbv in a more comprehensive way 5 conclusions the present study used the stable isotope δd δ 18o method to study the water sources and utilization rates of six typical sbv species p sylvestris a ordosica c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica across a precipitation gradient in the sandy region of northern china the lmwl of each of the six sbv species fell to the right of the gmwl demonstrating that the stable isotope values δd δ 18o during precipitation processes in the sandy regions of northern china are strongly affected by secondary evaporation with the effect increasing with decreasing precipitation p sylvestris and t ramosissima showed the highest precipitation utilization rate whereas p euphratica showed the lowest at 14 and 2 respectively t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used gw at rates of 46 54 and 62 respectively whereas p sylvestris a ordosica and c korshinshii mainly used soil water at rates of 65 81 and 54 respectively the highest soil water use efficiencies of sbvs across the different soil layers gradually shifted from shallow layers to deep layers as precipitation decreased from the semi humid region to the extremely arid region p sylvestris and a ordosica mainly used shallow soil water whereas c korshinshii t ramosissima h ammodendron and p euphratica mainly used deep soil water within the context of global climate change although it is predicted that temperature and precipitation will increase in the sandy regions of northern china evapotranspiration will also increase particularly in arid areas therefore increased focus should be placed on sbv in arid areas when assessing the impact of future climate change on the stability of sbv in northern china in particular on t ramosissima which was found to be less resilient to changes in climate it is suggested that a long term comprehensive sbv monitoring system be established in arid areas to prevent the overexploitation of gw and effectively guarantee the survival of sbv in arid areas credit authorship contribution statement xiaofei ma conceptualization methodology software data curation writing

4377,streamflow and sediment load exporting from catchments usually show high inter variability caused by climate variability and land surface changes it is challenge to predict monthly or daily streamflow and sediment load using simply statistical methods the state space model is an effective tool for quantifying localized variations and it only needs some easily obtained climate and land surface variables however there is no state space model developed to predict the long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration in this study fourteen main catchments in the loess plateau of china were chosen and these catchments experienced abrupt reductions of annual streamflow q specific sediment yield ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc during the past five decades the state space model was developed to predict monthly q ssy and ssc during 1982 2011 by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index the results indicated that the monthly q ssy and ssc in summer season decreased significantly in nearly all the catchments p 0 01 the periodicity of monthly q ssy and ssc reduced and especially the periodicity was not detected after 2003 the precipitation and previous q were the two main state variables to estimate monthly q with transition coefficients of 0 56 and 0 25 respectively whereas q and previous ssc were the most important state variables to estimate monthly ssy and ssc with transition coefficients of 0 50 and 0 34 respectively the state space model was satisfactory to simulate monthly q ssy and ssc with nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse over 0 85 in model calibration and validation furthermore the model performance was best for predicting monthly q followed by predicting monthly ssy and ssc with the average nse of 0 90 0 89 and 0 87 respectively the reductions of monthly streamflow and sediment load were mainly derived by soil and water conservation measures swcms and especially check dams the catchment runoff and sediment coefficient decreased significantly and linearly with the percentages of area affected by swcms p 0 01 this study indicates that the state space model is a useful tool to predict streamflow and sediment load time series with the hydrological and land surface informations keywords streamflow and sediment load monthly scale temporal variability state space prediction 1 introduction considerable alterations of catchment hydrological regimes have occurred globally in recent decades due to the accumulated consequences of climate change and diverse human activities syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 li et al 2020 streamflow and sediment load were important variables to indicate the erosion and transport of materials within catchments which had great environmental and societal consequences rustomji et al 2008 warrick et al 2013 golosov and walling 2019 detecting the temporal spatial variabilities of streamflow and sediment load understanding the dominant mechanisms behind such changes and accurate estimation of streamflow and sediment load are crucial to develop sustainable ecosystem and water resources management strategies in river basins wang et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 the sediment load in rivers is determined by sources transport and storage of sediment within the catchment vercruysse et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 the variations of streamflow and sediment load are caused by multiple catchment factors including climate soil topography land cover and human disturbances syvitski et al 2005 hansford et al 2020 most of previous studies usually focused on changes of annual streamflow and sediment load which may mask the seasonal variations however as the high variability and interaction of various catchment scale drivers the streamflow and sediment load represented highly inter seasonal variations vercruysse et al 2017 better understanding and accurate estimation of streamflow and sediment load on relatively fine temporal scale i e monthly and daily is critical to effectively regulate river flows and control soil loss in catchments there are various methods to estimate streamflow and sediment load including empirically statistical methods sediment rating curve and distributed hydrological models de vente et al 2013 li et al 2017a fu et al 2019 empirically statistical methods establish the relationships between climatic factors and streamflow or sediment load using long term historical data li et al 2017a the sediment rating curve i e describing flow sediment relationships by regression analysis is a widely used tool to estimate the sediment load as a function of stream discharge warrick 2015 ahn et al 2017 however the flow sediment relationships were usually non linear and depended on temporal scales vercruysse et al 2017 but with the sediment rating curve it is difficult to capture these characteristics li et al 2017b distributed hydrological models have complicated physical mechanisms and they are efficient to estimate streamflow and sediment load at different time scales fu et al 2019 however distributed hydrological models need a large amount of input datasets and parameters and they are time consuming it is thus of paramount importance to predict monthly or daily streamflow and sediment load using simply statistical methods with some easily obtained climate and land surface variables the state space model was developed to quantify localized variations wendroth et al 2003 nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 it can effectively consider the temporal and spatial dependences inherent in observations and it can identify the temporal and spatial relationships between dependent and independent variables wendroth et al 2003 nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 the state space model has been widely used to estimate vegetation yield wendroth et al 2003 timm et al 2003 and soil physical and chemical properties yang and wendroth 2014 awe et al 2015 recently the state space model was applied in hydrological prediction li et al 2017b used the state space model to simulate spring discharge using precipitation relative humidity water temperature and electrical conductivity in a karst catchment area guzhou catchment in southwest china from may to november 2015 li et al 2017c applied the state space model to simulate monthly sediment discharge using precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index during 2003 2015 in a typical karst catchment yujiang catchment in southwest china these studies only simulated variations of one certain hydrological variable in a relative short period the simulation in short years is suitable for the situation in which the hydrological variables did not exhibit abrupt change such as in li et al 2017b and li et al 2017c however if the hydrological variables exhibited abrupt changes at longer data series and their changes are different long term simulations of all hydrological variables are essential to our knowledge there is no state space model developed to predict the long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration this work is especially critical for the regions experiencing distinct hydrological changes induced by land use cover changes lucc and climate change e g the loess plateau in china which is the motivation for the work presented in this paper the loess plateau contributed nearly 90 of sediment load in the yellow river wang et al 2016 the severe soil erosion in the loess plateau was caused by highly erodible loessial soil frequent high intensity rainstorms steep topography low vegetation cover and long term intensive cultivation rustomji et al 2008 with the aim of controlling soil erosion in the loess plateau several soil and water conservation measures swcms and ecological restoration campaigns i e afforestation pasture planting construction of terrace and check dam have been implemented since the 1950s fu et al 2017 meanwhile the loess plateau region has been experiencing both warming and drying trends since the 1950s fu et al 2017 the extensive lucc have dramatically altered the hydrological regimes in the loess plateau with the combination of climate change it was observed that the streamflow and sediment load in the loess plateau have exhibited a considerable decreasing trend zhao et al 2017 which resulted in approximately 70 decrease of sediment load in the yellow river over the past six decades wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 indicated that annual streamflow in 44 sub catchments decreased significantly 0 1 2 6 mm yr 1 and annual sediment load in 52 sub catchments reduced with rates between 2 86 and 636 t km 2 yr 1 during 1957 2012 derived from 58 hydrological stations over the loess plateau zheng et al 2019 found that the mean annual streamflow and sediment load reduced by 22 and 74 during 2008 2016 respectively in comparison with the period of 1971 1987 at 122 hydrological stations across the loess plateau generally most of previous studies in the loess plateau usually investigated the changes of annual streamflow and sediment load while some studies have examined the changes on flood season scale gao et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 in reality most of the annual streamflow and sediment load approximately 45 and 88 respectively in the loess plateau is produced during few some months in the flood season gao et al 2016 therefore it is essential to characterize the variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load as well as suspended sediment concentration and accurately estimate them in the loess plateau over the last decades gao et al 2016 analyzed the multi temporal scale changes of streamflow and sediment load in the yanhe catchment during 1952 2011 however the model simulation was not conducted by gao et al 2016 and the study only was limited to one catchment some studies have used the empirically statistical methods li et al 2017a and physically based hydrological models such as watem sedem li et al 2018 to simulate annual streamflow and sediment load in the catchments of the loess plateau it is challenge to develop the state space models to predict the variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration over the past decades in the loess plateau furthermore previous studies usually obtained the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow and sediment load changes but the detailed effects of lucc need to be quantified in this study the changes of monthly streamflow q specific sediment yield ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc in fourteen main catchments of the loess plateau during 1961 2011 were detected and estimated the objectives are 1 to characterize the variations of monthly q and ssy and ssc 2 to develop state space models to predict monthly q ssy and ssc and 3 to investigate the effects of lucc on changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load 2 study area and database 2 1 study area the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region with an area of 12 97 104 km2 is located in the middle of loess plateau and it is the main sediment producing area of the loess plateau fig 1 the cshc region accounts for 14 8 of the entire yellow river basin fig 1 and it supplies over 70 of sediment load in the yellow river especially coarse sand rustomji et al 2008 the cshc region is characterized by arid to semi arid climate conditions from northwest to southeast the average annual precipitation of the cshc region varied from 300 mm in the northwest to 580 mm in the southeast during 1961 2011 gao et al 2017 the average annual temperature ranges from 6 to 14 c and the average potential evapotranspiration is 1500 to 2000 mm during 1961 2011 which is approximately 3 to 7 times that of the precipitation the precipitation during the flood season with the form of high intensity rainstorms accounts for 72 of the annual total fourteen main catchments in the cshc region were selected as they have available long term observed hydrological data and they have typical land cover landform and hydrological characteristics of the cshc region fig 1 the selected catchments account for 57 4 of the cshc region and they produce about 69 and 71 of total streamflow and sediment load in the cshc region during 1961 2011 respectively table 1 shows the characteristics of the fourteen catchments 2 2 database datasets of monthly streamflow and sediment load of each catchment during 1961 2011 were collected from yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china monthly q ssy and ssc were calculated by these datasets daily precipitation data and meteorological variables including air temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity during 1961 2011 at 66 meteorological stations in and around the cshc region were provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc the potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using the penman method the precipitation p and pet data were spatially averaged based on the co kriging interpolation algorithm philippe 2017 the land use at 1975 1990 2000 and 2010 was determined with landsat multispectral scanner mss and thematic mapper tm remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 30 m the overall accuracy of land use data reached 86 land use was divided into six types including forestland cropland grassland construction land water body and barren land the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset from january 1982 to december 2011were derived from the global inventory monitoring and modeling system gimms3g with 15 day intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 083 the gimms3g dataset was corrected by the modis dataset to improve the accuracy and reliability kong et al 2018 the areas treated by various swcms in the cshc region during the 1960s 2000s were provided by yrcc the effects of check dams were expressed by the area of land created above them and the storage capacity the total storage capacities of large to medium check dams 1 0 104 m3 in the cshc region during 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s were provided by yrcc 3 methodology the trends of annual seasonal and monthly q ssy and ssc were determined by the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendall test bs mk test the periodicity in monthly q ssy and ssc were detected by the continuous wavelet transform cwt analysis based on the morlet functional the state space model was developed to simulate monthly q ssy and ssc by their main influencing factors p pet and ndvi the p and pet are the most important climate variables affecting catchment hydrological processes the vegetation cover has considerable influence on runoff and soil erosion and it is highly correlated with streamflow and sediment load the ndvi is a good indicator of vegetation cover and the easily obtained long series of monthly ndvi data can be used to estimate variabilities of streamflow and sediment load thus the p pet and ndvi were expected to estimate monthly streamflow and sediment load by state space model 3 1 bs mk trend test the bs mk test was proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 to assess the trends of hydrological and meteorological time series it was improved by yue and pilon 2004 to eliminate data correlation a z statistic was obtained from the bs mk test and a negative value of z indicates a downward trend and vice versa the slope of the trend β was estimated by the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 3 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 η in cwt is defined as 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where η is the non dimensional time parameter ω

and validation period 2000 2011 the number of calibrating dataset is 216 for each catchment which is sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the established model the performance of the state space

reached the maximum in july or august fig 2 the p and pet during the summer season accounted for 57 53 and 40 26 of the annual total respectively fig s1 shows the changes of the seasonal and annual p

change occurred during 1975 2010 the cropland area decreased by 26 72 and forestland area increased by 53 15 and the grassland area increased by 4 21 from 1975 to 2010 fig s2 the ndvi during the summer season 0 45 was significantly higher than the annual mean value 0 28 fig 2 the ndvi in the study area increased significantly from 1982 to 2011 on annual spring summer and autumn scales p 0 000

the 1960s to 28 61 in the 2000s fig s4 approximate 1209 check dams were constructed by the 1970s and the number increased to 3846 by the 2000s in the cshc region the sediment storage capacity behind the check dams was estimated to be 230 108 510 108 650 108 and 700 108 m3 in the 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s respectively fig s5 4 2 changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load fig 2 shows the average monthly q ssy and ssc during 1961 2011 for the fourteen catchments the q ssy and ssc all concentrated in the summer season and the maximum monthly value occurred in july or august the q and ssy during the summer season accounted for 49 87 and 91 79 of the annual total respectively the average ssc during summer season 243 09 kg m 3 was approximately two times of the mean annual value 140 89 kg m 3 the above results infer that annual runoff and soil loss is governed by the summer season which highlights the necessity of investigating streamflow and sediment load on monthly scale table 2 shows the trends of the seasonal and annual q ssy and ssc during 1961 2011 the annual q ssy and ssc decreased significantly in all catchments at 0 01 significance level except for the annual q in the qingjian catchment and annual ssc in the huangfu catchment at 0 05 level the mean decreasing rates of annual q ssy and ssc were 0 88 mm yr 1 0 24 to 1 63 mm yr 1 196 31 t km 2 yr 1 35 46 to 419 60 t km 2 yr 1 and 2 85 kg m 3 yr 1 0 98 to 4 86 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively the summer q ssy and ssc decreased significantly in all catchments p 0 01 except for the qingjian catchment at 0 05 level with the mean rates of 0 45 mm yr 1 0 11 to 0 89 mm yr 1 176 43 t km 2 yr 1 30 93 to 384 52 t km 2 yr 1 and 5 32 kg m 3 yr 1 2 89 to 7 55 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively the q ssy and ssc in spring and autumn seasons also showed significantly decreasing trends for almost all the catchments p 0 05 but the winter q ssy and ssc did not show significantly decreasing trends in three four and five catchments respectively p 0 05 the q ssy and ssc in june july and august decreased significantly in almost all the catchments p 0 01 4 3 continuous wavelet analysis of monthly streamflow and sediment load from the wavelet power spectrum analysis the monthly ssy in the studied catchments showed significantly periodic oscillations on 6 month and 12 month scales p 0 05 and the 12 month period was the most important one from 1978 to 1986 and after 2003 periodicity was not detected in all catchments fig 3 a shows the wavelet power spectrum analysis of monthly ssy in the yanhe catchment significant 6 month discontinuous cyclicities in the monthly ssy were detected during 1963 1979 and 1987 2002 and significant 12 month periodic oscillation was found during 1962 1971 1976 1979 1987 1989 and 1991 1996 periodicity was not detected from 1980 to 1986 and after 2003 in the yanhe catchment the periodic characteristics of monthly q were somewhat in accordance with those of monthly ssy there were significant 6 month oscillations for q in yanhe catchment during 1963 1979 and 1987 2002 and significant 12 month periodic oscillations during 1962 1971 1976 1979 1987 1989 and 1991 1996 fig 3b similar to monthly ssy monthly ssc in the studied catchments showed significant power in the wavelet power spectrum at 2 month and 12 month periods but the periodic continuity of ssc is better than that of ssy fig 3c shows the periods of monthly ssc in the yanhe catchment the 95 confidence intervals are continuously distributed in 6 month and 12 month band during 1961 1980 1982 1997 and 2001 2002 4 4 simulations of monthly streamflow and sediment load by state space model the acf results showed that the significant autocorrelation range for monthly q ssy ssc p pet and ndvi were all at least one lags in the fourteen catchments for example the monthly q ssy ssc p pet and ndvi in the yanhe catchment had significant autocorrelation range of 1 2 1 2 2 and 2 lags respectively fig 4 the ccf results showed that the monthly q was significantly cross correlated with p pet and ndvi and both ssy and ssc were significantly cross correlated with q p and ndvi with at least one lag in the studied catchments for example in the yanhe catchment the monthly q was significantly cross correlated with p pet and ndvi in 2 3 and 2 lags respectively fig 5 the monthly ssy was significantly cross correlated with q p and ndvi in 1 1 and 2 lags respectively and the corresponding lags for monthly ssc were 2 2 and 2 respectively fig 5 the acf and ccf results indicated that the state space model had potential to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc with the selected variables i e p pet q and ndvi table 3 shows the transition coefficients and performances of the state space model to estimate monthly q using the three influencing factors p pet and ndvi the mean aic nse and rmse values during the calibration period were 6 68 8 38 to 5 35 0 97 0 93 0 99 and 0 04 0 02 0 07 respectively during the validation period the mean aic nse and rmse values were 5 21 6 43 to 4 27 0 90 0 78 0 97 and 0 08 0 04 0 12 respectively there were eight catchments having nse values 0 90 four catchments having nse values between 0 80 and 0 90 and two catchments having nse values between 0 75 and 0 80 during the validation period the average transition coefficients of q p pet and ndvi at time i 1 to estimate q at time i were 0 25 0 12 0 66 0 56 0 18 0 73 0 21 0 11 0 35 and 0 11 0 01 0 18 respectively this result implied that precipitation was the most important factor to estimate streamflow compared to monthly q the state space models had higher mean aic value lower nse value and higher rmse value to estimate monthly ssy with 6 19 0 94 and 0 05 during calibration period and 5 12 0 89 and 0 08 during validation period respectively table 4 this result indicated that accuracy of estimating monthly ssy was lower than that of monthly q the average transition coefficients of ssy q p and ndvi at time i 1 to estimate ssy at time i were 0 15 0 001 0 41 0 50 0 08 0 76 0 23 0 11 0 47 and 0 18 0 002 0 32 respectively the streamflow had the most substantial influence on specific sediment yield the mean aic nse and rmse values of the state space model to estimate monthly ssc were 5 66 0 91 and 0 07 during the calibration period respectively and they were 4 81 0 87 and 0 09 during the validation period respectively table 5 therefore the accuracy of the state space model to estimate monthly ssc was lower than that to estimate monthly q and ssy furthermore the average transition coefficients of ssc q p and ndvi at time i 1were 0 34 0 07 0 63 0 27 0 003 0 70 0 14 0 03 0 24 and 0 20 0 07 0 36 respectively therefore the relative contribution of the previous ssc was much greater than q p and ndvi to estimate ssc at time i the observed and estimated monthly q ssy and ssc during the calibration and validation periods in the yanhe catchment are shown in fig 6 the estimated monthly q ssy and ssc generally matched the observed values well the state space model had good performance to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc by p q and ndvi however the estimated value was somewhat lower than the observed value especially on the months with high values which indicated that the state space model underestimated the streamflow and sediment load to some degree fig 6 we also used the linear regression equation and sediment rating curve to estimate monthly sediment load for comparison tables s1 and s2 figs s6 and s7 same to the simulation procedure of the state space model the linear regression equation between monthly ssy and p ssy ap b and sediment rating curve ssy αqβ 1 was established in calibration period 1982 1999 and they were used to predict monthly sediment load in validation period 2000 2011 the mean nse value of the linear regression equation to estimate monthly ssc was only 0 47 during the calibration period and it was even negative 7 60 during the validation period table s1 the simulation results of linear regression equation had huge estimation error and it was not applicable in predicting sediment load fig s6 the performance of sediment rating curve was acceptable with mean nse value of 0 85 during calibration period and 0 55 during validation period table s2 however compared to the state space model the sediment rating curve had lower nse value and much higher aic value and it considerably overestimated the sediment load on the months with low values fig s7 5 discussion 5 1 effects of land use cover changes on variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load this study indicated that the annual summer spring and autumn streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration all decreased significantly in almost all the catchments during 1961 2011 the periodicity of monthly streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration reduced and especially the periodicity was not detected after 2003 the changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were not significant in the study area and their effects were limited wang et al 2016 fu et al 2017 the changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load were mainly caused by land use cover change improvement of vegetation cover and constructions of engineering measures induced by swcms and ecological restoration campaigns rustomji et al 2008 gao et al 2017 the swcms greatly decreased the production ability of runoff and sediment load by precipitation and retained streamflow and sediment load within the catchment puigdefábregas 2005 dey and mishra 2017 the biological swcms i e afforestation and grass planting can increase rainfall interception and evapotranspiration by the vegetation canopy reduce wash durability and surface runoff by the litter layer fixate soil by the root system and ameliorate soil physical chemical properties to increase anti erodibility vannoppen et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2016 the above effects operate together to enhance infiltration and ultimately reduce runoff amount which subsequently decrease soil erosion and sediment transport kervroedan et al 2020 improvement of vegetation cover was considered one of the most effective measures to control soil erosion farley et al 2005 gao et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 found that both the runoff coefficient and sediment concentration decreased significantly and linearly with the vegetation coverage in catchments of the loess plateau some studies found that vegetation restoration measure has played a key role in reducing surface runoff and controlling soil erosion in the loess plateau during recent years wang et al 2016 the engineering swcms had immediate and substantial effects on reducing streamflow by reducing flood peaks and storing water within check dams and reservoirs guyassa et al 2017 the check dam can effectively mitigate sedimentation as sediment could be fully deposited before the dam quiñonero rubio et al 2016 it was reported that check dams retained sediment with rate of approximately 5 15 13 08 104 t hm 2 in the loess plateau gao et al 2016 and terraces maintained runoff and sediment with ratios of 3 8 m3 km 2 and 0 8 t km 2 respectively miao et al 2011 the construction of check dams and terraces has progressed rapidly since the 1970s in the study area zhao et al 2017 the engineering measures consequently decrease both the magnitude and variability of streamflow and sediment load mekonnen et al 2015 the engineering measures utilized much smaller area compared to the vegetation restoration measures but the engineering measures substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load quiñonero rubio et al 2016 the engineering and vegetation restoration measures played different roles in reducing streamflow and sediment load the check dams mainly regulated the flow sediment relationship whereas reforestation primarily resulted in streamflow moderation zhang et al 2019 in order to quantify the effects of swcms on streamflow and sediment load reductions the relationships between the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient with the percentage of area treated by swcms in the study area were analyzed respectively the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient was defined as the average ratio of q and ssy over precipitation in the five decades 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s respectively thus eliminating the effect of precipitation and enabling a direct focus on land surface condition controls it was found that both the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient decreased significantly and linearly with the percentage of area treated by swcms in fig 7 p 0 05 indicating the heavily dependence of streamflow and sediment load production ability on the area under swcms treatment furthermore the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient also had linear correlations with the check dam storage fig 8 the check dam had the critical effect on streamflow and sediment load reduction among the swcms it also can be found that the effects of swcms and check dam on sediment load reduction were stronger than those on streamflow reduction as indicated by the regression coefficients in figs 7 and 8 it should be noted that the locality of swcms also has considerable effects on streamflow and sediment load and the quantitative effects of different swcms on changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load are complex due to the nonlinear processes these issues need further study with detailed spatial distribution data of swcms in the catchment 5 2 applicability of state space model to predict monthly streamflow and sediment load the simulation results indicated that the state space model was satisfactory to predict long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration in the studied catchments the state space model is practical as it only needs several commonly available climate and land surface indicators i e precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index whereas the distributed hydrological models need a large amount of input datasets and parameters for the longer time data series furthermore the prediction results of state space model far outperformed the classical regression and sediment rating curve methods in this study additionally the temporal variations in streamflow and sediment load are considerably influenced by watershed characteristics such as geology geomorphology landscapes and soil properties vercruysse et al 2017 a factor that played a critical role in one watershed might not be important at other watersheds consequently we have expanded the state space model to longer time data series and more watersheds in order to better establish this methodology thus the developed state space model was a useful tool for predicting streamflow and sediment load in the loess plateau the performance of state space model for simulating streamflow was best followed by simulating sediment yield and sediment concentration furthermore the relative contribution of precipitation and previous streamflow in simulating monthly streamflow was greater than those of potential evapotranspiration and normalized differential vegetation index streamflow and previous sediment concentration were the most important state variables to estimate monthly sediment yield and sediment concentration respectively precipitation is the direct driving force of producing runoff and the precipitation and streamflow usually have good relationship under little land surface change but the relationship is variable if there is extensive land cover change gao et al 2017 hansford et al 2020 the sediment load is mainly controlled by sediment production ability of runoff and the sediment load is typically strongly correlated with stream discharge vercruysse et al 2017 the sediment concentration is determined by the flow sediment relationship which is usually complex and nonlinear zhang et al 2019 therefore it is usually difficult to adequately simulate sediment concentration good performance of the state space model is attributed to that it considers the magnitude of a variable at a given time in comparison with its respective value at a previous or future time timm et al 2003 wendroth et al 2003 the state space model employs the relationships between neighboring observations whereas the classical statistical method assumes that observations are distributed randomly nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 in addition the autoregressive nature of state space model can take into account uncertainty that usually drive a stochastic updating and filtering step li et al 2017b 2017c therefore the state space model can be considered as an effective tool to describe the temporal variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load there are several issues that still require further investigation for the state space model to predict streamflow and sediment load first the applicability of the state space model to estimate monthly streamflow and sediment load needs further test in more catchments with different climatic land use cover soil properties and topography conditions the state space model should be extended to estimate streamflow and sediment load on more fine scale i e daily or even storm based second the interaction effect between the model variables may reduce the performance of the state space model such as the underestimation of monthly streamflow and sediment load in this study accounting for this interaction effect in the state space model would greatly improve the predictability of streamflow and sediment load third besides vegetation cover factors i e ndvi considered in this study more land surface conditions such as the effects of engineering measures should be incorporated in the state space model the temporal variations of model parameters should be considered especially for the situation with distinct land use cover change finally the geographically spatial regression model with detailed distribution information of land surface condition is also an effective tool to estimate hydrological responses more studies are needed to compare the performances of different types of model 6 conclusions this study detected the changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load during 1961 2011 in fourteen main catchments of the loess plateau and developed state space model to estimate the long term variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load the annual streamflow and sediment load concentrated in the summer season which showed significant decreases of monthly q ssy and ssc and the changing periodicity also reduced greatly in the state space model precipitation q and previous ssc were the main state variables to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc respectively the state space model well predicted the temporal variations of monthly q ssy and ssc with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency over 0 85 the state space model is a useful tool for predicting streamflow and sediment load time series credit authorship contribution statement guangyao

4377,streamflow and sediment load exporting from catchments usually show high inter variability caused by climate variability and land surface changes it is challenge to predict monthly or daily streamflow and sediment load using simply statistical methods the state space model is an effective tool for quantifying localized variations and it only needs some easily obtained climate and land surface variables however there is no state space model developed to predict the long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration in this study fourteen main catchments in the loess plateau of china were chosen and these catchments experienced abrupt reductions of annual streamflow q specific sediment yield ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc during the past five decades the state space model was developed to predict monthly q ssy and ssc during 1982 2011 by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index the results indicated that the monthly q ssy and ssc in summer season decreased significantly in nearly all the catchments p 0 01 the periodicity of monthly q ssy and ssc reduced and especially the periodicity was not detected after 2003 the precipitation and previous q were the two main state variables to estimate monthly q with transition coefficients of 0 56 and 0 25 respectively whereas q and previous ssc were the most important state variables to estimate monthly ssy and ssc with transition coefficients of 0 50 and 0 34 respectively the state space model was satisfactory to simulate monthly q ssy and ssc with nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse over 0 85 in model calibration and validation furthermore the model performance was best for predicting monthly q followed by predicting monthly ssy and ssc with the average nse of 0 90 0 89 and 0 87 respectively the reductions of monthly streamflow and sediment load were mainly derived by soil and water conservation measures swcms and

state space prediction 1 introduction considerable alterations of catchment hydrological regimes have occurred globally in recent decades due to the accumulated consequences of climate change and diverse human activities syvitski et al 2005 cohen et al 2014 li et al 2020 streamflow and sediment load were important variables to indicate the erosion and transport of materials within catchments which had great environmental and societal consequences rustomji et al 2008 warrick et al 2013 golosov and walling 2019 detecting the temporal spatial variabilities of streamflow and sediment load understanding the dominant mechanisms behind such changes and accurate estimation of streamflow and sediment load are crucial to develop sustainable ecosystem and water resources management strategies in river basins wang et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 the sediment load in rivers is determined by sources transport and storage of sediment within the catchment vercruysse et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 the variations of streamflow and sediment load are caused by multiple catchment factors including climate soil topography land cover and human disturbances syvitski et al 2005 hansford et al 2020 most of previous studies usually focused on changes of annual streamflow and sediment load which may mask the seasonal variations however as the high variability and interaction of various catchment scale drivers the streamflow and sediment load represented highly inter seasonal variations vercruysse et al 2017 better understanding and accurate estimation of streamflow and sediment load on relatively fine temporal scale i e monthly and daily is critical to effectively regulate river flows and control soil loss in catchments there are various methods to estimate streamflow and sediment load including empirically statistical methods sediment rating curve and distributed hydrological models de vente et al 2013 li et al 2017a fu et al 2019 empirically statistical methods establish the relationships between climatic factors and streamflow or sediment load using long term historical data li et al 2017a the sediment rating curve i e describing flow sediment relationships by regression analysis is a widely used tool to estimate the sediment load as a function of stream discharge warrick 2015 ahn et al 2017 however the flow sediment relationships were usually non linear and depended on temporal scales vercruysse et al 2017 but with the sediment rating curve it is difficult to capture these characteristics li et al 2017b distributed hydrological models have complicated physical mechanisms and they are efficient to estimate streamflow and sediment load at different time scales fu et al 2019 however distributed hydrological models need a large amount of input datasets and parameters and they are time consuming it is thus of paramount importance to predict monthly or daily streamflow and sediment load using simply statistical methods with some easily obtained climate and land surface variables the state space model was developed to quantify localized variations wendroth et al 2003 nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 it can effectively consider the temporal and spatial dependences inherent in observations and it can identify the temporal and spatial relationships between dependent and independent variables wendroth et al 2003 nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 the state space model has been widely used to estimate vegetation yield wendroth et al 2003 timm et al 2003 and soil physical and chemical properties yang and wendroth 2014 awe et al 2015 recently the state space model was applied in hydrological prediction li et al 2017b used the state space model to simulate spring discharge using precipitation relative humidity water temperature and electrical conductivity in a karst catchment area guzhou catchment in southwest china from may to november 2015 li et al 2017c applied the state space model to simulate monthly sediment discharge using precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index during 2003 2015 in a typical karst catchment yujiang catchment in southwest china these studies only simulated variations of one certain hydrological variable in a relative short period the simulation in short years is suitable for the situation in which the hydrological variables did not exhibit abrupt change such as in li et al 2017b and li et al 2017c however if the hydrological variables exhibited abrupt changes at longer data series and their changes are different long term simulations of all hydrological variables are essential to our knowledge there is no state space model developed to predict the long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration this work is especially critical for the regions experiencing distinct hydrological changes induced by land use cover changes lucc and climate change e g the loess plateau in china which is the motivation for the work presented in this paper the loess plateau contributed nearly 90 of sediment load in the yellow river wang et al 2016 the severe soil erosion in the loess plateau was caused by highly erodible loessial soil frequent high intensity rainstorms steep topography low vegetation cover and long term intensive cultivation rustomji et al 2008 with the aim of controlling soil erosion in the loess plateau several soil and water conservation measures swcms and ecological restoration campaigns i e afforestation pasture planting construction of terrace and check dam have been implemented since the 1950s fu et al 2017 meanwhile the loess plateau region has been experiencing both warming and drying trends since the 1950s fu et al 2017 the extensive lucc have dramatically altered the hydrological regimes in the loess plateau with the combination of climate change it was observed that the streamflow and sediment load in the loess plateau have exhibited a considerable decreasing trend zhao et al 2017 which resulted in approximately 70 decrease of sediment load in the yellow river over the past six decades wang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 indicated that annual streamflow in 44 sub catchments decreased significantly 0 1 2 6 mm yr 1 and annual sediment load in 52 sub catchments reduced with rates between 2 86 and 636 t km 2 yr 1 during 1957 2012 derived from 58 hydrological stations over the loess plateau zheng et al 2019 found that the mean annual streamflow and sediment load reduced by 22 and 74 during 2008 2016 respectively in comparison with the period of 1971 1987 at 122 hydrological stations across the loess plateau generally most of previous studies in the loess plateau usually investigated the changes of annual streamflow and sediment load while some studies have examined the changes on flood season scale gao et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 in reality most of the annual streamflow and sediment load approximately 45 and 88 respectively in the loess plateau is produced during few some months in the flood season gao et al 2016 therefore it is essential to characterize the variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load as well as suspended sediment concentration and accurately estimate them in the loess plateau over the last decades gao et al 2016 analyzed the multi temporal scale changes of streamflow and sediment load in the yanhe catchment during 1952 2011 however the model simulation was not conducted by gao et al 2016 and the study only was limited to one catchment some studies have used the empirically statistical methods li et al 2017a and physically based hydrological models such as watem sedem li et al 2018 to simulate annual streamflow and sediment load in the catchments of the loess plateau it is challenge to develop the state space models to predict the variations of monthly streamflow sediment load and suspended sediment concentration over the past decades in the loess plateau furthermore previous studies usually obtained the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow and sediment load changes but the detailed effects of lucc need to be quantified in this study the changes of monthly streamflow q specific sediment yield ssy and suspended sediment concentration ssc in fourteen main catchments of the loess plateau during 1961 2011 were detected and estimated the objectives are 1 to characterize the variations of monthly q and ssy and ssc 2 to develop state space models to predict monthly q ssy and ssc and 3 to investigate the effects of lucc on changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load 2 study area and database 2 1 study area the coarse sandy hilly catchments cshc region with an area of 12 97 104 km2 is located in the middle of loess plateau and it is the main sediment producing area of the loess plateau fig 1 the cshc region accounts for 14 8 of the entire yellow river basin fig 1 and it supplies over 70 of sediment load in the yellow river especially coarse sand rustomji et al 2008 the cshc region is characterized by arid to semi arid climate conditions from northwest to southeast the average annual precipitation of the cshc region varied from 300 mm in the northwest to 580 mm in the southeast during 1961 2011 gao et al 2017 the average annual temperature ranges from 6 to 14 c and the average potential evapotranspiration is 1500 to 2000 mm during 1961 2011 which is approximately 3 to 7 times that of the precipitation the precipitation during the flood season with the form of high intensity rainstorms accounts for 72 of the annual total fourteen main catchments in the cshc region were selected as they have available long term observed hydrological data and they have typical land cover landform and hydrological characteristics of the cshc region fig 1 the selected catchments account for 57 4 of the cshc region and they produce about 69 and 71 of total streamflow and sediment load in the cshc region during 1961 2011 respectively table 1 shows the characteristics of the fourteen catchments 2 2 database datasets of monthly streamflow and sediment load of each catchment during 1961 2011 were collected from yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china monthly q ssy and ssc were calculated by these datasets daily precipitation data and meteorological variables including air temperature sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity during 1961 2011 at 66 meteorological stations in and around the cshc region were provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc the potential evapotranspiration pet was estimated using the penman method the precipitation p and pet data were spatially averaged based on the co kriging interpolation algorithm philippe 2017 the land use at 1975 1990 2000 and 2010 was determined with landsat multispectral scanner mss and thematic mapper tm remote sensing images with a spatial resolution of 30 m the overall accuracy of land use data reached 86 land use was divided into six types including forestland cropland grassland construction land water body and barren land the monthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset from january 1982 to december 2011were derived from the global inventory monitoring and modeling system gimms3g with 15 day intervals and a spatial resolution of 0 083 the gimms3g dataset was corrected by the modis dataset to improve the accuracy and reliability kong et al 2018 the areas treated by various swcms in the cshc region during the 1960s 2000s were provided by yrcc the effects of check dams were expressed by the area of land created above them and the storage capacity the total storage capacities of large to medium check dams 1 0 104 m3 in the cshc region during 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s were provided by yrcc 3 methodology the trends of annual seasonal and monthly q ssy and ssc were determined by the bootstrap based nonparametric mann kendall test bs mk test the periodicity in monthly q ssy and ssc were detected by the continuous wavelet transform cwt analysis based on the morlet functional the state space model was developed to simulate monthly q ssy and ssc by their main influencing factors p pet and ndvi the p and pet are the most important climate variables affecting catchment hydrological processes the vegetation cover has considerable influence on runoff and soil erosion and it is highly correlated with streamflow and sediment load the ndvi is a good indicator of vegetation cover and the easily obtained long series of monthly ndvi data can be used to estimate variabilities of streamflow and sediment load thus the p pet and ndvi were expected to estimate monthly streamflow and sediment load by state space model 3 1 bs mk trend test the bs mk test was proposed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 to assess the trends of hydrological and meteorological time series it was improved by yue and pilon 2004 to eliminate data correlation a z statistic was obtained from the bs mk test and a negative value of z indicates a downward trend and vice versa the slope of the trend β was estimated by the sen s slope estimator sen 1968 3 2 continuous wavelet transform cwt the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 η in cwt is defined as 1 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e 1 2 η 2 where η is the non dimensional time parameter ω

convergence limit of 0 005 shumway and stoffer 1982 the original data ui was normalized with respect to their mean m and standard deviation σ to eliminate differences in magnitude among the variables 5 u i u i m 2 σ 4 σ where u i is the scale variable which is dimensionless with mean of 0 5 and standard deviation of 0 25 the variables should be ensured to have significant auto correlation and cross correlation prior to state space analysis timm et al 2003 both the auto correlation functions acf and cross correlation functions ccf were calculated to investigate the temporal correlation structures among the input p pet and ndvi and output variables q ssy and ssc in this study the state space model was applied by the applied statistical time series analysis astsa software by shumway 1988 3 4 model performance criteria the simulation data period was set as 1982 2011 as the ndvi data was available since 1982 and it was divided into two stages i e the calibration period 1982 1999 and validation period 2000 2011 the number of calibrating dataset is 216 for each catchment which is sufficient to ensure the accuracy of the established model the performance of the state space models was evaluated by the akaike information criterion aic nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and root mean square error rmse as follows nielsen and wendroth 2003 yang and wendroth 2014 6 aic ln 1

reached the maximum in july or august fig 2 the p and pet during the summer season accounted for 57 53 and 40 26 of the annual total respectively fig s1 shows the changes of the seasonal and annual p and pet in the study area during 1961 2011 the annual spring summer and autumn precipitation in the study area all decreased during 1961 2011 with rates of 1 34 mm yr 1 0 03 mm yr 1 0 64 mm yr 1 and 0 71 mm yr 1 respectively fig s1a but the decreasing was not significant p 0 05 although the pet increased with rates of 0 82 mm yr 1 0 47 mm yr 1 0 16 mm yr 1 0 14 mm yr 1 and 0 13 mm yr 1 for annual spring summer autumn and winter scales respectively the increase was not significant p 0 1 fig s1b the cropland forestland and grassland accounted for 90 of the cshc region and extensive land use change occurred during 1975 2010 the cropland area decreased by 26 72 and forestland area increased by 53 15 and the grassland area increased by 4 21 from 1975 to 2010 fig s2 the ndvi during the summer season 0 45 was significantly higher than the annual mean value 0 28 fig 2 the ndvi in the study area increased significantly from 1982 to 2011 on annual spring summer and autumn scales p 0 000 with rates of 0 0014 yr 1 0 0012 yr 1 0 0021 yr 1 and 0 0022 yr 1 respectively fig s3 the percentage of the treated area area treated by swcms relative to total catchment area increased from 3 95 in the 1960s to 28 61 in the 2000s fig s4 approximate 1209 check dams were constructed by the 1970s and the number increased to 3846 by the 2000s in the cshc region the sediment storage capacity behind the check dams was estimated to be 230 108 510 108 650 108 and 700 108 m3 in the 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s respectively fig s5 4 2 changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load fig 2 shows the average monthly q ssy and ssc during 1961 2011 for the fourteen catchments the q ssy and ssc all concentrated in the summer season and the maximum monthly value occurred in july or august the q and ssy during the summer season accounted for 49 87 and 91 79 of the annual total respectively the average ssc during summer season 243 09 kg m 3 was approximately two times of the mean annual value 140 89 kg m 3 the above results infer that annual runoff and soil loss is governed by the summer season which highlights the necessity of investigating streamflow and sediment load on monthly scale table 2 shows the trends of the seasonal and annual q ssy and ssc during 1961 2011 the annual q ssy and ssc decreased significantly in all catchments at 0 01 significance level except for the annual q in the qingjian catchment and annual ssc in the huangfu catchment at 0 05 level the mean decreasing rates of annual q ssy and ssc were 0 88 mm yr 1 0 24 to 1 63 mm yr 1 196 31 t km 2 yr 1 35 46 to 419 60 t km 2 yr 1 and 2 85 kg m 3 yr 1 0 98 to 4 86 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively the summer q ssy and ssc decreased significantly in all catchments p 0 01 except for the qingjian catchment at 0 05 level with the mean rates of 0 45 mm yr 1 0 11 to 0 89 mm yr 1 176 43 t km 2 yr 1 30 93 to 384 52 t km 2 yr 1 and 5 32 kg m 3 yr 1 2 89 to 7 55 kg m 3 yr 1 respectively the q ssy and ssc in spring and autumn seasons also showed significantly decreasing trends for almost all the catchments p 0 05 but the winter q ssy and ssc did not show significantly decreasing trends in three four and five catchments respectively p 0 05 the q ssy and ssc in june july and august decreased significantly in almost all the catchments p 0 01 4 3 continuous wavelet analysis of monthly streamflow and sediment load from the wavelet power spectrum analysis the monthly ssy in the studied catchments showed significantly periodic oscillations on 6 month and 12 month scales p 0 05 and the 12 month period was the most important one from 1978 to 1986 and after 2003 periodicity was not detected in all catchments fig 3 a shows the wavelet power spectrum analysis of monthly ssy in the yanhe catchment significant 6 month discontinuous cyclicities in the monthly ssy were detected during 1963 1979 and 1987 2002 and significant 12 month periodic oscillation was found during 1962 1971 1976 1979 1987 1989 and 1991 1996 periodicity was not detected from 1980 to 1986 and after 2003 in the yanhe catchment the periodic characteristics of monthly q were somewhat in accordance with those of monthly ssy there were significant 6 month oscillations for q in yanhe catchment during 1963 1979 and 1987 2002 and significant 12 month periodic oscillations during 1962 1971 1976 1979 1987 1989 and 1991 1996 fig 3b similar to monthly ssy monthly ssc in the studied catchments showed significant power in the wavelet power spectrum at 2 month and 12 month periods but the periodic continuity of ssc is better than that of ssy fig 3c shows the periods of monthly ssc in the yanhe catchment the 95 confidence intervals are continuously distributed in 6 month and 12 month band during 1961 1980 1982 1997 and 2001 2002 4 4 simulations of monthly streamflow and sediment load by state space model the acf results showed that the significant autocorrelation range for monthly q ssy ssc p pet and ndvi were all at least one lags in the fourteen catchments for example the monthly q ssy ssc p pet and ndvi in the yanhe catchment had significant autocorrelation range of 1 2 1 2 2 and 2 lags respectively fig 4 the ccf results showed that the monthly q was significantly cross correlated with p pet and ndvi and both ssy and ssc were significantly cross correlated with q p and ndvi with at least one lag in the studied catchments for example in the yanhe catchment the monthly q was significantly cross correlated with p pet and ndvi in 2 3 and 2 lags respectively fig 5 the monthly ssy was significantly cross correlated with q p and ndvi in 1 1 and 2 lags respectively and the corresponding lags for monthly ssc were 2 2 and 2 respectively fig 5 the acf and ccf results indicated that the state space model had potential to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc with the selected variables i e p pet q and ndvi table 3 shows the transition coefficients and performances of the state space model to estimate monthly q using the three influencing factors p pet and ndvi the mean aic nse and rmse values during the calibration period were 6 68 8 38 to 5 35 0 97 0 93 0 99 and 0 04 0 02 0 07 respectively during the validation period the mean aic nse and rmse values were 5 21 6 43 to 4 27 0 90 0 78 0 97 and 0 08 0 04 0 12 respectively there were eight catchments having nse values 0 90 four catchments having nse values between 0 80 and 0 90 and two catchments having nse values between 0 75 and 0 80 during the validation period the average transition coefficients of q p pet and ndvi at time i 1 to estimate q at time i were 0 25 0 12 0 66 0 56 0 18 0 73 0 21 0 11 0 35 and 0 11 0 01 0 18 respectively this result implied that precipitation was the most important factor to estimate streamflow compared to monthly q the state space models had higher mean aic value lower nse value and higher rmse value to estimate monthly ssy with 6 19 0 94 and 0 05 during calibration period and 5 12 0 89 and 0 08 during validation period respectively table 4 this result indicated that accuracy of estimating monthly ssy was lower than that of monthly q the average transition coefficients of ssy q p and ndvi at time i 1 to estimate ssy at time i were 0 15 0 001 0 41 0 50 0 08 0 76 0 23 0 11 0 47 and 0 18 0 002 0 32 respectively the streamflow had the most substantial influence on specific sediment yield the mean aic nse and rmse values of the state space model to estimate monthly ssc were 5 66 0 91 and 0 07 during the calibration period respectively and they were 4 81 0 87 and 0 09 during the validation period respectively table 5 therefore the accuracy of the state space model to estimate monthly ssc was lower than that to estimate monthly q and ssy furthermore the average transition coefficients of ssc q p and ndvi at time i 1were 0 34 0 07 0 63 0 27 0 003 0 70 0 14 0 03 0 24 and 0 20 0 07 0 36 respectively therefore the relative contribution of the previous ssc was much greater than q p and ndvi to estimate ssc at time i the observed and estimated monthly q ssy and ssc during the calibration and validation periods in the yanhe catchment are shown in fig 6 the estimated monthly q ssy and ssc generally matched the observed values well the state space model had good performance to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc by p q and ndvi however the estimated value was somewhat lower than the observed value especially on the months with high values which indicated that the state space model underestimated the streamflow and sediment load to some degree fig 6 we also used the linear regression equation and sediment rating curve to estimate monthly sediment load for comparison tables s1 and s2 figs s6 and s7 same to the simulation procedure of the state space model the linear regression equation between monthly ssy and p ssy ap b and sediment rating curve ssy αqβ 1 was established in calibration period 1982 1999 and they were used to predict monthly sediment load in validation period 2000 2011 the mean nse value of the linear regression equation to estimate monthly ssc was only 0 47 during the calibration period and it was even negative 7 60 during the validation period table s1 the simulation results of linear regression equation had huge estimation error and it was not applicable in predicting sediment load fig s6 the performance of sediment rating curve was acceptable with mean nse value of 0 85 during calibration period and 0 55 during validation period table s2 however compared to the state space model the sediment rating curve had lower nse value and much higher aic value and it considerably overestimated the sediment load on the months with low values fig s7 5 discussion 5 1 effects of land use cover changes on variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load this study indicated that the annual summer spring and autumn streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration all decreased significantly in almost all the catchments during 1961 2011 the periodicity of monthly streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration reduced and especially the periodicity was not detected after 2003 the changes of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were not significant in the study area and their effects were limited wang et al 2016 fu et al 2017 the changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load were mainly caused by land use cover change improvement of vegetation cover and constructions of engineering measures induced by swcms and ecological restoration campaigns rustomji et al 2008 gao et al 2017 the swcms greatly decreased the production ability of runoff and sediment load by precipitation and retained streamflow and sediment load within the catchment puigdefábregas 2005 dey and mishra 2017 the biological swcms i e afforestation and grass planting can increase rainfall interception and evapotranspiration by the vegetation canopy reduce wash durability and surface runoff by the litter layer fixate soil by the root system and ameliorate soil physical chemical properties to increase anti erodibility vannoppen et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2016 the above effects operate together to enhance infiltration and ultimately reduce runoff amount which subsequently decrease soil erosion and sediment transport kervroedan et al 2020 improvement of vegetation cover was considered one of the most effective measures to control soil erosion farley et al 2005 gao et al 2016 and wang et al 2016 found that both the runoff coefficient and sediment concentration decreased significantly and linearly with the vegetation coverage in catchments of the loess plateau some studies found that vegetation restoration measure has played a key role in reducing surface runoff and controlling soil erosion in the loess plateau during recent years wang et al 2016 the engineering swcms had immediate and substantial effects on reducing streamflow by reducing flood peaks and storing water within check dams and reservoirs guyassa et al 2017 the check dam can effectively mitigate sedimentation as sediment could be fully deposited before the dam quiñonero rubio et al 2016 it was reported that check dams retained sediment with rate of approximately 5 15 13 08 104 t hm 2 in the loess plateau gao et al 2016 and terraces maintained runoff and sediment with ratios of 3 8 m3 km 2 and 0 8 t km 2 respectively miao et al 2011 the construction of check dams and terraces has progressed rapidly since the 1970s in the study area zhao et al 2017 the engineering measures consequently decrease both the magnitude and variability of streamflow and sediment load mekonnen et al 2015 the engineering measures utilized much smaller area compared to the vegetation restoration measures but the engineering measures substantially trapped streamflow and sediment load quiñonero rubio et al 2016 the engineering and vegetation restoration measures played different roles in reducing streamflow and sediment load the check dams mainly regulated the flow sediment relationship whereas reforestation primarily resulted in streamflow moderation zhang et al 2019 in order to quantify the effects of swcms on streamflow and sediment load reductions the relationships between the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient with the percentage of area treated by swcms in the study area were analyzed respectively the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient was defined as the average ratio of q and ssy over precipitation in the five decades 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s and 2000s respectively thus eliminating the effect of precipitation and enabling a direct focus on land surface condition controls it was found that both the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient decreased significantly and linearly with the percentage of area treated by swcms in fig 7 p 0 05 indicating the heavily dependence of streamflow and sediment load production ability on the area under swcms treatment furthermore the decadal runoff coefficient and sediment coefficient also had linear correlations with the check dam storage fig 8 the check dam had the critical effect on streamflow and sediment load reduction among the swcms it also can be found that the effects of swcms and check dam on sediment load reduction were stronger than those on streamflow reduction as indicated by the regression coefficients in figs 7 and 8 it should be noted that the locality of swcms also has considerable effects on streamflow and sediment load and the quantitative effects of different swcms on changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load are complex due to the nonlinear processes these issues need further study with detailed spatial distribution data of swcms in the catchment 5 2 applicability of state space model to predict monthly streamflow and sediment load the simulation results indicated that the state space model was satisfactory to predict long term variations of monthly streamflow sediment yield and sediment concentration in the studied catchments the state space model is practical as it only needs several commonly available climate and land surface indicators i e precipitation potential evapotranspiration and normalized difference vegetation index whereas the distributed hydrological models need a large amount of input datasets and parameters for the longer time data series furthermore the prediction results of state space model far outperformed the classical regression and sediment rating curve methods in this study additionally the temporal variations in streamflow and sediment load are considerably influenced by watershed characteristics such as geology geomorphology landscapes and soil properties vercruysse et al 2017 a factor that played a critical role in one watershed might not be important at other watersheds consequently we have expanded the state space model to longer time data series and more watersheds in order to better establish this methodology thus the developed state space model was a useful tool for predicting streamflow and sediment load in the loess plateau the performance of state space model for simulating streamflow was best followed by simulating sediment yield and sediment concentration furthermore the relative contribution of precipitation and previous streamflow in simulating monthly streamflow was greater than those of potential evapotranspiration and normalized differential vegetation index streamflow and previous sediment concentration were the most important state variables to estimate monthly sediment yield and sediment concentration respectively precipitation is the direct driving force of producing runoff and the precipitation and streamflow usually have good relationship under little land surface change but the relationship is variable if there is extensive land cover change gao et al 2017 hansford et al 2020 the sediment load is mainly controlled by sediment production ability of runoff and the sediment load is typically strongly correlated with stream discharge vercruysse et al 2017 the sediment concentration is determined by the flow sediment relationship which is usually complex and nonlinear zhang et al 2019 therefore it is usually difficult to adequately simulate sediment concentration good performance of the state space model is attributed to that it considers the magnitude of a variable at a given time in comparison with its respective value at a previous or future time timm et al 2003 wendroth et al 2003 the state space model employs the relationships between neighboring observations whereas the classical statistical method assumes that observations are distributed randomly nielsen and wendroth 2003 awe et al 2015 in addition the autoregressive nature of state space model can take into account uncertainty that usually drive a stochastic updating and filtering step li et al 2017b 2017c therefore the state space model can be considered as an effective tool to describe the temporal variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load there are several issues that still require further investigation for the state space model to predict streamflow and sediment load first the applicability of the state space model to estimate monthly streamflow and sediment load needs further test in more catchments with different climatic land use cover soil properties and topography conditions the state space model should be extended to estimate streamflow and sediment load on more fine scale i e daily or even storm based second the interaction effect between the model variables may reduce the performance of the state space model such as the underestimation of monthly streamflow and sediment load in this study accounting for this interaction effect in the state space model would greatly improve the predictability of streamflow and sediment load third besides vegetation cover factors i e ndvi considered in this study more land surface conditions such as the effects of engineering measures should be incorporated in the state space model the temporal variations of model parameters should be considered especially for the situation with distinct land use cover change finally the geographically spatial regression model with detailed distribution information of land surface condition is also an effective tool to estimate hydrological responses more studies are needed to compare the performances of different types of model 6 conclusions this study detected the changes of monthly streamflow and sediment load during 1961 2011 in fourteen main catchments of the loess plateau and developed state space model to estimate the long term variations of monthly streamflow and sediment load the annual streamflow and sediment load concentrated in the summer season which showed significant decreases of monthly q ssy and ssc and the changing periodicity also reduced greatly in the state space model precipitation q and previous ssc were the main state variables to estimate monthly q ssy and ssc respectively the state space model well predicted the temporal variations of monthly q ssy and ssc with the nash sutcliffe model efficiency over 0 85 the state space model is a useful tool for predicting streamflow and sediment load time series credit authorship contribution statement guangyao

4378,with great changes such as climate and land use cover occurring in hydrological processes over the last decades runoff sensitivity here defined as proportional changes in runoff caused by a given proportional change in its driving factors including precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and parameter m has also been changing over time however few studies have focused on this sensitivity change and runoff sensitivity is always considered to be constant in runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method in this study we attempt to examine the temporal variation of runoff sensitivity in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin china and quantify its effects on the changes in runoff so that the existing attribution method can be improved we found that runoff sensitivity showed statistically significant trend and runoff became more sensitive to changes in long term average p pet and m parameter m largely affected by land use cover change resulting from large scale ecological projects was the major contributor to change in runoff sensitivity followed by p and lastly pet runoff sensitivity variation contributed approximately 20 to the proportional runoff change and by allowing runoff sensitivity to change over time relative contributions of p pet and m to runoff would range from 5 05 to 9 94 our study supplements research focusing on hydrological changes and interactions and we suggest that temporal variation in runoff sensitivity should be considered when quantifying the impacts of driving factors on changes in hydrological processes keywords budyko elasticity attribution analysis loess plateau 1 introduction runoff sensitivity refers to the runoff response to a change in its driving factors such as climate and land use cover and it varies in different conditions berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 harman et al 2011 nêmec and schaake 1982 roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for example with an assumption that all driving factors other than precipitation such as temperature and land use cover remain constant the same percentage increase in precipitation in arid regions causes a smaller percentage increase in runoff than it would in humid regions also the replacement of trees or shrubs with crops or grasses would lead to increasing runoff because of reduced evapotranspiration roderick and farquhar 2011 lots of studies have demonstrated these spatial disparities of runoff sensitivity on both regional and global scales and related these disparities with changes in aridity or land use cover berghuijs et al 2017 donohue et al 2011 hua et al 2013 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 silberstein et al 2012 sinha et al 2020 tang and lettenmaier 2012 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 however temporal change of runoff sensitivity gets less attention berghuijs and woods 2016 fan et al 2017 considering the existence of space time symmetry in water balance which means that the spatial between catchment variability of mean annual water balances matches the corresponding temporal inter annual variability of individual catchments berghuijs and woods 2016 carmona et al 2014 singh et al 2011 sivapalan et al 2011 it is likely that runoff sensitivity would change over time in the same way as other hydrological processes e g runoff trends especially in the context of global warming and intensive land use cover change jaramillo and destouni 2015 labat et al 2004 piao et al 2007 yang et al 2018b however runoff sensitivity has been regarded as constant in the elasticity based method used in hydrological attribution analysis gao et al 2016 hongxing et al 2009 li et al 2012 2007 liang et al 2015 sinha et al 2020 wang 2014 wu et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2014 2013 zhang et al 2008 2011 these kinds of analyses focus on hydrological changes such as decreases or increases in runoff between two periods baseline period and post baseline period and this change is usually attributed to climate and human activities such as land use cover change taking precipitation as an example a general framework for distinguishing the contribution of certain factors to runoff change using the elasticity method is as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 sinha et al 2020 1 δ r p ε p r p δ p where r and p are the average annual runoff and precipitation respectively across the whole study period and δ p and δ r p are the precipitation change and precipitation introduced runoff change between the baseline and post baseline periods ε p represents runoff elasticity to the precipitation in the entire study period and is defined as the proportional change in average annual runoff for a given proportional change in average annual precipitation 2 ε p r r p p this concept was first proposed by schaake 1990 in hydrology and has been widely used for describing runoff sensitivity because it allows variables with different physical meanings to be compared berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 2017 harman et al 2011 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2016b based on the inference mentioned above whereby runoff sensitivity might change over time in a changing environment the use of invariant runoff elasticity in an attribution analysis of where hydrological processes have been changing clearly warrants more careful consideration the objectives of this study are therefore 1 to examine temporal variations in runoff sensitivity and 2 to analyze to what extent these sensitivity variations would influence runoff and runoff attribution analysis by allowing elasticity to change over time in order to do this sensitivity estimation is necessary and various methods have been developed to calculate runoff sensitivity these methods can be classified into three categories 1 inputting different values into a well calibrated hydrological model to obtain the resulting runoff change arora 2002 silberstein et al 2012 tang and lettenmaier 2012 2 analytical derivation from a linear or nonlinear equations donohue et al 2011 tang and lettenmaier 2012 and 3 nonparametric estimation from a statistical description such as median value over time of the long term observations brikowski 2015 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 in these methods budyko equations are popular in sensitivity estimation and attribution analysis with an elasticity based method because of their structural simplicity and physical background compared with methods that use a hydrological model and statistical description respectively berghuijs et al 2020 2017 gan et al

2011 yang et al 2007 therefore runoff sensitivity to changes in ϕ also p and pet respectively and m can be estimated based on the partial differential equations derived from budyko equations also the runoff sensitivity can then be used in attribution analysis with an elasticity based method for example based on budyko equations donohue et al 2011 and yang and yang 2011 estimated the spatial differences in runoff sensitivity in the murray darling basin in australia and 90 small catchments in the northern part of china respectively while zhou et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 and berghuijs et al 2017 conducted global assessments of the sensitivity of water availability indicated by r or r p to climate indicated by ϕ p or pet and other factors indicated by m liang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and sinha et al 2020 also quantified the relative effects of climate and other factors on runoff variability in some catchments across china and india and associated changes in the other factors in budyko equations with human activities such as ecological restoration ning et al considered other factors as interactions among vegetation climate and topography and disentangled m from vegetation coverage climate seasonality the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and relative basin relief at different time scale from annual to 30 year period ning et al 2017 2020 2019 gan et al 2021 demonstrated the great importance of vegetation to water balance within the budyko equations by highlighting effects of land cover type effective rooting depth vegetation coverage and dependence of vegetation to climate there are also lots of research aimed to make the budyko equations extend from long term water balance model to daily monthly scale from steady state to non steady state condition with changes in shallow groundwater and water storage and from natural processes to coupled human nature system including irrigation and human water consumption chen et al 2020 mianabadi et al 2020 sankarasubramanian et al 2020 yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 here we use budyko equations to estimate runoff sensitivity to its drivers and this study is organized as follows first temporal changes in variables in the budyko equations r p pet and m are detected to show the changing environment and thus the necessity of sensitivity variation analysis section 3 1 next we calculate runoff sensitivity to p pet and m expressed by ε p ε pet and ε m respectively over time and test their trends section 3 2 then the study period is divided into two parts through breakpoint analysis we quantify the respective effects of p pet and m on the respective changes in ε p ε pet and ε m between two periods section 3 3 and estimate the sum effects of runoff sensitivity variation ε p ε pet and ε m on the proportional change in r section 3 4 finally uncertainty surrounding the runoff attribution analysis with the elasticity based method is estimated by taking the temporal variation of runoff sensitivity into consideration section 3 5 2 methods 2 1 study area we chose 16 small catchments in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin china fig 1 as the study area because changes in climate and land use cover there make it likely that runoff sensitivity has changed 1 the climate here has been warmer and drier over time and runoff has clearly been decreasing since 1950s fu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 and 2 there has been a great change in land use cover in recent decades including an increase in grassland forestland and buildings and a decrease in unused land and farmland fu and chen 2000 wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 furthermore because the regions has suffered from severe soil erosion fu et al 2011 the portion of the area subject to soil and water conservation measures terraces check dams small reservoirs and afforestation increased from 3 06 in 1969 to 51 36 in 2012 wang 2002 yrcc 1990 2012 2 2 data sources and processing long term climate and runoff data were used in this study the catchment boundary and drainage area were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for 1956 to 2016 were derived from the daily meteorological data china meteorological data service center http data cma cn at 99 meteorological stations fig 1 daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated via the penman monteith equation from maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity and duration of sunshine details available in allen et al 1998 a digital elevation model of the study area international scientific data service platform http datamirror csdb cn the anusplin interpolation tool hutchinson and xu 2013 and the arcmap 10 2 clip tool were used to calculate the annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of each catchment and the entire region the annual streamflow data from 18 gauging stations fig 1 table 1 were also obtained from the yrcc the streamflow of the middle reaches is the difference between the observation data from the stations at the entrance and the outlet 2 3 trend test the trend significance of the long term variables including r p pet m ε p ε pet and ε m were tested using the non parametric mann kendall mk method in this study the mk test is often used in hydro meteorological time series and a statistical value z obtained from the mk test is used to indicate the level of significance gocic and trajkovic 2013 mann 1945 a slope of the trends was estimated using sen s method sen 1968 2 4 runoff sensitivity estimation here we used budyko equations to estimate runoff sensitivity and two of the more widely used equations are the turc mezentsev mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 and tixeront fu fu 1996 tixeront 1964 formulas andréassian et al 2016 andréassian and sari 2019 here we chose the tixeront fu equation to calculate runoff sensitivity due to its more general partial differential expressions compared with the turc mezentsev formulas andréassian and sari 2019 and it is expressed as 4 f φ m 1 φ 1 φ m 1 m then the first derivative of f φ m with respect to ϕ f φ and m f m is written as follows 5 f φ 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 1 6 f m 1 φ m 1 m ln 1 φ m m 2 φ m 1 φ m 1 m 1 ln φ m combining eqs 2 and 3 runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m can be expressed respectively as follows 7 ε p r r p p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ m 8 ε pet r r p e t p e t ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ m 9 ε m r r m m m f m 1 f ϕ m therefore ε p ε pet and ε m can finally be calculated based on the values of r p and pet according to eqs 7 9 ε p is a positive value an increase in p increases r ε pet and ε m are negative values increases in pet and m decrease r and the sum of ε p and ε pet always equals 1 larger absolute values of ε p ε pet and ε m indicate greater proportional change in r for a given proportional change in p pet and m respectively that is to say r is more sensitive to p pet and m therefore in subsequent analysis we also used absolute values of ε pet and ε m ε pet and ε m to compare levels of runoff sensitivity to p pet and m more details about the derivation process can be seen in gao et al 2016 it is important to note that the application of budyko equations needs to satisfy an assumption that catchments should be under steady state conditions however it is difficult to measure changes in water storage existing studies have always used long term averages to represent steady state carmona et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 andréassian et al 2016 considered the long term averages of at least ten years and preferably three decades han et al 2020 showed that about 70 of the catchments attain a steady state within 10 years with a threshold of water storage change for a steady state setting to 5 of the mean monthly p in this study we used 15 year averages to attain a steady state and replaced data in the tth year with 15 year moving averages from the t 7th to t 7th years so that the steady state assumption can be satisfied and trends of variables in budyko equations can also be tested sections 3 1 and 3 2 2 5 scenario analysis a scenario analysis was used to calculate the respective effects of p pet and m on the respective changes in ε p ε pet and ε m section 3 3 and also the effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on proportional changes in r section 3 4 at first a non parametric pettitt method pettitt 1979 was used to detect the breakpoint of annual r and the significance level of the breakpoint table 1 based on this we divided the study period into two periods the baseline period and post baseline period and calculated the average values of r p pet and m of each period 2 5 1 estimation of effects of driving factors on changes in runoff sensitivity driving factors include p pet and m runoff sensitivity includes ε p ε pet and ε m to estimate the effects of p on changes in ε p between the two periods we 1 used average values of p pet and m in the baseline period p 1 pet 1 and m 1 to calculate ε p 1 based on eq 7 and 2 used the average value of p in the post baseline period p 2 as well as the average values of pet and m in the baseline period pet 1 and m 1 to calculate ε p 3 considered the absolute difference between ε p and ε p 1 as the contribution of p to changes in ε p from the baseline period to the post baseline period eq 10 repeating steps 1 3 respective contributions of pet and m to changes in ε p can be estimated eqs 11 12 we then 4 calculated the respective relative contributions of p pet and m to ε p as eqs 13 15 again when repeating steps 1 4 respective relative contributions of p pet and m to the respective changes in ε pet and ε m can also be estimated 10 con p t o ε p ε p p 2 pet

estimation of effect of runoff sensitivity on proportional runoff change because r is a function of p pet and m the proportional change in r can be expressed as gao et al 2016 16 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet ε m δ m m we first calculated the average values of ε p ε pet ε m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m at the baseline period and post baseline period to estimate the effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on relative changes in r δ r r between the two periods we 1 used the average values in the baseline period ε p 1 ε pet 1 ε m 1 δ p p 1 δ p e t pet 1 and δ m m 1 to calculate δ r r 1 based on eq 16 and 2 used the average values of ε p ε pet and ε m in the post baseline period ε p 2 ε pet 2 and ε m 2 and the average values of δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m in the baseline period δ p p 1 δ p e t pet 1 and δ m m 1 to calculate δ r r 3 we considered the absolute difference between δ r r and δ r r 1 as the contribution of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m to the proportional change in r δ r r from the baseline period to the post baseline period eq 17 repeating steps 1 3 the contribution of proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m to the change in r δ r r can be estimated eqs 18 we then 4 calculated the respective relative contributions of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m and the proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m to δ

uncertainty of scenario analysis the role of interaction among driving factors in runoff sensitivity or proportional runoff change was ignored in scenario analysis so validity of this method was evaluated by comparing a total sum of contribution of each driver to runoff sensitivity or to proportional runoff change between baseline period and post baseline period with b the difference of runoff sensitivity or proportional runoff change between the two periods which were directly calculated based on average values of each period the closer the a is to b the minor the role of interaction among driving factors is and thus the more convincing the scenario analysis is in this study a and b are roughly equal with an average relative error ratio of the difference between a and b to the value of b of 12 fig s4 2 6 uncertainty surrounding the runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method a runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method calculates the contribution of p pet and m to the change in r δ r between the baseline period and the post baseline period based on eq 16 the change in r caused by p δ r p is estimated as eq 1 and the changes in r caused by pet δ r pet and m δ r m are the same then the respective relative contributions of p rcon p t o r pet rcon p e t t o r and m rcon m t o r to r can be calculated for example as 21 rcon p t o r δ r p δ r p δ r pet δ r m more details about the attribution analysis are available in gao et al 2016 here we estimated the possible ranges of the relative contributions of p pet and m to the change in r rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r with attribution analysis by allowing runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m to change over time first we calculated two groups of ε p ε pet and ε m using data from baseline period and post baseline period respectively based on these two groups of ε p ε pet and ε m possible ranges of rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r can be obtained then we compared upper and lower limits of the possible ranges of rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r with their previous values calculated via eq 21 and this relative change is defined as the uncertainty surrounding in attribution analysis with an elasticity based method for instance the uncertainty range in rcon p t o r is expressed as 22 u n c e r t a i n t y rcon p t o r

in the budyko equation for 1956 2016 r and p decreased statistically significantly p 0 05 with rates of 0 87 mm yr and 1 35 mm yr respectively while pet showed a lack of trend fig 2 a c based on their 15 year moving average values we calculated the annual values of m as shown in fig 2d m values ranged from 2 92 to 3 78 with a statistically significant increase rate of 0 02 yr p 0 05 between 1963 and 2009 regarding small catchments the average annual values of r p pet and m had various spatial patterns and their annual values showed statistically significant trends p 0 05 in most areas fig 3 r had larger average values and reduction rates in the southernmost and northernmost catchments such as yiluo wei qin kuye and tuwei while the smallest average value was in fen in the middle catchments the average values of p and m both increased roughly from north to south but their trends and change rates differed p had a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in all catchments while m had a statistically significant increasing trend in all catchments except qingjian yan and beiluo and the decrease rates of p and increase rates of m in eastern catchments were larger than the west the average annual values of pet decreased from north to south except for yiluo in the south temporally it showed a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in the northernmost huangfu kuye and gushan and southernmost catchments qin and yiluo while in other catchments it had an increasing trend and increased statistically significantly p 0 05 in wei qingjian dali yan wuding jing and beiluo which are located in the west 3 2 temporal variation in runoff sensitivity our analysis showed diverse spatial patterns and temporal trends in runoff sensitivity to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pet and m ε m here we compared ε p with ε m and ε pet because ε m and ε pet have negative values i e increasing m and pet cause decreasing runoff note that ε pet ε p 1 eqs 7 and 8 in section 2 4 so they have the same trends and change rates in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin ε p was slightly larger than ε m with mean values of 3 14 and 2 90 respectively long term ε m and ε p both showed statistically significantly increasing trends p 0 05 with change rates of 0 02 yr and ranged from 2 43 to 3 35 and from 2 76 to 3 65 respectively fig 4 specifically the mean value of the long term ε m was larger than ε p in nine small catchments mostly located north of the middle reaches and smaller than ε p in seven catchments in the south fig 5 the difference between the average ε m and ε p of the catchments where ε m was larger than ε p ranged from 0 22 qin to 1 02 wuding while other catchments where ε m was smaller than ε p ranged from 0 02 yan to 0 82 xinshui moreover the mean value of ε m varied between 1 96 yiluo and 3 45 fen with larger values in north of the middle reaches whereas ε p varied between 1 84 tuwei and 3 92 fen with larger values in the south regarding the trends of ε m and ε p for the last six decades they both increased statistically significantly p 0 05 in all catchments except the north central catchments covering dali yan and beiluo where the p values of ε p trends were higher than 0 05 the largest and lowest statistically significant increase rates of ε p were approximately 0 027 yr in fen and 0 008 yr in wuding respectively while 0 033 yr in fen and 0 005 yr in yiluo respectively for ε m 3 3 effects of driving factors on changes in runoff sensitivity after identifying the breakpoints of the middle reaches and small catchments table 1 figs s1 and s2 we then analyzed the respective effects of p pet and m on respective changes in runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m between two periods through the scenario analysis see section 2 5 1 in the whole middle reaches the results showed that m was the main contributor to the changes in ε p and ε m from the baseline period to the post baseline period with a proportion of 93 99 and 52 88 respectively fig 6 for ε p in small catchments m contributed an average of 85 26 to its change while p and pet caused 10 82 and 3 92 respectively spatially the contribution of m was larger for the catchments in the north than those in the south while p and pet were the opposite for ε m average contributions of m p and pet to it were 47 13 39 09 and 13 87 respectively and their spatial patterns were similar to those for ε p in the north and south catchments in addition because the sum of ε pet and ε p was constant the respective effects of p pet and m on changes in ε pet were the same as those on ε p and they were ignored in fig 6 3 4 effect of runoff sensitivity on proportional runoff change here we identified the total effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on changes in proportional runoff change δ r r between two periods see section 2 5 2 as shown in fig 7 runoff sensitivity including ε p ε pet and ε m took up an average of 22 55 of the change in δ r r from the baseline period to the post baseline period with the exception of jing in all of the small catchments runoff sensitivity contributed less than half to changes in δ r r ranging from 3 93 to 38 58 effects of proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m on the change in δ r r were larger and these effects referred to the direct effects of p pet and m on δ r r rather than the indirect effects that p pet and m influence r through the change in runoff sensitivity 3 5 uncertainty of runoff attribution analysis with the consideration of sensitivity variation given the small but indispensable effect of runoff sensitivity on changes in δ r r we estimated uncertainty of the runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method which considers runoff sensitivity as constants according to the method in section 2 6 possible relative changes in runoff attribution results relative contributions of p pet and m to the change in r namely rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r were illustrated in fig 8 in small catchments relative change range of rcon p e t t o r was greater than rcon p t o r followed by rcon m t o r with an average proportion of 24 24 17 08 and 5 11 respectively the pattern of the relative change in rcon p t o r was similar to that of rcon p e t t o r they had a wider range in the north and south catchments but a narrower one in the central parts for rcon m t o r its prop change range was wider in the south catchments than the north considering the direction of the relative change the positive amplitudes of rcon p t o r and rcon p e t t o r were larger than the negative in most of the catchments but rcon m t o r was the opposite there were a number of exceptions such as in jialu qin qingjian yan and beiluo where the positive amplitude of rcon m t o r was wider or the negative amplitudes of rcon p t o r and rcon p e t t o r were narrower for the entire middle reaches temporal variation of runoff sensitivity caused relative changes in rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r varying from 5 05 to 9 41 from 4 75 to 9 94 and from 5 02 to 2 68 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 theoretical causes for runoff sensitivity variation based on budyko equations according to the theoretical curves of runoff sensitivity which can be derived from budyko equations berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m are greater in areas with a drier climate pet p and larger m in terms of ε m both m and pet p affect it but ε p and ε pet are more sensitive to m rather than pet p therefore in this study decreasing p drier climate and increasing m caused increases in ε p ε pet and ε m together and m was the major contributing factor fig 6 it contributed 93 99 to the increases in ε p and ε pet and 52 88 to ε m p took up 43 61 of the change in ε m while pet had little effect on runoff sensitivity in the study area due to its lack of trend within the study period fig 2 spatially the north catchments had drier climates pet p and smaller m than the south fig 3 reducing difference in ε m between the north and south catchments however ε p and ε pet were predominantly affected by m so ε p and ε pet were smaller in the north catchments than in the south as a result ε m was larger than ε p in the north catchments and the opposite in the south fig 5 moreover the effects of p and pet on the changes in runoff sensitivity were smaller in the north catchments than in the south because of their varied climate fig 6 the aforementioned results derived from budyko equations were consistent with earlier research based on empirical evidence padrón et al 2017 concluded from a systematic review and meta analysis that apart from pet p other factors also indicated by m explained at least 35 of the et p change and up to about 90 in arid regions therefore m greatly influences runoff especially in arid climates other global synthetic studies have found that climate variability and forest cover change play an equal role in annual water yield variations but r is less sensitive to climate change in drier catchments than in wetter catchments li et al 2017 4 2 potential causes for temporal variation in runoff sensitivity in this study the parameter m is an important factor in runoff sensitivity and there are lots of physical explanations for it in general m accounts for all factors except for long term average pet p that might influence the partitioning of p into r and et and a larger m means more p would be converted to et the physical factors involved both catchment properties e g topography soil texture and land use cover type and further climatic factors e g snow condition and climatic seasonal variability berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 ning et al 2019 roderick and farquhar 2011 yang et al 2018a also described m as the water retention properties of catchments and regarded it as a function of vegetation soil and topography yang et al 2007 proposed an empirical formula for m estimation with a calibration from the long term observations in 108 non humid catchments within and near the yellow river basin the formula includes landscape parameters including relative infiltration capacity relative soil water storage and the average slope and here we analyzed the potential causes for increases in m from this perspective infiltration capacity is measured by saturated hydraulic conductivity while soil water storage is determined by plant extractable water capacity on a decade scale the most likely drivers for the changes in the above mentioned soil physical properties may be land use cover change since 1999 the grain for green programme ggp has converted 16 000 km2 of rain fed cropland in the loess plateau mostly located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin to vegetation with vegetation cover increasing at a rate of 25 over the last decade feng et al 2016 in addition soil in forests or shrub land has a higher infiltration capacity and water storage capacity than that in farmland because of the litter layer and deeper roots moreover the conservation of water and soil ecological engineering cwsee project was also launched in this area in the 1960s and the cumulative area of soil and water conservation such as terraces check dams and small reservoirs has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 these measures reduced the slope of landscape and increased water infiltration and retention wang 2002 estimated that on average about 1 85 mm yr 1 of water was retained by these measures between 1960 and 2000 in the loess plateau liang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 also found that m is significantly correlated with the percentage of an area affected by soil and water conservation measures in most of this region in addition increasing water withdrawal from rivers may also increase m by directly reducing runoff wang et al 2019 as mentioned in previous paragraph land use cover change maybe the major reason for the change in m given the important role of m in runoff sensitivity variation relationship between land use cover and runoff sensitivity was discussed in this section as shown in figs 9 and 10 both vegetation coverage and area of ecological measures are statistically significantly correlated with ε p and ε m in most of the catchments however number of catchments with significant correlation between vegetation coverage and ε p is larger than that with significant correlation between vegetation coverage and ε m while area of ecological measures is significantly correlated with ε m in more catchments than that with ε p this contradiction maybe resulted from the inconsistent time series of vegetation coverage and ecological measures so more long and reliable data set or technique should be developed and used for quantifying interaction among the complex hydrological processes in terms of climate factors p showed a statistically significant decreasing trend while changes in pet were not apparent with global warming this is unexpected due to the close correlation between pet and temperature however the penman monteith pet estimated model also depends on wind speed relative humidity and other variables and we found that the increasing temperature was offset by decreasing wind speeds and sunshine duration while relative humidity had no significant trend fig s3 see also in yin et al 2010a 2010b 4 3 implication and limitations of this study this study focuses on temporal variation in runoff sensitivity and supplements research on hydrological change it has been acknowledged that the hydrological process on both global and regional scales has changed greatly in the last century durack and matear 2012 gedney et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 previous studies have realized the great importance of this change and explored it with the perspectives of the hydro meteorological variables trends water regime shift and the effects of driving factors on water availability change jaramillo and destouni 2014 liang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 as a supplement our study which took the middle reaches of the yellow river basin as a case study proved the existence of temporal increase in runoff sensitivity and found that runoff sensitivity change affected about one fifth of the proportional runoff change since these effects of runoff sensitivity have been ignored in previous runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method which considered runoff sensitivity to be constants we considered it and estimated uncertainty of previous attribution method gao et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 therefore more attention should be paid to hydrological sensitivity variation and effects of sensitivity variation on change in runoff especially in regions where significant transformations have taken place in recent decades tang et al 2019 the budyko equation was the basis of this study its applicability to the study area and the calculation of parameter m in the function were important to support the rationality of our findings the budyko equation has been widely used in previous studies on both regional and global scales annual runoff projections using the budyko equation and the physical based hydrological model agreed with each other fernandez and sayama 2015 yang et al 2018a the equation has proven to be an effective tool for exploring hydrological processes in particular the impacts of climate factors and catchment characteristics on water balance wang et al 2016a however it was developed for steady states in large catchments and functions such as the tixeront fu equation used in this study should be calculated with long term averages to guarantee the steady state condition here we used multi year moving average data and set the lengths of the moving windows as 11 15 and 31 according to suggestions in previous studies results showed that the mean values and slopes of m and runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m in different moving windows are similar in both the middle reaches of the yellow river basin and small catchments fig 11 and tables s1 s3 therefore the size of the moving window influences the amplitude of fluctuations in time series data rather than its long term trend some studies have also extended the budyko equation by incorporating water storage effects or other factors into the equation to make it available for non steady states chen et al 2013 greve et al 2016 tang et al 2017 these can be used in future sensitivity studies to better understand the links and feedback between climate factors catchment retention capacity and regional water yield at finer scales 5 conclusions based on the budyko equation this study proved the existence of temporal variations in runoff sensitivity identified factors other than long term average climate here mainly referring to land use cover change as the major contributor to runoff sensitivity variations and explored role of sensitivity variations in runoff change in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin for the last six decades the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pet and parameter m ε m increased significantly with similar change rates this higher sensitivity was mainly caused by change in m followed by precipitation p and lastly potential evapotranspiration pet land use cover change resulting from large ecological projects such as grain for green and conservation of water and soil was the possible reason for the change in m sensitivity variation also influenced about a fifth of the proportional runoff decline between the baseline period and the post baseline period applying runoff sensitivity of the two periods to runoff attribution analysis with elasticity based method separately relative changes in the contributions of p pet and m on

4378,with great changes such as climate and land use cover occurring in hydrological processes over the last decades runoff sensitivity here defined as proportional changes in runoff caused by a given proportional change in its driving factors including precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and parameter m has also been changing over time however few studies have focused on this sensitivity change and runoff sensitivity is always considered to be constant in runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method in this study we attempt to examine the temporal variation of runoff sensitivity in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin china and quantify its effects on the changes in runoff so that the existing attribution method can be improved we found that runoff sensitivity showed statistically significant trend and runoff became more sensitive to changes in long term average p pet and m parameter m largely affected by land use cover change resulting from large scale ecological projects was the major contributor to change in runoff sensitivity followed by p and lastly pet runoff sensitivity variation contributed approximately 20 to the proportional runoff change and by allowing runoff sensitivity to change over time relative contributions of p pet and m to runoff would range from 5 05 to 9 94 our study supplements research focusing on hydrological changes and interactions and we suggest that temporal variation in runoff sensitivity should be considered when quantifying the impacts of driving factors on changes in hydrological processes keywords budyko elasticity attribution analysis loess plateau 1 introduction runoff sensitivity refers to the runoff response to a change in its driving factors such as climate and land use cover and it varies in different conditions berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 harman et al 2011 nêmec and schaake 1982 roderick and farquhar 2011 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 for example with an assumption that all driving factors other than precipitation such as temperature and land use cover remain constant the same percentage increase in precipitation in arid regions causes a smaller percentage increase in runoff than it would in humid regions also the replacement of trees or shrubs with crops or grasses would lead to increasing runoff because of reduced evapotranspiration roderick and farquhar 2011 lots of studies have demonstrated these spatial disparities of runoff sensitivity on both regional and global scales and related these disparities with changes in aridity or land use cover berghuijs et al 2017 donohue et al 2011 hua et al 2013 sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 silberstein et al 2012 sinha et al 2020 tang and lettenmaier 2012 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 however temporal change of runoff sensitivity gets less attention berghuijs and woods 2016 fan et al 2017 considering the existence of space time symmetry in water balance which means that the spatial between catchment variability of mean annual water balances matches the corresponding temporal inter annual variability of individual catchments berghuijs and woods 2016 carmona et al 2014 singh et al 2011 sivapalan et al 2011 it is likely that runoff sensitivity would change over time in the same way as other hydrological processes e g runoff trends especially in the context of global warming and intensive land use cover change jaramillo and destouni 2015 labat et al 2004 piao et al 2007 yang et al 2018b however runoff sensitivity has been regarded as constant in the elasticity based method used in hydrological attribution analysis gao et al 2016 hongxing et al 2009 li et al 2012 2007 liang et al 2015 sinha et al 2020 wang 2014 wu et al 2016 2017 xu et al 2014 2013 zhang et al 2008 2011 these kinds of analyses focus on hydrological changes such as decreases or increases in runoff between two periods baseline period and post baseline period and this change is usually attributed to climate and human activities such as land use cover change taking precipitation as an example a general framework for distinguishing the contribution of certain factors to runoff change using the elasticity method is as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 sinha et al 2020 1 δ r p ε p r p δ p where r and p are the average annual runoff and precipitation respectively across the whole study period and δ p and δ r p are the precipitation change and precipitation introduced runoff change between the baseline and post baseline periods ε p represents runoff elasticity to the precipitation in the entire study period and is defined as the proportional change in average annual runoff for a given proportional change in average annual precipitation 2 ε p r r p p this concept was first proposed by schaake 1990 in hydrology and has been widely used for describing runoff sensitivity because it allows variables with different physical meanings to be compared berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 2017 harman et al 2011 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2016b based on the inference mentioned above whereby runoff sensitivity might change over time in a changing environment the use of invariant runoff elasticity in an attribution analysis of where hydrological processes have been changing clearly warrants more careful consideration the objectives of this study are therefore 1 to examine temporal variations in runoff sensitivity and 2 to analyze to what extent these sensitivity variations would influence runoff and runoff attribution analysis by allowing elasticity to change over time in order to do this sensitivity estimation is necessary and various methods have been developed to calculate runoff sensitivity these methods can be classified into three categories 1 inputting different values into a well calibrated hydrological model to obtain the resulting runoff change arora 2002 silberstein et al 2012 tang and lettenmaier 2012 2 analytical derivation from a linear or nonlinear equations donohue et al 2011 tang and lettenmaier 2012 and 3 nonparametric estimation from a statistical description such as median value over time of the long term observations brikowski 2015 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 tang et al 2019 in these methods budyko equations are popular in sensitivity estimation and attribution analysis with an elasticity based method because of their structural simplicity and physical background compared with methods that use a hydrological model and statistical description respectively berghuijs et al 2020 2017 gan et al 2021 gudmundsson et al 2016 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang et al 2016a zhou et al 2015 budyko equations characterize the long term evapotranspiration fraction et p or runoff ratio r p of a large catchment at a steady state as a function of the aridity index ϕ and parameter m 3 et p 1 r p f ϕ m where ϕ is the ratio of annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation pet p m is a parameter and accounts for all other factors besides ϕ that might influence the partitioning of p into r and et these other factors expressed by m include both catchment properties e g topography soil texture and land use cover type and further climatic factors e g snow condition and climatic seasonal variability berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 ning et al 2017 2020 2019 roderick and farquhar 2011 yang et al 2007 therefore runoff sensitivity to changes in ϕ also p and pet respectively and m can be estimated based on the partial differential equations derived from budyko equations also the runoff sensitivity can then be used in attribution analysis with an elasticity based method for example based on budyko equations donohue et al 2011 and yang and yang 2011 estimated the spatial differences in runoff sensitivity in the murray darling basin in australia and 90 small catchments in the northern part of china respectively while zhou et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 and berghuijs et al 2017 conducted global assessments of the sensitivity of water availability indicated by r or r p to climate indicated by ϕ p or pet and other factors indicated by m liang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 and sinha et al 2020 also quantified the relative effects of climate and other factors on runoff variability in some catchments across china and india and associated changes in the other factors in budyko equations with human activities such as ecological restoration ning et al considered other factors as interactions among vegetation climate and topography and disentangled m from vegetation coverage climate seasonality the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and relative basin relief at different time scale from annual to 30 year period ning et al 2017 2020 2019 gan et al 2021 demonstrated the great importance of vegetation to water balance within the budyko equations by highlighting effects of land cover type effective rooting depth vegetation coverage and dependence of vegetation to climate there are also lots of research aimed to make the budyko equations extend from long term water balance model to daily monthly scale from steady state to non steady state condition with changes in shallow groundwater and water storage and from natural processes to coupled human nature system including irrigation and human water consumption chen et al 2020 mianabadi et al 2020 sankarasubramanian et al 2020 yao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 here we use budyko equations to estimate runoff sensitivity to its drivers and this study is organized as follows first temporal changes in variables in the budyko equations r p pet and m are detected to show the changing environment and thus the necessity of sensitivity variation analysis section 3 1 next we calculate runoff sensitivity to p pet and m expressed by ε p ε pet and ε m respectively over time and test their trends section 3 2 then the study period is divided into two parts through breakpoint analysis we quantify the respective effects of p pet and m on the respective changes in ε p ε pet and ε m between two periods section 3 3 and estimate the sum effects of runoff sensitivity variation ε p ε pet and ε m on the proportional change in r section 3 4 finally uncertainty surrounding the runoff attribution analysis with the elasticity based method is estimated by taking the temporal variation of runoff sensitivity into consideration section 3 5 2 methods 2 1 study area we chose 16 small catchments in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin china fig 1 as the study area because changes in climate and land use cover there make it likely that runoff sensitivity has changed 1 the climate here has been warmer and drier over time and runoff has clearly been decreasing since 1950s fu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 and 2 there has been a great change in land use cover in recent decades including an increase in grassland forestland and buildings and a decrease in unused land and farmland fu and chen 2000 wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 furthermore because the regions has suffered from severe soil erosion fu et al 2011 the portion of the area subject to soil and water conservation measures terraces check dams small reservoirs and afforestation increased from 3 06 in 1969 to 51 36 in 2012 wang 2002 yrcc 1990 2012 2 2 data sources and processing long term climate and runoff data were used in this study the catchment boundary and drainage area were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for 1956 to 2016 were derived from the daily meteorological data china meteorological data service center http data cma cn at 99 meteorological stations fig 1 daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated via the penman monteith equation from maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed atmospheric pressure relative humidity and duration of sunshine details available in allen et al 1998 a digital elevation model of the study area international scientific data service platform http datamirror csdb cn the anusplin interpolation tool hutchinson and xu 2013 and the arcmap 10 2 clip tool were used to calculate the annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration of each catchment and the entire region the annual streamflow data from 18 gauging stations fig 1 table 1 were also obtained from the yrcc the streamflow of the middle reaches is the difference between the observation data from the stations at the entrance and the outlet 2 3 trend test the trend significance of the long term variables including r p pet m ε p ε pet and ε m were tested using the non parametric mann kendall mk method in this study the mk test is often used in hydro meteorological time series and a statistical value z obtained from the mk test is used to indicate the level of significance gocic and trajkovic 2013 mann 1945 a slope of the trends was estimated using sen s method sen 1968 2 4 runoff sensitivity estimation here we used budyko equations to estimate runoff sensitivity and two of the more widely used equations are the turc mezentsev mezentsev 1955 turc 1954 and tixeront fu fu 1996 tixeront 1964 formulas andréassian et al 2016 andréassian and sari 2019 here we chose the tixeront fu equation to calculate runoff sensitivity due to its more general partial differential expressions compared with the turc mezentsev formulas andréassian and sari 2019 and it is expressed as 4 f φ m 1 φ 1 φ m 1 m then the first derivative of f φ m with respect to ϕ f φ and m f m is written as follows 5 f φ 1 φ m 1 1 φ m 1 m 1 6 f m 1 φ m 1 m ln 1 φ m m 2 φ m 1 φ m 1 m 1 ln φ m combining eqs 2 and 3 runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m can be expressed respectively as follows 7 ε p r r p p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ m 8 ε pet r r p e t p e t ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ m 9 ε m r r m m m f m 1 f ϕ m therefore ε p ε pet and ε m can finally be calculated based on the values of r p and pet according to eqs 7 9 ε p is a positive value an increase in p increases r ε pet and ε m are negative values increases in pet and m decrease r and the sum of ε p and ε pet always equals 1 larger absolute values of ε p ε pet and ε m indicate greater proportional change in r for a given proportional change in p pet and m respectively that is to say r is more sensitive to p pet and m therefore in subsequent analysis we also used absolute values of ε pet and ε m ε pet and ε m to compare levels of runoff sensitivity to p pet and m more details about the derivation process can be seen in gao et al 2016 it is important to note that the application of budyko equations needs to satisfy an assumption that catchments should be under steady state conditions however it is difficult to measure changes in water storage existing studies have always used long term averages to represent steady state carmona et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 andréassian et al 2016 considered the long term averages of at least ten years and preferably three decades han et al 2020 showed that about 70 of the catchments attain a steady state within 10 years with a threshold of water storage change for a steady state setting to 5 of the mean monthly p in this study we used 15 year averages to attain a steady state and replaced data in the tth year with 15 year moving averages from the t 7th to t 7th years so that the steady state assumption can be satisfied and trends of variables in budyko equations can also be tested sections 3 1 and 3 2 2 5 scenario analysis a scenario analysis was used to calculate the respective effects of p pet and m on the respective changes in ε p ε pet and ε m section 3 3 and also the effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on proportional changes in r section 3 4 at first a non parametric pettitt method pettitt 1979 was used to detect the breakpoint of annual r and the significance level of the breakpoint table 1 based on this we divided the study period into two periods the baseline period and post baseline period and calculated the average values of r p pet and m of each period 2 5 1 estimation of effects of driving factors on changes in runoff sensitivity driving factors include p pet and m runoff sensitivity includes ε p ε pet and ε m to estimate the effects of p on changes in ε p between the two periods we 1 used average values of p pet and m in the baseline period p 1 pet 1 and m 1 to calculate ε p 1 based on eq 7 and 2 used the average value of p in the post baseline period p 2 as well as the average values of pet and m in the baseline period pet 1 and m 1 to calculate ε p 3 considered the absolute difference between ε p and ε p 1 as the contribution of p to changes in ε p from the baseline period to the post baseline period eq 10 repeating steps 1 3 respective contributions of pet and m to changes in ε p can be estimated eqs 11 12 we then 4 calculated the respective relative contributions of p pet and m to ε p as eqs 13 15 again when repeating steps 1 4 respective relative contributions of p pet and m to the respective changes in ε pet and ε m can also be estimated 10 con p t o ε p ε p p 2 pet

estimation of effect of runoff sensitivity on proportional runoff change because r is a function of p pet and m the proportional change in r can be expressed as gao et al 2016 16 δ r r ε p δ p p ε pet δ p e t pet ε m δ m m we first calculated the average values of ε p ε pet ε m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m at the baseline period and post baseline period to estimate the effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on relative changes in r δ r r between the two periods we 1 used the average values in the baseline period ε p 1 ε pet 1 ε m 1 δ p p 1 δ p e t pet 1 and δ m m 1 to calculate δ r r 1 based on eq 16 and 2 used the average values of ε p ε pet and ε m in the post baseline period ε p 2 ε pet 2 and ε m 2 and the average values of δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m in the baseline period δ p p 1 δ p e t pet 1 and δ m m 1 to calculate δ r r 3 we considered the absolute difference between δ r r and δ r r 1 as the contribution of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m to the proportional change in r δ r r from the baseline period to the post baseline period eq 17 repeating steps 1 3 the contribution of proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m to the change in r δ r r can be estimated eqs 18 we then 4 calculated the respective relative contributions of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m and the proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m to δ

uncertainty of scenario analysis the role of interaction among driving factors in runoff sensitivity or proportional runoff change was ignored in scenario analysis so validity of this method was evaluated by comparing a total sum of contribution of each driver to runoff sensitivity or to proportional runoff change between baseline period and post baseline period with b the difference of runoff sensitivity or proportional runoff change between the two periods which were directly calculated based on average values of each period the closer the a is to b the minor the role of interaction among driving factors is and thus the more convincing the scenario analysis is in this study a and b are roughly equal with an average relative error ratio of the difference between a and b to the value of b of 12 fig s4 2 6 uncertainty surrounding the runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method a runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method calculates the contribution of p pet and m to the change in r δ r between the baseline period and the post baseline period based on eq 16 the change in r caused by p δ r p is estimated as eq 1 and the changes in r caused by pet δ r pet and m δ r m are the same then the respective relative contributions of p rcon p t o r pet rcon p e t t o r and m rcon m t o r to r can be calculated for example as 21 rcon p t o r δ r p δ r p δ r pet δ r m more details about the attribution analysis are available in gao et al 2016 here we estimated the possible ranges of the relative contributions of p pet and m to the change in r rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r with attribution analysis by allowing runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m to change over time first we calculated two groups of ε p ε pet and ε m using data from baseline period and post baseline period respectively based on these two groups of ε p ε pet and ε m possible ranges of rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r can be obtained then we compared upper and lower limits of the possible ranges of rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r with their previous values calculated via eq 21 and this relative change is defined as the uncertainty surrounding in attribution analysis with an elasticity based method for instance the uncertainty range in rcon p t o r is expressed as 22 u n c e r t a i n t y rcon p t o r

in the budyko equation for 1956 2016 r and p decreased statistically significantly p 0 05 with rates of 0 87 mm yr and 1 35 mm yr respectively while pet showed a lack of trend fig 2 a c based on their 15 year moving average values we calculated the annual values of m as shown in fig 2d m values ranged from 2 92 to 3 78 with a statistically significant increase rate of 0 02 yr p 0 05 between 1963 and 2009 regarding small catchments the average annual values of r p pet and m had various spatial patterns and their annual values showed statistically significant trends p 0 05 in most areas fig 3 r had larger average values and reduction rates in the southernmost and northernmost catchments such as yiluo wei qin kuye and tuwei while the smallest average value was in fen in the middle catchments the average values of p and m both increased roughly from north to south but their trends and change rates differed p had a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in all catchments while m had a statistically significant increasing trend in all catchments except qingjian yan and beiluo and the decrease rates of p and increase rates of m in eastern catchments were larger than the west the average annual values of pet decreased from north to south except for yiluo in the south temporally it showed a statistically significant decreasing trend p 0 05 in the northernmost huangfu kuye and gushan and southernmost catchments qin and yiluo while in other catchments it had an increasing trend and increased statistically significantly p 0 05 in wei qingjian dali yan wuding jing and beiluo which are located in the west 3 2 temporal variation in runoff sensitivity our analysis showed diverse spatial patterns and temporal trends in runoff sensitivity to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pet and m ε m here we compared ε p with ε m and ε pet because ε m and ε pet have negative values i e increasing m and pet cause decreasing runoff note that ε pet ε p 1 eqs 7 and 8 in section 2 4 so they have the same trends and change rates in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin ε p was slightly larger than ε m with mean values of 3 14 and 2 90 respectively long term ε m and ε p both showed statistically significantly increasing trends p 0 05 with change rates of 0 02 yr and ranged from 2 43 to 3 35 and from 2 76 to 3 65 respectively fig 4 specifically the mean value of the long term ε m was larger than ε p in nine small catchments mostly located north of the middle reaches and smaller than ε p in seven catchments in the south fig 5 the difference between the average ε m and ε p of the catchments where ε m was larger than ε p ranged from 0 22 qin to 1 02 wuding while other catchments where ε m was smaller than ε p ranged from 0 02 yan to 0 82 xinshui moreover the mean value of ε m varied between 1 96 yiluo and 3 45 fen with larger values in north of the middle reaches whereas ε p varied between 1 84 tuwei and 3 92 fen with larger values in the south regarding the trends of ε m and ε p for the last six decades they both increased statistically significantly p 0 05 in all catchments except the north central catchments covering dali yan and beiluo where the p values of ε p trends were higher than 0 05 the largest and lowest statistically significant increase rates of ε p were approximately 0 027 yr in fen and 0 008 yr in wuding respectively while 0 033 yr in fen and 0 005 yr in yiluo respectively for ε m 3 3 effects of driving factors on changes in runoff sensitivity after identifying the breakpoints of the middle reaches and small catchments table 1 figs s1 and s2 we then analyzed the respective effects of p pet and m on respective changes in runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m between two periods through the scenario analysis see section 2 5 1 in the whole middle reaches the results showed that m was the main contributor to the changes in ε p and ε m from the baseline period to the post baseline period with a proportion of 93 99 and 52 88 respectively fig 6 for ε p in small catchments m contributed an average of 85 26 to its change while p and pet caused 10 82 and 3 92 respectively spatially the contribution of m was larger for the catchments in the north than those in the south while p and pet were the opposite for ε m average contributions of m p and pet to it were 47 13 39 09 and 13 87 respectively and their spatial patterns were similar to those for ε p in the north and south catchments in addition because the sum of ε pet and ε p was constant the respective effects of p pet and m on changes in ε pet were the same as those on ε p and they were ignored in fig 6 3 4 effect of runoff sensitivity on proportional runoff change here we identified the total effects of runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m on changes in proportional runoff change δ r r between two periods see section 2 5 2 as shown in fig 7 runoff sensitivity including ε p ε pet and ε m took up an average of 22 55 of the change in δ r r from the baseline period to the post baseline period with the exception of jing in all of the small catchments runoff sensitivity contributed less than half to changes in δ r r ranging from 3 93 to 38 58 effects of proportional changes in p pet and m δ p p δ p e t pet and δ m m on the change in δ r r were larger and these effects referred to the direct effects of p pet and m on δ r r rather than the indirect effects that p pet and m influence r through the change in runoff sensitivity 3 5 uncertainty of runoff attribution analysis with the consideration of sensitivity variation given the small but indispensable effect of runoff sensitivity on changes in δ r r we estimated uncertainty of the runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method which considers runoff sensitivity as constants according to the method in section 2 6 possible relative changes in runoff attribution results relative contributions of p pet and m to the change in r namely rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r were illustrated in fig 8 in small catchments relative change range of rcon p e t t o r was greater than rcon p t o r followed by rcon m t o r with an average proportion of 24 24 17 08 and 5 11 respectively the pattern of the relative change in rcon p t o r was similar to that of rcon p e t t o r they had a wider range in the north and south catchments but a narrower one in the central parts for rcon m t o r its prop change range was wider in the south catchments than the north considering the direction of the relative change the positive amplitudes of rcon p t o r and rcon p e t t o r were larger than the negative in most of the catchments but rcon m t o r was the opposite there were a number of exceptions such as in jialu qin qingjian yan and beiluo where the positive amplitude of rcon m t o r was wider or the negative amplitudes of rcon p t o r and rcon p e t t o r were narrower for the entire middle reaches temporal variation of runoff sensitivity caused relative changes in rcon p t o r rcon p e t t o r and rcon m t o r varying from 5 05 to 9 41 from 4 75 to 9 94 and from 5 02 to 2 68 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 theoretical causes for runoff sensitivity variation based on budyko equations according to the theoretical curves of runoff sensitivity which can be derived from budyko equations berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m are greater in areas with a drier climate pet p and larger m in terms of ε m both m and pet p affect it but ε p and ε pet are more sensitive to m rather than pet p therefore in this study decreasing p drier climate and increasing m caused increases in ε p ε pet and ε m together and m was the major contributing factor fig 6 it contributed 93 99 to the increases in ε p and ε pet and 52 88 to ε m p took up 43 61 of the change in ε m while pet had little effect on runoff sensitivity in the study area due to its lack of trend within the study period fig 2 spatially the north catchments had drier climates pet p and smaller m than the south fig 3 reducing difference in ε m between the north and south catchments however ε p and ε pet were predominantly affected by m so ε p and ε pet were smaller in the north catchments than in the south as a result ε m was larger than ε p in the north catchments and the opposite in the south fig 5 moreover the effects of p and pet on the changes in runoff sensitivity were smaller in the north catchments than in the south because of their varied climate fig 6 the aforementioned results derived from budyko equations were consistent with earlier research based on empirical evidence padrón et al 2017 concluded from a systematic review and meta analysis that apart from pet p other factors also indicated by m explained at least 35 of the et p change and up to about 90 in arid regions therefore m greatly influences runoff especially in arid climates other global synthetic studies have found that climate variability and forest cover change play an equal role in annual water yield variations but r is less sensitive to climate change in drier catchments than in wetter catchments li et al 2017 4 2 potential causes for temporal variation in runoff sensitivity in this study the parameter m is an important factor in runoff sensitivity and there are lots of physical explanations for it in general m accounts for all factors except for long term average pet p that might influence the partitioning of p into r and et and a larger m means more p would be converted to et the physical factors involved both catchment properties e g topography soil texture and land use cover type and further climatic factors e g snow condition and climatic seasonal variability berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2016 ning et al 2019 roderick and farquhar 2011 yang et al 2018a also described m as the water retention properties of catchments and regarded it as a function of vegetation soil and topography yang et al 2007 proposed an empirical formula for m estimation with a calibration from the long term observations in 108 non humid catchments within and near the yellow river basin the formula includes landscape parameters including relative infiltration capacity relative soil water storage and the average slope and here we analyzed the potential causes for increases in m from this perspective infiltration capacity is measured by saturated hydraulic conductivity while soil water storage is determined by plant extractable water capacity on a decade scale the most likely drivers for the changes in the above mentioned soil physical properties may be land use cover change since 1999 the grain for green programme ggp has converted 16 000 km2 of rain fed cropland in the loess plateau mostly located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin to vegetation with vegetation cover increasing at a rate of 25 over the last decade feng et al 2016 in addition soil in forests or shrub land has a higher infiltration capacity and water storage capacity than that in farmland because of the litter layer and deeper roots moreover the conservation of water and soil ecological engineering cwsee project was also launched in this area in the 1960s and the cumulative area of soil and water conservation such as terraces check dams and small reservoirs has been increasing rapidly since the 1970s gao et al 2016 liang et al 2015 these measures reduced the slope of landscape and increased water infiltration and retention wang 2002 estimated that on average about 1 85 mm yr 1 of water was retained by these measures between 1960 and 2000 in the loess plateau liang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 also found that m is significantly correlated with the percentage of an area affected by soil and water conservation measures in most of this region in addition increasing water withdrawal from rivers may also increase m by directly reducing runoff wang et al 2019 as mentioned in previous paragraph land use cover change maybe the major reason for the change in m given the important role of m in runoff sensitivity variation relationship between land use cover and runoff sensitivity was discussed in this section as shown in figs 9 and 10 both vegetation coverage and area of ecological measures are statistically significantly correlated with ε p and ε m in most of the catchments however number of catchments with significant correlation between vegetation coverage and ε p is larger than that with significant correlation between vegetation coverage and ε m while area of ecological measures is significantly correlated with ε m in more catchments than that with ε p this contradiction maybe resulted from the inconsistent time series of vegetation coverage and ecological measures so more long and reliable data set or technique should be developed and used for quantifying interaction among the complex hydrological processes in terms of climate factors p showed a statistically significant decreasing trend while changes in pet were not apparent with global warming this is unexpected due to the close correlation between pet and temperature however the penman monteith pet estimated model also depends on wind speed relative humidity and other variables and we found that the increasing temperature was offset by decreasing wind speeds and sunshine duration while relative humidity had no significant trend fig s3 see also in yin et al 2010a 2010b 4 3 implication and limitations of this study this study focuses on temporal variation in runoff sensitivity and supplements research on hydrological change it has been acknowledged that the hydrological process on both global and regional scales has changed greatly in the last century durack and matear 2012 gedney et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 previous studies have realized the great importance of this change and explored it with the perspectives of the hydro meteorological variables trends water regime shift and the effects of driving factors on water availability change jaramillo and destouni 2014 liang et al 2015 wu et al 2016 as a supplement our study which took the middle reaches of the yellow river basin as a case study proved the existence of temporal increase in runoff sensitivity and found that runoff sensitivity change affected about one fifth of the proportional runoff change since these effects of runoff sensitivity have been ignored in previous runoff attribution analysis with an elasticity based method which considered runoff sensitivity to be constants we considered it and estimated uncertainty of previous attribution method gao et al 2016 sinha et al 2020 therefore more attention should be paid to hydrological sensitivity variation and effects of sensitivity variation on change in runoff especially in regions where significant transformations have taken place in recent decades tang et al 2019 the budyko equation was the basis of this study its applicability to the study area and the calculation of parameter m in the function were important to support the rationality of our findings the budyko equation has been widely used in previous studies on both regional and global scales annual runoff projections using the budyko equation and the physical based hydrological model agreed with each other fernandez and sayama 2015 yang et al 2018a the equation has proven to be an effective tool for exploring hydrological processes in particular the impacts of climate factors and catchment characteristics on water balance wang et al 2016a however it was developed for steady states in large catchments and functions such as the tixeront fu equation used in this study should be calculated with long term averages to guarantee the steady state condition here we used multi year moving average data and set the lengths of the moving windows as 11 15 and 31 according to suggestions in previous studies results showed that the mean values and slopes of m and runoff sensitivity ε p ε pet and ε m in different moving windows are similar in both the middle reaches of the yellow river basin and small catchments fig 11 and tables s1 s3 therefore the size of the moving window influences the amplitude of fluctuations in time series data rather than its long term trend some studies have also extended the budyko equation by incorporating water storage effects or other factors into the equation to make it available for non steady states chen et al 2013 greve et al 2016 tang et al 2017 these can be used in future sensitivity studies to better understand the links and feedback between climate factors catchment retention capacity and regional water yield at finer scales 5 conclusions based on the budyko equation this study proved the existence of temporal variations in runoff sensitivity identified factors other than long term average climate here mainly referring to land use cover change as the major contributor to runoff sensitivity variations and explored role of sensitivity variations in runoff change in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin for the last six decades the sensitivity of runoff to precipitation ε p potential evapotranspiration ε pet and parameter m ε m increased significantly with similar change rates this higher sensitivity was mainly caused by change in m followed by precipitation p and lastly potential evapotranspiration pet land use cover change resulting from large ecological projects such as grain for green and conservation of water and soil was the possible reason for the change in m sensitivity variation also influenced about a fifth of the proportional runoff decline between the baseline period and the post baseline period applying runoff sensitivity of the two periods to runoff attribution analysis with elasticity based method separately relative changes in the contributions of p pet and m on changes in r ranged from 5 05 to 9 94 this study highlights the temporal variation of runoff sensitivity along with land use cover and climate change and influence of sensitivity variation on runoff and runoff attribution analysis with the elasticity based method which are all critical for better understanding hydrological regime changes and catchment management credit author statement yaping

4379,due to climate change and urbanization urban flood modelling has become an increasingly important tool in assessing flooding and associated damage costs however large computational demands of state of the art hydrodynamic flood models makes multiple and real time simulations unfeasible this study presents a fast dynamic gis based flood model floodstroem floodstroem generates a surface network of depressions bluespots and flow paths and routes surcharged water from a subsurface drainage model through the network resulting in flood depth maps and associated damage costs floodstroem is tested on three sub catchments in elster creek catchment melbourne australia and benchmarked against the 2d distributed hydrodynamic model mike 21 and two other simplified models rufidam and ca ffé floodstroem is robust to the number of bluespots included for the three sub catchments floodstroem can reproduce flooding time pattern depth and damage costs sufficiently but has a tendency to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream performance is best for the large steep sub catchments and largest rainstorms where floodstroem performs better than the two other simplified models the critical success index csi ranges from 23 for a 5 year storm event in a flat catchment to 65 for a 100 year return period for a steeper catchment with respect to simulation time floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the 2d hydrodynamic model and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time which has potential for further reduction by optimization of the workflow keywords flood risk hydraulic modelling surrogate models computational time surface network 1 introduction urban pluvial flood risk is expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change and urbanization ipcc 2014 zhou et al 2012 to mitigate this risk resilience of urban water infrastructure can be enhanced through implementation of various adaptation measures to obtain an optimal adaptation strategy flood models are used as an essential tool to evaluate current and future flood levels as well as the associated economic consequences urban pluvial flooding is often caused by exceedance of drainage capacity in the storm water sewer system leading to surcharging from here water spreads across the terrain along preferential flow paths such as roads pathways etc to local depressions often denoted bluespots if the drainage capacity allows runoff will re enter the drainage system where manhole inlets are present this process known as the dual drainage concept djordjević et al 2005 1999 is modelled in many ways in urban flood models state of the art flood models consists of a 1d distributed drainage model using saint venant equations and a 2d distributed surface overland flow model using shallow water equations with dynamical coupling at relevant manholes henceforth we will denote these models 1d and 2d models and models with dynamical coupling 1d 2d models examples of 1d 2d models are mike flood sobek xpswmm and tuflow teng et al 2017 flood models are commonly applied in strategic planning to test a range of climate and city development scenarios possibly with the implementation of different adaptation measures this requires multiple scenario simulations and therefore fast and accurate flood models warning and control measures might also be implemented to reduce flooding costs requiring flood models that are able to run faster than real time however 1d 2d flood models have large computational demands due to the high level of detail included i e high resolution elevation data and number of physical processes teng et al 2017 the high computational time makes this model type unfit for large areas cases where multiple simulations are needed and or where the time for running the simulation is limited to cope with these limitations many efforts have been made to reduce the computational time as pointed out in jamali et al 2018 these include i optimized usage of computational resources parallel processing multicore simulations or external computing with remote computers or cloud computation burger et al 2014 glenis et al 2013 neal et al 2010 yu 2010 ii reduction of details included reducing spatial and or temporal resolution by using e g bigger simulation time steps lower resolution of the topographic input data cook and merwade 2009 fewtrell et al 2008 savage et al 2016 or simplified model networks davidsen et al 2017 leitão et al 2010 iii model simplification replacing the model with a simpler model i e surrogate model with either a simpler mechanistic i e physically based model structure complexity by e g neglecting model terms bates et al 2010 fewtrell et al 2011 or replacing the model with simpler flood spreading routines the latter can be applied on a cell by cell level with cellular automata guidolin et al 2016 jamali et al 2019 or between grouped areas e g local depressions and impact zones as applied in different rapid flood spreading methods rfsms balstrøm and crawford 2018 jamali et al 2018 maksimović et al 2009 reduction in computational time may be achieved by one or a combination of the above mentioned methods however i might not be manageable for all model users if computer resources are unavailable and therefore ii or iii can be applied for multiple fast simulations the time reduction achieved with ii might be insufficient therefore iii has gained a lot of attention current simple pluvial flood models are however typically static such as rufidam and ca ffé jamali et al 2019 2018 this means that they disregard the temporal evolution of flooding only predicting a snapshot of maximum inundation depths and with a unidirectional flow option from the drainage system to the surface when including the temporal evolution of flooding in a simplified model we expect a better representation of overland flow processes which would lead to more accurate flood inundation modelling while still ensuring a low computational time additionally it provides the potential for bi directional flow exchange between underground and surface systems whereby it in principle will be able also to construct a simplified 1d 2d model by coupling it to a simplified 1d model in this study we develop and benchmark a novel fast dynamic urban pluvial flood and damage assessment model denoted floodstroem floodstroem is a surrogate mechanistic model which therefore requires no calibration and provides a dynamic simulation environment producing the temporal evolution of flooding we wish to investigate floodstroem s ability to emulate the overland flow processes and hence we focus on a setup where distributed dynamic input in the form of water flows appear on the overland surface in the example we apply a unidirectional input from surcharging manholes generated by a 1d model this allows floodstroem to be benchmarked against a 2d model as well as the simplified static flood models rufidam and ca ffé presented in jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 the novelty of this approach is that floodstroem allows for dynamic routing of the water on the surface hence the temporal evolution of flooding can be described and water levels both in bluespots and flow paths can be visualised which is not included in the simple static models 2 methods 2 1 floodstroem model description floodstroem is divided into five sub model components m1 m5 see fig 1 m1 delivers distributed time series of flows within the catchment e g generated by spilling from a 1d model m2 generates the surface flow network from the digital elevation model dem m3 routes the flow inputs from m1 through the surface network generated in m2 by a mechanistic dynamic surrogate model m4 converts the flows and volumes from m3 to two dimensional flood maps m5 computes damage costs based on the flood maps from m4 unlike many other simplified flood models floodstroem is dependent only on catchment characteristics not on output from a hydrodynamic model computer code for the entire floodstroem workflow is available from thrysøe 2021 the following sections provide a detailed description of each module 2 1 1 m1 dynamic distributed input this module produces distributed time series of flow inputs throughout the catchment for the purposes of the validation of the model we employ a 1d drainage network model to produce time series of surcharging from the subsurface sewer system we employ mike urban dhi 2014a for this purpose first the mike urban rainfall runoff generation simulates the hydrologic load serving as an input to the pipe network secondly flow is simulated in the pipe network using 1d saint venant equations from the drainage network water can surcharge to the surface if capacity is exceeded these surcharge hydrographs serve as an input to module m3 and are extracted from the results in this process all manholes are set to spilling which means that water can spill to the surface but it cannot re enter the drainage system this setting is chosen over ponding as it was found in jamali et al 2018 to be the most realistic representation in principle this module may be exchanged with any other spatial generation of flows over the catchment it could also be exchanged with a drainage surrogate model as described in thrysøe et al 2019 which would enable development of a model that could dynamically emulate a full 1d 2d model we refrain from this in the current paper to focus on the ability of floodstroem to emulate two dimensional overland flows 2 1 2 m2 flow network generation the surface flow network is generated by the open source software arc malstroem developed by balstrøm and crawford 2018 based on esri s arcgis desktop 10 6 from a digital elevation model dem this program identifies local bluespot watersheds pour points and downstream flow paths a bluespot pour point is defined as the point location where spill over from the bluespot occurs when its capacity is exceeded arc malstroem provides a built in threshold bst option excluding bluespots below a certain volume and or depth threshold to reduce the number of model elements fig 2 a shows an example of an arc malstroem output for each bluespot a corresponding pour point is shown from here a flow path leads to the next downstream bluespot the watersheds include any upstream flow paths to the bluespot as illustrated fig 2 c shows a cross section of the two bluespots bs in series bsn and bsn 1 arc malstroem does not allow for multiple pour points i e multiple spill over points from a given bluespot or diverging flows as the data model is based on a geometric network moreover arc malstroem does not consider the filling order of any sub bluespots small bluespots within a larger bluespot like seen for e g bsn 1 thus these are simply merged into one large bluespot when the arc malstroem component is completed additional flow paths from each of the points where time series of water discharges entering the model are identified using arcgis desktop as shown in fig 2 b these locations are identified in m1 and linked to the surface flow network hereafter arc malstroem is re computed with artificial boundaries around each watershed of height h added to the dem the height is user defined as described in section 2 2 3 this provides bluespot extents when the water level is h above the pour points as seen in fig 2 b c this process allows water to accumulate above the pour point level causing the horizontal extent of the bluespot to expand within the watershed as seen in fig 2 b c to describe the volume depth extent relationship of the extended bluespots the bluespot depth raster is sliced into compartments of constant height as seen in fig 2 c to eliminate volume errors along the fringes of the bluespot s extent at various water levels the volume is calculated as the bluespot s horizontal extent at ½ the compartment height times the compartment height resulting in the marked volume areas this information is used for determining the water level above a pour point at a given volume to calculate the discharge from a bluespot and for visualizing its extent at different filled levels see sections 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 2 1 3 m3 dynamic mechanistic modelling of surface flows the surcharge hydrographs from m1 are assigned to the flow network fig 2b volumes in watersheds are modelled by in and outgoing discharges consisting of the spilling surcharge from m1 and upstream and downstream surface flows between the watersheds as shown in fig 3 water is moved instantaneously between watersheds this means that as soon as water leaves a bluespot it is accounted for in the volume of the downstream watershed this also means that the transportation time between bluespots is disregarded but the filling time of a bluespot remains included the discharge from one watershed to another is calculated using volume outflow curves first water levels above pour point level are derived from the slices shown in fig 2 c for a range of different volumes for each bluespot hereafter corresponding discharges at the different water levels are found using the kinematic wave equation where the average slope of each flow path is extracted from arcgis and a global manning roughness coefficient and a fixed width is assumed as described in section 2 2 3 resulting volume discharge curves are saved in a parameter file used in the dynamic simulation in m3 a model engine takes the input from m1 and routes it through the watershed by means of piecewise linear interpolation of the volume outflow curves the model engine applied is presented in borup et al 2017 and thrysøe et al 2019 for access to the model engine s source code see borup 2018 2 1 4 m4 conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps in this model component the volume within each watershed and discharge along connecting flow paths found in m3 are translated into water levels in bluespots and flow paths as outlined below 2 1 5 water level in bluespots as the bluespots are determined from a search for landscape depressions and their maximum extents when filled at capacity before spilling over i e having reached their maximum volumes it is necessary to estimate the individual bluespots levels and reduced extents if they happen to be partly filled for this the water level volume extent relationships created from the slices from fig 2 c is applied the slice with the aggregated volume corresponding to the volume outcome from m3 is identified for each bluespot as the bluespot s horizontal extent at the specific filled level hereafter the water level from the vertical datum is subtracted from the dem to determine the water level 2 1 6 flood propagation along flow paths the method for calculating water levels along flow paths is described in this section first discharges between bluespots from module m3 are calculated to the water levels in flow paths using the kinematic wave equation this is done every time flow paths merge either from bluespots or from manholes the water levels are now used to identify the flood propagation along each flow path this is carried out in the steps shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a the original flow path containing information on the water level is smoothed and divided into smaller segments and for each of them a buffer is created if the flow path was not smoothened overlaps and gaps will occur between the buffers however this still occurs at flow path junctions and sharp curves and here mean values are applied at overlaps at gaps flooding is cut off the buffer width is determined by the water level in the flow path so a larger water level results in a wider buffer the flow path segment s water level and mean terrain elevation values are added and transferred as attributes to the buffer in fig 4 b this is subtracted from the filled dem in the buffer area not including potential flooding outside the buffer zone which is cut off in fig 4 c all adjacent flooded areas are connected and flooded areas not connected to the flow path are eliminated 2 1 7 m5 damage assessment floodstroem applies the stage depth curve damage curve method in which the damage cost is a function of flood depth and area m4 produces a raster flood map containing water depth pixels which is overlaid with building and road layers hereafter stage depth damage curves are applied to calculate the direct tangible flood damages the stage damage curves are identified from a recent literature review olesen et al 2017 this approach includes three types of land uses 1 residential buildings 2 commercial and industrial buildings and 3 road areas table 1 shows the different thresholds and damage costs applied for the different structural elements within the catchments we applied this simple approach since more detailed damage curves were not available for australia moreover the same approach and data were used in jamali et al 2018 so results are directly comparable 2 2 model testing and application 2 2 1 models used for comparison and benchmarking floodstroem is benchmarked against the 2d model mike21 dhi 2016 mike21 is a surface flood model and in this study it is computed similarly to floodstroem i e with input spilling surcharge from a 1d mike urban drainage model the 1d 2d model mike flood dhi 2014b which couples mike urban and mike21 dynamically is not used as a benchmark model as we wished to evaluate floodstroem surface flow processes ignoring the dynamic couplings in a 1d 2d model setup the 2d model results will be considered the truth in this study and all other models are benchmarked to its results note that floodstroem is not calibrated to the results of the 2d model which is only used for benchmarking purposes table 2 shows an overview of all models compared in this study and their properties besides the 2d model we also compare to the simplified models rufidam and ca ffé jamali et al 2019 2018 arc malstroem is also shown as floodstroem incorporates a part of this model in m1 the 1d 2d model is included as well as it is used for overall damage costs comparison together with the 2d model arc malstroem rufidam and floodstroem are all considered one dimensional models as they route water along preferred pathways even though they can visualize two dimensional results and rufidam can spill to two multiple neighbouring watersheds denoted impact zones in jamali et al 2018 mike flood and mike21 both apply the full shallow water equations for modelling surface flows while floodstroem only applies a kinematic wave arc malstroem rufidam and ca ffé does not consider conservation of momentum only volume conservation mike flood mike21 and ca ffé contain a high number of model elements whereas arc malstroem rufidam and floodstroem all apply watersheds as computational nodes which upfront reduces computational time as the number of elements included in the model is substantially reduced mike flood is the only model including a dynamic exchange between the drainage system 1d and the surface 2d where the remaining models are pure surface models the simplified models arc malstroem rufidam and ca ffé only consider total volume input whereas the hydrodynamic models and floodstroem consider a temporal dynamic input thereby enabling simulation of the temporal evolution of the water levels this means that floodstroem is the only simplified model able to produce the temporal dynamics of the water level as well as calculating maximum water levels in both bluespots and along flow paths 2 2 2 case study area floodstroem is tested using three sub catchments sc sc1 sc2 and sc3 fig 5 which were also applied in jamali et al 2018 the three scs have been selected to cover different typical urban catchment characteristics i e flat steep upstream coastal large small all sub catchments are located within the elster creek catchment melbourne australia which has been subject to frequent pluvial and tidal flooding the area mainly consists of residential buildings including a small proportion of commercial and industrial buildings olesen et al 2017 all three sub catchments differ in size and slope as seen in fig 5 sc1 is the smallest of the three sub catchments covering an area of approximately 78 ha with an average surface slope of 4 the hydrodynamic model for this sub catchment contains 189 manholes sc2 is the largest sub catchment covering an area of approximately 987 ha with an average surface slope of 5 the hydrodynamic model contains 1329 manholes sc3 covers an area of 760 ha with an average surface slope of 6 even though the average slope of this sub catchment is the highest it contains a large flat area located near the shore and the 1d 2d model simulations indicate that there are substantial backwater effects in this sub catchment the sc3 sub catchment contain 1228 manholes the hydrodynamic model mike flood for the entire area covering the sub catchments is discussed in detail in davidsen et al 2017 the terrain model is a lidar digital elevation model raster with a horizontal resolution of 1 by 1 m the built in volume threshold in arc malstroem is varied to evaluate the optimal number of bluespots in the surface network see section 2 2 5 2 2 3 model input data and parameters three chicago design storms cds rain events with the return periods t 5 10 and 100 years were used as input to floodstroem in module m1 to test it against the 2d model and the other simplified models presented in table 2 these rain events are selected to cover different flood intensities and because they have been used previously for this catchment jamali et al 2018 thereby allowing direct comparison a global manning roughness coefficient of 0 04 s m 1 3 and a fixed flow path width of 10 m is applied for calculating the discharge from bluespots in all three sub catchments the manning coefficient is selected to be identical to the one used in the 2d model and the fixed width is determined by the average road width for the buffers described in section 2 1 4 the buffer widths are set to 10 30 35 50 and 100 m for water levels above 0 05 0 19 0 30 0 60 and 0 85 m respectively these water levels were found by trial and error to cover most of the simulated floodstroem flood results while avoiding significant overlapping at junctions buffers were created every third meter a depth bluespot threshold of 0 1 m is applied in computing arc malstroem excluding all bluespots with depths smaller than this threshold in the surface network generated besides different volume bluespot thresholds are tested to assess the influence of number of bluespots in the model see section 2 2 5 the watershed border applied is set to 1 m 2 2 4 performance indicators cell based performance indicators are used to evaluate floodstroem performance against the 2d model both in terms of flood depth and damage costs four model performance indicators are selected from bennett et al 2013 and shown in eqs 1 4 these include 1 hit rate hr 2 false alarm rate far 3 critical success index csi and 4 root mean square error rmse a cell is set to flooded if the water level is more than 5 cm this threshold is commonly used kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 hit rate represents the percentage of flooded cells that are flooded in both models false alarm rate represents the percentage of cells flooded in the simplified model but dry in the benchmark model hr ignores false alarms while far ignores misses csi combines hr and far as it includes both misses and false alarms and is the percentage of cells correctly predicted by the simplified model the indicators hr far and csi only focuses on the area of the flooding from the given flood threshold value and not flood depth accuracy for this we include rmse and only include cells flooded in both models 1 hr hits hits misses 100 2 far false alarms hits false alarms 100 3 csi hits hits misses false alarms 100 4 rmse i 1 n y i c y i t 2 n where yc are the floodstroem water levels yt are the mike21 values and n is the number of flooded cells to supplement the cell based indicators comparison based on aggregated catchment damage costs are also reported according to the calculations outlined in section 2 1 5 2 2 5 determining optimal model resolution six different model configurations are tested with varying number of bluespots included to find the optimal model resolution and examine floodstroem s sensitivity to number of bluespots included in the model 3 results 3 1 computational time the main driver for developing the surrogate model is to reduce the computational cost computational time reported for floodstroem and the 2d model mike 21 is presented in fig 6 for sc3 for a cds storm with a return period of t 100 years for comparison computational time for mike flood is also reported the simulation time is divided into the different modelling steps m1 simulation of 1d drainage model m2 generation of flow network m3 dynamic mechanistic modelling of surface flows m4 conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps and m5 damage assessment the drainage simulation and assigning the input to floodstroem in step m1 accounts for approximately 25 based on the needed simulation time of the 1d model the computational time for the 2d mike 21 and 1d 2d mike flood models consists of pure simulation time of the flows in the drainage system and on the surface hence the setup of the models is not included this is however included in the total computational time reported for floodstroem where it m2 represents approximately 60 of the total computational time this mainly consists of creating the volume depth description of each bluespots as illustrated in fig 2 c this module only has to be executed once per catchment model configuration the surface simulation itself takes 0 1 s saving and writing the results gives a total of 3 s the time steps applied in the models are 1 s for the 1d models to avoid numerical instabilities and 1 min for floodstroem for comparison m3 was computed using a time step of 1 s leading to a simulation time of 0 8 s the conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps represents around 12 mainly spent on creating the flow path flood propagation the damage assessment takes approximately 1 min to compute compared to mike21 and mike flood floodstroem is 33 and 60 times faster respectively when including the entire model setup when only including the simulation time m3 floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster for comparison ca ffé took 181 s for this sub catchment excluding calibration which took 28 min rufidam took approximately 10 min to compute excluding the surface network generation 3 2 determining optimal model resolution floodstroem is tested with six different model configurations using the volume thresholds 10 20 50 150 250 and 2500 m3 denoted bst10 bst20 bst50 bst150 bst250 and bst2500 respectively fig 7 shows three out of six of the resulting surface networks generated for sc2 all six can be found in the supplementary material fig s 1 as the number of bluespots decreases the amount of water downstream increases due to the removal of upstream storage capacity within the system and the water will also appear more quickly because of the instantaneous movement of water between bluespots hence more water is being transported through the system leading to larger flooding in downstream areas this is seen in fig 8 where the maximum flood depths for model configurations bs20 and bs2500 are shown together with results from mike21 maximum flood depths for the four other model configurations are found in supplementary material fig s 3 fig 9 show hit miss and false positive for all cells for the three setups bs10 bs20 and bs2500 the remaining model configurations are found in supplementary material fig s 4 again it is seen that the removal of bluespots results in more flooding downstream and thus better coverage of all the flooding but it also leads to many false positive cells downstream for bst10 a downstream branch northwest in the sub catchment is also producing high water levels and many false positive cells a small bluespot that is not included with the higher threshold volumes is producing very high water levels because its filling volume ratio is very large causing instabilities in the model when using a 1 min time step performance indicators for the different model settings for all volume thresholds are shown in fig 10 floodstroem seems rather robust to the number of bluespots included in the model since most of the indicators vary only slightly over rather large variations of the number of bluespots and corresponding volume thresholds this is both a positive and a negative result in the sense that the model seems rather insensitive to the only parameter that can be used to tune its performance the best hit rate is found when only 12 bluespots are included in the model however looking at figs 8 9 c it is observed that the reason for the high hit rate score is caused by the lack of available storage upstream producing more flooding downstream where it covers and thereby hits more flooded cells therefore it also has the highest false alarm rate as more cells are falsely flooded downstream the lowest false alarm rate is obtained for the 186 bluespots where also the lowest rmse is found rmse is the only indicator that shows the magnitude of error and it indicates that the volume threshold should not exceed 150 m 3 corresponding to 57 bluespots moving forward we will apply a bluespot volume threshold of 20 m3 3 3 flooding accuracy 3 3 1 surface flow networks fig 11 shows surface networks generated for sc2 in m2 with a volume threshold of 20 m3 fig 11 a shows the surface networks with bluespots and flow paths in between fig 11 b shows the full network including flow paths from manholes and fig 11 c shows the bluespots and the maximum extent of bluespots from the zoom in fig 11 a 3 3 2 flood level hydrographs to illustrate the ability of floodstroem to model the temporal evolution of flooding and to visualize how temporal errors evolve through the system three bluespot locations have been selected for flood level hydrographs see fig 12 as water enters the bluespot flood levels increase to above maximum storage capacity see fig 2 and hereafter the flood levels decrease as the water continues downstream leaving only the volume in the bluespot that corresponds to the maximum storage capacity the discrepancies between floodstroem and the 1d 2d model are larger downstream than upstream partly because floodstroem moves water instantaneously between bluespots while the 1d 2d model includes transportation time in the simulation this also causes the slightly higher and narrower peak observed with floodstroem however the time delay is not large which indicate that the filling time of the sinks and temporal variation in the input data which is included is more important than the transportation time the higher peak is also caused by the exclusion of bluespots below the selected volume threshold where this water instead of being retained upstream is transported though the system resulting in a higher volume of water downstream in floodstroem compared to the 1d 2d model moreover the kinematic wave approximation excludes inertial terms which are significant for non shallow flows finally errors accumulate through the system the tail of the hydrographs for the 1d 2d model does not decrease to maximum storage capacity downstream due to hydraulic constraints causing backwatering from downstream bluespots as downstream states do not influence the outflow from a given watershed in floodstroem this effect is not present in the water levels from floodstroem hydrographs for the flow paths show wide variation in performance across the flow paths and is in any case a post calculation add on as the hydrograph at any location is calculated based on average flow rates from the upstream bluespot hence the performance of the accuracy of the flow paths are only reported as aggregated information on flow depths across the sub catchments as discussed in section 3 2 4 even though it could in principle be calculated dynamically for all cells 3 3 3 maximum flood level floodstroem can reproduce the pattern and magnitude of the maximum flood levels of the three sub catchments and return periods tested it performs better for the steeper sub catchments and for the larger return periods even though sc3 has a larger average slope it also contains the flattest areas of the three sub catchments where divergent flows dominate fig 8 shows resulting maximum flood levels from the 2d model fig 8d and floodstroem fig 8b for sub catchment sc2 for return period t 100 years flood maps for the remaining return periods and sub catchments can be seen in the supplementary material figs s 5 s 7 3 3 4 performance indicators fig 13 shows cell by cell hit miss and false positive indicators for a zoom of each sub catchment and return period the same figures for the full sub catchments can be seen in the supplementary material fig s 8 sc1 is the smallest sub catchment and floodstroem is generally able to emulate the flood pattern from the 1d 2d model the fit is better for sc2 while sc3 provides the poorest results due to the sub catchment characteristics sc3 contains a large flat area with backwater effects and divergent flows which the model structure of floodstroem has difficulties capturing this results in more flooding in the main flow paths and less flooding in between these the fit is generally better for the larger events as the storage volume of the discarded bluespots has a smaller impact relative to the total amount of flooding the type of spatial errors is the same for all sub catchments and all return periods floodstroem tends to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream the main cause is the neglected storage volume which is disregarded when the volume threshold is applied hence less water is retained upstream in the small bluespots and more water is carried downstream along the surface network moreover as described in section 3 2 2 disregarding transportation time the exclusion of inertial terms and accumulation of errors may lead to larger peak levels downstream table 3 shows the performance indicators for floodstroem for the three sub catchments and three return periods for comparison csi values for rufidam and ca ffé are also presented the results confirm the observations from fig 13 the performance improves for the larger return period and sc2 performs best the higher performance of sc2 is likely due to the large catchment size and its relatively steep slopes average 2 15 for flow paths further it is this sub catchment for which the bluespots threshold is optimized sc1 performs second best but would probably perform better if the bluespot threshold was fitted for this sub catchment as it is distinctively smaller than the two other sub catchments floodstroem did not perform as well in sc3 due to the flat catchment properties when comparing csi values for floodstroem and the two simplified models rufidam and ca ffé it is seen that floodstroem generally outperforms rufidam for ca ffé floodstroem scores better for the higher return periods for the steep sub catchments while ca ffé performs better for the flat areas and for the lower return periods 3 4 flood damage costs fig 14 shows the aggregated damage costs for floodstroem mike21 rufidam and ca ffé for the three sub catchments and return periods as expected the cost increases with the return period and the size of the sub catchment floodstroem can reproduce damage costs from the 2d model for all sub catchments and return periods quite accurately except for sc3 for return periods t 5 and t 10 years this is also where the most different flooding results were obtained due to the flat catchment characteristics and low return periods damage costs from rufidam and ca ffé are also shown for comparison it is seen that of the three simplified models floodstroem generally performs better for all cases except for sc3 for the smaller return periods floodstroem performs better on a catchment scale damage costs than for the cell based indicators as small spatial deviations are not punished 4 discussion benchmark model and performance indicators in this study we benchmark against a state of the art 2d model mike 21 however we must expect large deviations between the simulations by this model and actual events due to input data errors parameter errors model structural errors etc using a model to model validation removes all these uncertainties in the evaluation of floodstroem whereby the errors due to the model simplification of floodstroem can be examined the study highlights that in some cases there are important discrepancies between floodstroem and the hydrodynamic model however floodstroem seems to perform at least as well as the other two simplified models rufidam and ca ffé except for small return periods in the flat catchment the performance of floodstroem is primarily evaluated based on maximum flood depth maps as this outcome is key in decision making for adaptation strategies and evaluating damage costs mustafa et al 2018 chen et al 2016 zhou 2012 however dynamic calculation of flood levels in bluespots is also possible as opposed to the other simplified models discharges can also be extracted from the model whereas velocities and flow levels along the flow paths must be calculated from the discharges the cell based performance indicators for maximum flood depth such as csi may indicate a poor performance in some cases however the usage of this type of performance measure is very strict as it includes a binary threshold setting flooded or not flooded and does not take into account that often double penalties occur e g flooding shifted one cell if floodstroem results in a cell which is flooded to just below the threshold setting it will count as a miss and if floodstroem shifts a flooded cell it will count as a miss and a false positive increasing cell size could improve floodstroem results otherwise a nearest neighbour search and a conditional threshold setting including an error range instead of a fixed threshold value could be considered fairer for comparison between the three simple models this process cancels out but for comparison between the simple and full model damage costs may be a better indicator of the model performance although the errors of underestimating upstream and overestimation downstream may cancel each other out for evaluating the computational time only parts of the modules need to be executed when doing multiple simulations of the same catchment the most time consuming module m1 only needs to be executed once unless the surface topography changes m2 would need to be executed once for every scenario where surface adaptation measures are tested further the workflow for setting up the model has not been optimized timewise optimizing this could possibly reduce time for computing model steps m2 and m4 further the simulation of the surface routing itself was the least time consuming part which shows great promise for applying this model set up for modelling multiple scenarios or large scale flood modelling balancing model resolution and flood calculation accuracy floodstroem was able to reproduce flooding time pattern and water levels sufficiently however floodstroem generally underestimated flooding upstream and overestimated flooding downstream mainly caused by the application of the volume threshold in m2 disregarding small bluespots and their storage capacity to avoid too many model elements and instabilities to mitigate this the volume of all small bluespots in contact with a flow path could be subtracted in m3 and hereafter visualized in m4 this would lead to more flooding upstream in the small connected bluespots and less flooding downstream as less water is transported through the surface network floodstroem proved to be very robust to the number of bluespots included in the model and hence this choice can be made based on level of detailed desired in the model the optimal bluespot volume threshold of 20 m3 seemed to be relatively robust but this may not be the case in other catchments and resolutions of the terrain model especially for smaller catchments the threshold might be further reduced and hence the time step limitations further research and applications there are several limitations with floodstroem first the surface network generated in m2 can be rigid and does not allow for flexibility such as multidirectional spilling and a dynamically changing network implementing these features would provide a more flexible surface network which would improve results for the smaller return periods and flat areas such as sc3 moreover assumptions are made regarding a global manning number a global channel width and rules for the width of flow path buffers based on water levels these assumptions could be relaxed but this would be at the expense of larger times for tuning the model manually a greater potential is foreseen in further automation of the model setups finally it is possible to expand floodstroem to include dynamic coupling to the drainage surface using a drainage surrogate model as outlined in e g thrysøe et al 2019 our results based on the three typical catchments indicate that floodstroem overall performs better than ca ffé for the steeper sub catchment for high return periods for the flat sub catchment ca ffé performs better it has also previously been shown that this model type performs best for low lying depression areas whereas models containing a predefined surface network such as floodstroem and static rfsms performs worse in these areas jamali et al 2019 zhang and pan 2014 therefore for flat catchments models such as ca ffé should be considered especially if the temporal dynamics are not important by testing different sub catchments covering various urban catchment characteristics and storm durations we are confident that floodstroem can be applied to other catchments with various rain input as such the results are aligned with our expectations however they are still based on testing of only three catchments to fully establish the potential and limitations of floodstroem more strict benchmark tests needs to be carried out like in e g neelz and pender 2013 floodstroem can be applied for flood screening for identifying areas prone to flooding and risk mapping by identifying areas with high damage costs floodstroem can be applied as a substitute for state of the art hydrodynamic models in situations when computational time is prohibitive as e g for large catchments when fast projections in real time is required or when multiple simulations are required for e g testing different adaptation measures or climate change scenarios 5 conclusion in this paper a dynamic gis based surface flood routing model floodstroem is presented and applied to three sub catchments of the elster creek catchment in melbourne australia with varying model configurations and rain events and benchmarked to the hydrodynamic flood model mike21 the key findings are floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art 2d model currently used to predict flooding in urban areas for the simulation itself and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time for the three sub catchments and rainstorms tested floodstroem can emulate temporal evolution of flooding maximum flood levels and extents and damage costs of the 2d model floodstroem generally underestimates flooding upstream and overestimates flooding downstream of the three sub catchments and return periods tested floodstroem performs better for large steep catchments with large return periods compared to two newly reported simplified static models rufidam and ca ffé floodstroem outperforms rufidam and it performs better than ca ffé for the steep sub catchments for large return periods floodstroem is robust to the number of bluespots included in the model however too few bluespots resulted in a drastic decrease in model performance due to volume errors and too many resulted in a small decrease in performance due to numerical instabilities the current model setup implies that there are limitations in realistic representations of diverging flows and the filling order of sub bluespots and incorporation of dynamic interaction with the drainage system which could be implemented to improve the model floodstroem is suitable for flood inundation and damage estimation and in particular suitable for large study areas when multiple simulations are required or fast projections in real time applications are needed credit authorship

4379,due to climate change and urbanization urban flood modelling has become an increasingly important tool in assessing flooding and associated damage costs however large computational demands of state of the art hydrodynamic flood models makes multiple and real time simulations unfeasible this study presents a fast dynamic gis based flood model floodstroem floodstroem generates a surface network of depressions bluespots and flow paths and routes surcharged water from a subsurface drainage model through the network resulting in flood depth maps and associated damage costs floodstroem is tested on three sub catchments in elster creek catchment melbourne australia and benchmarked against the 2d distributed hydrodynamic model mike 21 and two other simplified models rufidam and ca ffé floodstroem is robust to the number of bluespots included for the three sub catchments floodstroem can reproduce flooding time pattern depth and damage costs sufficiently but has a tendency to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream performance is best for the large steep sub catchments and largest rainstorms where floodstroem performs better than the two other simplified models the critical success index csi ranges from 23 for a 5 year storm event in a flat catchment to 65 for a 100 year return period for a steeper catchment with respect to simulation time floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the 2d hydrodynamic model and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time which has potential for further reduction by optimization of the workflow keywords flood risk hydraulic modelling surrogate models computational time surface network 1 introduction urban pluvial flood risk is expected to increase in frequency and magnitude due to climate change and urbanization ipcc 2014 zhou et al 2012 to mitigate this risk resilience of urban water infrastructure can be enhanced through implementation of various adaptation measures to obtain an optimal adaptation strategy flood models are used as an essential tool to evaluate current and future flood levels as well as the associated economic consequences urban pluvial flooding is often caused by exceedance of drainage capacity in the storm water sewer system leading to surcharging from here water spreads across the terrain along preferential flow paths such as roads pathways etc to local depressions often denoted bluespots if the drainage capacity allows runoff will re enter the drainage system where manhole inlets are present this process known as the dual drainage concept djordjević et al 2005 1999 is modelled in many ways in urban flood models state of the art flood models consists of a 1d distributed drainage model using saint venant equations and a 2d distributed surface overland flow model using shallow water equations with dynamical coupling at relevant manholes henceforth we will denote these models 1d and 2d models and models with dynamical coupling 1d 2d models examples of 1d 2d models are mike flood sobek xpswmm and tuflow teng et al 2017 flood models are commonly applied in strategic planning to test a range of climate and city development scenarios possibly with the implementation of different adaptation measures this requires multiple scenario simulations and therefore fast and accurate flood models warning and control measures might also be implemented to reduce flooding costs requiring flood models that are able to run faster than real time however 1d 2d flood models have large computational demands due to the high level of detail included i e high resolution elevation data and number of physical processes teng et al 2017 the high computational time makes this model type unfit for large areas cases where multiple simulations are needed and or where the time for running the simulation is limited to cope with these limitations many efforts have been made to reduce the computational time as pointed out in jamali et al 2018 these include i optimized usage of computational resources parallel processing multicore simulations or external computing with remote computers or cloud computation burger et al 2014 glenis et al 2013 neal et al 2010 yu 2010 ii reduction of details included reducing spatial and or temporal resolution by using e g bigger simulation time steps lower resolution of the topographic input data cook and merwade 2009 fewtrell et al 2008 savage et al 2016 or simplified model networks davidsen et al 2017 leitão et al 2010 iii model simplification replacing the model with a simpler model i e surrogate model with either a simpler mechanistic i e physically based model structure complexity by e g neglecting model terms bates et al 2010 fewtrell et al 2011 or replacing the model with simpler flood spreading routines the latter can be applied on a cell by cell level with cellular automata guidolin et al 2016 jamali et al 2019 or between grouped areas e g local depressions and impact zones as applied in different rapid flood spreading methods rfsms balstrøm and crawford 2018 jamali et al 2018 maksimović et al 2009 reduction in computational time may be achieved by one or a combination of the above mentioned methods however i might not be manageable for all model users if computer resources are unavailable and therefore ii or iii can be applied for multiple fast simulations the time reduction achieved with ii might be insufficient therefore iii has gained a lot of attention current simple pluvial flood models are however typically static such as rufidam and ca ffé jamali et al 2019 2018 this means that they disregard the temporal evolution of flooding only predicting a snapshot of maximum inundation depths and with a unidirectional flow option from the drainage system to the surface when including the temporal evolution of flooding in a simplified model we expect a better representation of overland flow processes which would lead to more accurate flood inundation modelling while still ensuring a low computational time additionally it provides the potential for bi directional flow exchange between underground and surface systems whereby it in principle will be able also to construct a simplified 1d 2d model by coupling it to a simplified 1d model in this study we develop and benchmark a novel fast dynamic urban pluvial flood and damage assessment model denoted floodstroem floodstroem is a surrogate mechanistic model which therefore requires no calibration and provides a dynamic simulation environment producing the temporal evolution of flooding we wish to investigate floodstroem s ability to emulate the overland flow processes and hence we focus on a setup where distributed dynamic input in the form of water flows appear on the overland surface in the example we apply a unidirectional input from surcharging manholes generated by a 1d model this allows floodstroem to be benchmarked against a 2d model as well as the simplified static flood models rufidam and ca ffé presented in jamali et al 2019 jamali et al 2018 the novelty of this approach is that floodstroem allows for dynamic routing of the water on the surface hence the temporal evolution of flooding can be described and water levels both in bluespots and flow paths can be visualised which is not included in the simple static models 2 methods 2 1 floodstroem model description floodstroem is divided into five sub model components m1 m5 see fig 1 m1 delivers distributed time series of flows within the catchment e g generated by spilling from a 1d model m2 generates the surface flow network from the digital elevation model dem m3 routes the flow inputs from m1 through the surface network generated in m2 by a mechanistic dynamic surrogate model m4 converts the flows and volumes from m3 to two dimensional flood maps m5 computes damage costs based on the flood maps from m4 unlike many other simplified flood models floodstroem is dependent only on catchment characteristics not on output from a hydrodynamic model computer code for the entire floodstroem workflow is available from thrysøe 2021 the following sections provide a detailed description of each module 2 1 1 m1 dynamic distributed input this module produces distributed time series of flow inputs throughout the catchment for the purposes of the validation of the model we employ a 1d drainage network model to produce time series of surcharging from the subsurface sewer system we employ mike urban dhi 2014a for this purpose first the mike urban rainfall runoff generation simulates the hydrologic load serving as an input to the pipe network secondly flow is simulated in the pipe network using 1d saint venant equations from the drainage network water can surcharge to the surface if capacity is exceeded these surcharge hydrographs serve as an input to module m3 and are extracted from the results in this process all manholes are set to spilling which means that water can spill to the surface but it cannot re enter the drainage system this setting is chosen over ponding as it was found in jamali et al 2018 to be the most realistic representation in principle this module may be exchanged with any other spatial generation of flows over the catchment it could also be exchanged with a drainage surrogate model as described in thrysøe et al 2019 which would enable development of a model that could dynamically emulate a full 1d 2d model we refrain from this in the current paper to focus on the ability of floodstroem to emulate two dimensional overland flows 2 1 2 m2 flow network generation the surface flow network is generated by the open source software arc malstroem developed by balstrøm and crawford 2018 based on esri s arcgis desktop 10 6 from a digital elevation model dem this program identifies local bluespot watersheds pour points and downstream flow paths a bluespot pour point is defined as the point location where spill over from the bluespot occurs when its capacity is exceeded arc malstroem provides a built in threshold bst option excluding bluespots below a certain volume and or depth threshold to reduce the number of model elements fig 2 a shows an example of an arc malstroem output for each bluespot a corresponding pour point is shown from here a flow path leads to the next downstream bluespot the watersheds include any upstream flow paths to the bluespot as illustrated fig 2 c shows a cross section of the two bluespots bs in series bsn and bsn 1 arc malstroem does not allow for multiple pour points i e multiple spill over points from a given bluespot or diverging flows as the data model is based on a geometric network moreover arc malstroem does not consider the filling order of any sub bluespots small bluespots within a larger bluespot like seen for e g bsn 1 thus these are simply merged into one large bluespot when the arc malstroem component is completed additional flow paths from each of the points where time series of water discharges entering the model are identified using arcgis desktop as shown in fig 2 b these locations are identified in m1 and linked to the surface flow network hereafter arc malstroem is re computed with artificial boundaries around each watershed of height h added to the dem the height is user defined as described in section 2 2 3 this provides bluespot extents when the water level is h above the pour points as seen in fig 2 b c this process allows water to accumulate above the pour point level causing the horizontal extent of the bluespot to expand within the watershed as seen in fig 2 b c to describe the volume depth extent relationship of the extended bluespots the bluespot depth raster is sliced into compartments of constant height as seen in fig 2 c to eliminate volume errors along the fringes of the bluespot s extent at various water levels the volume is calculated as the bluespot s horizontal extent at ½ the compartment height times the compartment height resulting in the marked volume areas this information is used for determining the water level above a pour point at a given volume to calculate the discharge from a bluespot and for visualizing its extent at different filled levels see sections 2 1 3 and 2 1 4 2 1 3 m3 dynamic mechanistic modelling of surface flows the surcharge hydrographs from m1 are assigned to the flow network fig 2b volumes in watersheds are modelled by in and outgoing discharges consisting of the spilling surcharge from m1 and upstream and downstream surface flows between the watersheds as shown in fig 3 water is moved instantaneously between watersheds this means that as soon as water leaves a bluespot it is accounted for in the volume of the downstream watershed this also means that the transportation time between bluespots is disregarded but the filling time of a bluespot remains included the discharge from one watershed to another is calculated using volume outflow curves first water levels above pour point level are derived from the slices shown in fig 2 c for a range of different volumes for each bluespot hereafter corresponding discharges at the different water levels are found using the kinematic wave equation where the average slope of each flow path is extracted from arcgis and a global manning roughness coefficient and a fixed width is assumed as described in section 2 2 3 resulting volume discharge curves are saved in a parameter file used in the dynamic simulation in m3 a model engine takes the input from m1 and routes it through the watershed by means of piecewise linear interpolation of the volume outflow curves the model engine applied is presented in borup et al 2017 and thrysøe et al 2019 for access to the model engine s source code see borup 2018 2 1 4 m4 conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps in this model component the volume within each watershed and discharge along connecting flow paths found in m3 are translated into water levels in bluespots and flow paths as outlined below 2 1 5 water level in bluespots as the bluespots are determined from a search for landscape depressions and their maximum extents when filled at capacity before spilling over i e having reached their maximum volumes it is necessary to estimate the individual bluespots levels and reduced extents if they happen to be partly filled for this the water level volume extent relationships created from the slices from fig 2 c is applied the slice with the aggregated volume corresponding to the volume outcome from m3 is identified for each bluespot as the bluespot s horizontal extent at the specific filled level hereafter the water level from the vertical datum is subtracted from the dem to determine the water level 2 1 6 flood propagation along flow paths the method for calculating water levels along flow paths is described in this section first discharges between bluespots from module m3 are calculated to the water levels in flow paths using the kinematic wave equation this is done every time flow paths merge either from bluespots or from manholes the water levels are now used to identify the flood propagation along each flow path this is carried out in the steps shown in fig 4 in fig 4 a the original flow path containing information on the water level is smoothed and divided into smaller segments and for each of them a buffer is created if the flow path was not smoothened overlaps and gaps will occur between the buffers however this still occurs at flow path junctions and sharp curves and here mean values are applied at overlaps at gaps flooding is cut off the buffer width is determined by the water level in the flow path so a larger water level results in a wider buffer the flow path segment s water level and mean terrain elevation values are added and transferred as attributes to the buffer in fig 4 b this is subtracted from the filled dem in the buffer area not including potential flooding outside the buffer zone which is cut off in fig 4 c all adjacent flooded areas are connected and flooded areas not connected to the flow path are eliminated 2 1 7 m5 damage assessment floodstroem applies the stage depth curve damage curve method in which the damage cost is a function of flood depth and area m4 produces a raster flood map containing water depth pixels which is overlaid with building and road layers hereafter stage depth damage curves are applied to calculate the direct tangible flood damages the stage damage curves are identified from a recent literature review olesen et al 2017 this approach includes three types of land uses 1 residential buildings 2 commercial and industrial buildings and 3 road areas table 1 shows the different thresholds and damage costs applied for the different structural elements within the catchments we applied this simple approach since more detailed damage curves were not available for australia moreover the same approach and data were used in jamali et al 2018 so results are directly comparable 2 2 model testing and application 2 2 1 models used for comparison and benchmarking floodstroem is benchmarked against the 2d model mike21 dhi 2016 mike21 is a surface flood model and in this study it is computed similarly to floodstroem i e with input spilling surcharge from a 1d mike urban drainage model the 1d 2d model mike flood dhi 2014b which couples mike urban and mike21 dynamically is not used as a benchmark model as we wished to evaluate floodstroem surface flow processes ignoring the dynamic couplings in a 1d 2d model setup the 2d model results will be considered the truth in this study and all other models are benchmarked to its results note that floodstroem is not calibrated to the results of the 2d model which is only used for benchmarking purposes table 2 shows an overview of all models compared in this study and their properties besides the 2d model we also compare to the simplified models rufidam and ca ffé jamali et al 2019 2018 arc malstroem is also shown as floodstroem incorporates a part of this model in m1 the 1d 2d model is included as well as it is used for overall damage costs comparison together with the 2d model arc malstroem rufidam and floodstroem are all considered one dimensional models as they route water along preferred pathways even though they can visualize two dimensional results and rufidam can spill to two multiple neighbouring watersheds denoted impact zones in jamali et al 2018 mike flood and mike21 both apply the full shallow water equations for modelling surface flows while floodstroem only applies a kinematic wave arc malstroem rufidam and ca ffé does not consider conservation of momentum only volume conservation mike flood mike21 and ca ffé contain a high number of model elements whereas arc malstroem rufidam and floodstroem all apply watersheds as computational nodes which upfront reduces computational time as the number of elements included in the model is substantially reduced mike flood is the only model including a dynamic exchange between the drainage system 1d and the surface 2d where the remaining models are pure surface models the simplified models arc malstroem rufidam and ca ffé only consider total volume input whereas the hydrodynamic models and floodstroem consider a temporal dynamic input thereby enabling simulation of the temporal evolution of the water levels this means that floodstroem is the only simplified model able to produce the temporal dynamics of the water level as well as calculating maximum water levels in both bluespots and along flow paths 2 2 2 case study area floodstroem is tested using three sub catchments sc sc1 sc2 and sc3 fig 5 which were also applied in jamali et al 2018 the three scs have been selected to cover different typical urban catchment characteristics i e flat steep upstream coastal large small all sub catchments are located within the elster creek catchment melbourne australia which has been subject to frequent pluvial and tidal flooding the area mainly consists of residential buildings including a small proportion of commercial and industrial buildings olesen et al 2017 all three sub catchments differ in size and slope as seen in fig 5 sc1 is the smallest of the three sub catchments covering an area of approximately 78 ha with an average surface slope of 4 the hydrodynamic model for this sub catchment contains 189 manholes sc2 is the largest sub catchment covering an area of approximately 987 ha with an average surface slope of 5 the hydrodynamic model contains 1329 manholes sc3 covers an area of 760 ha with an average surface slope of 6 even though the average slope of this sub catchment is the highest it contains a large flat area located near the shore and the 1d 2d model simulations indicate that there are substantial backwater effects in this sub catchment the sc3 sub catchment contain 1228 manholes the hydrodynamic model mike flood for the entire area covering the sub catchments is discussed in detail in davidsen et al 2017 the terrain model is a lidar digital elevation model raster with a horizontal resolution of 1 by 1 m the built in volume threshold in arc malstroem is varied to evaluate the optimal number of bluespots in the surface network see section 2 2 5 2 2 3 model input data and parameters three chicago design storms cds rain events with the return periods t 5 10 and 100 years were used as input to floodstroem in module m1 to test it against the 2d model and the other simplified models presented in table 2 these rain events are selected to cover different flood intensities and because they have been used previously for this catchment jamali et al 2018 thereby allowing direct comparison a global manning roughness coefficient of 0 04 s m 1 3 and a fixed flow path width of 10 m is applied for calculating the discharge from bluespots in all three sub catchments the manning coefficient is selected to be identical to the one used in the 2d model and the fixed width is determined by the average road width for the buffers described in section 2 1 4 the buffer widths are set to 10 30 35 50 and 100 m for water levels above 0 05 0 19 0 30 0 60 and 0 85 m respectively these water levels were found by trial and error to cover most of the simulated floodstroem flood results while avoiding significant overlapping at junctions buffers were created every third meter a depth bluespot threshold of 0 1 m is applied in computing arc malstroem excluding all bluespots with depths smaller than this threshold in the surface network generated besides different volume bluespot thresholds are tested to assess the influence of number of bluespots in the model see section 2 2 5 the watershed border applied is set to 1 m 2 2 4 performance indicators cell based performance indicators are used to evaluate floodstroem performance against the 2d model both in terms of flood depth and damage costs four model performance indicators are selected from bennett et al 2013 and shown in eqs 1 4 these include 1 hit rate hr 2 false alarm rate far 3 critical success index csi and 4 root mean square error rmse a cell is set to flooded if the water level is more than 5 cm this threshold is commonly used kaspersen and halsnæs 2017 hit rate represents the percentage of flooded cells that are flooded in both models false alarm rate represents the percentage of cells flooded in the simplified model but dry in the benchmark model hr ignores false alarms while far ignores misses csi combines hr and far as it includes both misses and false alarms and is the percentage of cells correctly predicted by the simplified model the indicators hr far and csi only focuses on the area of the flooding from the given flood threshold value and not flood depth accuracy for this we include rmse and only include cells flooded in both models 1 hr hits hits misses 100 2 far false alarms hits false alarms 100 3 csi hits hits misses false alarms 100 4 rmse i 1 n y i c y i t 2 n where yc are the floodstroem water levels yt are the mike21 values and n is the number of flooded cells to supplement the cell based indicators comparison based on aggregated catchment damage costs are also reported according to the calculations outlined in section 2 1 5 2 2 5 determining optimal model resolution six different model configurations are tested with varying number of bluespots included to find the optimal model resolution and examine floodstroem s sensitivity to number of bluespots included in the model 3 results 3 1 computational time the main driver for developing the surrogate model is to reduce the computational cost computational time reported for floodstroem and the 2d model mike 21 is presented in fig 6 for sc3 for a cds storm with a return period of t 100 years for comparison computational time for mike flood is also reported the simulation time is divided into the different modelling steps m1 simulation of 1d drainage model m2 generation of flow network m3 dynamic mechanistic modelling of surface flows m4 conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps and m5 damage assessment the drainage simulation and assigning the input to floodstroem in step m1 accounts for approximately 25 based on the needed simulation time of the 1d model the computational time for the 2d mike 21 and 1d 2d mike flood models consists of pure simulation time of the flows in the drainage system and on the surface hence the setup of the models is not included this is however included in the total computational time reported for floodstroem where it m2 represents approximately 60 of the total computational time this mainly consists of creating the volume depth description of each bluespots as illustrated in fig 2 c this module only has to be executed once per catchment model configuration the surface simulation itself takes 0 1 s saving and writing the results gives a total of 3 s the time steps applied in the models are 1 s for the 1d models to avoid numerical instabilities and 1 min for floodstroem for comparison m3 was computed using a time step of 1 s leading to a simulation time of 0 8 s the conversion of mechanistic model results to two dimensional flood maps represents around 12 mainly spent on creating the flow path flood propagation the damage assessment takes approximately 1 min to compute compared to mike21 and mike flood floodstroem is 33 and 60 times faster respectively when including the entire model setup when only including the simulation time m3 floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster for comparison ca ffé took 181 s for this sub catchment excluding calibration which took 28 min rufidam took approximately 10 min to compute excluding the surface network generation 3 2 determining optimal model resolution floodstroem is tested with six different model configurations using the volume thresholds 10 20 50 150 250 and 2500 m3 denoted bst10 bst20 bst50 bst150 bst250 and bst2500 respectively fig 7 shows three out of six of the resulting surface networks generated for sc2 all six can be found in the supplementary material fig s 1 as the number of bluespots decreases the amount of water downstream increases due to the removal of upstream storage capacity within the system and the water will also appear more quickly because of the instantaneous movement of water between bluespots hence more water is being transported through the system leading to larger flooding in downstream areas this is seen in fig 8 where the maximum flood depths for model configurations bs20 and bs2500 are shown together with results from mike21 maximum flood depths for the four other model configurations are found in supplementary material fig s 3 fig 9 show hit miss and false positive for all cells for the three setups bs10 bs20 and bs2500 the remaining model configurations are found in supplementary material fig s 4 again it is seen that the removal of bluespots results in more flooding downstream and thus better coverage of all the flooding but it also leads to many false positive cells downstream for bst10 a downstream branch northwest in the sub catchment is also producing high water levels and many false positive cells a small bluespot that is not included with the higher threshold volumes is producing very high water levels because its filling volume ratio is very large causing instabilities in the model when using a 1 min time step performance indicators for the different model settings for all volume thresholds are shown in fig 10 floodstroem seems rather robust to the number of bluespots included in the model since most of the indicators vary only slightly over rather large variations of the number of bluespots and corresponding volume thresholds this is both a positive and a negative result in the sense that the model seems rather insensitive to the only parameter that can be used to tune its performance the best hit rate is found when only 12 bluespots are included in the model however looking at figs 8 9 c it is observed that the reason for the high hit rate score is caused by the lack of available storage upstream producing more flooding downstream where it covers and thereby hits more flooded cells therefore it also has the highest false alarm rate as more cells are falsely flooded downstream the lowest false alarm rate is obtained for the 186 bluespots where also the lowest rmse is found rmse is the only indicator that shows the magnitude of error and it indicates that the volume threshold should not exceed 150 m 3 corresponding to 57 bluespots moving forward we will apply a bluespot volume threshold of 20 m3 3 3 flooding accuracy 3 3 1 surface flow networks fig 11 shows surface networks generated for sc2 in m2 with a volume threshold of 20 m3 fig 11 a shows the surface networks with bluespots and flow paths in between fig 11 b shows the full network including flow paths from manholes and fig 11 c shows the bluespots and the maximum extent of bluespots from the zoom in fig 11 a 3 3 2 flood level hydrographs to illustrate the ability of floodstroem to model the temporal evolution of flooding and to visualize how temporal errors evolve through the system three bluespot locations have been selected for flood level hydrographs see fig 12 as water enters the bluespot flood levels increase to above maximum storage capacity see fig 2 and hereafter the flood levels decrease as the water continues downstream leaving only the volume in the bluespot that corresponds to the maximum storage capacity the discrepancies between floodstroem and the 1d 2d model are larger downstream than upstream partly because floodstroem moves water instantaneously between bluespots while the 1d 2d model includes transportation time in the simulation this also causes the slightly higher and narrower peak observed with floodstroem however the time delay is not large which indicate that the filling time of the sinks and temporal variation in the input data which is included is more important than the transportation time the higher peak is also caused by the exclusion of bluespots below the selected volume threshold where this water instead of being retained upstream is transported though the system resulting in a higher volume of water downstream in floodstroem compared to the 1d 2d model moreover the kinematic wave approximation excludes inertial terms which are significant for non shallow flows finally errors accumulate through the system the tail of the hydrographs for the 1d 2d model does not decrease to maximum storage capacity downstream due to hydraulic constraints causing backwatering from downstream bluespots as downstream states do not influence the outflow from a given watershed in floodstroem this effect is not present in the water levels from floodstroem hydrographs for the flow paths show wide variation in performance across the flow paths and is in any case a post calculation add on as the hydrograph at any location is calculated based on average flow rates from the upstream bluespot hence the performance of the accuracy of the flow paths are only reported as aggregated information on flow depths across the sub catchments as discussed in section 3 2 4 even though it could in principle be calculated dynamically for all cells 3 3 3 maximum flood level floodstroem can reproduce the pattern and magnitude of the maximum flood levels of the three sub catchments and return periods tested it performs better for the steeper sub catchments and for the larger return periods even though sc3 has a larger average slope it also contains the flattest areas of the three sub catchments where divergent flows dominate fig 8 shows resulting maximum flood levels from the 2d model fig 8d and floodstroem fig 8b for sub catchment sc2 for return period t 100 years flood maps for the remaining return periods and sub catchments can be seen in the supplementary material figs s 5 s 7 3 3 4 performance indicators fig 13 shows cell by cell hit miss and false positive indicators for a zoom of each sub catchment and return period the same figures for the full sub catchments can be seen in the supplementary material fig s 8 sc1 is the smallest sub catchment and floodstroem is generally able to emulate the flood pattern from the 1d 2d model the fit is better for sc2 while sc3 provides the poorest results due to the sub catchment characteristics sc3 contains a large flat area with backwater effects and divergent flows which the model structure of floodstroem has difficulties capturing this results in more flooding in the main flow paths and less flooding in between these the fit is generally better for the larger events as the storage volume of the discarded bluespots has a smaller impact relative to the total amount of flooding the type of spatial errors is the same for all sub catchments and all return periods floodstroem tends to underestimate flooding upstream and overestimate flooding downstream the main cause is the neglected storage volume which is disregarded when the volume threshold is applied hence less water is retained upstream in the small bluespots and more water is carried downstream along the surface network moreover as described in section 3 2 2 disregarding transportation time the exclusion of inertial terms and accumulation of errors may lead to larger peak levels downstream table 3 shows the performance indicators for floodstroem for the three sub catchments and three return periods for comparison csi values for rufidam and ca ffé are also presented the results confirm the observations from fig 13 the performance improves for the larger return period and sc2 performs best the higher performance of sc2 is likely due to the large catchment size and its relatively steep slopes average 2 15 for flow paths further it is this sub catchment for which the bluespots threshold is optimized sc1 performs second best but would probably perform better if the bluespot threshold was fitted for this sub catchment as it is distinctively smaller than the two other sub catchments floodstroem did not perform as well in sc3 due to the flat catchment properties when comparing csi values for floodstroem and the two simplified models rufidam and ca ffé it is seen that floodstroem generally outperforms rufidam for ca ffé floodstroem scores better for the higher return periods for the steep sub catchments while ca ffé performs better for the flat areas and for the lower return periods 3 4 flood damage costs fig 14 shows the aggregated damage costs for floodstroem mike21 rufidam and ca ffé for the three sub catchments and return periods as expected the cost increases with the return period and the size of the sub catchment floodstroem can reproduce damage costs from the 2d model for all sub catchments and return periods quite accurately except for sc3 for return periods t 5 and t 10 years this is also where the most different flooding results were obtained due to the flat catchment characteristics and low return periods damage costs from rufidam and ca ffé are also shown for comparison it is seen that of the three simplified models floodstroem generally performs better for all cases except for sc3 for the smaller return periods floodstroem performs better on a catchment scale damage costs than for the cell based indicators as small spatial deviations are not punished 4 discussion benchmark model and performance indicators in this study we benchmark against a state of the art 2d model mike 21 however we must expect large deviations between the simulations by this model and actual events due to input data errors parameter errors model structural errors etc using a model to model validation removes all these uncertainties in the evaluation of floodstroem whereby the errors due to the model simplification of floodstroem can be examined the study highlights that in some cases there are important discrepancies between floodstroem and the hydrodynamic model however floodstroem seems to perform at least as well as the other two simplified models rufidam and ca ffé except for small return periods in the flat catchment the performance of floodstroem is primarily evaluated based on maximum flood depth maps as this outcome is key in decision making for adaptation strategies and evaluating damage costs mustafa et al 2018 chen et al 2016 zhou 2012 however dynamic calculation of flood levels in bluespots is also possible as opposed to the other simplified models discharges can also be extracted from the model whereas velocities and flow levels along the flow paths must be calculated from the discharges the cell based performance indicators for maximum flood depth such as csi may indicate a poor performance in some cases however the usage of this type of performance measure is very strict as it includes a binary threshold setting flooded or not flooded and does not take into account that often double penalties occur e g flooding shifted one cell if floodstroem results in a cell which is flooded to just below the threshold setting it will count as a miss and if floodstroem shifts a flooded cell it will count as a miss and a false positive increasing cell size could improve floodstroem results otherwise a nearest neighbour search and a conditional threshold setting including an error range instead of a fixed threshold value could be considered fairer for comparison between the three simple models this process cancels out but for comparison between the simple and full model damage costs may be a better indicator of the model performance although the errors of underestimating upstream and overestimation downstream may cancel each other out for evaluating the computational time only parts of the modules need to be executed when doing multiple simulations of the same catchment the most time consuming module m1 only needs to be executed once unless the surface topography changes m2 would need to be executed once for every scenario where surface adaptation measures are tested further the workflow for setting up the model has not been optimized timewise optimizing this could possibly reduce time for computing model steps m2 and m4 further the simulation of the surface routing itself was the least time consuming part which shows great promise for applying this model set up for modelling multiple scenarios or large scale flood modelling balancing model resolution and flood calculation accuracy floodstroem was able to reproduce flooding time pattern and water levels sufficiently however floodstroem generally underestimated flooding upstream and overestimated flooding downstream mainly caused by the application of the volume threshold in m2 disregarding small bluespots and their storage capacity to avoid too many model elements and instabilities to mitigate this the volume of all small bluespots in contact with a flow path could be subtracted in m3 and hereafter visualized in m4 this would lead to more flooding upstream in the small connected bluespots and less flooding downstream as less water is transported through the surface network floodstroem proved to be very robust to the number of bluespots included in the model and hence this choice can be made based on level of detailed desired in the model the optimal bluespot volume threshold of 20 m3 seemed to be relatively robust but this may not be the case in other catchments and resolutions of the terrain model especially for smaller catchments the threshold might be further reduced and hence the time step limitations further research and applications there are several limitations with floodstroem first the surface network generated in m2 can be rigid and does not allow for flexibility such as multidirectional spilling and a dynamically changing network implementing these features would provide a more flexible surface network which would improve results for the smaller return periods and flat areas such as sc3 moreover assumptions are made regarding a global manning number a global channel width and rules for the width of flow path buffers based on water levels these assumptions could be relaxed but this would be at the expense of larger times for tuning the model manually a greater potential is foreseen in further automation of the model setups finally it is possible to expand floodstroem to include dynamic coupling to the drainage surface using a drainage surrogate model as outlined in e g thrysøe et al 2019 our results based on the three typical catchments indicate that floodstroem overall performs better than ca ffé for the steeper sub catchment for high return periods for the flat sub catchment ca ffé performs better it has also previously been shown that this model type performs best for low lying depression areas whereas models containing a predefined surface network such as floodstroem and static rfsms performs worse in these areas jamali et al 2019 zhang and pan 2014 therefore for flat catchments models such as ca ffé should be considered especially if the temporal dynamics are not important by testing different sub catchments covering various urban catchment characteristics and storm durations we are confident that floodstroem can be applied to other catchments with various rain input as such the results are aligned with our expectations however they are still based on testing of only three catchments to fully establish the potential and limitations of floodstroem more strict benchmark tests needs to be carried out like in e g neelz and pender 2013 floodstroem can be applied for flood screening for identifying areas prone to flooding and risk mapping by identifying areas with high damage costs floodstroem can be applied as a substitute for state of the art hydrodynamic models in situations when computational time is prohibitive as e g for large catchments when fast projections in real time is required or when multiple simulations are required for e g testing different adaptation measures or climate change scenarios 5 conclusion in this paper a dynamic gis based surface flood routing model floodstroem is presented and applied to three sub catchments of the elster creek catchment in melbourne australia with varying model configurations and rain events and benchmarked to the hydrodynamic flood model mike21 the key findings are floodstroem is five orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art 2d model currently used to predict flooding in urban areas for the simulation itself and 33 times faster when including the entire model setup time for the three sub catchments and rainstorms tested floodstroem can emulate temporal evolution of flooding maximum flood levels and extents and damage costs of the 2d model floodstroem generally underestimates flooding upstream and overestimates flooding downstream of the three sub catchments and return periods tested floodstroem performs better for large steep catchments with large return periods compared to two newly reported simplified static models rufidam and ca ffé floodstroem outperforms rufidam and it performs better than ca ffé for the steep sub catchments for large return periods floodstroem is robust to the number of bluespots included in the model however too few bluespots resulted in a drastic decrease in model performance due to volume errors and too many resulted in a small decrease in performance due to numerical instabilities the current model setup implies that there are limitations in realistic representations of diverging flows and the filling order of sub bluespots and incorporation of dynamic interaction with the drainage system which could be implemented to improve the model floodstroem is suitable for flood inundation and damage estimation and in particular suitable for large study areas when multiple simulations are required or fast projections in real time applications are needed credit authorship
