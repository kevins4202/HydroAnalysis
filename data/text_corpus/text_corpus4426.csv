22130,this work presents an autonomous surface vehicle asv with tracking capability the asv is able to follow after an autonomous underwater vehicle auv without prior knowledge of the auv s actual position tracking an auv can significantly increase the communication range and bandwidth of the transferred data which means that the auv can operate without nearby operators mathematical models to represent asv s kinematics and kinetics were developed as well as a controller that takes into account sea wave effects simulations of the asv with a ranger interrogator system was developed to test the tracking algorithm the proposed method allows computing the possible location of the auv which can be used to reduce the navigation error of the auv this method was tested both in a simulation environment and at sea trials in the red sea in both cases the algorithm performed well and precise tracking was achieved keywords asv auv tracking 1 introduction there is a growing interest worldwide in the use of autonomous surface vehicles asvs to execute missions of increasing complexity without direct supervision by human operators the increasing needs of the oceanographic community for better environmental monitoring and surveillance systems have stimulated much research within the academic and commercial robotics communities thus considerable progress has been observed in the development and use of asvs these platforms provide various capabilities for payload communication mobility and autonomy curcio et al 2005a dunbabin et al 2009 in recent years many asvs have been developed for bathymetric data recording in shallow waters and for monitoring various marine environmental data gupta and sakhare 2015 their dimensions are usually above three meters long by one meter wide depending on their form monohull catamaran trimaran manley 2008 more detailed information about the target platforms that are used in this research is presented in section 4 autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have played a significant role in underwater mapping ocean sampling fiorelli et al 2006 and plankton sampling zhang et al 2010 tracking algorithms for the asv auv has become an important research topic in recent years majid and arshad 2016 miskovic et al 2015 eiler et al 2013 an example of a tracking scenario is presented in fig 1 a key enabling element for the execution of such missions is the availability of advanced systems for the asv s motion control there are three main issues to solve i point stabilization where the goal is to stabilize a vehicle at a given target point with the desired orientation ii trajectory tracking where the vehicle is required to track a time parameterized reference and iii path following where the objective is for the vehicle to converge to and follow a desired geometric path without an explicit timing law assigned to it aguiar et al 2009 in this study a tracking algorithm based on a ranger interrogator system benthos 2017 will be presented the ranger system provides distance and discrete bearing between the auv and the asv typically a usbl have an accuracy of 0 25 link quest 2019 the proposed approach provides the same accuracy of a usbl based tracking systems at lower cost half the typical cost of a usbl systems the proposed algorithm allows the asv to follow an auv without the need to know the auv s actual position sample points derived from the ranger are updated dynamically to predict the position of the auv for stable tracking the goal is to overcome the difficulties attributable to discrete bearing measurements an asv with tracking capabilities such as asv equipped with acoustic and rf modems can extend the capability of an auv by improving position estimation and can also serve as a relay station curcio et al 2005b additionally it can be critical for an asv to be able to follow an auv as closely as possible for example during optical communication with an auv the asv must hover above the auv farr et al 2005 carder et al 2001 to achieve the necessary accuracy required for auv tracking the control approach is presented see section 6 the controller allows the vehicle to perform the tracking despite the effect of the sea waves braginsky and guterman 2015 ordinarily coupling between heading and position makes tracking particularly difficult in order to solve the tracking control problem under the effect of sea waves two controllers are offered that use an acoustic system as reference one controller is applied for achieving heading regulation and the second controller is applied for achieving the distance to the tracking target in this paper section 2 presents related works section 3 describes acoustic positioning techniques section 4 describes the target platforms that were used and the communication structure sections 5 and 6 present approaches to the model and control of the asv respectively sections 7 and 8 show the simulation and experimental results respectively 2 related work there are several ways to track underwater acoustic sources from surface vehicles underwater vehicles and from underwater sensor networks pearson et al 2014 among these methods tracking from a surface vessel is the most flexible in terms of simplicity and ease in monitoring and offers a low cost of operation majid and arshad 2016 for example webster et al 2009 and eustice et al 2007 employ a single beacon one way travel time acoustic approach however this approach requires a complex system highly accurate synchronization between the clocks of the different platforms and knowledge of the auv s position tracking a diver based on an acoustic signal is another means to approximate the position using an asv miskovic et al 2015 however this approach requires a more expensive and complex system such as usbl a similar principle was applied to track a fish as reported in eiler et al 2013 this paper extends the previous research reported in braginsky et al 2016 which presented the preliminary results of a tracking algorithm in this work additional simulation and experimental results are presented also a more detailed description of the asv model and system is given 3 acoustic positioning techniques an acoustic positioning system is strongly similar to the popular global navigation satellite system gnss like the gnss the acoustic positioning method relies on the distance between a navigating vehicle namely an auv and some reference points in the navigation frame with gnss these reference points are the satellites the satellite s position is known with respect to the earth and the distance is measured as the time of flight tof of an electromagnetic signal between the satellite and the navigating vehicle groves 2013 in the case of an acoustic positioning system the reference could be one of the following an acoustic transponder in a fixed position on the sea floor a gnss intelligent buoy gib which is a floating buoy with both an acoustic transponder and gnss for positioning or an acoustic transceiver that is located on a supporting vessel with some absolute or relative positioning capabilities the navigating vessels could be a ship an asv or another auv the distance between two transponders can be extracted from the time measurement of the acoustic waves and their speed in the following different ways time of arrival toa the average time it takes the acoustic signal to travel back and forth between the two transducers one way time of arrival owta the tof of the signal which is calculated with the help of clock synchronization time difference of arrival tdoa the difference between the times that a signal is received at two transceivers with a known distance between them and phase shift by measuring the phase shift of the propagated wave between closely placed receivers the direction of the wave can be calculated there are several different implementations of acoustic positioning systems which differ from each other mainly by the distance between the transponders also known as baseline and also based on the frequency typically used and the accuracy that is achievable vickery 1998 a summary of the more popular methods can be seen in table 1 the long baseline lbl method involves measuring the range to several three or more spaced beacons with known coordinates and solving the relevant system of equations where auv coordinates are unknown kebkal and mashoshin 2017 the ultra short baseline usbl consists of at least three acoustic sensors for two dimensional positioning and at least four acoustic sensors for three dimensional positioning alcocer et al vickery 1998 these sensors are placed close with each other to form an array the position of the source can be estimated from its direction with respect to the origin of the sensor array the single beacon navigation sbn uses a tightly coupled filter which allows the auv to be able to estimate its position using only the range measurement of a single beacon kebkal and mashoshin 2017 the beacon can be a stationary one in a known position or a moving beacon that can transmit its estimated position to the auv as reference due to the simplicity of the method the sbn can be employed with an asv as a moving beacon that can follow the auv in its mission braginsky et al 2016 this method can also be used for cooperative navigation of several auvs although the auvs do not have any knowledge of their absolute positions this method can keep the relative error small and thus reduce the final position estimation error bahr et al 2009 the sbn method does not offer a closed set of equations as the trilateration and for that reason implementation requires optimization penas 2009 eustice et al 2007 therefore its accuracy is strongly dependent on the algorithm that is used and the trajectory of the vehicles under optimal conditions this method can achieve an accuracy of about 1 m kebkal and mashoshin 2017 4 target platforms in this section the target platforms an asv and an auv will be described both systems have to fulfill similar requirements such as path planning communication guidance and navigation with some differences based on the specific medium that each vehicle is designed for consequently a general approach was used when designing the systems hardware and software thus allowing for lower costs and simpler systems 4 1 asv the asv was developed at the laboratory for autonomous robotics lar ben gurion university of the negev with the objective of improving the auv s capabilities such as positioning and communication arrichiello et al 2010 aguiary et al 2009 aguiar et al 2009 bahr et al 2009 the asv is based on a regular ocean kayak manufactured by ocean kayak fig 2 and with a 4 m long hull the asv s hardware and sensors are depicted in the block diagram in fig 3 the main computer is an arm based micro controller unit mcu which is responsible for guidance navigation and communication the asv can be deployed with various kinds of payload sensors for specific experiment needs thrusters produced by torqeedo 2019 are used for propulsion the range between the asv and the auv is measured by a dri 267 system which is capable of measuring distance up to 1000 m and bearing to the tracked source the dri 267 is connected to the mcu via a serial communication channel 4 2 auv the hydrocamel ii auv fig 4 was also developed at lar braginsky and guterman 2014 it is a torpedo shaped auv with a depth rating of 300 m its seven thrusters enable the vehicle to have 6 of freedom dof which allows it to hover in place and to perform tight maneuvers it is equipped with various types of sensors for navigation and surveying alongside different kinds of computer hardware a block diagram of the system can be seen in fig 5 the auv employs an inertial navigation system ins based on a micro electro mechanical systems mems inertial measurement unit imu and an extended kalman filter ekf for data fusion baruch et al 2016 the auv navigation performance was presented in detail in previous work baruch et al 2017 4 3 platforms communications the communication architecture in this system has two primary roles to transfer data from point to point and to create a network between the surface and underwater platforms to meet this requirement each communication channel acoustic and rf must be able to communicate point to point and to create ad hoc networks when underwater vehicles are on the surface they use rf to communicate with other surface vehicles such as an asv or a support ship however when the auv is underwater rf communication is not available due to the high attenuation of electromagnetic waves in water due to these limitations each platform must be equipped with two different communication channels in order to establish a network between all the platforms regardless of whether the auv is on the surface or underwater in fig 6 the communication system architecture with rf and acoustic interface is illustrated the same architecture is used on both the platforms presented in this work the hydrocamel auv and the kayak asv the architecture is built primarily from off the shelf hardware with the underwater segment constructed from a set of benthos atm 903 acoustic modems benthos 2019 the acoustic network has a simple mesh topology with each node transmitting to every other node that is all nodes operate in a promiscuous mode that is capable of receiving all transmissions from all other nodes the range between two nodes can be up to 6 km but by the use of repeat mode a distance of 20 km can be achieved according to the manufacturer in above water segment is formed by 2 4 ghz wireless network equipment the nvip2400 wireless modem produced by microhard 2019 is employed on the platforms the wireless modem has the capability of building a mesh network similar to the acoustic modem 5 model of the autonomous surface vehicle to exploit the physical properties of the models the equations of motion are represented in a vectorial setting it is often beneficial to use physical system properties to reduce the number of coefficients needed for control this is the primary motivation for developing a vectorial representation of the equations of motion the following representation of three dof models will be used in this work fossen 2011 1 m r b ν c r b ν ν m a ν c a ν ν d ν ν τ rb where 2 τ r b τ w i n d τ w a v e τ the vector τ f t h r u s t 0 m t h r u s t t represents the propulsion forces and moments discussed in section 5 2 external interference from wind and wave are described as τ w i n d and τ w a v e respectively the influence of wave induced forces can be simulated by separating the 1st wave frequency motion and 2nd wave shift forces order effects love et al 2004 fossen 1994 the waves effect influence can be estimated using imu measurements fossen and perez 2009 and winds effect influence can be measured by an anemometer the anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed and direction 5 1 rigid body and hydrodynamic forces the state vectors are chosen where ν u v r t and η x y ψ t this implies that the dynamics associated with the heave roll and pitch motions are neglected that is w p q 0 for the horizontal motion of a vessel the kinematic equations of motion reduce from the general six dof to one principal rotation about the z axis 3 r i b ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 where r i b is the rotation matrix from inertial to body frame defined by the euler angle ψ in general any movement of the vehicle involves three dof it is convenient to define two coordinate frames as shown in fig 7 it is also common to assume that the craft has homogeneous mass distribution and xz plane symmetry such that 4 i x y i y z 0 5 m r b m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i z notice that surge is decoupled from sway and yaw in m r b due to symmetry considerations of the system inertia matrix it is assumed that the added mass matrix is computed in co 6 c r b ν 0 0 m v 0 0 m u m v m u 0 7 m a m a t d i a g x u y v n r 8 c a ν 0 0 y v v y r r 0 0 x u u y v v y r r x u u 0 and 9 d ν d d n ν linear potential

martin and whitcomb 2014 the definitions of the model parameters can be found in appendix a 5 2 propulsion model depending on the forces provided by the thrusters fig 8 the applied force in the body referenced frame is 12 f t h r u s t f 1 f 2 a moment is induced in the yaw direction due to the thrust 13 m t h r u s t y r f 1 f 2 where y r is the distance from the motors to the body center of mass and the difference in the thrust produced by the two thrusters will apply moment according eq 13 on the platform that will change the heading eqs 12 13 can therefore be rewritten as follow 14 f 1 1 2 f t h r u s t 1 2 y r m t h r u s t 15 f 2 1 2 f t h r u s t 1 2 y r m t h r u s t 6 suggested algorithm 6 1 auv tracking approach below an approach using an asv to track an auv is presented the usual technique is to use a support vessel on the surface to track the auv however reliable communication is difficult to establish due to the physical properties of the water especially when transmitting over great distances instead a tracking algorithm using data from the dri 267 ranger system is used the range and direction angle derived are used as input for the attitude and position controllers respectively fig 9 fig 10 shows the asv propulsion system equipped with a dri 267 ranger system the detected distance can be from 1 to 1000 m and the direction is presented in nine discrete bearing ranges as described in table 2 the ranger supplied information can be combined with the known auv depth to estimate the auv s position the relative position between the asv and the auv can be calculated using the following equation x r n 2 d 2 1 2 c o s α 16 y r n 2 d 2 1 2 s i n α where r n is the range and α is the bearing to the auv table 2 both measured by the ranger and d is the depth of the auv as presented in fig 11 the position x and y is calculated using eq 16 in the body frame of the asv and it can be easily transformed into the inertial frame the position error is a function of the bearing angle range and depth range and depth can be measured very accurately with a resolution of within one meter according to the dri and keller x35 depth sensor data sheets keller 2019 however the bearing angle must be taken into account as one of the critical components of error as we can see in table 2 the bearing angle measurement is much more accurate for small angles that is angles between 1 and 3 where the maximum error can be 2 for indicator 3 for example the bearing to the auv is between 8 and 20 and the possible error has increased to 12 6 1 1 auv position uncertainty based on a ranger relative position error between the asv and the auv can been calculated using eq 17 x e r r o r r n r n e r r o r 2 d d e r r o r 2 1 2 c o s α α e r r o r x t r u e 17 y e r r o r r n r n e r r o r 2 d d e r r o r 2 1 2 s i n α α e r r o r y t r u e where x t r u e and y t r u e can be calculated using eq 16 with true values of r n d and α from sensors data sheet follow that r n e r r o r 1 m and d e r r o r 0 1 m when α e r r o r depend on bearing output table 2 and an asv heading uncertainty which is typically 1 sokolović et al 2015 consequently the auv position is highly depend on the range r n and α e r r o r for example at a distance of 100 m and given a bearing output 0 α e r r o r 1 and the asv heading uncertainty of 1 the relative position error between the asv and the auv will be y e r r o r 3 5 m and x e r r o r 0 1 m additionally to the relative position error the asv gps accuracy typically 1 5 m groves 2013 will affect the auv position accuracy however if the bearing output increases to 3 error of 6 the possible error increases to 11 m from this example we thus learn that for this application it is very critical to be able to track with the smallest bearing error possible so as to have a minimum possible position error 6 2 distance and heading controllers 6 2 1 distance controller two assumptions were made for the position controller first that the asv can move faster than the auv so it can close the gap between them and second that the asv cannot move backwards this means that when the distance between the platforms is too close the asv will slow down to minimal speed or stop the thrusters the second assumption is that the auv is generally moving at a constant speed for better performance of the side scan sonar sss given these assumptions we have used a linear asv forward model so that eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 18 m x u u x u u f t h r u s t and a proportional integral pi distance controller in the following form was chosen 19 f t h r u s t k p d e k i d e d t where d e r n t a r g e t r n is the range error to the auv as received from ranger 6 2 2 heading controller the objective of the heading controller is to automatically steer the vehicle in a given desired direction yaw to this end the control algorithm accepts the reference signal ψ as input for example be the bearing output from dri 267 for the heading controller design it is assumed that all state variables are measured in this part we concentrate on the third element of the vector ν r is the rotation speed we will define the rotation subsystem as follows 20 ψ r 21 r 1 i z n r m t h r u s t τ w a v e τ w i n d x u u v y v v u y r r u n v v v v n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r n v v n r r the following attitude controller is defined 22 m t h r u s t k ψ b r τ w a v e τ w i n d x u u v y v v u y r r u n v v v v n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r n v v n r r where k and b are arbitrarily selected constant scalars for proving stability using the lyapunov approach for the non linear heading controller described in eq 22 the following lyapunov candidate function is proposed 23 v ω b η 1 2 k ψ 2 i z n r r 2 substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eq 23 the derivative of the resulting closed loop system namely v k ψ ψ i z n r r r satisfies 24 v k ψ r r k ψ b r b r 2 0 when b is positive invoking lasalle s invariance principle khalil 1996 and considering the null solution r 0 that is the solution of eq 21 is asymptotically stable if v does not vanish identically along any solution of eq 21 other than the null solution thus the nonlinear heading controller is able to deal with speed changes of the asv and with external interference such as winds and sea waves within the limits of the thrusters 7 simulation results to evaluate the performance and behavior of the system using the derived controllers simulations were run based on the model presented in section 5 tracking capability was tested in three different scenarios different initial conditions different target ranges and using a rectangle trajectory as illustrated in figs 12 14 the simulation takes into account the nonlinear response of the ranger table 2 in the first scenario the auv is moving in a straight line the initial position of the auv is assumed to be 0 0 and the initial position of the asv is in three different positions see table 3 the robustness of the tracking algorithm was tested by changing the initial position of the asv in each simulation the target range in these three simulations was set to 100 m and auv speed was 1 1 m s the range and bearing of the asv to the auv are computed based on the simulated positions of the auv fig 12 shows that for most of the time the distance error was less than 5 m the error occurs due to the bearing measurement which can vary between 1 and 1 and which at a distance of 100 m means that the auv position error will be about 2 m eq 16 in the second scenario the auv is following a sine trajectory as presented in fig 13 a the initial positions are assumed to be 0 0 and 100 50 for the auv and asv respectively and the auv speed was 1 m s the target range varies from 10 to 100 m according to fig 13 b more than 90 of the time the error was less than one meter from the defined target the results of the third scenario tracking an auv survey mission are shown in fig 14 a the initial position of the auv is assumed to be 0 10 and the initial position of the asv was 25 25 the target distance between the auv and the asv was 10 m and auv speed was 1 m s fig 14 b illustrates that the error was less than one meter from the tracked platform for over 90 of the time with error occurring mainly during the turns the relatively high error bars greater than 5 m reflect the initial stage of the tracking 7 1 comparison between tracking using a ranger vs usbl to compare the performance of the tracking approach two simulations were completed the first based on a ranger system and the second on a usbl the usbl system was simulated instead of ranger with resolution of 0 25 the tracking capability was tested in two different scenarios a the auv is moving in a straight line and b the auv is following a sine trajectory as illustrated in figs 15 and 16 from figs 15 a and 16 a clearly can be seen that in both scenarios tracking performance were similar 8 experimental results following the simulations the tracking algorithm was tested experimentally on the asv described in section 4 1 the experiments took place on the israeli coast of the red sea several trials were performed using different auv asv ranges and auv depths altitude before starting a series of experiments or after any changes in the asv or auv electronics magnetometer calibration was performed at the beginning of each experiment the auv was on the surface at a distance of about 10 m from the asv as well external effects influence τ w i n d and τ w a v e were updated using meteorological data from the interuniversity institute for marine science in eilat iui iui 2019 a start command was simultaneously sent to both systems whereupon the auv began diving and the asv began searching for the auv by revolving once the asv locked on the auv the tracking algorithm as described in section 6 1 began working for the sake of clarity tracking and position results will be presented separately sections 8 1 and 8 3 respectively the combined tracking distance of the twelve trials was approximately 5 km 8 1 auv tracking by an asv the experimental results of four trials with different ranges and different auv depths altitude and set points which summarize all experiments are shown in figs 17 and 18 during the experiments the auv maintained either constant altitude figs 17 a and 18 a or constant depth figs 17 b 17 d and figs 18 b 18 d each tracking experiment was divided into three different stages i diving maneuver ii cruise maneuver iii ascent maneuver fig 18 illustrated the ranger output and heading controller input as can been seen from fig 17 regardless of range and auv depth altitude the asv performance was satisfied as expected from simulation more detailed comparison between the simulation and the experimental result are presented in the next section the average tracking range error for all the trials was about one meter fig 19 a the normalized histogram of the bearing indicator received from the dri 267 for all the trials is shown in fig 19 b it can be observed that most of the time the bearing angle was between 3 refer again to table 2 8 2 comparison between the simulated model and experimental data a comparison between the simulated model and experimental data can be seen in fig 20 the simulation was performed using initial conditions similar to those of the experiment the previously show the auv s trajectory is divided into three operational stages the asv maintain the target range closely during stage ii while following a similar trajectory to the simulated model during stages i and iii fig 20 a a constant positive bias relative to the target range is observed during stage ii further analysis revealed that the bias is related to four factors ranger inaccuracy error in the determination of the sound velocity the receiver turn around time of the transponder and the influence of winds and waves during the sea experiment the closeness between simulation and experimental data can be further observed by comparing the statistically bearing changes fig 20 b it might be observed that bearing was closely maintained during the experiment 8 3 auv position estimation using tracking data the experimental results of using two surface platforms is presented in this section in this case the asv was supported with a ship equipped with an acoustic modem by using the acoustic modem the auv was able to measure its distance from the ship again the auv s mission can be divided into three main stages as presented in fig 21 the distance and azimuth to the auv as measured by the asv can be used for the auv position estimation for the sake of brevity only a subset of the results are presented here the combined tracking distance of the trials was about 2 km the experimental results of two trials with different range depth and altitude set points are presented in figs 21 and 22 the auv position was estimated in post processing using the data collected from the auv the asv and the supported ship the data was synchronized using the gps clock as can be seen from these figures the estimated position error of the auv upon surfacing and getting a gps fix region iii in fig 21 is about 7 m the position estimation is based on a loosely coupled gps aided strapdown inertial navigation system sins farrell 2008 in this case the ranger system measurements were processed by an outlier filter median absolute deviation verboven and hubert 2005 and then used as pseudo gps input for sins the algorithm equations presented in detail in appendix b due to the lack of a doppler velocity log dvl bottom locking during diving the auv navigation error was about 50 m blue line in both trials where the travel distance was 700 m in the first and 1200 m in the second the ranger navigation error was less than ten meters 9 conclusions the asv was developed mainly as a vehicle to serve as a support platform for and cooperate with an auv and to this purpose it was fitted with an acoustic ranger real experiments successfully demonstrated the asv s ability to autonomously track an auv and serve as a repeater the tracking algorithm is based on a non linear controller which allows to keep the heading of the asv despite the effect of the sea waves this controller keeps the auv in a tight area of a few degrees during the tracking the navigation error using the ranger system does not depend on travel distance as it does when using dead reckoning navigation the proposed approach provides the same accuracy of usbl based tracking systems at lower cost furthermore the experiments showed that these tracking capabilities could significantly improve accuracy in positioning the auv declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a asv parameters

in this appendix the equations of the navigation system will be described for a simple fusion of the ranger system its measurements were used as gps updates the equations and model of the navigation system are based on farrell s error state model farrell 2008 with approximation for low cost sensors and low velocity only several m s which means that the major source of errors derive from the accelerometer and gyroscope errors a short description of the navigation system is given in this section for the convenience of the reader in this paper the state vector that was used for the error state estimation is b 1 x δ p t δ v t δ ψ t δ f t δ ω t t where δ p δ v δ ψ are the position velocity and orientation errors respectively δ f δ ω are the accelerometer and gyroscope errors the change

the tracking algorithm the proposed method allows computing the possible location of the auv which can be used to reduce the navigation error of the auv this method was tested both in a simulation environment and at sea trials in the red sea in both cases the algorithm performed well and precise tracking was achieved keywords asv auv tracking 1 introduction there is a growing interest worldwide in the use of autonomous surface vehicles asvs to execute missions of increasing complexity without direct supervision by human operators the increasing needs of the oceanographic community for better environmental monitoring and surveillance systems have stimulated much research within the academic and commercial robotics communities thus considerable progress has been observed in the development and use of asvs these platforms provide various capabilities for payload communication mobility and autonomy curcio et al 2005a dunbabin et al 2009 in recent years many asvs have been developed for bathymetric data recording in shallow waters and for monitoring various marine environmental data gupta and sakhare 2015 their dimensions are usually above three meters long by one meter wide depending on their form monohull catamaran trimaran manley 2008 more detailed information about the target platforms that are used in this research is presented in section 4 autonomous underwater vehicles auvs have played a significant role in underwater mapping ocean sampling fiorelli et al 2006 and plankton sampling zhang et al 2010 tracking algorithms for the asv auv has become an important research topic in recent years majid and arshad 2016 miskovic et al 2015 eiler et al 2013 an example of a tracking scenario is presented in fig 1 a key enabling element for the execution of such missions is the availability of advanced systems for the asv s motion control there are three main issues to solve i point stabilization where the goal is to stabilize a vehicle at a given target point with the desired orientation ii trajectory tracking where the vehicle is required to track a time parameterized reference and iii path following where the objective is for the vehicle to converge to and follow a desired geometric path without an explicit timing law assigned to it aguiar et al 2009 in this study a tracking algorithm based on a ranger interrogator system benthos 2017 will be presented the ranger system provides distance and discrete bearing between the auv and the asv typically a usbl have an accuracy of 0 25 link quest 2019 the proposed approach provides the same accuracy of a usbl based tracking systems at lower cost half the typical cost of a usbl systems the proposed algorithm allows the asv to follow an auv without the need to know the auv s actual position sample points derived from the ranger are updated dynamically to predict the position of the auv for stable tracking the goal is to overcome the difficulties attributable to discrete bearing measurements an asv with tracking capabilities such as asv equipped with acoustic and rf modems can extend the capability of an auv by improving position estimation and can also serve as a relay station curcio et al 2005b additionally it can be critical for an asv to be able to follow an auv as closely as possible for example during optical communication with an auv the asv must hover above the auv farr et al 2005 carder et al 2001 to achieve the necessary accuracy required for auv tracking the control approach is presented see section 6 the controller allows the vehicle to perform the tracking despite the effect of the sea waves braginsky and guterman 2015 ordinarily coupling between heading and position makes tracking particularly difficult in order to solve the tracking control problem under the effect of sea waves two controllers are offered that use an acoustic system as reference one controller is applied for achieving heading regulation and the second controller is applied for achieving the distance to the tracking target in this paper section 2 presents related works section 3 describes acoustic positioning techniques section 4 describes the target platforms that were used and the communication structure sections 5 and 6 present approaches to the model and control of the asv respectively sections 7 and 8 show the simulation and experimental results respectively 2 related work there are several ways to track underwater acoustic sources from surface vehicles underwater vehicles and from underwater sensor networks pearson et al 2014 among these methods tracking from a surface vessel is the most flexible in terms of simplicity and ease in monitoring and offers a low cost of operation majid and arshad 2016 for example webster et al 2009 and eustice et al 2007 employ a single beacon one way travel time acoustic approach however this approach requires a complex system highly accurate synchronization between the clocks of the different platforms and knowledge of the auv s position tracking a diver based on an acoustic signal is another means to approximate the position using an asv miskovic et al 2015 however this approach requires a more expensive and complex system such as usbl a similar principle was applied to track a fish as reported in eiler et al 2013 this paper extends the previous research reported in braginsky et al 2016 which presented the preliminary results of a tracking algorithm in this work additional simulation and experimental results are presented also a more detailed description of the asv model and system is given 3 acoustic positioning techniques an acoustic positioning system is strongly similar to the popular global navigation satellite system gnss like the gnss the acoustic positioning method relies on the distance between a navigating vehicle namely an auv and some reference points in the navigation frame with gnss these reference points are the satellites the satellite s position is known with respect to the earth and the distance is measured as the time of flight tof of an electromagnetic signal between the satellite and the navigating vehicle groves 2013 in the case of an acoustic positioning system the reference could be one of the following an acoustic transponder in a fixed position on the sea floor a gnss intelligent buoy gib which is a floating buoy with both an acoustic transponder and gnss for positioning or an acoustic transceiver that is located on a supporting vessel with some absolute or relative positioning capabilities the navigating vessels could be a ship an asv or another auv the distance between two transponders can be extracted from the time measurement of the acoustic waves and their speed in the following different ways time of arrival toa the average time it takes the acoustic signal to travel back and forth between the two transducers one way time of arrival owta the tof of the signal which is calculated with the help of clock synchronization time difference of arrival tdoa the difference between the times that a signal is received at two transceivers with a known distance between them and phase shift by measuring the phase shift of the propagated wave between closely placed receivers the direction of the wave can be calculated there are several different implementations of acoustic positioning systems which differ from each other mainly by the distance between the transponders also known as baseline and also based on the frequency typically used and the accuracy that is achievable vickery 1998 a summary of the more popular methods can be seen in table 1 the long baseline lbl method involves measuring the range to several three or more spaced beacons with known coordinates and solving the relevant system of equations where auv coordinates are unknown kebkal and mashoshin 2017 the ultra short baseline usbl consists of at least three acoustic sensors for two dimensional positioning and at least four acoustic sensors for three dimensional positioning alcocer et al vickery 1998 these sensors are placed close with each other to form an array the position of the source can be estimated from its direction with respect to the origin of the sensor array the single beacon navigation sbn uses a tightly coupled filter which allows the auv to be able to estimate its position using only the range measurement of a single beacon kebkal and mashoshin 2017 the beacon can be a stationary one in a known position or a moving beacon that can transmit its estimated position to the auv as reference due to the simplicity of the method the sbn can be employed with an asv as a moving beacon that can follow the auv in its mission braginsky et al 2016 this method can also be used for cooperative navigation of several auvs although the auvs do not have any knowledge of their absolute positions this method can keep the relative error small and thus reduce the final position estimation error bahr et al 2009 the sbn method does not offer a closed set of equations as the trilateration and for that reason implementation requires optimization penas 2009 eustice et al 2007 therefore its accuracy is strongly dependent on the algorithm that is used and the trajectory of the vehicles under optimal conditions this method can achieve an accuracy of about 1 m kebkal and mashoshin 2017 4 target platforms in this section the target platforms an asv and an auv will be described both systems have to fulfill similar requirements such as path planning communication guidance and navigation with some differences based on the specific medium that each vehicle is designed for consequently a general approach was used when designing the systems hardware and software thus allowing for lower costs and simpler systems 4 1 asv the asv was developed at the laboratory for autonomous robotics lar ben gurion university of the negev with the objective of improving the auv s capabilities such as positioning and communication arrichiello et al 2010 aguiary et al 2009 aguiar et al 2009 bahr et al 2009 the asv is based on a regular ocean kayak manufactured by ocean kayak fig 2 and with a 4 m long hull the asv s hardware and sensors are depicted in the block diagram in fig 3 the main computer is an arm based micro controller unit mcu which is responsible for guidance navigation and communication the asv can be deployed with various kinds of payload sensors for specific experiment needs thrusters produced by torqeedo 2019 are used for propulsion the range between the asv and the auv is measured by a dri 267 system which is capable of measuring distance up to 1000 m and bearing to the tracked source the dri 267 is connected to the mcu via a serial communication channel 4 2 auv the hydrocamel ii auv fig 4 was also developed at lar braginsky and guterman 2014 it is a torpedo shaped auv with a depth rating of 300 m its seven thrusters enable the vehicle to have 6 of freedom dof which allows it to hover in place and to perform tight maneuvers it is equipped with various types of sensors for navigation and surveying alongside different kinds of computer hardware a block diagram of the system can be seen in fig 5 the auv employs an inertial navigation system ins based on a micro electro mechanical systems mems inertial measurement unit imu and an extended kalman filter ekf for data fusion baruch et al 2016 the auv navigation performance was presented in detail in previous work baruch et al 2017 4 3 platforms communications the communication architecture in this system has two primary roles to transfer data from point to point and to create a network between the surface and underwater platforms to meet this requirement each communication channel acoustic and rf must be able to communicate point to point and to create ad hoc networks when underwater vehicles are on the surface they use rf to communicate with other surface vehicles such as an asv or a support ship however when the auv is underwater rf communication is not available due to the high attenuation of electromagnetic waves in water due to these limitations each platform must be equipped with two different communication channels in order to establish a network between all the platforms regardless of whether the auv is on the surface or underwater in fig 6 the communication system architecture with rf and acoustic interface is illustrated the same architecture is used on both the platforms presented in this work the hydrocamel auv and the kayak asv the architecture is built primarily from off the shelf hardware with the underwater segment constructed from a set of benthos atm 903 acoustic modems benthos 2019 the acoustic network has a simple mesh topology with each node transmitting to every other node that is all nodes operate in a promiscuous mode that is capable of receiving all transmissions from all other nodes the range between two nodes can be up to 6 km but by the use of repeat mode a distance of 20 km can be achieved according to the manufacturer in above water segment is formed by 2 4 ghz wireless network equipment the nvip2400 wireless modem produced by microhard 2019 is employed on the platforms the wireless modem has the capability of building a mesh network similar to the acoustic modem 5 model of the autonomous surface vehicle to exploit the physical properties of the models the equations of motion are represented in a vectorial setting it is often beneficial to use physical system properties to reduce the number of coefficients needed for control this is the primary motivation for developing a vectorial representation of the equations of motion the following representation of three dof models will be used in this work fossen 2011 1 m r b ν c r b ν ν m a ν c a ν ν d ν ν τ rb where 2 τ r b τ w i n d τ w a v e τ the vector τ f t h r u s t 0 m t h r u s t t represents the propulsion forces and moments discussed in section 5 2 external interference from wind and wave are described as τ w i n d and τ w a v e respectively the influence of wave induced forces can be simulated by separating the 1st wave frequency motion and 2nd wave shift forces order effects love et al 2004 fossen 1994 the waves effect influence can be estimated using imu measurements fossen and perez 2009 and winds effect influence can be measured by an anemometer the anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed and direction 5 1 rigid body and hydrodynamic forces the state vectors are chosen where ν u v r t and η x y ψ t this implies that the dynamics associated with the heave roll and pitch motions are neglected that is w p q 0 for the horizontal motion of a vessel the kinematic equations of motion reduce from the general six dof to one principal rotation about the z axis 3 r i b ψ c o s ψ s i n ψ 0 s i n ψ c o s ψ 0 0 0 1 where r i b is the rotation matrix from inertial to body frame defined by the euler angle ψ in general any movement of the vehicle involves three dof it is convenient to define two coordinate frames as shown in fig 7 it is also common to assume that the craft has homogeneous mass distribution and xz plane symmetry such that 4 i x y i y z 0 5 m r b m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i z notice that surge is decoupled from sway and yaw in m r b due to symmetry considerations of the system inertia matrix it is assumed that

referenced frame is 12 f t h r u s t f 1 f 2 a moment is induced in the yaw direction due to the thrust 13 m t h r u s t y r f 1 f 2 where y r is the distance from the motors to the body center of mass and the difference in the thrust produced by the two thrusters will apply moment according eq 13 on the platform that will change the heading eqs 12 13 can therefore be rewritten as follow 14 f 1 1 2 f t h r u s t 1 2 y r m t h r u s t 15 f 2 1 2 f t h r u s t 1 2 y r m t h r u s t 6 suggested algorithm 6 1 auv tracking approach below an approach using an asv to track an auv is presented the usual technique is to use a support vessel on the surface to track the auv however reliable communication is difficult to establish due to the physical properties of the water especially when transmitting over great distances instead a tracking algorithm using data from the dri 267 ranger system is used the range and direction angle derived are used as input for the attitude and position controllers respectively fig 9 fig 10 shows the asv propulsion system equipped with a dri 267 ranger system the detected distance can be from 1 to 1000 m and the direction is presented in nine discrete bearing ranges as described in table 2 the ranger supplied information can be combined with the known auv depth to estimate the auv s position the relative position between the asv and the auv can be calculated using the following equation x r n 2 d 2 1 2 c o s α 16 y r n 2 d 2 1 2 s i n α where r n is the range and α is the bearing to the auv table 2 both measured by the ranger and d is the depth of the auv as presented in fig 11 the position x and y is calculated using eq 16 in the body frame of the asv and it can be easily transformed into the inertial frame the position error is a function of the bearing angle range and depth range and depth can be measured very accurately with a resolution of within one meter according to the dri and keller x35 depth sensor data sheets keller 2019 however the bearing angle must be taken into account as one of the critical components of error as we can see in table 2 the bearing angle measurement is much more accurate for small angles that is angles between 1 and 3 where the maximum error can be 2 for indicator 3 for example the bearing to the auv is between 8 and 20 and the possible error has increased to 12 6 1 1 auv position uncertainty based on a ranger relative position error between the asv and the auv can been calculated using eq 17 x e r r o r r n r n e r r o r 2 d d e r r o r 2 1 2 c o s α α e r r o r x t r u e 17 y e r r o r r n r n e r r o r 2 d d e r r o r 2 1 2 s i n α α e r r o r y t r u e where x t r u e and y t r u e can be calculated using eq 16 with true values of r n d and α from sensors data sheet follow that r n e r r o r 1 m and d e r r o r 0 1 m when α e r r o r depend on bearing output table 2 and an asv heading uncertainty which is typically 1 sokolović et al 2015 consequently the auv position is highly depend on the range r n and α e r r o r for example at a distance of 100 m and given a bearing output 0 α e r r o r 1 and the asv heading uncertainty of 1 the relative position error between the asv and the auv will be y e r r o r 3 5 m and x e r r o r 0 1 m additionally to the relative position error the asv gps accuracy typically 1 5 m groves 2013 will affect the auv position accuracy however if the bearing output increases to 3 error of 6 the possible error increases to 11 m from this example we thus learn that for this application it is very critical to be able to track with the smallest bearing error possible so as to have a minimum possible position error 6 2 distance and heading controllers 6 2 1 distance controller two assumptions were made for the position controller first that the asv can move faster than the auv so it can close the gap between them and second that the asv cannot move backwards this means that when the distance between the platforms is too close the asv will slow down to minimal speed or stop the thrusters the second assumption is that the auv is generally moving at a constant speed for better performance of the side scan sonar sss given these assumptions we have used a linear asv forward model so that eq 1 can be rewritten as follows 18 m x u u x u u f t h r u s t and a proportional integral pi distance controller in the following form was chosen 19 f t h r u s t k p d e k i d e d t where d e r n t a r g e t r n is the range error to the auv as received from ranger 6 2 2 heading controller the objective of the heading controller is to automatically steer the vehicle in a given desired direction yaw to this end the control algorithm accepts the reference signal ψ as input for example be the bearing output from dri 267 for the heading controller design it is assumed that all state variables are measured in this part we concentrate on the third element of the vector ν r is the rotation speed we will define the rotation subsystem as follows 20 ψ r 21 r 1 i z n r m t h r u s t τ w a v e τ w i n d x u u v y v v u y r r u n v v v v n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r n v v n r r the following attitude controller is defined 22 m t h r u s t k ψ b r τ w a v e τ w i n d x u u v y v v u y r r u n v v v v n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r n v v n r r where k and b are arbitrarily selected constant scalars for proving stability using the lyapunov approach for the non linear heading controller described in eq 22 the following lyapunov candidate function is proposed 23 v ω b η 1 2 k ψ 2 i z n r r 2 substituting eqs 21 and 22 into eq 23 the derivative of the resulting closed loop system namely v k ψ ψ i z n r r r satisfies 24 v k ψ r r k ψ b r b r 2 0 when b is positive invoking lasalle s invariance principle khalil 1996 and considering the null solution r 0 that is the solution of eq 21 is asymptotically stable if v does not vanish identically along any solution of eq 21 other than the null solution thus the nonlinear heading controller is able to deal with speed changes of the asv and with external interference such as winds and sea waves within the limits of the thrusters 7 simulation results to evaluate the performance and behavior of the system using the derived controllers simulations were run based on the model presented in section 5 tracking capability was tested in three different scenarios different initial conditions different target ranges and using a rectangle trajectory as illustrated in figs 12 14 the simulation takes into account the nonlinear response of the ranger table 2 in the first scenario the auv is moving in a straight line the initial position of the auv is assumed to be 0 0 and the initial position of the asv is in three different positions see table 3 the robustness of the tracking algorithm was tested by changing the initial position of the asv in each simulation the target range in these three simulations was set to 100 m and auv speed was 1 1 m s the range and bearing of the asv to the auv are computed based on the simulated positions of the auv fig 12 shows that for most of the time the distance error was less than 5 m the error occurs due to the bearing measurement which can vary between 1 and 1 and which at a distance of 100 m means that the auv position error will be about 2 m eq 16 in the second scenario the auv is following a sine trajectory as presented in fig 13 a the initial positions are assumed to be 0 0 and 100 50 for the auv and asv respectively and the auv speed was 1 m s the target range varies from 10 to 100 m according to fig 13 b more than 90 of the time the error was less than one meter from the defined target the results of the third scenario tracking an auv survey mission are shown in fig 14 a the initial position of the auv is assumed to be 0 10 and the initial position of the asv was 25 25 the target distance between the auv and the asv was 10 m and auv speed was 1 m s fig 14 b illustrates that the error was less than one meter from the tracked platform for over 90 of the time with error occurring mainly during the turns the relatively high error bars greater than 5 m reflect the initial stage of the tracking 7 1 comparison between tracking using a ranger vs usbl to compare the performance of the tracking approach two simulations were completed the first based on a ranger system and the second on a usbl the usbl system was simulated instead of ranger with resolution of 0 25 the tracking capability was tested in two different scenarios a the auv is moving in a straight line and b the auv is following a sine trajectory as illustrated in figs 15 and 16 from figs 15 a and 16 a clearly can be seen that in both scenarios tracking performance were similar 8 experimental results following the simulations the tracking algorithm was tested experimentally on the asv described in section 4 1 the experiments took place on the israeli coast of the red sea several trials were performed using different auv asv ranges and auv depths altitude before starting a series of experiments or after any changes in the asv or auv electronics magnetometer calibration was performed at the beginning of each experiment the auv was on the surface at a distance of about 10 m from the asv as well external effects influence τ w i n d and τ w a v e were updated using meteorological data from the interuniversity institute for marine science in eilat iui iui 2019 a start command was simultaneously sent to both systems whereupon the auv began diving and the asv began searching for the auv by revolving once the asv locked on the auv the tracking algorithm as described in section 6 1 began working for the sake of clarity tracking and position results will be presented separately sections 8 1 and 8 3 respectively the combined tracking distance of the twelve trials was approximately 5 km 8 1 auv tracking by an asv the experimental results of four trials with different ranges and different auv depths altitude and set points which summarize all experiments are shown in figs 17 and 18 during the experiments the auv maintained either constant altitude figs 17 a and 18 a or constant depth figs 17 b 17 d and figs 18 b 18 d each tracking experiment was divided into three different stages i diving maneuver ii cruise maneuver iii ascent maneuver fig 18 illustrated the ranger output and heading controller input as can been seen from fig 17 regardless of range and auv depth altitude the asv performance was satisfied as expected from simulation more detailed comparison between the simulation and the experimental result are presented in the next section the average tracking range error for all the trials was about one meter fig 19 a the normalized histogram of the bearing indicator received from the dri 267 for all the trials is shown in fig 19 b it can be observed that most of the time the bearing angle was between 3 refer again to table 2 8 2 comparison between the simulated model and experimental data a comparison between the simulated model and experimental data can be seen in fig 20 the simulation was performed using initial conditions similar to those of the experiment the previously show the auv s trajectory is divided into three operational stages the asv maintain the target range closely during stage ii while following a similar trajectory to the simulated model during stages i and iii fig 20 a a constant positive bias relative to the target range is observed during stage ii further analysis revealed that the bias is related to four factors ranger inaccuracy error in the determination of the sound velocity the receiver turn around time of the transponder and the influence of winds and waves during the sea experiment the closeness between simulation and experimental data can be further observed by comparing the statistically bearing changes fig 20 b it might be observed that bearing was closely maintained during the experiment 8 3 auv position estimation using tracking data the experimental results of using two surface platforms is presented in this section in this case the asv was supported with a ship equipped with an acoustic modem by using the acoustic modem the auv was able to measure its distance from the ship again the auv s mission can be divided into three main stages as presented in fig 21 the distance and azimuth to the auv as measured by the asv can be used for the auv position estimation for the sake of brevity only a subset of the results are presented here the combined tracking distance of the trials was about 2 km the experimental results of two trials with different range depth and altitude set points are presented in figs 21 and 22 the auv position was estimated in post processing using the data collected from the auv the asv and the supported ship the data was synchronized using the gps clock as can be seen from these figures the estimated position error of the auv upon surfacing and getting a gps fix region iii in fig 21 is about 7 m the position estimation is based on a loosely coupled gps aided strapdown inertial navigation system sins farrell 2008 in this case the ranger system measurements were processed by an outlier filter median absolute deviation verboven and hubert 2005 and then used as pseudo gps input for sins the algorithm equations presented in detail in appendix b due to the lack of a doppler velocity log dvl bottom locking during diving the auv navigation error was about 50 m blue line in both trials where the travel distance was 700 m in the first and 1200 m in the second the ranger navigation error was less than ten meters 9 conclusions the asv was developed mainly as a vehicle to serve as a support platform for and cooperate with an auv and to this purpose it was fitted with an acoustic ranger real experiments successfully demonstrated the asv s ability to autonomously track an auv and serve as a repeater the tracking algorithm is based on a non linear controller which allows to keep the heading of the asv despite the effect of the sea waves this controller keeps the auv in a tight area of a few degrees during the tracking the navigation error using the ranger system does not depend on travel distance as it does when using dead reckoning navigation the proposed approach provides the same accuracy of usbl based tracking systems at lower cost furthermore the experiments showed that these tracking capabilities could significantly improve accuracy in positioning the auv declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a asv parameters

in this appendix the equations of the navigation system will be described for a simple fusion of the ranger system its measurements were used as gps updates the equations and model of the navigation system are based on farrell s error state model farrell 2008 with approximation for low cost sensors and low velocity only several m s which means that the major source of errors derive from the accelerometer and gyroscope errors a short description of the navigation system is given in this section for the convenience of the reader in this paper the state vector that was used for the error

introduction the coastal zone is the interface between land and ocean where both natural and man made hard or soft defences protect the hinterland areas against coastal flooding over the decades conventional coastal engineering solutions result in hard structures such as seawalls dykes and embankments in addition to hard engineering approaches nature based protection approaches such as shingle beaches and barriers are also considered as an efficient coastal protection approach due to its natural capability to mitigate the wave induced energy mccall et al 2014 similar to other coastal infrastructures shingle beaches and barriers can be affected by various wave induced hazards such as flooding due to extreme wave overtopping events eurotop 2018 hence sea defences are usually designed to limit the wave induced overtopping at the structures during an extreme event many parametric experimental studies have been carried out to clarify the phenomenon of wave overtopping on coastal structures with fixed impermeable beaches based on these predominantly small scale laboratory measurements several empirical formulae have been reported for the prediction of overtopping at these types of structures e g eurotop 2018 there have been relatively few studies on the overtopping processes at shingle barriers and beaches see matias et al 2012 pearson 2010 for the prediction of cross shore profile changes on a shingle coastline many researchers proposed empirical prediction models for instance predictions reported by bradbury and powell 1992 lorang 2002 van der meer 1992 van hijum 1976 van hijum and pilarczyk 1982 in addition advances have also been made to compile large scale datasets and to establish appropriate numerical methods for shingle beaches and barriers to cite an example to evaluate the morphological behaviour of shingle beaches and barriers subjected to the action of waves tides and storm an extensive large scale experimental investigation was undertaken e g williams et al 2009 williams et al 2012a alongside the experimental investigations numerical studies on gravel beaches with the application of xbeach model have been performed by researchers e g mccall et al 2015 williams et al 2009 williams et al 2012b the vast majority of overtopping data applied in eurotop 2018 has been derived from small scale measurements with impermeable foreshore slopes to date there have been few parametric studies focussed on the investigation of the wave overtopping at sloping structures with a permeable foreshore slope recent laboratory work by salauddin and pearson 2019 demonstrated that average overtopping rates at a vertical breakwater on a shingle beach is reduced when compared to the impermeable bed configuration however the overtopping performance of permeable gravel foreshores at sloping structures was not covered within the earlier work of salauddin and pearson 2019 there is a knowledge gap on the wave overtopping at sloping walls with permeable gravel slopes due to the lack of field and laboratory research on these types of sea defences the main purpose of this experimental research is to extend the existing empirical predictions of wave overtopping at smooth sloping structures for the case of permeable gravel foreshores this paper extends the earlier research work of salauddin and pearson 2019 who investigated the wave overtopping at plain vertical walls with two permeable gravel foreshores subjected to impulsive and non impulsive wave conditions the extension presented in this article covers a comprehensive experimental study on the overtopping characteristics at 1 in 2 sloping structures conducted on both impermeable and permeable foreshore slopes detailed results on the overtopping characteristics at sloping structures are presented and then compared with existing empirical predictions which provide guidance for overtopping volumes at these types of sea defences these results are intended for practitioners and researchers predicting wave overtopping characteristics at sloping structures with permeable gravel foreshores 2 technical background 2 1 empirical prediction of overtopping wave overtopping or over washing is one of the key hydraulic responses of a coastal structure i e breakwater due to its significant effects on the functional efficiency of a structure franco et al 1994 for the design of a coastal defence the design for tolerable wave overtopping is treated as one of the key concerns by researchers eurotop 2018 at a coastal structure an overtopping event mainly occurs when run up heights of the largest waves are greater than the freeboard of the structure taw 2002 the crest freeboard rc is the vertical distance between the top of the structure and still water level line mean overtopping discharge q in terms of per linear metre of width of the structure l m s is very often used to quantify wave overtopping phenomenon current prediction methods are based on a general exponential equation which is used for describing wave overtopping discharge q on many coastal structures including vertical and sloping structures armoured rubble mound breakwaters coastal dikes etc eurotop 2018 franco et al 1994 owen 1980 the exponential expression as formulated in equation 1 is a special case of the weibull shaped function 1 q g h m 0 3 a exp b r c h m 0 in which q denotes average overtopping discharge h m 0 represents the significant wave height based on spectral analysis a indicates the weibull scale parameter b exhibits the weibull shape parameter r c h m 0 is the dimensionless crest freeboard and q g h m 0 ˆ 3 is defined the dimensionless wave overtopping discharge e g eurotop 2018 the eurotop overtopping manual was published in 2007 eurotop 2007 based upon the most reliable existing empirical formulae from parametric tests further goda 2009 established a set of empirical formulations for the prediction of mean overtopping discharges at sloping structures by analysing the selected clash datasets and argued that new formulas e g equations 2 6 provide better prediction compared to those estimated by eurotop 2007 2 q g h m 0 3 exp a b r c h m 0 where 3 a a 0 tanh 0 956 4 44 tan θ h t h m 0 1 242 2 032 tan 0 25 θ 4 b b 0 tanh 0 822 2 22 tan θ h t h m 0 0 578 2 22 tan θ 5 a 0 3 4 0 734 cot 0 239 cot 2 0 016 cot 3 6 b 0 2 3 0 5 cot 0 15 cot 2 0 011 cot 3 valid for 0 cot 7 where θ is the slope of the seabed α is the slope of the structure and ht is the toe water depth later in 2014 etemad shahidi and jafari provided new formulas equations 7 and 8 for the prediction of mean overtopping rates at smooth impermeable sloping structures using a decision tree approach along with nonlinear regression model they reported that the revised formulas outperform the existing empirical predictions for the estimation of overtopping at sloping structures 7 q g h m 0 3 0 032 exp 2 6 r c h m 0 1 6 ξ m 1 0 1 26 f o r r c h m 0 1 62 8 q g h m 0 3 0 032 exp 5 63 ξ m 1 0 1 26 3 283 r c h m 0 1 62 0 83 f o r r c h m 0 1 62 thereafter van der meer and bruce 2014 proposed a new set of formulae to predict overtopping at sloping structures both for breaking and non breaking waves they reported that the application of goda 2009 formulae should be limited to the slopes steeper than 1 in 2 they also reported that goda 2009 formulae will overestimate wave overtopping at gentle slopes with very low and zero crest freeboards the formulations of van der meer and bruce 2014 were then incorporated into the updated overtopping manual eurotop 2018 for the estimation of mean overtopping discharges at smooth slopping walls under breaking and non breaking wave conditions eurotop 2018 gives the following formulae see equations 9 and 10 for breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 9 q g h m 0 3 0 023 tan α ξ m 1 0 exp 2 7 r c ξ m 1 0 h m 0 γ f 1 3 for non breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 a maximum value of 10 q g h m 0 3 0 09 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 γ f 1 3 where γ f influence factor for roughness elements on a slope it should be noted that for the smooth impermeable slope the roughness factor equals to 1 0 in the above mentioned formulae equations 9 and 10 breaker parameter or iribarren number ξ m 1 0 is the combination of wave steepness and structure slope to distinguish breaking and non breaking waves see equation 11 equation 9 represents the estimation of overtopping for plunging or breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 while equation 10 denotes the maximum overtopping induced by non breaking or surging waves ξ m 1 0 2 see eurotop 2018 for a detailed explanation of breaking and non breaking waves 11 ξ m 1 0 tan h m 0 l m 1 0 where α is the slope of the structure and l m 1 0 is the deep water wave length based on spectral wave period t m 1 0 g t m 1 0 2 2 π the maximum individual overtopping volume v max in a known overtopping sequence can be calculated with the following formula equation 12 maximum individual overtopping volume v max 12 v m a x a ln n o w 1 b where v m a x denotes the maximum wave by wave overtopping volume per meter width of the structure m3 per m and n ow represents the number of overtopping waves eurotop 2018 recommended the following expression equation 8 for the estimation of weibull scale factor a 13 a 1 γ 1 1 b q t m p o v where t m means average wave period p o v probability of overtopping waves and γ denotes mathematical gamma function to determine the weibull shape factor b at smooth sloping structures zanuttigh et al 2013 suggested a new prediction formula equation 14 by presenting a relationship between shape factor and relative discharge q gh m0 t m 1 0 14 b 0 73 55 q g h m 0 t m 1 0 0 8 the number of overtopping waves n ow can be approximated by knowing the probability of overtopping wave and total number of waves in a storm duration see equation 15 as recommended by eurotop 2018 15 p o v n o w n w for the estimation of the probability of overtopping waves p o v van der meer and janssen 1994 provided the following expression equation 16 by considering a rayleigh distribution of the run up heights and with the use of 2 run up height r u 2 16 p o v exp l n 0 02 r c r u 2 2 for a relatively gentle slope with a breaker parameter less than ξ m 1 0 4 0 the following basic formula equation 17 can be applied to estimate the run up heights at smooth sloping structures e g taw 2002 17 r u 2 h m 0 1 65 ξ m 1 0 the empirical formulae equations 16 and 17 as proposed by van der meer and janssen 1994 and taw 2002 respectively are also incorporated in the overtopping manual e g eurotop 2007 eurotop 2018 it is important to note that these formulations are based on the measurement of run up level which is usually calculated at a point on a straight slope but overtopping is measured on or behind the crest of the structure eurotop 2018 hence eurotop 2018 warned that these formulations always overestimate the number of overtopping waves instead of using 2 run up height r u 2 victor et al 2012 proposed another empirical expression equation 18 to estimate probability of overtopping at smooth impermeable slopes with the use of known relative freeboard and slope subjected to non breaking wave attack 18 p o v exp 1 4 0 30 cot r c h m 0 2 the existing prediction formulae currently available are principally founded on the fitting to experimental measurements such as empirical formulae reported in the overtopping manual since most of the parametric studies were performed in the laboratory using an impermeable beach uncertainties may exist in available prediction formulae when applied to permeable gravel slopes 2 2 scaling of shingle bed materials to represent a gravel or shingle bed within the laboratory crushed anthracite has been satisfactorily used as a model beach material by researchers over the years e g powell 1990 coates and dodd 1994 powell 1990 described that the model bed materials should fulfil the following three requirements for the appropriate representation of the prototype beach e g salauddin and pearson 2019 beach permeability should be correctly reproduced in order to get the actual bed slope the threshold of motion has to be accurately replicated in order to find the minimum wave velocity to initiate the movement of the bed the relative magnitudes of the onshore and offshore movement should be precisely reproduced for evaluating whether the accretion or erosion occurs at the bed to fulfil these requirements powell 1990 proposed the methodology of yalin 1963 komer and miller 1973 and dean 1973 for the beach permeability threshold of movement and onshore and offshore movement criteria respectively in summary powell 1990 reported the following formulations equations 19 22 to scale the model bed material for accurate representation of permeability 19 λ d λ k p k r e p λ 1 2 λ d for accurate representation of onshore offshore movement 20 λ δ λ λ cd λ d where 21 λ cd c d p c d r e p λ 1 2 λ d for accurate threshold of motion 22 λ δ λ d 3 4 λ 3 4 where λ is the model scale k p and rep are the permeability and reynolds number of the prototype situation λ δ δ is ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ f and ρ s are the specific gravities of the fluid and sediment respectively c d is the drag coefficient and c dp is the prototype drag coefficient for known prototype values of k p and rep there are four equations to solve for four unknowns λ λ d λ δ and λ cd as also mentioned by powell 1990 that these four formulations can only be solved with the assumption of prototype condition which makes λ λ d λ δ λ cd and subsequently three variables remain as unknown another aspect is that the correct replication of all three criteria is practically unreachable since the model bed materials have only two characteristics size and specific gravity of the sediments in 1990 powell found that the filtered anthracite materials with a quoted specific gravity of 1 39 justify most of the requirements by reproducing the correct magnitudes of onshore offshore movement and threshold of motion later this methodology was adapted by coates and dodd 1994 to scale down a narrow gravel bed d50 of 15 mm with a prototype density of 2 65 t m3 these researchers concluded that at a 1 50 scaling filtered anthracite sediment d50 of 2 50 mm with a density of 1 40 t m3 satisfy the most of the requirements to reproduce an assumed prototype gravel bed d50 of 15 mm in this work the mobile gravel beds were reproduced with the use of the crushed anthracite by adapting the methodology of powell 1990 3 laboratory set up the laboratory set up for this experimental work has been performed by adapting the guidelines of eurotop 2018 and wolters et al 2009 for typical two dimensional wave flume investigations the two dimensional small scale investigations were performed in a wave channel of 22 m long 0 60 m wide and 1 00 m deep 0 70 m operating depth at the warwick water laboratory experiments were carried out with a smooth impermeable 1 2 sloping seawall on a uniform foreshore slope of 1 in 20 e g fig 1 a piston type wave paddle with an active wave absorption system is attached with the wave channel which is able to produce both irregular and uniform waves in this study two different permeable 1 in 20 shingle foreshores were tested to investigate the overtopping characteristics at sloping structures with shingle foreshores in addition to the shingle beds experiments were also undertaken with a uniform impermeable foreshore to study the wave overtopping at a sloping wall with a solid foreshore which allowed comparison to previous studies as reported in eurotop 2018 to perform the experiments on permeable foreshores two different gravel sediments were used and reproduced by crushed anthracite with a quoted specific gravity of 1 40 with the adaption of the well known method of powell 1990 two different assumed prototype gravel slopes d50 of 13 mm and 24 mm with a prototype specific gravity of 2 65 t m3 were reproduced with the use of two different sizes of model sediments at a model length scale of 1 50 for assumed gravel beds d50 of 13 mm and 24 mm with a prototype specific gravity of 2 65 t m3 the required sediment properties are listed in table 1 with the application of expressions as suggested by powell 1990 equation 19 22 as observed in table 1 the model sediment should have a specific gravity around 1 40 to satisfy the requirements of the correct magnitudes of onshore offshore movement and threshold of motion hence the filtered anthracite with a quoted specific gravity of 1 40 has been used in this study which is also commercially available in various sizes in fig 2 the grain size distribution curve of each gravel sediment is presented to measure the incident wave characteristics a total of six wave gauges resistance type were used adopting the method suggested by mansard and funke 1980 the three point technique was executed to separate the incident waves from reflected waves the first set of three gauges were placed close to the wave generator to measure the wave characteristics at comparatively deep water in addition three probes number 4 5 and 6 in fig 1 were positioned at the toe of the sloping structure to measure the inshore wave conditions the gauge number 6 fig 1 at the toe of the structure was set up adopting the method of klopman and van der meer 1999 in order to reduce the influence of a reflective structure on the measured incident wave heights although the paddle was equipped with an active absorption system to compensate the reflected waves originating from the structure due to the presence of reflections induced by structure there may be existence of uncertainties in the determination of incident inshore wave characteristics thus to reduce probable uncertainties in the measurement of inshore wave characteristics the measurements were also carried out by repeating the experiments without the existence of the sloping walls in the flume bare flume the overtopping discharges were determined using a load cell technique by suspending a measuring container behind the sloping wall from a calibrated load cell see fig 1 wave by wave overtopping events were identified by using two parallel strips of metal tape run along the crest of the sloping wall which performed as a switch closed by the water individual overtopping volumes were calculated by measuring the increment in the mass of overtopped water in the container after each overtopping event for a test run a parameterized jonswap wave spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 σ a 0 07 and σ b 0 09 was applied each experiment consisted of approximately 1000 random waves as suggested by eurotop 2018 and wolters et al 2009 this enabled the acquisition of the measured overtopping characteristics which were statistically independent of the storm duration number of waves for the experiment run prior to running of each experiment with shingle bed configurations the gravel foreshore slope was reshaped to the initial beach profile of 1 20 in front of the sloping structure under the gravel foreshore configurations measurements of the scour hole depth at the toe of the sloping wall were also carried out furthermore for each test run the bed level changes along the foreshore were also investigated from the variation of initial and final elevation of the foreshore from the investigation on the development of scour depths with respect to storm durations it was observed that an equilibrium profile can be achieved at around 1000 wave cycles which are similar to studies by sumer and fredsøe 2000 at a 1 in 1 2 sloping wall on a sandy bed and salauddin and pearson 2019 at a plain vertical wall with permeable gravel foreshore both low and high wave steepnesses were generated by performing experiments with two constant nominal deep water wave steepnesses sop 0 02 and 0 05 at a 1 50 scaling the incident significant wave heights h m0 were tested from 50 mm to 160 mm and corresponding wave periods were in the range of 0 80 s 2 26 s six different toe water depths were tested in this study in total around 180 test sequences were performed see table 2 table 3 reports the nominal incident wave conditions followed in this research it is noted that the nominal incident wave conditions as presented in table 3 were applied to both impermeable and permeable slopes indicating that one group of three tests was performed with the same incident wave condition with the three foreshores furthermore table 4 shows the ranges of application for the sloping structure with impermeable and permeable slopes considered within this study as it is seen in table 4 the tested relative crest freeboards were in the range from 0 80 to 4 50 for both impermeable and permeable foreshore configurations the minimum iribarren number was equal to 2 0 indicating that tested wave conditions were non breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 eurotop 2018 on a relatively steep 1 in 2 smooth sloping structure 4 results and analysis 4 1 incident wave heights in fig 3 two examples of measured incident wave heights at a relatively deep water near wave paddle are presented and compared with the deep water rayleigh distribution of wave heights from the graph it is noticeable that the measured wave heights overall follow the predicted rayleigh distribution for both low and high wave steepnesses there is however data points that correspond to relatively high waves that were found slightly lower than the prediction which may have occurred due to the occurrence of wave breaking near the wave paddle under depth limited conditions 4 2 accuracy of measurement system the accuracy of the overtopping measurement system was inspected prior to carrying out any experiments adapting the technique followed by pearson et al 2001 a series of wave overtopping events were simulated by adding a known amount of water into the overtopping measuring tank then the observed data from the overtopping detector and load cell were processed by using an algorithm to find the number of overtopping waves and resulting individual overtopping volumes afterwards the actual volume of each simulated overtopping event was compared with the measured value e g table 5 the test results clearly demonstrate that the measured overtopping volumes were almost identical to actual given values the relative error of total measured volumes and actual volumes was found satisfactory around 0 7 and rmse root mean square error value was observed 9 38 ml indicating that any errors induced by the overtopping measurement technique were minimal it is to note that the sensitivity of the load cell was limited to the identification of 5 9 ml of overtopping volume hence the smaller overtopping volumes showed an overall slightly greater error in the measurements compared to larger values 4 3 mean overtopping rate in fig 4 the measured relative overtopping discharges q gh m0 3 for the impermeable foreshore configuration reference case are compared with the predicted values using the existing empirical predictions for sloping structures to predict the mean overtopping rates the empirical predictions of goda 2009 etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and eurotop 2018 are presented in fig 4a b and 4 c respectively it can be seen from fig 4a that the predictions of the goda 2009 formulae equations 2 6 overestimate the mean overtopping rates at sloping structures 1 in 2 for the tested conditions covered within this study similar characteristics of goda s formulae for the prediction of mean overtopping rates at sloping structures with gentle slopes milder than 1 in 2 were also reported by van der meer and bruce 2014 when comparing the results of the reference case with the empirical formulae of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and eurotop 2018 it is seen that both the predictions of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 equations 7 and 8 and eurotop 2018 equations 9 and 10 overall succeed in providing the estimation of the mean overtopping rate see fig 4 however it is also noticeable that the measured values overall show slightly better agreement with the predicted values of eurotop 2018 compared to the those observed by etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 for the quantitative comparison of the accuracy of the prediction formulae the statistical error analysis such as root mean square error rmse and bias analysis have been undertaken and reported in table 6 the root mean square error rmse analysis and bias analysis were performed with the use of measured and estimated values of overtopping using empirical formulations as defined in equations 23 and 24 as seen in table 6 the prediction formulae of eurotop 2018 outperforms the predictions of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and goda 2009 by providing relatively lower rmse and bias values for the tested impermeable bed configurations 23 rmse 1 n t e s t n 1 n t e s t log q m e a s u r e d g h m 0 3 n log q p r e d i c t e d g h m 0 3 n 2 24 bias 1 n t e s t n 1 n t e s t log q p r e d i c t e d g h m 0 3 n log q m e a s u r e d g h m 0 3 n in which ntest is defined as the number of experimental results used to derive an equation the smaller rmse value means the better prediction formula which fits the specific dataset well the rmse value demonstrates the standard deviation of the measured values about the mean predicted overtopping rates on a log log scale the measured average overtopping rates for both impermeable reference case and gravel bed configurations are plotted in fig 5 the experimental results are compared with the prediction formulae equations 9 and 10 for sloping structures as reported by eurotop 2018 the solid line in fig 5 represents the empirical expression of eurotop 2018 considering an impermeable foreshore the graph demonstrates that average overtopping discharges are reduced substantially for permeable gravel foreshore configurations compared to those observed for impermeable slope from fig 5 it is also observed that the shingle foreshore of prototype grain diameter of 24 mm provide a greater reduction in mean overtopping rate when the two permeable bed configurations are compared an r2 best fit analysis was performed on the resulting average overtopping discharges to observe the reduction margin with the introduction of gravel foreshores compared to an impermeable slope see equations 25 and 26 it is noticeable that the overtopping is decreased by an approximate factor of 3 0 for gravel d50 of 13 mm and about a factor of 4 0 for d50 of 24 mm in comparison to the formulation equation 1 of eurotop 2018 it is important to note that best fit equations have been derived by adapting the formulations of eurotop 2018 which enables a direct comparison between new equations and existing empirical formulae for gravel d50 of 13 mm 25 q g h m 0 3 0 03 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 1 3 for gravel d50 of 24 mm 26 q g h m 0 3 0 0225 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 1 3 to investigate the reliability of the new equations a root mean square error rmse analysis was performed with the use of measured and predicted values of overtopping using new equations equations 25 and 26 as following the approach applied by owen 1980 and victor et al 2012 see equation 23 in addition to rmse analysis bias analysis was also carried out to find the reliability of the derived equations see equation 24 in table 7 the error measures of the proposed revised equations in the prediction of mean overtopping rate at sloping walls with permeable foreshores are shown for the conditions tested the rmse value based on the measured and estimated values of overtopping was only 0 14 and 0 15 for gravel d50 of 13 mm equation 25 and d50 of 24 mm equation 26 respectively see table 7 similar to rmse values the observed bias values for the new formulations were also smaller i e 0 03 for equation 25 and 0 10 for equation 26 these indicate that despite some scatter in general the predictions by using the revised expressions equations 25 and 26 exhibit a promising trend with the actual measurements furthermore in the prediction of overtopping at sloping structures the effect of various factors such as influence of roughness factor of the armour slope influence of berm etc in the reduction of overtopping is often incorporated by using a gamma factor in the empirical expression such as roughness factor of the sloping structure in equation 10 to adopt a simple overall coefficient approach for the influence of permeable foreshore in the wave overtopping measured mean overtopping rates are compared with various assumed foreshore roughness factors in fig 6 using the empirical formulation of eurotop 2018 the solid line represents the prediction of eurotop 2018 considering a gamma factor equals to 1 0 for the impermeable foreshore using equation 10 although it is evident from the graph that test results of permeable foreshores do not perfectly fit with all data using the best fit empirical lines assuming foreshore roughness factors i e gamma factor of 0 70 for d50 of 24 mm and 0 80 for d50 of 13 mm using equation 5 nevertheless an approximate trend is observed 4 4 mean overtopping sediment discharge for the estimation of the average overtopping sediment rate the mass of sediment overtopped in the collection tank was measured dry weight along with the mass of the water passing the parapet of the sloping wall the dry weight of the sediments was then transformed to a volume with the use of the quoted specific gravity of 1 40 in order to make sure that the measurements were dimensionally comparable fig 7 illustrates the measured mean overtopping characteristics of the sediment and the overtopping characteristics of the water for the tested shingle foreshore configurations the resulting data points demonstrate that the amount of sediment passes the parapet of the structure is approximately 1 of the amount of water also it is noticeable from the graph that there is no apparent effect of the size of the shingle foreshore slope on the overtopping of the sediment material at sloping seawall 4 5 distribution of wave by wave volumes wave by wave individual overtopping volumes in an overtopping sequence can be fitted with a weibull distribution e g van der meer and janssen 1994 besley 1999 hughes et al 2012 for robust predictions of maximum overtopping volumes it is important to have a good distribution of wave by wave individual overtopping volumes to examine the distribution of measured volumes the observed individual overtopping volumes for each tested condition were investigated on a weibull scale fig 8 shows the resulting weibull distribution of individual overtopping volumes for three distinct tested foreshore slopes for the same wave condition in graph v denotes wave by wave overtopping volume p v is the probability that an individual event volume equals or exceeds a volume v and v bar represents average overtopping volume the graph fig 8d provides a comparison of the distribution of overtopping volumes between impermeable and permeable foreshore slopes from the gradient of linear regression line of the weibull distribution the weibull b parameter can be calculated for an overtopping sequence it has been demonstrated by many researchers that the higher individual overtopping volumes provide a good fit to the distribution with a reliable prediction of extreme wave by wave volumes e g pearson et al 2002 and zanuttigh et al 2013 in general the designers and practitioners are mainly interested on the largest individual overtopping volumes hence the shape factor b is usually determined by fitting only the extreme tail of the distribution upper portion of the weibull plot using the relatively large overtopping volumes in this study the weibull b has been determined for all the tested conditions by plotting a best fitted trend line using the conventional fitting procedure i e upper part of the weibull distribution considering overtopping volumes greater than the average values v v bar as indicated in fig 8 overall the measured data points follow a linear trend which indicates that the resulting wave by wave volumes follow the weibull distribution within this study see fig 8a c it is noticeable from fig 8d that the overtopping volumes distribution for different bed configurations are very similar to each other which indicates that there is no obvious influence of gravel foreshore configurations on the weibull distribution of overtopping volumes 4 6 proportion of waves overtopping the measured proportion of waves overtopping as a function of dimensionless freeboard is plotted in fig 9 the graph compares the results of this study with the empirical prediction equation 18 reported by victor et al 2012 the data points correspond to the benchmark tests represent the experiments with the impermeable foreshore these follow the victor et al 2012 prediction to within a factor of 2 for the tested conditions the measured proportion of waves overtopping is reduced by an average of 50 for relative freeboards of 1 0 2 0 compared with the predictions whereas on an average 75 reduction was observed for relative freeboards of 2 0 3 5 when comparing the two gravel slopes it is noticeable that the larger gravel d50 of 24 mm provides a higher overall reduction in the proportion of waves overtopping in fig 10 the resulting proportion of overtopping waves are compared with the predicted values equations 16 and 17 as reported by eurotop 2018 for both impermeable and permeable configurations it is evident that the measured values are lower than the estimated values of eurotop 2018 as expected this occurs due to the overestimation of the number of overtopping waves by using the predictions of eurotop 2018 an investigation of the time series showed that for the smaller waves such as for wave height of 50 mm for the model shingle d50 of 2 1 mm hm0 d50 25 the shingle beach was more efficient in reducing the number of overtopping waves and hence mean overtopping discharge rates 4 7 maximum overtopping volume for the tested conditions fig 11 compares the measured maximum overtopping wave volumes at sloping seawalls with the empirical prediction as suggested by victor et al 2012 the resulting data points correspond to both impermeable and gravel foreshore configurations approximately following the trend of that reported by victor et al 2012 it is evident that there is no discernible variation in the prediction of the maximum volumes for impermeable and permeable foreshores at sloping structures similar characteristics of the overtopping wave volumes with respect to different foreshore configurations were also reported by salauddin and pearson 2019 for vertical breakwaters with permeable shingle foreshores 5 discussion a wide range of experiments were conducted in this study to inspect the overtopping characteristics at a smooth sloping structure on impermeable and permeable gravel foreshores and to provide the preliminary guidelines for the prediction of processes at full scale generally in the investigation of overtopping processes pearson et al 2002 reported that the scale and model effects in the two dimensional wave flume physical experiments showed no discernible differences in comparison to the large scale laboratory measurements for impermeable configurations e g vertical walls in addition victor and troch 2012 concluded that for the smooth impermeable sloping structures the influence of scale effects is believed to be minimal in the wave overtopping measurements in this study the experimental set up has been complimented by adapting the well established guidelines of eurotop 2018 powell 1990 and wolters et al 2009 for typical two dimensional experimental investigations the tested significant wave heights were varied from 50 mm up to 160 mm which were higher than the minimum wave heights of 30 mm as suggested by wolters et al 2009 to avoid scale effects in the measurements during the experiments an active re reflected wave absorber system was available in order to reduce the model effects induced by reflection from the model boundaries in addition tests were complimented without the existence of any structure bare flume in the wave channel in order to validate the inshore wave conditions the measured incident wave conditions within this study overall follow the rayleigh distribution at deep water the resulting overtopping from benchmark experiments impermeable foreshore showed a good agreement with the empirical prediction of eurotop 2018 for both permeable and impermeable slopes it was also observed that the distribution of wave by wave volumes follow the two parameter weibull distribution therefore it is anticipated that the proposed revised prediction methods from this two dimensional experimental research study would be applicable at prototype conditions with minimal scale and model effects even though the further validation of the dataset would be desirable 6 implications for prediction methods to estimate the overtopping characteristics at a sloping wall on a gravel foreshore to date there are relatively limited prediction tools available in the literature for a traditional impermeable foreshore slope the new manual eurotop 2018 recommended equations 9 and 10 for the estimation of average overtopping rates at sloping structures it is important to note that to predict the mean overtopping discharges at sloping walls with permeable foreshores the prediction guidance suggested in this study can be considered as a development of those described in the overtopping manual within the experimental limitations the results of this study demonstrate that the average overtopping discharge is reduced noticeably for permeable gravel beaches when compared to an impermeable slope reference case therefore a new set of prediction formulae equations 25 and 26 is proposed in this study for the estimation of average overtopping rates at a 1 in 2 sloping wall with a permeable gravel 1 in 20 foreshore configuration a conservative method is suggested i e an impermeable slope see empirical expressions equations 9 and 10 as described by eurotop 2018 when there is no other information available for the estimation of the average sediment discharges at a sloping structure on a permeable shingle beach to date there is no guidance available based on an analysis of the measured average sediment discharge it is recommended to expect up to 1 of the sediment material within the overtopping waves as observed in fig 10 the measured values of probability of overtopping waves at a sloping structure on a gravel foreshore were lower compared to the impermeable foreshore however the measured maximum individual wave overtopping volumes for shingle beaches do not vary significantly within a factor of 2 from those obtained for impermeable slopes as shown in fig 11 a correlation between overtopping wave volumes and number of overtopping waves for both impermeable and shingle beds is presented in fig 12 also shows a comparison of the distribution of overtopping volumes for various foreshore configurations for an incident wave height hm0 of 100 mm with a wave steepness sm 1 0 of 0 06 it is noticeable that for the impermeable foreshore configuration a higher number of overtopping waves compared to the shingle foreshores for the same wave condition is observed for example the data points corresponding to the solid foreshore slope represent around 49 of overtopping waves while the shingle bed d50 of 13 mm and d50 of 24 mm provide about 33 and 32 respectively it is however noticeable that the maximum wave by wave overtopping volumes on gravel beds overall do not differ significantly from those reported on impermeable beach configuration for instance the graph fig 12 shows that the maximum individual overtopping volume of 3 0 l per m width for the impermeable foreshore and 2 9 l per m width for shingle bed d50 of 13 mm this indicates that permeable shingle beaches lead to less wave overtopping events and hence lower mean overtopping discharges but the maximum individual overtopping volumes are similar for both cases considering the random characteristics of wave by wave overtopping volumes the updated eurotop manual eurotop 2018 also emphasized the significance of the influence of individual overtopping volumes on the tolerable overtopping discharges we therefore recommend a conservative prediction of maximum individual overtopping volumes at sloping walls with permeable shingle beaches i e the predictions as stated by eurotop 2018 considering a solid foreshore slope is suggested 7 conclusions the average overtopping discharge average sediment discharge proportion of overtopping waves and wave by wave overtopping volumes on a sloping structure for both impermeable and permeable gravel foreshore configurations have been studied based on the experimental results and through a comparison with existing empirical formulations from literature our conclusions are summarised as follows the measured baseline overtopping characteristics corresponding to the impermeable beach configuration control condition correlated well with the existing predictions for the tested conditions the results on mean overtopping discharge showed that the overtopping is reduced for permeable foreshore slopes in comparison to impermeable slopes a reduction factor of 3 0 and 4 0 was reported for the gravel bed d50 prototype of 13 mm and d50 of 24 mm respectively the measured volume of overtopped sediment was found approximately 1 of the total overtopping volume for the conditions covered within this study for the tested conditions the measured proportion of waves reduced by an average of 50 for relative freeboards of 1 0 2 0 compared with the empirical predictions whereas on an average 75 reduction was observed for relative freeboards of 2 0 3 5 the measured values of wave by wave and maximum overtopping volumes for shingle beaches were somewhat similar within a factor of 2 to those measured for impermeable slopes this indicates that there is no obvious influence of gravel foreshore configurations on the weibull distribution of overtopping volumes as well as on the maximum individual overtopping volumes for the conditions tested within this study for the prediction of overtopping

22131,the vast majority of overtopping data applied in eurotop 2018 has been made from small scale measurements with impermeable foreshore slopes this article describes a comprehensive two dimensional experimental study conducted in a small scale 1 50 wave flume results are presented for the overtopping performance at a 1 to 2 sloping wall undertaken on both impermeable and permeable foreshore slopes within experimental limitations the results demonstrated that the mean overtopping rate is reduced by up to a factor of 4 when compared to the predictions reported for the impermeable slope however when comparing maximum individual wave by wave overtopping volumes no significant differences were observed these results are intended for practitioners and researchers predicting wave overtopping characteristics at sloping structures with permeable gravel foreshores keywords overtopping discharge wave by wave overtopping volume sediment rate shingle foreshore sloping structure 1 introduction the coastal zone is the interface between land and ocean where both natural and man made hard or soft defences protect the hinterland areas against coastal flooding over the decades conventional coastal engineering solutions result in hard structures such as seawalls dykes and embankments in addition to hard engineering approaches nature based protection approaches such as shingle beaches and barriers are also considered as an efficient coastal protection approach due to its natural capability to mitigate the wave induced energy mccall et al 2014 similar to other coastal infrastructures shingle beaches and barriers can be affected by various wave induced hazards such as flooding due to extreme wave overtopping events eurotop 2018 hence sea defences are usually designed to limit the wave induced overtopping at the structures during an extreme event many parametric experimental studies have been carried out to clarify the phenomenon of wave overtopping on coastal structures with fixed impermeable beaches based on these predominantly small scale laboratory measurements several empirical formulae have been reported for the prediction of overtopping at these types of structures e g eurotop 2018 there have been relatively few studies on the overtopping processes at shingle barriers and beaches see matias et al 2012 pearson 2010 for the prediction of cross shore profile changes on a shingle coastline many researchers proposed empirical prediction models for instance predictions reported by bradbury and powell 1992 lorang 2002 van der meer 1992 van hijum 1976 van hijum and pilarczyk 1982 in addition advances have also been made to compile large scale datasets and to establish appropriate numerical methods for shingle beaches and barriers to cite an example to evaluate the morphological behaviour of shingle beaches and barriers subjected to the action of waves tides and storm an extensive large scale experimental investigation was undertaken e g williams et al 2009 williams et al 2012a alongside the experimental investigations numerical studies on gravel beaches with the application of xbeach model have been performed by researchers e g mccall et al 2015 williams et al 2009 williams et al 2012b the vast majority of overtopping data applied in eurotop 2018 has been derived from small scale measurements with impermeable foreshore slopes to date there have been few parametric studies focussed on the investigation of the wave overtopping at sloping structures with a permeable foreshore slope recent laboratory work by salauddin and pearson 2019 demonstrated that average overtopping rates at a vertical breakwater on a shingle beach is reduced when compared to the impermeable bed configuration however the overtopping performance of permeable gravel foreshores at sloping structures was not covered within the earlier work of salauddin and pearson 2019 there is a knowledge gap on the wave overtopping at sloping walls with permeable gravel slopes due to the lack of field and laboratory research on these types of sea defences the main purpose of this experimental research is to extend the existing empirical predictions of wave overtopping at smooth sloping structures for the case of permeable gravel foreshores this paper extends the earlier research work of salauddin and pearson 2019 who investigated the wave overtopping at plain vertical walls with two permeable gravel foreshores subjected to impulsive and non impulsive wave conditions the extension presented in this article covers a comprehensive experimental study on the overtopping characteristics at 1 in 2 sloping structures conducted on both impermeable and permeable foreshore slopes detailed results on the overtopping characteristics at sloping structures are presented and then compared with existing empirical predictions which provide guidance for overtopping volumes at these types of sea defences these results are intended for practitioners and researchers predicting wave overtopping characteristics at sloping structures with permeable gravel foreshores 2 technical background 2 1 empirical prediction of overtopping wave overtopping or over washing is one of the key hydraulic responses of a coastal structure i e breakwater due to its significant effects on the functional efficiency of a structure franco et al 1994 for the design of a coastal defence the design for tolerable wave overtopping is treated as one of the key concerns by researchers eurotop 2018 at a coastal structure an overtopping event mainly occurs when run up heights of the largest waves are greater than the freeboard of the structure taw 2002 the crest freeboard rc is the vertical distance between the top of the structure and still water level line mean overtopping discharge q in terms of per linear metre of width of the structure l m s is very often used to quantify wave overtopping phenomenon current prediction methods are based on a general exponential equation which is used for describing wave overtopping discharge q on many coastal structures including vertical and sloping structures armoured rubble mound breakwaters coastal dikes etc eurotop 2018 franco et al 1994 owen 1980 the exponential expression as formulated in equation 1 is a special case of the weibull shaped function 1 q g h m 0 3 a exp b r c h m 0 in which q denotes average overtopping discharge h m 0 represents the significant wave height based on spectral analysis a indicates the weibull scale parameter b exhibits the weibull shape parameter r c h m 0 is the dimensionless crest freeboard and q g h m 0 ˆ 3 is defined the dimensionless wave overtopping discharge e g eurotop 2018 the eurotop overtopping manual was published in 2007 eurotop 2007 based upon the most reliable existing empirical formulae from parametric tests further goda 2009 established a set of empirical formulations for the prediction of mean overtopping discharges at sloping structures by analysing the selected clash datasets and argued that new formulas e g equations 2 6 provide better prediction compared to those estimated by eurotop 2007 2 q g h m 0 3 exp a b r c h m 0 where 3 a a 0 tanh 0 956 4 44 tan θ h t h m 0 1 242 2 032 tan 0 25 θ 4 b b 0 tanh 0 822 2 22 tan θ h t h m 0 0 578 2 22 tan θ 5 a 0 3 4 0 734 cot 0 239 cot 2 0 016 cot 3 6 b 0 2 3 0 5 cot 0 15 cot 2 0

and 8 for the prediction of mean overtopping rates at smooth impermeable sloping structures using a decision tree approach along with nonlinear regression model they reported that the revised formulas outperform the existing empirical predictions for the estimation of overtopping at sloping structures 7 q g h m 0 3 0 032 exp 2 6 r c h m 0 1 6 ξ m 1 0 1 26 f o r r c h m 0 1 62 8 q g h m 0 3 0 032 exp 5 63 ξ m 1 0 1 26 3 283 r c h m 0 1 62 0 83 f o r r c h m 0 1 62 thereafter van der meer and bruce 2014 proposed a new set of formulae to predict overtopping at sloping structures both for breaking and non breaking waves they reported that the application of goda 2009 formulae should be limited to the slopes steeper than 1 in 2 they also reported that goda 2009 formulae will overestimate wave overtopping at gentle slopes with very low and zero crest freeboards the formulations of van der meer and bruce 2014 were then incorporated into the updated overtopping manual eurotop 2018 for the estimation of mean overtopping discharges at smooth slopping walls under breaking and non breaking wave conditions eurotop 2018 gives the following formulae see equations 9 and 10 for breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 9 q g h m 0 3 0 023 tan α ξ m 1 0 exp 2 7 r c ξ m 1 0 h m 0 γ f 1 3 for non breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 a maximum value of 10 q g h m 0 3 0 09 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 γ f 1 3 where γ f influence factor for roughness elements on a slope it should be noted that for the smooth impermeable slope the roughness factor equals to 1 0 in the above mentioned formulae equations 9 and 10 breaker parameter or iribarren number ξ m 1 0 is the combination of wave steepness and structure slope to distinguish breaking and non breaking waves see equation 11 equation 9 represents the estimation of overtopping for plunging or breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 while equation 10 denotes the maximum overtopping induced by non breaking or surging waves ξ m 1 0 2 see eurotop 2018 for a detailed explanation of breaking and non breaking waves 11 ξ m 1 0 tan h m 0 l m 1 0 where α is the slope of the structure and l m 1 0 is the deep water wave length based on spectral wave period t m 1 0 g t m 1 0 2 2 π the maximum individual overtopping volume v max in a known overtopping sequence can be calculated with the following formula equation 12 maximum individual overtopping volume v max 12 v m a x a ln n o w 1 b where v m a x denotes the maximum wave by wave overtopping volume per meter width of the structure m3 per m and n ow represents the number of overtopping waves eurotop 2018 recommended the following expression equation 8 for the estimation of weibull scale factor a 13 a 1 γ 1 1 b q t m p o v where t m means average wave period p o v probability of overtopping waves and γ denotes mathematical gamma function to determine the weibull shape factor b at smooth sloping structures zanuttigh et al 2013 suggested a new prediction formula equation 14 by presenting a relationship between shape factor and relative discharge q gh m0 t m 1 0 14 b 0 73 55 q g h m 0 t m 1 0 0 8 the number of overtopping waves n ow can be approximated by knowing the probability of

der meer and janssen 1994 provided the following expression equation 16 by considering a rayleigh distribution of the run up heights and with the use of 2 run up height r u 2 16 p o v exp l n 0 02 r c r u 2 2 for a relatively gentle slope with a breaker parameter less than ξ m 1 0 4 0 the following basic formula equation 17 can be applied to estimate the run up heights at smooth sloping structures e g taw 2002 17 r u 2 h m 0 1 65 ξ m 1 0 the empirical formulae equations 16 and 17 as proposed by van der meer and janssen 1994 and taw 2002 respectively are also incorporated in the overtopping manual e g eurotop 2007 eurotop 2018 it is important to note that these formulations are based on the measurement of run up level which is usually calculated at a point on a straight slope but overtopping is measured on or behind the crest of the structure eurotop 2018 hence eurotop 2018 warned that these formulations always overestimate the number of overtopping waves instead of using 2 run up height r u 2 victor et al 2012 proposed another empirical expression equation 18 to estimate probability of overtopping at smooth impermeable slopes with the use of known relative freeboard and slope subjected to non breaking wave attack 18 p o v exp 1 4 0 30 cot r c h m 0 2 the existing prediction formulae currently available are principally founded on the fitting to experimental measurements such as empirical formulae reported in the overtopping manual since most of the parametric studies were performed in the laboratory using an impermeable beach uncertainties may exist in available prediction formulae when applied to permeable gravel slopes 2 2 scaling of shingle bed materials to represent a gravel or shingle bed within the laboratory crushed anthracite has been satisfactorily used as a model beach material by researchers over the years e g powell 1990 coates and dodd 1994 powell 1990 described that the model bed materials should fulfil the following three requirements for the appropriate representation of the prototype beach e g salauddin and pearson 2019 beach permeability should be correctly reproduced in order to get the actual bed slope the threshold of motion has to be accurately replicated in order to find the minimum wave velocity to initiate the movement of the bed the relative magnitudes of the onshore and offshore movement should be precisely reproduced for evaluating whether the accretion or erosion occurs at the bed to fulfil these requirements powell 1990 proposed the methodology of yalin 1963 komer and miller 1973 and dean 1973 for the beach permeability threshold of movement and onshore and offshore movement criteria respectively in summary powell 1990 reported the following formulations equations 19 22 to scale the model bed material for accurate representation of permeability 19 λ d λ k p k r e p λ 1 2 λ d for accurate representation of onshore offshore movement 20 λ δ λ λ cd λ d where 21 λ cd c d p c d r e p λ 1 2 λ d for accurate threshold of motion 22 λ δ λ d 3 4 λ 3 4 where λ is the model scale k p and rep are the permeability and reynolds number of the prototype situation λ δ δ is ρ s ρ f ρ f ρ f and ρ s are the specific gravities of the fluid and sediment respectively c d is the drag coefficient and c dp is the prototype drag coefficient for known prototype values of k p and rep there are four equations to solve for four unknowns λ λ d λ δ and λ cd as also mentioned by powell 1990 that these four formulations can only be solved with the assumption of prototype condition which makes λ λ d λ δ λ cd and subsequently three variables remain as unknown another aspect is that the correct replication of all three criteria is practically unreachable since the model bed materials have only two characteristics size and specific gravity of the sediments in 1990 powell found that the filtered anthracite materials with a quoted specific gravity of 1 39 justify most of the requirements by reproducing the correct magnitudes of onshore offshore movement and threshold of motion later this methodology was adapted by coates and dodd 1994 to scale down a narrow gravel bed d50 of 15 mm with a prototype density of 2 65 t m3 these researchers concluded that at a 1 50 scaling filtered anthracite sediment d50 of 2 50 mm with a density of 1 40 t m3 satisfy the most of the requirements to reproduce an assumed prototype gravel bed d50 of 15 mm in this work the mobile gravel beds were reproduced with the use of the crushed anthracite by adapting the methodology of powell 1990 3 laboratory set up the laboratory set up for this experimental work has been performed by adapting the guidelines of eurotop 2018 and wolters et al 2009 for typical two dimensional wave flume investigations the two dimensional small scale investigations were performed in a wave channel of 22 m long 0 60 m wide and 1 00 m deep 0 70 m operating depth at the warwick water laboratory experiments were carried out with a smooth impermeable 1 2 sloping seawall on a uniform foreshore slope of 1 in 20 e g fig 1 a piston type wave paddle with an active wave absorption system is attached with the wave channel which is able to produce both irregular and uniform waves in this study two different permeable 1 in 20 shingle foreshores were tested to investigate the overtopping characteristics at sloping structures with shingle foreshores in addition to the shingle beds experiments were also undertaken with a uniform impermeable foreshore to study the wave overtopping at a sloping wall with a solid foreshore which allowed comparison to previous studies as reported in eurotop 2018 to perform the experiments on permeable foreshores two different gravel sediments were used and reproduced by crushed anthracite with a quoted specific gravity of 1 40 with the adaption of the well known method of powell 1990 two different assumed prototype gravel slopes d50 of 13 mm and 24 mm with a prototype specific gravity of 2 65 t m3 were reproduced with the use of two different sizes of model sediments at a model length scale of 1 50 for assumed gravel beds d50 of 13 mm and 24 mm with a prototype specific gravity of 2 65 t m3 the required sediment properties are listed in table 1 with the application of expressions as suggested by powell 1990 equation 19 22 as observed in table 1 the model sediment should have a specific gravity around 1 40 to satisfy the requirements of the correct magnitudes of onshore offshore movement and threshold of motion hence the filtered anthracite with a quoted specific gravity of 1 40 has been used in this study which is also commercially available in various sizes in fig 2 the grain size distribution curve of each gravel sediment is presented to measure the incident wave characteristics a total of six wave gauges resistance type were used adopting the method suggested by mansard and funke 1980 the three point technique was executed to separate the incident waves from reflected waves the first set of three gauges were placed close to the wave generator to measure the wave characteristics at comparatively deep water in addition three probes number 4 5 and 6 in fig 1 were positioned at the toe of the sloping structure to measure the inshore wave conditions the gauge number 6 fig 1 at the toe of the structure was set up adopting the method of klopman and van der meer 1999 in order to reduce the influence of a reflective structure on the measured incident wave heights although the paddle was equipped with an active absorption system to compensate the reflected waves originating from the structure due to the presence of reflections induced by structure there may be existence of uncertainties in the determination of incident inshore wave characteristics thus to reduce probable uncertainties in the measurement of inshore wave characteristics the measurements were also carried out by repeating the experiments without the existence of the sloping walls in the flume bare flume the overtopping discharges were determined using a load cell technique by suspending a measuring container behind the sloping wall from a calibrated load cell see fig 1 wave by wave overtopping events were identified by using two parallel strips of metal tape run along the crest of the sloping wall which performed as a switch closed by the water individual overtopping volumes were calculated by measuring the increment in the mass of overtopped water in the container after each overtopping event for a test run a parameterized jonswap wave spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 σ a 0 07 and σ b 0 09 was applied each experiment consisted of approximately 1000 random waves as suggested by eurotop 2018 and wolters et al 2009 this enabled the acquisition of the measured overtopping characteristics which were statistically independent of the storm duration number of waves for the experiment run prior to running of each experiment with shingle bed configurations the gravel foreshore slope was reshaped to the initial beach profile of 1 20 in front of the sloping structure under the gravel foreshore configurations measurements of the scour hole depth at the toe of the sloping wall were also carried out furthermore for each test run the bed level changes along the foreshore were also investigated from the variation of initial and final elevation of the foreshore from the investigation on the development of scour depths with respect to storm durations it was observed that an equilibrium profile can be achieved at around 1000 wave cycles which are similar to studies by sumer and fredsøe 2000 at a 1 in 1 2 sloping wall on a sandy bed and salauddin and pearson 2019 at a plain vertical wall with permeable gravel foreshore both low and high wave steepnesses were generated by performing experiments with two constant nominal deep water wave steepnesses sop 0 02 and 0 05 at a 1 50 scaling the incident significant wave heights h m0 were tested from 50 mm to 160 mm and corresponding wave periods were in the range of 0 80 s 2 26 s six different toe water depths were tested in this study in total around 180 test sequences were performed see table 2 table 3 reports the nominal incident wave conditions followed in this research it is noted that the nominal incident wave conditions as presented in table 3 were applied to both impermeable and permeable slopes indicating that one group of three tests was performed with the same incident wave condition with the three foreshores furthermore table 4 shows the ranges of application for the sloping structure with impermeable and permeable slopes considered within this study as it is seen in table 4 the tested relative crest freeboards were in the range from 0 80 to 4 50 for both impermeable and permeable foreshore configurations the minimum iribarren number was equal to 2 0 indicating that tested wave conditions were non breaking waves ξ m 1 0 2 eurotop 2018 on a relatively steep 1 in 2 smooth sloping structure 4 results and analysis 4 1 incident wave heights in fig 3 two examples of measured incident wave heights at a relatively deep water near wave paddle are presented and compared with the deep water rayleigh distribution of wave heights from the graph it is noticeable that the measured wave heights overall follow the predicted rayleigh distribution for both low and high wave steepnesses there is however data points that correspond to relatively high waves that were found slightly lower than the prediction which may have occurred due to the occurrence of wave breaking near the wave paddle under depth limited conditions 4 2 accuracy of measurement system the accuracy of the overtopping measurement system was inspected prior to carrying out any experiments adapting the technique followed by pearson et al 2001 a series of wave overtopping events were simulated by adding a known amount of water into the overtopping measuring tank then the observed data from the overtopping detector and load cell were processed by using an algorithm to find the number of overtopping waves and resulting individual overtopping volumes afterwards the actual volume of each simulated overtopping event was compared with the measured value e g table 5 the test results clearly demonstrate that the measured overtopping volumes were almost identical to actual given values the relative error of total measured volumes and actual volumes was found satisfactory around 0 7 and rmse root mean square error value was observed 9 38 ml indicating that any errors induced by the overtopping measurement technique were minimal it is to note that the sensitivity of the load cell was limited to the identification of 5 9 ml of overtopping volume hence the smaller overtopping volumes showed an overall slightly greater error in the measurements compared to larger values 4 3 mean overtopping rate in fig 4 the measured relative overtopping discharges q gh m0 3 for the impermeable foreshore configuration reference case are compared with the predicted values using the existing empirical predictions for sloping structures to predict the mean overtopping rates the empirical predictions of goda 2009 etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and eurotop 2018 are presented in fig 4a b and 4 c respectively it can be seen from fig 4a that the predictions of the goda 2009 formulae equations 2 6 overestimate the mean overtopping rates at sloping structures 1 in 2 for the tested conditions covered within this study similar characteristics of goda s formulae for the prediction of mean overtopping rates at sloping structures with gentle slopes milder than 1 in 2 were also reported by van der meer and bruce 2014 when comparing the results of the reference case with the empirical formulae of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and eurotop 2018 it is seen that both the predictions of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 equations 7 and 8 and eurotop 2018 equations 9 and 10 overall succeed in providing the estimation of the mean overtopping rate see fig 4 however it is also noticeable that the measured values overall show slightly better agreement with the predicted values of eurotop 2018 compared to the those observed by etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 for the quantitative comparison of the accuracy of the prediction formulae the statistical error analysis such as root mean square error rmse and bias analysis have been undertaken and reported in table 6 the root mean square error rmse analysis and bias analysis were performed with the use of measured and estimated values of overtopping using empirical formulations as defined in equations 23 and 24 as seen in table 6 the prediction formulae of eurotop 2018 outperforms the predictions of etemad shahidi and jafari 2014 and goda 2009 by providing relatively lower rmse and bias values for the tested impermeable bed configurations 23 rmse 1 n t

which ntest is defined as the number of experimental results used to derive an equation the smaller rmse value means the better prediction formula which fits the specific dataset well the rmse value demonstrates the standard deviation of the measured values about the mean predicted overtopping rates on a log log scale the measured average overtopping rates for both impermeable reference case and gravel bed configurations are plotted in fig 5 the experimental results are compared with the prediction formulae equations 9 and 10 for sloping structures as reported by eurotop 2018 the solid line in fig 5 represents the empirical expression of eurotop 2018 considering an impermeable foreshore the graph demonstrates that average overtopping discharges are reduced substantially for permeable gravel foreshore configurations compared to those observed for impermeable slope from fig 5 it is also observed that the shingle foreshore of prototype grain diameter of 24 mm provide a greater reduction in mean overtopping rate when the two permeable bed configurations are compared an r2 best fit analysis was performed on the resulting average overtopping discharges to observe the reduction margin with the introduction of gravel foreshores compared to an impermeable slope see equations 25 and 26 it is noticeable that the overtopping is decreased by an approximate factor of 3 0 for gravel d50 of 13 mm and about a factor of 4 0 for d50 of 24 mm in comparison to the formulation equation 1 of eurotop 2018 it is important to note that best fit equations have been derived by adapting the formulations of eurotop 2018 which enables a direct comparison between new equations and existing empirical formulae for gravel d50 of 13 mm 25 q g h m 0 3 0 03 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 1 3 for gravel d50 of 24 mm 26 q g h m 0 3 0 0225 exp 1 5 r c h m 0 1 3 to investigate the reliability of the new equations a root mean square error rmse analysis was performed with the use of measured and predicted values of overtopping using new equations equations 25 and 26 as following the approach applied by owen 1980 and victor et al 2012 see equation 23 in addition to rmse analysis bias analysis was also carried out to find the reliability of the derived equations see equation 24 in table 7 the error measures of the proposed revised equations in the prediction of mean overtopping rate at sloping walls with permeable foreshores are shown for the conditions tested the rmse value based on the measured and estimated values of overtopping was only 0 14 and 0 15 for gravel d50 of 13 mm equation 25 and d50 of 24 mm equation 26 respectively see table 7 similar to rmse values the observed bias values for the new formulations were also smaller i e 0 03 for equation 25 and 0 10 for equation 26 these indicate that despite some scatter in general the predictions by using the revised expressions equations 25 and 26 exhibit a promising trend with the actual measurements furthermore in the prediction of overtopping at sloping structures the effect of various factors such as influence of roughness factor of the armour slope influence of berm etc in the reduction of overtopping is often incorporated by using a gamma factor in the empirical expression such as roughness factor of the sloping structure in equation 10 to adopt a simple overall coefficient approach for the influence of permeable foreshore in the wave overtopping measured mean overtopping rates are compared with various assumed foreshore roughness factors in fig 6 using the empirical formulation of eurotop 2018 the solid line represents the prediction of eurotop 2018 considering a gamma factor equals to 1 0 for the impermeable foreshore using equation 10 although it is evident from the graph that test results of permeable foreshores do not perfectly fit with all data using the best fit empirical lines assuming foreshore roughness factors i e gamma factor of 0 70 for d50 of 24 mm and 0 80 for d50 of 13 mm using equation 5 nevertheless an approximate trend is observed 4 4 mean overtopping sediment discharge for the estimation of the average overtopping sediment rate the mass of sediment overtopped in the collection tank was measured dry weight along with the mass of the water passing the parapet of the sloping wall the dry weight of the sediments was then transformed to a volume with the use of the quoted specific gravity of 1 40 in order to make sure that the measurements were dimensionally comparable fig 7 illustrates the measured mean overtopping characteristics of the sediment and the overtopping characteristics of the water for the tested shingle foreshore configurations the resulting data points demonstrate that the amount of sediment passes the parapet of the structure is approximately 1 of the amount of water also it is noticeable from the graph that there is no apparent effect of the size of the shingle foreshore slope on the overtopping of the sediment material at sloping seawall 4 5 distribution of wave by wave volumes wave by wave individual overtopping volumes in an overtopping sequence can be fitted with a weibull distribution e g van der meer and janssen 1994 besley 1999 hughes et al 2012 for robust predictions of maximum overtopping volumes it is important to have a good distribution of wave by wave individual overtopping volumes to examine the distribution of measured volumes the observed individual overtopping volumes for each tested condition were investigated on a weibull scale fig 8 shows the resulting weibull distribution of individual overtopping volumes for three distinct tested foreshore slopes for the same wave condition in graph v denotes wave by wave overtopping volume p v is the probability that an individual event volume equals or exceeds a volume v and v bar represents average overtopping volume the graph fig 8d provides a comparison of the distribution of overtopping volumes between impermeable and permeable foreshore slopes from the gradient of linear regression line of the weibull distribution the weibull b parameter can be calculated for an overtopping sequence it has been demonstrated by many researchers that the higher individual overtopping volumes provide a good fit to the distribution with a reliable prediction of extreme wave by wave volumes e g pearson et al 2002 and zanuttigh et al 2013 in general the designers and practitioners are mainly interested on the largest individual overtopping volumes hence the shape factor b is usually determined by fitting only the extreme tail of the distribution upper portion of the weibull plot using the relatively large overtopping volumes in this study the weibull b has been determined for all the tested conditions by plotting a best fitted trend line using the conventional fitting procedure i e upper part of the weibull distribution considering overtopping volumes greater than the average values v v bar as indicated in fig 8 overall the measured data points follow a linear trend which indicates that the resulting wave by wave volumes follow the weibull distribution within this study see fig 8a c it is noticeable from fig 8d that the overtopping volumes distribution for different bed configurations are very similar to each other which indicates that there is no obvious influence of gravel foreshore configurations on the weibull distribution of overtopping volumes 4 6 proportion of waves overtopping the measured proportion of waves overtopping as a function of dimensionless freeboard is plotted in fig 9 the graph compares the results of this study with the empirical prediction equation 18 reported by victor et al 2012 the data points correspond to the benchmark tests represent the experiments with the impermeable foreshore these follow the victor et al 2012 prediction to within a factor of 2 for the tested conditions the measured proportion of waves overtopping is reduced by an average of 50 for relative freeboards of 1 0 2 0 compared with the predictions whereas on an average 75 reduction was observed for relative freeboards of 2 0 3 5 when comparing the two gravel slopes it is noticeable that the larger gravel d50 of 24 mm provides a higher overall reduction in the proportion of waves overtopping in fig 10 the resulting proportion of overtopping waves are compared with the predicted values equations 16 and 17 as reported by eurotop 2018 for both impermeable and permeable configurations it is evident that the measured values are lower than the estimated values of eurotop 2018 as expected this occurs due to the overestimation of the number of overtopping waves by using the predictions of eurotop 2018 an investigation of the time series showed that for the smaller waves such as for wave height of 50 mm for the model shingle d50 of 2 1 mm hm0 d50 25 the shingle beach was more efficient in reducing the number of overtopping waves and hence mean overtopping discharge rates 4 7 maximum overtopping volume for the tested conditions fig 11 compares the measured maximum overtopping wave volumes at sloping seawalls with the empirical prediction as suggested by victor et al 2012 the resulting data points correspond to both impermeable and gravel foreshore configurations approximately following the trend of that reported by victor et al 2012 it is evident that there is no discernible variation in the prediction of the maximum volumes for impermeable and permeable foreshores at sloping structures similar characteristics of the overtopping wave volumes with respect to different foreshore configurations were also reported by salauddin and pearson 2019 for vertical breakwaters with permeable shingle foreshores 5 discussion a wide range of experiments were conducted in this study to inspect the overtopping characteristics at a smooth sloping structure on impermeable and permeable gravel foreshores and to provide the preliminary guidelines for the prediction of processes at full scale generally in the investigation of overtopping processes pearson et al 2002 reported that the scale and model effects in the two dimensional wave flume physical experiments showed no discernible differences in comparison to the large scale laboratory measurements for impermeable configurations e g vertical walls in addition victor and troch 2012 concluded that for the smooth impermeable sloping structures the influence of scale effects is believed to be minimal in the wave overtopping measurements in this study the experimental set up has been complimented by adapting the well established guidelines of eurotop 2018 powell 1990 and wolters et al 2009 for typical two dimensional experimental investigations the tested significant wave heights were varied from 50 mm up to 160 mm which were higher than the minimum wave heights of 30 mm as suggested by wolters et al 2009 to avoid scale effects in the measurements during the experiments an active re reflected wave absorber system was available in order to reduce the model effects induced by reflection from the model boundaries in addition tests were complimented without the existence of any structure bare flume in the wave channel in order to validate the inshore wave conditions the measured incident wave conditions within this study overall follow the rayleigh distribution at deep water the resulting overtopping from benchmark experiments impermeable foreshore showed a good agreement with the empirical prediction of eurotop 2018 for both permeable and impermeable slopes it was also observed that the distribution of wave by wave volumes follow the two parameter weibull distribution therefore it is anticipated that the proposed revised prediction methods from this two dimensional experimental research study would be applicable at prototype conditions with minimal scale and model effects even though the further validation of the dataset would be desirable 6 implications for prediction methods to estimate the overtopping characteristics at a sloping wall on a gravel foreshore to date there are relatively limited prediction tools available in the literature for a traditional impermeable foreshore slope the new manual eurotop 2018 recommended equations 9 and 10 for the estimation of average overtopping rates at sloping structures it is important to note that to predict the mean overtopping discharges at sloping walls with permeable foreshores the prediction guidance suggested in this study can be considered as a development of those described in the overtopping manual within the experimental limitations the results of this study demonstrate that the average overtopping discharge is reduced noticeably for permeable gravel beaches when compared to an impermeable slope reference case therefore a new set of prediction formulae equations 25 and 26 is proposed in this study for the estimation of average overtopping rates at a 1 in 2 sloping wall with a permeable gravel 1 in 20 foreshore configuration a conservative method is suggested i e an impermeable slope see empirical expressions equations 9 and 10 as described by eurotop 2018 when there is no other information available for the estimation of the average sediment discharges at a sloping structure on a permeable shingle beach to date there is no guidance available based on an analysis of the measured average sediment discharge it is recommended to expect up to 1 of the sediment material within the overtopping waves as observed in fig 10 the measured values of probability of overtopping waves at a sloping structure on a gravel foreshore were lower compared to the impermeable foreshore however the measured maximum individual wave overtopping volumes for shingle beaches do not vary significantly within a factor of 2 from those obtained for impermeable slopes as shown in fig 11 a correlation between overtopping wave volumes and number of overtopping waves for both impermeable and shingle beds is presented in fig 12 also shows a comparison of the distribution of overtopping volumes for various foreshore configurations for an incident wave height hm0 of 100 mm with a wave steepness sm 1 0 of 0 06 it is noticeable that for the impermeable foreshore configuration a higher number of overtopping waves compared to the shingle foreshores for the same wave condition is observed for example the data points corresponding to the solid foreshore slope represent around 49 of overtopping waves while the shingle bed d50 of 13 mm and d50 of 24 mm provide about 33 and 32 respectively it is however noticeable that the maximum wave by wave overtopping volumes on gravel beds overall do not differ significantly from those reported on impermeable beach configuration for instance the graph fig 12 shows that the maximum individual overtopping volume of 3 0 l per m width for the impermeable foreshore and 2 9 l per m width for shingle bed d50 of 13 mm this indicates that permeable shingle beaches lead to less wave overtopping events and hence lower mean overtopping discharges but the maximum individual overtopping volumes are similar for both cases considering the random characteristics of wave by wave overtopping volumes the updated eurotop manual eurotop 2018 also emphasized the significance of the influence of individual overtopping volumes on the tolerable overtopping discharges we therefore recommend a conservative prediction of maximum individual overtopping volumes at sloping walls with permeable shingle beaches i e the predictions as stated by eurotop 2018 considering a solid foreshore slope is suggested 7 conclusions the average overtopping discharge average sediment discharge proportion of overtopping waves and wave by wave overtopping volumes on a sloping structure for both impermeable and permeable gravel foreshore configurations have been studied based on the experimental results and through a comparison with existing empirical formulations from literature our conclusions are summarised as follows the measured baseline overtopping characteristics corresponding to the impermeable beach configuration control condition correlated well with the existing predictions for the tested conditions the results on mean overtopping discharge showed that the overtopping is reduced for permeable foreshore slopes in comparison to impermeable slopes a reduction factor of 3 0 and 4 0 was reported for the gravel bed d50 prototype of 13 mm and d50 of 24 mm respectively the measured volume of overtopped sediment was found approximately 1 of the total overtopping volume for the conditions covered within this study for the tested conditions the measured proportion of waves reduced by an average of 50 for relative freeboards of 1 0 2 0 compared with the empirical predictions whereas on an average 75 reduction was observed for relative freeboards of 2 0 3 5 the measured values of wave by wave and maximum overtopping volumes for shingle beaches were somewhat similar within a factor of 2 to those measured for impermeable slopes this indicates that there is no obvious influence of gravel foreshore configurations on the weibull distribution of overtopping volumes as well as on the maximum individual overtopping volumes for the conditions tested within this study for the prediction of overtopping

vibration viv is a typical fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon which occurs in the fields of wind engineering nuclear engineering renewable energy engineering ocean engineering and so on rashidi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 ding et al 2019 due to many practical issues associated with viv viv has attracted more and more concern when ocean current flows past bluff body there will be vortex shedding behind the structure the vortices provide periodic hydrodynamic force acting on the structure which results in the periodic vibration of the structure the above phenomenon is called viv morse and williamson 2009 the instability factors of viv are cross section shape seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 wang et al 2015 the flow incidence angle zhao et al 2019 surface roughness gao et al 2018a b and so on it is obvious that different cross section shapes have important effects on viv responses when the frequency of vortex shedding approaches to the natural frequency of the structure a large amplitude motion is observed called lock in or vortex synchronization jadidi et al 2017 ding et al 2020 especially lock in causes more serious consequences for a low mass damping system which is one of the important factors in fatigue failure and structure instability dorogi and baranyi 2018 viv response is harmful in offshore structures marine riser submarine pipeline and so on various methods have been proposed to suppress viv responses such as helical strakes sui et al 2016 control rods zhu and yao 2015 wire meshes huera huarte 2017 and so on wake control is a common viv suppression method such as splitter plate abdi et al 2019 and fairing devices zheng and wang 2017a b zhu et al 2017 investigated different triangular fairing on viv suppression and the lengths of fairing is an important factor on viv suppression if the fairing and the main cylinder are considered as a whole the shape of the rear edge of the main cylinder is changed as shown in fig 1 zhu et al 2017 and it is obvious that the length of the rear edge is an important factor affecting viv response law and jaiman 2017 investigated the wake stabilization mechanism of four different suppression devices and c shaped foil prevent the occurrence of galloping at high reynolds number and suppression viv response which shown that the flow characteristics can be changed by installing fairing behind bluff body zheng and wang 2017a b investigated the effect of the short tail and water drop shaped fairing devices on viv suppression and the short characteristic lengths should be chosen in the design of fairing devices as shown in fig 2 the rear edge the shape of rear edge is water drop shaped despite the destructive nature of viv a different idea has emerged in recent years that clean energies can be produced by enhancing viv response kim and bernitsas 2016 sun and bernitsas 2019 vortex induced vibration viv usually occurs for a standard circular cylinder in steady inflow and the amplitude of viv response is difficult to exceed one equivalent diameter of a cylinder franzini et al 2018 however the galloping of bluff body with non circular cross section such as square cylinder occurs li et al 2019 when galloping occurs the amplitude of viv response increases with the increase of flow velocity sourav and sen 2019 so it is necessary to study the influence of cross section shape on viv energy harvesting ding et al 2015 investigated flow induced vibration fiv energy harvesting characteristics of bluff bodies with different cross sections and two dimensional numerical calculation was carried out for reynolds number range of 1 0 104 re 1 3 105 the research showed that the q trapezoid i quasi trapezoid cylinder with the long edge as the windward side had better performance on energy harvesting in fim than other cylinders and q trapezoid ii quasi trapezoid cylinder with the short edge as the windward side displayed a quite different character with low amplitude and high frequency and the vortex pattern was a constant 2s in the test re range lian et al 2017 also made a similar investigation on energy harvesting characteristics of bluff bodies with different cross sections the research showed that circular cylinders and diamond prisms both presented a self limited motion and triangle prisms and right square prisms presented a self unlimited motion tamimi et al 2019 investigated the viv responses of a right angle triangular cylinder in comparison to circular square and diamond cross sections and the results showed that the right isosceles triangular cylinder displays considerably greater hydroelastic efficiency than other sharp edge oscillators these studies mainly focus on the viv responses of bluff bodies with different cross section shapes in energy harvesting the above studies have focused on the effect of the overall shape of the bluff body on the viv response however different cross section shapes mean that the leading edges or rear edges are different the effects of rear edges on viv responses have not been studied if the shape of leading edge is kept the same the shape of rear edge is changed whether the rear edges of different shapes will suppress or enhance viv responses when the feature lengths of the rear edges are the same whether the rear edges will change the vortex shedding patterns when the leading edges are the same therefore the geometry of the leading edge is kept as a semi circle and the geometries of the rear edges are changed including triangular t2 trapezoidal t3 and rectangular t4 at the same time the geometry of the rear edges is semi circle t1 for comparison with the above three shapes the reynolds number range studied in this paper is similar to the references ding et al 2015 gao et al 2018a b kang et al 2019 in order to compare with the above references the two dimensional numerical method is adopted which is adopted in the above references the two dimensional numerical method can provide certain accuracy in the performance of amplitude response frequency response and vortex pattern etc in the present study viv responses of bluff body with different rear edges are numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for reynolds number range of 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model are used to calculate the flow around the cylinder kang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the newmark beta method is employed for evaluating the structure dynamics of circular cylinder the physical model is established in section 2 and the numerical model is established in section 3 in section 3 the numerical model is validated by experimental results and other numerical results the effects of the rear edges on viv responses are discussed in section 4 in detail some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 physical model the two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv system consists of a bluff body two springs and two dampers as shown as fig 3 a the viv responses of streamwise vibration and transverse vibration are all considered and the cylinder is free to vibrate in x direction and y direction c is the system damping and k is the spring stiffness ax and ay are the displacements in x direction and y direction d is the diameter of circular cylinder fig 3 b is the schematic diagram of four bluff bodies the windward side of bluff body is semicircle and the rear side of bluff bodies are semicircle t1 triangular t2 trapezoidal t3 and rectangular t4 the main parameters of viv system are the same for all cases as shown in table 1 the parameters of numerical investigation in the present study refers to the previous experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the rear edges on viv responses 2 2 motion equations a simple mathematical model of 2 dof viv system is modeled the classical mass spring damper oscillatory model is used to describe 2 dof viv responses the motion equations are modeled as follows zhu et al 2017 1 m x c x k x f x t 2 m y c y k y f y t in which 3 m m d 2 4 π ρ l 4 m m m a d d 5 m a d d c a d 2 4 π ρ l 6 c 2 k m ξ 7 f n 2 π k m where x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration respectively in x direction while y y and y represent the same quantities respectively associated with the transverse motion f x and f y are the fluid force acting on bluff body in x direction and y direction ca is the added mass coefficient ca 1 for circular cylinder zhu et al 2017 f n is the natural frequency of bluff body in water and ξ is the damping ratio l is the length of bluff body l 1m 3 computational method 3 1 mathematical model the viv response is numerically simulated using two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in conjunction with shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model gao et al 2018a b user defined functions udf are written and embedded in simulations for evaluating the structure dynamics of viv system the newmark beta method is used in udf which is an implicit time integration method pasetto et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the linear acceleration assumption is amended in newmark β method at the time t δt the parameters α and β are introduced in the expressions of velocity and

is the time step the solutions of the above equations eq 10 11 and 12 are realized by the c language and the algorithms are embedded in udf firstly the fluid acts on the cylinder and the velocity of flow is stable then fluent calculates the forces acting on the cylinder by solving 2d rans equations and sst k ω turbulence model according to the forces the displacement velocity and acceleration of motion at time t δt are solved out in udf finally the mesh is updated based on the displacement of motion the process of viv response is realized by the above methods as shown in fig 4 3 2 computational domain and grid dependence validation the entire computational domain is divided into four regions including sub domain y slipway x slipway and external flow field as shown in fig 5 due to the amplitude of motion may be high the lengths of computational domain in x direction and y direction are 60d and 40d for all cases based on the previous studies gao et al 2018a b the effect of domain width is negligible if the blockage ratio d w is less than 0 05 where w is the width of the computational domain the entire domain includes four kinds of boundaries which are inlet outlet side wall and cylinder wall the sub domain is 6d 6d the y slipway is 6d the streamwise direction 30d the transverse direction and the x slipway is 40d the streamwise direction 30d the transverse direction the center of the cylinder the original point is 15d away from the upstream boundary inlet and the upstream boundary is imposed with a velocity inlet condition which u u the streamwise direction and v 0 the transverse direction the center of the cylinder is 35d away from the downstream boundary outlet and the downstream boundary is an outlet condition with u x 0 and v x 0 the two lateral boundaries side wall are 20d away from the x axis the lateral boundary is symmetry condition with u y 0 and v 0 the layer method of dynamic mesh is applied for updating grid moving layers are located at the top and the bottom of sub domain for solving the vibration response of cylinder in y direction and moving layers are also located at the left and the right of y slipway for solving the vibration response of cylinder in x direction the interfaces are adopted to connect the different mesh region the sub domain and cylinder wall move up and down together the density of the mesh can affect the accuracy of the numerical model prediction therefore the grid independence validation is conducted using different grid density including 30000 m1 60000 m2 90000 m3 120000 m4 and 150000 m5 as shown in table 2 percentages in brackets are changes in the ratios ay d and f s f n relative to the corresponding values for the former grid when the mesh resolution is refined from m4 to m5 the differences ay d and f s f n are reduced to 0 05 and 0 04 the differences between the two meshes of m4 and m5 is less than 0 1 and the meshes of m5 can be adopted gao et al 2018a b therefore the number of meshes in the simulation is set to about 150000 and the meshing is shown in fig 6 3 3 numerical model validation before the numerical simulation is carried out the prediction accuracy of numerical model must be verified by the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and other cfd results gao et al 2018a b kang et al 2019 the main parameters are presented in table 3 the viv response of a circular cylinder is numerically simulated in the range of 2 ur reduced velocity ur u f n d 14 as shown in fig 7 the vortex shedding frequency is calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the transverse vibration amplitude and the displacement of vibration is the maximum values in the stable region based on the amplitude and frequency responses the response regions are divided into three branches including the initial branch ur 4 0 the upper branch 4 ur 8 0 and the lower branch ur 8 0 gao et al 2018a b there is a jump of value from the upper branch to the lower branch and the jump usually takes place at 6 ur 8 in jauvtis and williamson experiment 2004 the jump phenomenon takes place at ur 7 0 in the present model which is similar to kang s studies kang et al 2019 these differences may be caused by different reynolds number ranges the reynolds number is fixed at 5000 in the simulation of gao et al 2018a b and ur ur u f n d was changed by changing the natural frequency of the cylinder f n the reynolds number range in the present model 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 is close to that 5 8 103 re 4 08 104 and 1 305 103 re 9 18 104 in the simulations of kang et al 2019 ur is changed by changing the velocity of flow u in the present model and kang et al s model kang et al 2019 the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the kang s data despite some differences remain the trend of viv responses is the same as that of jauvtis and williamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 therefore the numerical model is acceptable 4 results and discussions 4 1 amplitude response and frequency response fig 8 shows the amplitude responses and the frequency responses of four different bluff bodies the vortex shedding frequency f s is related to the lift force so the frequency of vibration is calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the lift force in general the lock in phenomenon occurs when the vortex shedding frequency f s is close to the natural frequency f n wang et al 2019 when f s f n 1 0 this phenomenon is approximately valid in air for a large mass ratio system m o 100 feng 1968 however the range of lock in for a low mass ratio system is larger in water khalak and williamson 1999 compared with that in air feng 1968 in other words f s f n can depart from 1 when the lock in phenomenon occurs the natural frequency is the structural frequency in still water when the structure vibrates the flow around the structure can t be regard as still water in general the departure between the normalize natural frequency and the real natural frequency increases as the decrease of mass ratio han et al 2018 therefore the entire viv responses region can be divided into three regions including a lock in region and two regions which are out of the lock in range furthermore the lock in region can be divided in two regions based on the amplitude responses in fig 6 based on the amplitude responses and frequency responses the viv response region is divided into four regions as shown in table 4 in region i the amplitude ratios of different bluff bodies are less than 0 5 and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 there are some differences for different bluff bodies due to the differences of the rear edges when ur 4 0 the frequency ratios of t2 and t4 are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the range of region i is narrower for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 in region ii the frequency ratios of different bluff bodies are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the amplitude ratios show an upward trend and reach a maximum value in region ii the amplitude ratios reach the maximum value at ur 7 0 for t1 and t2 however it occurs at ur 8 0 for t3 and at ur 6 0 for t4 the maximum amplitude ratio is 1 5 for t1 1 0 for t2 1 0 for t3 and 0 2 for t4 the amplitude response is obviously suppressed for t4 if viv responses need to be suppressed the shape of rear edge can be designed to be similar to that of t4 in region iii the lock in phenomenon still exists although the frequency is far from 1 the frequency ratio increases slowly the amplitude ratios keep a relatively stable value for t1 and t3 and it fluctuates between 0 8 and 1 0 the possible reason is that the rear edges of t1 and t3 are similar the ranges of lock in are the same for t1 and t3 because the rear edge of t2 has a large slope the amplitude ratio begins to decrease rapidly and the frequency ratio begins to increase rapidly this phenomenon lead to that the lock in range is small the increase of frequency ratio for t4 is linearly related to ur the amplitude ratio starts to decrease slightly the lock in range of t4 is the smallest in region iv viv responses are similar to that in region i because they are all out of the lock in range the amplitude ratio drops rapidly to a lower level and the frequency ratio is far from 1 4 2 viv responses and vortex patterns the viv responses are shown in figs 9 11 13 and 15 and the vortex patterns are shown in figs 10 12 14 and 16 the vorticity is defined as ω u y v x four typical reduced velocities ur 3 0 6 0 10 0 and 14 0 are selected according to the viv response regions of t1 which correspond to four response regions figs 9 and 10 show viv responses and vortex patterns when ur 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i the fluctuation trends of cross flow amplitude ratios and the lift coefficients are similar for t1 t2 and t3 which means that the intensity of viv responses is similar the cross flow amplitude ratios of them is less than 0 18 and the lift coefficients of them is less than 3 however the cross flow amplitude ratio of t4 is less than 0 06 and the lift coefficients of t4 is less than 1 the frequency responses of the cross flow amplitude ratios and the lift coefficients are also shown in fig 9 the frequencies of t1 t3 and t4 are less than the natural frequency of structure f n 0 4hz in region i fig 10 show clearly that the vortex pattern of four bluff bodies are 2s modes 2s mode means that only one vortex shed from each side of bluff body in each half cycle however it is found that there are two peak frequencies for t2 which may be related to the vortex segmentation in the vibration process by the sharp edge of t2 the viv response of t2 is in the lock in range figs 11 and 12 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii the vortex pattern is 2s mode for t1 and t1 is in the lock in range because the main peak vibration frequency is 0 963 which is close to 1 0 the cross flow amplitude ratio reaches 1 2 for t1 and the peak value of lift coefficient is about 3 0 however the vortex patterns of t2 and t3 are changed to 2p modes 2p mode means that two vortexes shed from each side in each half cycle the cross flow amplitude ratio reaches 0 8 for t2 and it reaches 0 6 for t3 and the peak value of lift coefficient is about 2 5 for t2 and it is about 4 0 for t3 although the cross flow amplitude ratios are the similar for t2 and t3 the peak value of lift coefficients of them are different which is related to the difference in the shape of their rear edges the vortex mode is still 2s mode for t4 but the frequency increases obviously the increase of frequency quickly will result in a small lock in range for t4 figs 13 and 14 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 10 0 re 4 0 104 in region iii the fig 14 shows clearly that the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 and t4 can effectively suppress viv response the viv responses of t1 and t3 are the similar and the vortex modes of t1 and t3 are 2p modes therefore the lock in ranges of t1 and t3 are the similar compared with the shapes of the rear edges for t2 and t4 the shape of the rear edges for t3 is closest to that of t1 the cross flow amplitude ratios are less than 0 1 for t2 and t4 and the frequencies of t2 and t4 are far from the natural frequencies of the structures figs 15 and 16 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are all 2s modes the cross flow amplitude ratios are less than 0 12 for t2 t3 and t4 especially the cross flow amplitude ratio is less than 0 03 for t2 at the same time the frequency of t2 increases rapidly and t2 is quickly far from the lock in range however the cross flow amplitude ratio of t1 decreases slowly and the frequency of t1 increases slowly for t2 and t4 the cross flow amplitude ratios are small and the frequencies are high because them is far from the lock in range 4 3 general discussion fig 17 shows the comparisons of the in line amplitude responses jauvtis and williamson 2004 investigated experimentally the in line amplitude responses of a circular cylinder and kang et al 2019 investigated numerically the in line amplitude responses of a circular cylinder the in line amplitude responses of t1 are good agree with that of the above researches in region i the fluctuation trend of t2 and t4 is opposite to that of t1 which may lead to similar phenomena of the mean drag coefficients in region ii the in line amplitude ratios keep increasing and reach the maximum values for t1 and t2 and the maximum value is about 0 3 at ur 7 0 however the in line amplitude ratio of t4 keeps a low value in the entire viv regions and the maximum value is less than 0 05 in region iii the in line amplitude ratio reaches the maximum value for t3 and the maximum value is about 0 4 at ur 8 0 however the in line amplitude ratios of t1 and t2 begins to drop rapidly in region iv the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are at a very low level fig 18 shows the mean drag coefficients of four different bluff bodies in region i the mean drag coefficient of t1 and t3 increase first and then decrease however the trend is opposite for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 this phenomenon can be explained by the fluctuation of the in line amplitude responses when ur 3 0 there is a downward trend of the in line amplitude ratios for t2 and t4 the similar phenomena have also been observed in jauvtis et al s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the in line amplitude ratios increased firstly and then decreased when 1 0 ur 4 0 in region ii t1 t2 and t4 show an upward trend as ur increases for t1 t2 and t4 the mean drag coefficient reach the maximum value at ur 7 0 especially for t1 the mean drag coefficients is close to 3 0 which has a threefold increase over that of stationary cylinder the similar results have been observed in previous studies jadidi et al 2017 in region ii the mean drag coefficient reach a maximum value at ur 6 0 for t3 in region iii and iv the mean drag coefficient keep at a stable value for t4 which is about 1 6 the mean drag coefficient show a downward trend for t1 and t3 and the possible reason is that the shape of t1 and t3 is similar the mean drag coefficient decrease first and then increase to a stable value 1 1 for t2 the mean drag coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 remains around 1 0 in high reynolds number region and the mean drag coefficient of t4 is higher than that of t1 t2 and t3 fig 19 shows the motion trajectories of four different bluff bodies for t1 the typical figure 8 is observed however the size of the figure 8 changes with the increase of ur in general the size of the figure 8 increases first and then decreases with the increase of ur for example the size of the figure 8 for t1 is 0 01m ax 0 01m 0 001m ay 0 001m when ur 2 0 which is 0 02m ax 0 06m 0 12m ay 0 12m when ur 6 0 and 0 053m ax 0 062m 0 08m ay 0 08m when ur 10 0 meanwhile it is found that the in line vibration displacement increases with the increase of ur for example the equilibrium position of the in line vibration is about 0m for t1 when ur 2 0 which is 0 03m when ur 6 0 0 056m when ur 10 0 and 0 068m when ur 13 0 for t2 and t3 the motion trajectory isn t the typical figure 8 at ur 3 0 corresponding to region i and the vibration is in multi frequency mode the main reason is that the rear edges of t2 and t3 have obvious effects on the shedding of vortices as shown in fig 16 the change of the figure 8 is not obvious for t1 and t4 however the range of the figure 8 for t4 is significantly smaller than that for t1 it indicates that the rear edges of t4 is helpful to suppress viv responses the shape of motion trajectory when ur 6 0 for t3 is like double 8 connected together the trajectory of t3 appears as a cross line straight line at ur 13 0 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration viv of bluff body with different rear edges is numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for reynolds number range of 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the effects of different rear edges on viv responses are discussed in detail based on the above results the following conclusions are justified 1 based on the amplitude responses and frequency responses the viv response region is divided into four regions in region i the amplitude ratios of different bluff bodies are less than 0 5 and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 in region ii the frequency ratios of different bluff bodies are about 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the amplitude ratios show an upward trend and reach a maximum value in region ii in region iii the lock in phenomenon still exists although the frequency is far from 1 0 and the frequency ratio increases slowly for t1 and t3 the reason is that the rear edges of t1 and t3 are similar because the rear edge of t2 has a large slope the amplitude ratio began to decrease rapidly and the frequency ratio began to increase rapidly in region iii which lead to that the lock in range is small for t2 the increase of frequency ratio for t4 is linearly related to ur and the lock in region of t4 is the narrowest in region iv viv responses are similar to that in region i 2 the vortex pattern is 2s mode for four different bluff bodies in region i the peak value of lift coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 are the similar which means that viv responses is similar although the vortex pattern is also 2s mode for t1 in region ii the frequency increases obviously the vortex patterns of t2 and t3 are changed to 2p mode in region iii the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 in region iii in entire viv response region the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 and the rear edge of t4 is helpful to suppress viv responses 3 in region i the mean drag coefficient of t1 and t3 increase first and then decrease however the trend is opposite for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 in region ii t1 t2 and t4 show an upward trend as ur increases for t1 t2 and t4 the mean drag coefficient reach the maximum value in region iii and iv the mean drag coefficient keep at a stable value for t4 the mean drag coefficient show a downward trend for t1 and t3 and the possible reason is that the shape of t1 and t3 is similar the mean drag coefficient decrease first and then increase to a stable value for t2 the mean drag coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 remains around 1 0 in high reynolds number region and the mean drag coefficient of t4 is higher than that of t1 t2 and

22132,vortex induced vibration viv responses of bluff bodies with different rear edges semicircle t1 triangular t2 trapezoidal t3 and rectangular t4 are numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for reynolds number range of 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model are used to calculate the flow around bluff body the newmark beta method is employed for evaluating the structure dynamics of bluff body the effects of different rear edges on viv responses are discussed in detail the results show that the viv response region can be divided into four regions region i region ii region iii and region iv the geometry of the bluff body s rear side can considerably affect viv responses and vortex patterns the amplitude responses of t2 t3 and t4 are suppressed compared with that of t1 when the rear edge is rectangular the amplitude responses can be suppressed effectively and the vortex pattern is still 2s mode in the entire viv response region but the mean drag coefficient increases the range of lock in region is smaller for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 the range of lock in region is similar for t1 and t3 the motion trajectory of the typical figure 8 is observed keywords vortex induced vibration numerical investigation bluff body rear

vibration viv is a typical fluid structure interaction fsi phenomenon which occurs in the fields of wind engineering nuclear engineering renewable energy engineering ocean engineering and so on rashidi et al 2016 wang et al 2019 ding et al 2019 due to many practical issues associated with viv viv has attracted more and more concern when ocean current flows past bluff body there will be vortex shedding behind the structure the vortices provide periodic hydrodynamic force acting on the structure which results in the periodic vibration of the structure the above phenomenon is called viv morse and williamson 2009 the instability factors of viv are cross section shape seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 wang et al 2015 the flow incidence angle zhao et al 2019 surface roughness gao et al 2018a b and so on it is obvious that different cross section shapes have important effects on viv responses when the frequency of vortex shedding approaches to the natural frequency of the structure a large amplitude motion is observed called lock in or vortex synchronization jadidi et al 2017 ding et al 2020 especially lock in causes more serious consequences for a low mass damping system which is one of the important factors in fatigue failure and structure instability dorogi and baranyi 2018 viv response is harmful in offshore structures marine riser submarine pipeline and so on various methods have been proposed to suppress viv responses such as helical strakes sui et al 2016 control rods zhu and yao 2015 wire meshes huera huarte 2017 and so on wake control is a common viv suppression method such as splitter plate abdi et al 2019 and fairing devices zheng and wang 2017a b zhu et al 2017 investigated different triangular fairing on viv suppression and the lengths of fairing is an important factor on viv suppression if the fairing and the main cylinder are considered as a whole the shape of the rear edge of the main cylinder is changed as shown in fig 1 zhu et al 2017 and it is obvious that the length of the rear edge is an important factor affecting viv response law and jaiman 2017 investigated the wake stabilization mechanism of four different suppression devices and c shaped foil prevent the occurrence of galloping at high reynolds number and suppression viv response which shown that the flow characteristics can be changed by installing fairing behind bluff body zheng and wang 2017a b investigated the effect of the short tail and water drop shaped fairing devices on viv suppression and the short characteristic lengths should be chosen in the design of fairing devices as shown in fig 2 the rear edge the shape of rear edge is water drop shaped despite the destructive nature of viv a different idea has emerged in recent years that clean energies can be produced by enhancing viv response kim and bernitsas 2016 sun and bernitsas 2019 vortex induced vibration viv usually occurs for a standard circular cylinder in steady inflow and the amplitude of viv response is difficult to exceed one equivalent diameter of a cylinder franzini et al 2018 however the galloping of bluff body with non circular cross section such as square cylinder occurs li et al 2019 when galloping occurs the amplitude of viv response increases with the increase of flow velocity sourav and sen 2019 so it is necessary to study the influence of cross section shape on viv energy harvesting ding et al 2015 investigated flow induced vibration fiv energy harvesting characteristics of bluff bodies with different cross sections and two dimensional numerical calculation was carried out for reynolds number range of 1 0 104 re 1 3 105 the research showed that the q trapezoid i quasi trapezoid cylinder with the long edge as the windward side had better performance on energy harvesting in fim than other cylinders and q trapezoid ii quasi trapezoid cylinder with the short edge as the windward side displayed a quite different character with low amplitude and high frequency and the vortex pattern was a constant 2s in the test re range lian et al 2017 also made a similar investigation on energy harvesting characteristics of bluff bodies with different cross sections the research showed that circular cylinders and diamond prisms both presented a self limited motion and triangle prisms and right square prisms presented a self unlimited motion tamimi et al 2019 investigated the viv responses of a right angle triangular cylinder in comparison to circular square and diamond cross sections and the results showed that the right isosceles triangular cylinder displays considerably greater hydroelastic efficiency than other sharp edge oscillators these studies mainly focus on the viv responses of bluff bodies with different cross section shapes in energy harvesting the above studies have focused on the effect of the overall shape of the bluff body on the viv response however different cross section shapes mean that the leading edges or rear edges are different the effects of rear edges on viv responses have not been studied if the shape of leading edge is kept the same the shape of rear edge is changed whether the rear edges of different shapes will suppress or enhance viv responses when the feature lengths of the rear edges are the same whether the rear edges will change the vortex shedding patterns when the leading edges are the same therefore the geometry of the leading edge is kept as a semi circle and the geometries of the rear edges are changed including triangular t2 trapezoidal t3 and rectangular t4 at the same time the geometry of the rear edges is semi circle t1 for comparison with the above three shapes the reynolds number range studied in this paper is similar to the references ding et al 2015 gao et al 2018a b kang et al 2019 in order to compare with the above references the two dimensional numerical method is adopted which is adopted in the above references the two dimensional numerical method can provide certain accuracy in the performance of amplitude response frequency response and vortex pattern etc in the present study viv responses of bluff body with different rear edges are numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for reynolds number range of 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model are used to calculate the flow around the cylinder kang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the newmark beta method is employed for evaluating the structure dynamics of circular cylinder the physical model is established in section 2 and the numerical model is established in section 3 in section 3 the numerical model is validated by experimental results and other numerical results the effects of the rear edges on viv responses are discussed in section 4 in detail some conclusions are presented in section 5 2 problem description 2 1 physical model the two degrees of freedom 2 dof viv system consists of a bluff body two springs and two dampers as shown as fig 3 a the viv responses of streamwise vibration and transverse vibration are all considered and the cylinder is free to vibrate in x direction and y direction c is the system damping and k is the spring stiffness ax and ay are the displacements in x direction and y direction d is the diameter of circular cylinder fig 3 b is the schematic diagram of four bluff bodies the windward side of bluff body is semicircle and the rear side of bluff bodies are semicircle t1 triangular t2 trapezoidal t3 and rectangular t4 the main parameters of viv system are the same for all cases as shown in table 1 the parameters of numerical investigation in the present study refers to the previous experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the rear edges on viv responses 2 2 motion equations a simple mathematical model of 2 dof viv system is modeled the classical mass spring damper oscillatory model is used to describe 2 dof viv responses the motion equations are modeled as follows zhu et al 2017 1 m x c x k x f x t 2 m y c y k y f y t in which 3 m m d 2 4 π ρ l 4 m m m a d d 5 m a d d c a d 2 4 π ρ l 6 c 2 k m ξ 7 f n 2 π k m where x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration respectively in x direction while y y and y represent the same quantities respectively associated with the transverse motion f x and f y are the fluid force acting on bluff body in x direction and y direction ca is the added mass coefficient ca 1 for circular cylinder zhu et al 2017 f n is the natural frequency of bluff body in water and ξ is the damping ratio l is the length of bluff body l 1m 3 computational method 3 1 mathematical model the viv response is numerically simulated using two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations in conjunction with shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model gao et al 2018a b user defined functions udf are written and embedded in simulations for evaluating the structure dynamics of viv system the newmark beta method is used in udf which is an implicit time integration method pasetto et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the linear acceleration assumption is amended in newmark β method at the time t δt the parameters α and β are introduced in the expressions of velocity and displacement two basic equations are obtained 8 u t δ t u t u t δ t 1 2 β u t β u t δ t δ t 2 9 u t δ t u t 1 α u t α u t δ t δ t according to eq 8 and eq 9 u t δ t and u t δ t can be expressed as 10 u t δ t 1 β δ t 2 u t δ t u t 1 β δ t u t 1 2 β 1 u t 11 u t δ t α β δ t u t δ t u t 1 α β u t α 2 β 1 δ t u t at the time t δt considering eq 1 and eq 2 unknown items u can represent x or y 12 m u t δ t c u t δ t k u t δ t f f l u i d t t δ t based on the previous study pasetto et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the values of α and β are 0 5 and 0 25 considering eqs 10 12 items u t δ t u t δ t and u t δ

is the time step the solutions of the above equations eq 10 11 and 12 are realized by the c language and the algorithms are embedded in udf firstly the fluid acts on the cylinder and the velocity of flow is stable then fluent calculates the forces acting on the cylinder by solving 2d rans equations and sst k ω turbulence model according to the forces the displacement velocity and acceleration of motion at time t δt are solved out in udf finally the mesh is updated based on the displacement of motion the process of viv response is realized by the above methods as shown in fig 4 3 2 computational domain and grid dependence validation the entire computational domain is divided into four regions including sub domain y slipway x slipway and external flow field as shown in fig 5 due to the amplitude of motion may be high the lengths of computational domain in x direction and y direction are 60d and 40d for all cases based on the previous studies gao et al 2018a b the effect of domain width is negligible if the blockage ratio d w is less than 0 05 where w is the width of the computational domain the entire domain includes four kinds of boundaries which are inlet outlet side wall and cylinder wall the sub domain is 6d 6d the y slipway is 6d the streamwise direction 30d the transverse direction and the x slipway is 40d the streamwise direction 30d the transverse direction the center of the cylinder the original point is 15d away from the upstream boundary inlet and the upstream boundary is imposed with a velocity inlet condition which u u the streamwise direction and v 0 the transverse direction the center of the cylinder is 35d away from the downstream boundary outlet and the downstream boundary is an outlet condition with u x 0 and v x 0 the two lateral boundaries side wall are 20d away from the x axis the lateral boundary is symmetry condition with u y 0 and v 0 the layer method of dynamic mesh is applied for updating grid moving layers are located at the top and the bottom of sub domain for solving the vibration response of cylinder in y direction and moving layers are also located at the left and the right of y slipway for solving the vibration response of cylinder in x direction the interfaces are adopted to connect the different mesh region the sub domain and cylinder wall move up and down together the density of the mesh can affect the accuracy of the numerical model prediction therefore the grid independence validation is conducted using different grid density including 30000 m1 60000 m2 90000 m3 120000 m4 and 150000 m5 as shown in table 2 percentages in brackets are changes in the ratios ay d and f s f n relative to the corresponding values for the former grid when the mesh resolution is refined from m4 to m5 the differences ay d and f s f n are reduced to 0 05 and 0 04 the differences between the two meshes of m4 and m5 is less than 0 1 and the meshes of m5 can be adopted gao et al 2018a b therefore the number of meshes in the simulation is set to about 150000 and the meshing is shown in fig 6 3 3 numerical model validation before the numerical simulation is carried out the prediction accuracy of numerical model must be verified by the experimental results jauvtis and williamson 2004 and other cfd results gao et al 2018a b kang et al 2019 the main parameters are presented in table 3 the viv response of a circular cylinder is numerically simulated in the range of 2 ur reduced velocity ur u f n d 14 as shown in fig 7 the vortex shedding frequency is calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the transverse vibration amplitude and the displacement of vibration is the maximum values in the stable region based on the amplitude and frequency responses the response regions are divided into three branches including the initial branch ur 4 0 the upper branch 4 ur 8 0 and the lower branch ur 8 0 gao et al 2018a b there is a jump of value from the upper branch to the lower branch and the jump usually takes place at 6 ur 8 in jauvtis and williamson experiment 2004 the jump phenomenon takes place at ur 7 0 in the present model which is similar to kang s studies kang et al 2019 these differences may be caused by different reynolds number ranges the reynolds number is fixed at 5000 in the simulation of gao et al 2018a b and ur ur u f n d was changed by changing the natural frequency of the cylinder f n the reynolds number range in the present model 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 is close to that 5 8 103 re 4 08 104 and 1 305 103 re 9 18 104 in the simulations of kang et al 2019 ur is changed by changing the velocity of flow u in the present model and kang et al s model kang et al 2019 the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the kang s data despite some differences remain the trend of viv responses is the same as that of jauvtis and williamson s experiment jauvtis and williamson 2004 therefore the numerical model is acceptable 4 results and discussions 4 1 amplitude response and frequency response fig 8 shows the amplitude responses and the frequency responses of four different bluff bodies the vortex shedding frequency f s is related to the lift force so the frequency of vibration is calculated by fast fourier transform fft of the lift force in general the lock in phenomenon occurs when the vortex shedding frequency f s is close to the natural frequency f n wang et al 2019 when f s f n 1 0 this phenomenon is approximately valid in air for a large mass ratio system m o 100 feng 1968 however the range of lock in for a low mass ratio system is larger in water khalak and williamson 1999 compared with that in air feng 1968 in other words f s f n can depart from 1 when the lock in phenomenon occurs the natural frequency is the structural frequency in still water when the structure vibrates the flow around the structure can t be regard as still water in general the departure between the normalize natural frequency and the real natural frequency increases as the decrease of mass ratio han et al 2018 therefore the entire viv responses region can be divided into three regions including a lock in region and two regions which are out of the lock in range furthermore the lock in region can be divided in two regions based on the amplitude responses in fig 6 based on the amplitude responses and frequency responses the viv response region is divided into four regions as shown in table 4 in region i the amplitude ratios of different bluff bodies are less than 0 5 and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 there are some differences for different bluff bodies due to the differences of the rear edges when ur 4 0 the frequency ratios of t2 and t4 are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the range of region i is narrower for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 in region ii the frequency ratios of different bluff bodies are close to 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the amplitude ratios show an upward trend and reach a maximum value in region ii the amplitude ratios reach the maximum value at ur 7 0 for t1 and t2 however it occurs at ur 8 0 for t3 and at ur 6 0 for t4 the maximum amplitude ratio is 1 5 for t1 1 0 for t2 1 0 for t3 and 0 2 for t4 the amplitude response is obviously suppressed for t4 if viv responses need to be suppressed the shape of rear edge can be designed to be similar to that of t4 in region iii the lock in phenomenon still exists although the frequency is far from 1 the frequency ratio increases slowly the amplitude ratios keep a relatively stable value for t1 and t3 and it fluctuates between 0 8 and 1 0 the possible reason is that the rear edges of t1 and t3 are similar the ranges of lock in are the same for t1 and t3 because the rear edge of t2 has a large slope the amplitude ratio begins to decrease rapidly and the frequency ratio begins to increase rapidly this phenomenon lead to that the lock in range is small the increase of frequency ratio for t4 is linearly related to ur the amplitude ratio starts to decrease slightly the lock in range of t4 is the smallest in region iv viv responses are similar to that in region i because they are all out of the lock in range the amplitude ratio drops rapidly to a lower level and the frequency ratio is far from 1 4 2 viv responses and vortex patterns the viv responses are shown in figs 9 11 13 and 15 and the vortex patterns are shown in figs 10 12 14 and 16 the vorticity is defined as ω u y v x four typical reduced velocities ur 3 0 6 0 10 0 and 14 0 are selected according to the viv response regions of t1 which correspond to four response regions figs 9 and 10 show viv responses and vortex patterns when ur 3 0 re 1 2 104 in region i the fluctuation trends of cross flow amplitude ratios and the lift coefficients are similar for t1 t2 and t3 which means that the intensity of viv responses is similar the cross flow amplitude ratios of them is less than 0 18 and the lift coefficients of them is less than 3 however the cross flow amplitude ratio of t4 is less than 0 06 and the lift coefficients of t4 is less than 1 the frequency responses of the cross flow amplitude ratios and the lift coefficients are also shown in fig 9 the frequencies of t1 t3 and t4 are less than the natural frequency of structure f n 0 4hz in region i fig 10 show clearly that the vortex pattern of four bluff bodies are 2s modes 2s mode means that only one vortex shed from each side of bluff body in each half cycle however it is found that there are two peak frequencies for t2 which may be related to the vortex segmentation in the vibration process by the sharp edge of t2 the viv response of t2 is in the lock in range figs 11 and 12 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 6 0 re 2 4 104 in region ii the vortex pattern is 2s mode for t1 and t1 is in the lock in range because the main peak vibration frequency is 0 963 which is close to 1 0 the cross flow amplitude ratio reaches 1 2 for t1 and the peak value of lift coefficient is about 3 0 however the vortex patterns of t2 and t3 are changed to 2p modes 2p mode means that two vortexes shed from each side in each half cycle the cross flow amplitude ratio reaches 0 8 for t2 and it reaches 0 6 for t3 and the peak value of lift coefficient is about 2 5 for t2 and it is about 4 0 for t3 although the cross flow amplitude ratios are the similar for t2 and t3 the peak value of lift coefficients of them are different which is related to the difference in the shape of their rear edges the vortex mode is still 2s mode for t4 but the frequency increases obviously the increase of frequency quickly will result in a small lock in range for t4 figs 13 and 14 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 10 0 re 4 0 104 in region iii the fig 14 shows clearly that the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 and t4 can effectively suppress viv response the viv responses of t1 and t3 are the similar and the vortex modes of t1 and t3 are 2p modes therefore the lock in ranges of t1 and t3 are the similar compared with the shapes of the rear edges for t2 and t4 the shape of the rear edges for t3 is closest to that of t1 the cross flow amplitude ratios are less than 0 1 for t2 and t4 and the frequencies of t2 and t4 are far from the natural frequencies of the structures figs 15 and 16 show the viv responses and the vortex patterns when ur 13 0 re 5 2 104 in region iv the vortex patterns of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are all 2s modes the cross flow amplitude ratios are less than 0 12 for t2 t3 and t4 especially the cross flow amplitude ratio is less than 0 03 for t2 at the same time the frequency of t2 increases rapidly and t2 is quickly far from the lock in range however the cross flow amplitude ratio of t1 decreases slowly and the frequency of t1 increases slowly for t2 and t4 the cross flow amplitude ratios are small and the frequencies are high because them is far from the lock in range 4 3 general discussion fig 17 shows the comparisons of the in line amplitude responses jauvtis and williamson 2004 investigated experimentally the in line amplitude responses of a circular cylinder and kang et al 2019 investigated numerically the in line amplitude responses of a circular cylinder the in line amplitude responses of t1 are good agree with that of the above researches in region i the fluctuation trend of t2 and t4 is opposite to that of t1 which may lead to similar phenomena of the mean drag coefficients in region ii the in line amplitude ratios keep increasing and reach the maximum values for t1 and t2 and the maximum value is about 0 3 at ur 7 0 however the in line amplitude ratio of t4 keeps a low value in the entire viv regions and the maximum value is less than 0 05 in region iii the in line amplitude ratio reaches the maximum value for t3 and the maximum value is about 0 4 at ur 8 0 however the in line amplitude ratios of t1 and t2 begins to drop rapidly in region iv the in line amplitude ratios of t1 t2 t3 and t4 are at a very low level fig 18 shows the mean drag coefficients of four different bluff bodies in region i the mean drag coefficient of t1 and t3 increase first and then decrease however the trend is opposite for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 this phenomenon can be explained by the fluctuation of the in line amplitude responses when ur 3 0 there is a downward trend of the in line amplitude ratios for t2 and t4 the similar phenomena have also been observed in jauvtis et al s experiments jauvtis and williamson 2004 and the in line amplitude ratios increased firstly and then decreased when 1 0 ur 4 0 in region ii t1 t2 and t4 show an upward trend as ur increases for t1 t2 and t4 the mean drag coefficient reach the maximum value at ur 7 0 especially for t1 the mean drag coefficients is close to 3 0 which has a threefold increase over that of stationary cylinder the similar results have been observed in previous studies jadidi et al 2017 in region ii the mean drag coefficient reach a maximum value at ur 6 0 for t3 in region iii and iv the mean drag coefficient keep at a stable value for t4 which is about 1 6 the mean drag coefficient show a downward trend for t1 and t3 and the possible reason is that the shape of t1 and t3 is similar the mean drag coefficient decrease first and then increase to a stable value 1 1 for t2 the mean drag coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 remains around 1 0 in high reynolds number region and the mean drag coefficient of t4 is higher than that of t1 t2 and t3 fig 19 shows the motion trajectories of four different bluff bodies for t1 the typical figure 8 is observed however the size of the figure 8 changes with the increase of ur in general the size of the figure 8 increases first and then decreases with the increase of ur for example the size of the figure 8 for t1 is 0 01m ax 0 01m 0 001m ay 0 001m when ur 2 0 which is 0 02m ax 0 06m 0 12m ay 0 12m when ur 6 0 and 0 053m ax 0 062m 0 08m ay 0 08m when ur 10 0 meanwhile it is found that the in line vibration displacement increases with the increase of ur for example the equilibrium position of the in line vibration is about 0m for t1 when ur 2 0 which is 0 03m when ur 6 0 0 056m when ur 10 0 and 0 068m when ur 13 0 for t2 and t3 the motion trajectory isn t the typical figure 8 at ur 3 0 corresponding to region i and the vibration is in multi frequency mode the main reason is that the rear edges of t2 and t3 have obvious effects on the shedding of vortices as shown in fig 16 the change of the figure 8 is not obvious for t1 and t4 however the range of the figure 8 for t4 is significantly smaller than that for t1 it indicates that the rear edges of t4 is helpful to suppress viv responses the shape of motion trajectory when ur 6 0 for t3 is like double 8 connected together the trajectory of t3 appears as a cross line straight line at ur 13 0 5 conclusions vortex induced vibration viv of bluff body with different rear edges is numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for reynolds number range of 8 0 103 re 5 6 104 the effects of different rear edges on viv responses are discussed in detail based on the above results the following conclusions are justified 1 based on the amplitude responses and frequency responses the viv response region is divided into four regions in region i the amplitude ratios of different bluff bodies are less than 0 5 and the frequency ratios are less than 1 0 in region ii the frequency ratios of different bluff bodies are about 1 0 and the lock in phenomenon occurs the amplitude ratios show an upward trend and reach a maximum value in region ii in region iii the lock in phenomenon still exists although the frequency is far from 1 0 and the frequency ratio increases slowly for t1 and t3 the reason is that the rear edges of t1 and t3 are similar because the rear edge of t2 has a large slope the amplitude ratio began to decrease rapidly and the frequency ratio began to increase rapidly in region iii which lead to that the lock in range is small for t2 the increase of frequency ratio for t4 is linearly related to ur and the lock in region of t4 is the narrowest in region iv viv responses are similar to that in region i 2 the vortex pattern is 2s mode for four different bluff bodies in region i the peak value of lift coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 are the similar which means that viv responses is similar although the vortex pattern is also 2s mode for t1 in region ii the frequency increases obviously the vortex patterns of t2 and t3 are changed to 2p mode in region iii the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 in region iii in entire viv response region the vortex pattern is still 2s mode for t4 and the rear edge of t4 is helpful to suppress viv responses 3 in region i the mean drag coefficient of t1 and t3 increase first and then decrease however the trend is opposite for t2 and t4 compared with that of t1 and t3 in region ii t1 t2 and t4 show an upward trend as ur increases for t1 t2 and t4 the mean drag coefficient reach the maximum value in region iii and iv the mean drag coefficient keep at a stable value for t4 the mean drag coefficient show a downward trend for t1 and t3 and the possible reason is that the shape of t1 and t3 is similar the mean drag coefficient decrease first and then increase to a stable value for t2 the mean drag coefficient of t1 t2 and t3 remains around 1 0 in high reynolds number region and the mean drag coefficient of t4 is higher than that of t1 t2 and

fsi methods and in predicting high frequency structural vibrations especially with low cost computational facilities keywords refinement method fluid structure interaction monolithic fsi method liquid sloshing dam breaking impact wave slamming 1 introduction numerical simulation of fluid structure interaction fsi has quite a range of applications in scientific and engineering fields e g aeroelastic problems farhat et al 2006 yao and marques 2017 ilie 2018 etc hydroelastic problems de rosis et al 2014 sun et al 2015 hu et al 2016 etc and hemodynamic problems torii et al 2009 kamensky et al 2015 chen and luo 2018 etc with the development of computational facilities and multi physics theories numerical simulations of fsi problems are widely conducted in different scientific and engineering fields nowadays which save a large amount of physical experiment costs and bring in much convenience to researchers as such different numerical methods have been developed to model various coupled fsi phenomena when fsi effects are non negligible from the perspective of discrete strategy fsi methods can be categorized into mesh based methods and meshless method on one aspect mesh based methods are widely used as the numerical approaches in dealing with fsi problems in which the computational domain is discretized by a set of grids or meshes and the governing equations are solved by numerical schemes such as the finite volume method fvm finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem firstly it is called a fully eulerian method if the meshes are fixed in space in which additional techniques should be used to capture the free surface such as volume of fluid vof and level set ls wick 2013 richter 2013 cottet and maitre 2016 hu et al 2016 etc generally speaking fully eulerian method using interface capturing methods such as vof is accurate and suitable for complex geometry deformation such as violent free surface evolutions however it requires solution of additional equations to capture the free surface interface and thus increases the numerical complexity secondly it is called an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method if moving meshes are used to track the changing free surface in which the meshes move independently to track the free surface interface deformation farhat and lakshminarayan 2014 wu and cai 2014 basting et al 2017 calandrini and aulisa 2019 etc space time method is another kind of moving mesh strategy to track free surface in which the time variable is treated as an additional spatial coordinate to solve the governing equations over a generalized space time domain takizawa and tezduyar 2011 bazilevs et al 2013 etc the interface tracking methods such as ale and space time show advantage in the accuracy of capturing moving fluid structure interface while they suffer mesh distortion when the free surface changes dramatically thirdly boundary element method bem is the other kind of mesh based method to simulate fsi problems except that the computation domain is only meshed at the free surface and fluid structure interface zhang et al 2013 rodríguez tembleque et al 2015 ravnik et al 2016 heltai et al 2017 etc however bem is usually limited to relatively simple geometries and physics which makes it hard to handle strong nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking and slamming moreover meshless methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and moving particle semi implicit mps method have found their way in recent years in dealing with fsi problems involving complex and nonlinear free surface evolutions since the fluid and structure particles follow exactly the motion within a fully lagrangian frame and thus meshless methods are also called the particle methods sph method works by dividing the fluid and structure into a set of discrete moving particles that follow the n s equations and handling particle particle interaction through a kernel function yang 2011 liu et al 2013 hu et al 2014 li et al 2015 fourey et al 2017 etc mps method is similar to the sph method yet it applies simplified differential operator models solely based on a local weighted averaging process without taking the gradient of a kernel function mitsume et al 2014 hwang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 hwang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2018 etc meshless methods such as the sph and mps have advantages in describing violent free surface evolutions and avoiding distortion of meshes however meshless methods usually have difficulty in setting boundary conditions and suffer computational inefficiency compared to mesh based methods from the perspective of coupling strategy fsi methods can be categorized into partitioned fsi methods and monolithic fsi methods partitioned fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains in partitioned solvers and interactively link them with appropriate coupling approaches farhat and lesoinne 2000 matthies and steindorf 2003 küttler and wall 2008 liu et al 2014 etc partitioned fsi methods are popular among researchers due to the reason that they take the best advantages of existing fluid solvers fluent and star ccm for example and structure solvers ansys and abaqus for example besides partitioned fsi methods are relatively simple in theory and easy for programming and they perform well for weak coupled fsi problems however partitioned fsi methods might suffer from the problem of computational instability and inaccuracy for strong coupled fsi problems monolithic fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains simultaneously in a fully coupled way in which the fluid and structure domains are combined to form a monolithic relation through fluid structure interface boundary conditions le tallec and mouro 2001 hübner et al 2004 heil et al 2008 hu et al 2016 etc using monolithic fsi equations monolithic fsi methods have shown advantages in computational stability efficiency as well as the accuracy for strong coupled fsi problems although monolithic fsi methods are favorable for the stability and efficiency of calculation they lose the advantage of efficiency under certain conditions since the complete system of nonlinear algebraic equations that formed from the coupled governing equations of the fluid and structure domains are solved as a whole monolithic fsi methods are usually believed to be too computational expensive for use in large scale or multi scale problems förster et al 2007 heil et al 2008 in other words when the simulation domain fluid domain mainly is large monolithic methods have to solve the coupled equations in the whole domain at every single time step additionally it is well acknowledged that usually calculation of the structure domain requires a much smaller time step compared to the fluid domain so that the high frequency structural vibration of metal structures can be captured precisely using a high sampling frequency however the time step for the fluid and structure domains applied in monolithic fsi methods are usually the same increasing the simulation cost enormously moreover although many researchers have contributed a great deal in the cost saving of the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using refinement methods löhner 2001 plewa et al 2005 ahmed and john 2015 fenández tena et al 2017 etc and parallel computing methods gropp et al 2001 amritkar et al 2014 crespo et al 2015 afzal et al 2017 etc methods on improving efficiency of monolithic fsi methods are still in need of investigation especially using low cost computational facilities the origin of coupling problems can well be explained by the fluid added mass the significance of which determines whether a strong coupling is required or whether a weak coupling suffices to solve significant added mass issues hu et al 2016 presented a simple based implicit method sbmim for the strong coupling of fsi which was validated and proved to be stable and robust under extreme simulation circumstances however several problems were found on the computational efficiency when the simulation is conducted in multi scale and when the vibration frequency of the structure is high based on sbmim a concurrent multi process refinement method is developed to solve the computational efficiency problems in this study for multi scale problems the structure mainly interacts with the fluid nearby and the far away fluid adds little to the interaction therefore concurrent multi process refinement method split the fluid in two parts the nearby fluid and the far away fluid the nearby fluid is solved simultaneously with the structure forming the local process the far away fluid is solved using a weak coupling with the nearby fluid forming the main process in this way simulations of the nearby fluid and the far away fluid can be conducted concurrently in multi processes localizing the fsi simulation area moreover different grid sizes and time steps can be applied in multi processes overcoming the difficulty of using monolithic fsi method when very small time step is required by high frequency structural vibrations of metal structures through file mappings on the computer s memory data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between multi processes on the fluid entry boundary using dummy grid with proper interpolations and time advance strategy in order to show the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method two refinement studies are carried out namely a liquid sloshing case and a dam breaking impact case simulations of the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank are conducted to give an error estimation regarding grid sizes and time steps using a gci method simulations of the dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall is conducted to verify the accuracy of present methods and to discuss the selection of localized fsi simulation area simulations of the green water impact a deck house caused by freak wave are conducted to show the performance of the method in balancing accuracy and efficiency when dealing with practical multi scale ocean engineering problems with high frequency structural vibrations through the three validation and application cases it is seen that concurrent multi process refinement method shows advantages in multi scale fsi simulations using monolithic fsi methods and in prediction of high frequency structural vibrations through the calculations of the added mass in the dam breaking case and the green water impact case it is also seen that the method is quite stable and robust for strong coupled fsi issues in which the added mass is significant by applying concurrent multi process refinement method the efficiency and accuracy of fsi simulations are balanced and improved especially for fsi simulations using low cost computational facilities like ordinary personal computers pure cfd simulations which solves the n s equations and fsi simulations which solves the strong coupled fsi equation are divided in multi processes different grid sizes and time steps can be applied in multi processes concurrently to meet the accuracy requirement of strong coupled fsi area and the efficiency requirement of the others more importantly the very small time step required by the high frequency structural vibrations can be avoided in the pure cfd processes where fsi plays a negligible role however it needs to mention that since the basic idea of concurrent multi process refinement method lies in the splitting of the fluid domain the area selection of local process should be careful so that the origin of strong coupling e g the added mass would not be under estimated 2 fluid structure interaction method 2 1 governing equations the fluid refers to liquid which is assumed to be viscous newtonian and incompressible by applying the vof youngs method youngs 1982 to reconstruct the free surface governing equations of the fluid include the continuity equation the momentum conservation equation and the fluid volume transportation equation written as follows 2 1 θ u 0 2 2 u t u u σ f ρ f f f 2 3 θ f f t θ u f f 0 where u ρ f f f and σ f are the velocity density body force and cauchy stress tensor of the fluid f f denotes the transportation volume of the fluid while the ratio of the volume occupied of fluid is described by θ which equals 1 where fluid can flow across the mesh boundary freely and 0 where the mesh boundary is solid lin 2007 governing equation of the structure is given by the structure momentum equation 2 4 ρ s w σ s f s where w ρ s f s and σ s are the displacement density body force and first piola kirchhoff stress tensor of the structure on the fluid structure interface velocity and traction force of the fluid domain must agree with the structure domain 2 5 u w 2 6 σ f n f σ s n s where n f and n s are the unit outward normal vector of the fluid boundary and the unit outward normal vector of the structure boundary 2 2 fluid structure coupling a self developed solver is utilized for fsi simulations which solves the incompressible navier stokes n s equations under two dimensional flow conditions in cfd simulations and solves the monolithic fsi equation in fsi simulations finite element method fem is used to discretize two dimensional euler beams simplified from structures that meet the cylindrical bending assumption timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 the structure here is assumed to be under small displacement and within the elastic range the structural dynamic equation can be written as 2 7 m w c w k w f where m is the global matrix of mass c is the global matrix of damping k is the global matrix of stiffness f is the nodal force vector implicit houbolt scheme houbolt 1950 which has been proved unconditionally stable newmark 1959 johnson 1966 nickel 1971 is used to calculate the structural velocity and acceleration at time t δ t with time step δ t and thus eq 2 7 is rewritten as 2 8 2 m δ t 2 11 c 6 δ t k w t δ t f t δ t 5 m δ t 2 3 c δ t w t 4 m δ t 2 3 c 2 δ t w t δ t m δ t 2 c 3 δ t w t 2 δ t from eqs 2 5 and 2 6 the relation between fluid velocity u c o u p l e t δ t on the fluid structure interface and structure displacement w and the relation between the structure nodal force f t δ t and fluid pressure p c o u p l e t δ t on fluid structure interface are given as 2 9 u c o u p l e t δ t a c o u p l e 1 w t δ t 2 10 f t δ t a c o u p l e 2 p c o u p l e t δ t where a c o u p l e 1 and a c o u p l e 2 are the conversion matrices generated in coupling calculation note that on fluid structure interface only the pressure related force is considered viscous effect is neglected at fluid structure interface since it plays an unimportant role in the simulation cases that this fsi method is designed for simple method patankar and spalding 1972 is used to solve the fluid governing equations finite difference method fdm is used to discretize the fluids while a fixed staggered grid eulerian grid system is used within which the pressure is defined at the grid center and the velocity is defined at the grid boundaries center central difference scheme cds is used for the pressure gradients and diffusion terms and the combination of the central difference and upwind difference scheme uds is used for advection terms using a two step projection method on eq 2 2 tentative velocity is expressed as 2 11 u t δ t u t δ t f f t δ t ν 2 u t u t u t where ν is the kinematic viscosity u t δ t is the tentative velocity at time t δ t u t is the true velocity at time t the tentative velocity is further updated as the true velocity with the use of correct fluid pressure at time t δ t using relation as 2 12 u t δ t u t δ t δ t p t δ t ρ f where p t δ t is the fluid pressure at time t δ t obtained by solving pressure poisson equation as 2 13 2 θ p t δ t ρ f θ u t δ t δ t here fluid pressure p t δ t in eq 2 13 can be solved using a successive over relaxation sor method for the fluid grids with fluid structure interfaces on their boundaries the interfaces can be treated as mobile solid boundaries hu et al 2016 therefore the simple based pressure poisson equation can be modified by replacing the tentative velocity in eq 2 13 with the mobile solid boundary velocity 2 14 p c o u p l e t δ t b c o u p l e u c o u p l e t δ t where b c o u p l e is the conversion matrix function formed in coupling calculation through simultaneous equations of eq 2 9 eq 2 10 and eq 2 11 structure nodal force is obtained as 2 15 f t δ t a c o u p l e 2 b c o u p l e a c o u p l e 1 w t δ t combining eq 2 15 with eq 2 8 the coupled structural dynamic equation is written as 2 16 2 m δ t 2 11 c 6 δ t k w t δ t a c o u p l e 2 b c o u p l e a c o u p l e 1 w t δ t 5 m δ t 2 3 c δ t w t 4 m δ t 2 3 c 2 δ t w t δ t m δ t 2 c 3 δ t w t 2 δ t here the relation between w and w are given as w t δ t 11 w t δ t 18 w t 9 w t δ t 2 w t 2 δ t 6 δ t following the houbolt scheme eq 2 16 is a monolithic fsi equation solved in an implicit way within a single iteration step δ t the fluid and structure domains are solved simultaneously more detailed derivations deductions validations and convergence tests of the monolithic fsi equation can be found in hu et al 2016 fig 1 gives the flow chart of the monolithic fsi method explained as the following 1 module set initial condition creates meshing of the fluids and structures and sets the initial simulation parameters 2 at each time step of the fsi simulation tentative velocity of the fluid is obtained in module calculate temp velocity using a two step projection following the simple method 3 matrices assembling and coupled fsi equation solving of eq 2 16 using the houbolt scheme are conducted in module solve coupled fsi equation 4 after solving the coupled fsi equation the structural response is calculated while the fluid velocity at fluid structure interface is obtained through eq 2 9 in module get structure response 5 then in module correct fluid pressure the fluid pressure is corrected through sor iteration of eq 2 14 using the obtained velocity at fluid structure interface until convergence note that criterion max i j p i j m 1 p i j m 0 001 ρ f is applied in this fsi method where p i j m 1 and p i j m denote the pressures of the m 1 th and mth iterations 6 after the fluid pressure converges real velocity of the fluid is updated using the corrected fluid pressure in module update fluid velocity while the fluid free surface is reconstructed using the vof method 7 updating the time to the next step the procedure goes back to module calculate temp velocity again and the simulation time proceeds to the next step 3 concurrent multi process refinement method 3 1 descriptions in section 2 the monolithic fsi method is briefly introduced which is capable of solving various strong coupled fsi problems however when encountered with realistic fsi simulation requirements such as simulations in multi scale and with high frequency structural vibrations the fsi method is faced with several problems on the efficiency and accuracy of computations listed as follows firstly for the fsi simulation using a monolithic fsi equation solution of the fluid domain is connected with the structure domain inseparably which means that the simulation is conducted solving the monolithic fsi equation in the whole computational domain undoubtedly this would lead to extra computational costs by changing the n s equations into the coupled fsi equations since the conversion matrices formed in the monolithic fsi equation eq 2 16 could be difficult and inefficient to solve secondly complex structures usually complicate the boundary of the fluid domain around where grids must be refined to achieve computational accuracy traditional refinement method solves the large scale matrix assembled by the governing equations in all the coarse and fine grids of the fluid domain within a single time step however it is know that solving a large scale matrix is rather inefficient compared to solving several small scale matrices especially with ordinary computational facilities like personal computers thirdly maximum time step in the fluid domain is usually defined according to the courant number c max u i j δ t δ x where u i j is the fluid velocity in every grids and δ t and δ x are the corresponding time step and grid length john and anderson 1995 godderidge et al 2006 therefore it is seen that finer grids require smaller time step and coarser grids fit for larger time step however existing monolithic fsi methods assign the same time step fixed or adaptive to all the grids in the fluid domain regardless of the fact that only local refined grids need smaller time step which increases the computational cost enormously lastly for fsi problems with relatively large rigidity structures such as metal structures time step in the structure domain would be significantly reduced compared to the time step in the fluid domain so that the high frequency structural vibrations could be captured accurately using high sampling frequencies the ratio of time step between the fluid and structure domains might be up to 20 times or larger however for monolithic fsi equations like eq 2 16 it is impossible to separate the time step between the fluid and structure domains in this section a concurrent multi process refinement method is developed which is capable of solving the monolithic fsi problems described above being different from traditional refinement method concurrent multi process refinement method divides the computational domain into several subdomains in different processes shown in fig 2 multi processes exist at the same time and are computed concurrently with corresponding multi grid sizes and multi time steps where data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between two processes through fluid entry boundaries and dummy grids by applying the method efficiency and accuracy of monolithic fsi simulations are balanced in four aspects firstly the monolithic fsi equation is solved within the fsi process while the n s equations are solved in other processes where fsi is not included secondly the fluid domain is divided into several subdomains and simulated in multi processes with different grid sizes concurrently which decomposes the total matrix into several smaller matrices in a single time step compared with the traditional refinement method thirdly larger and smaller time steps are applied in different simulation processes which guarantees the simulation efficiency in coarser grids and the simulation accuracy in finer grids simultaneously lastly the high sampling frequency thus small time step requirement in the structure domain caused by the high frequency structural vibrations is avoided in the fluid domain that is far from the fsi area and have little influence on the fsi coupling 3 2 numerical implementation in order to explain the numerical implementation of concurrent multi process refinement method developed in this paper a specific illustration of wave structure interaction is given in fig 3 the interaction problem is divided into two processes where generation and propagation of the wave are simulated in main process with a larger grid size and time step and the interaction between wave and structure are simulated in local process with a smaller grid size and time step in concurrent multi process refinement method the data between main process and local process are linked and transmitted through the fluid entry boundary which is similar to the wave making boundary velocity inlet in numerical implementation of wave generation shown in fig 3 as the red solid lines dummy grids are introduced in main process shown as the yellow colored grids in fig 3 as its literal meaning dummy grids are virtual grids acting as virtual boundary of the fluid domain in main process fluid entry boundary and dummy grids are the bridge of data transmissions through which relations of variables of fluid velocity components and pressure between main process and local process are built bi directionally in particular dummy grids act as the boundary condition for main process while the column grids on fluid entry boundary within dummy grids act as the boundary condition for local process the data transmissions of variables between main process and local process are illustrated in fig 4 in main process assuming the fluid velocity on the right left top and bottom boundary

process in which δ x m a i n and δ y m a i n denote the grid length in horizontal and vertical directions in main process δ x l o c a l and δ y l o c a l denote the grid length in horizontal and vertical directions in local process once the data transmission is completed from one process to the other the transmitted values update the variables in dummy grids at fluid entry boundary when data are transmitted from local process to main process variables u i j m a i n r i g h t u i j m a i n l e f t v i j m a i n t o p v i j m a i n b o t t o m p i j m a i n are updated by u i j l o c a l r

local process are calculated using the new boundary condition of the column grids on fluid entry boundary within dummy grids the descriptions above explains the data transmission between multi processes in one time step note that one time step here denotes the last time step in local process when data are transmitted from local process to main process or the last time step in main process when data are transmitted from main process to local process to better explain the time advance strategy fig 5 gives the sketch of the time relation between main process mp and local process lp temporally firstly assuming the computational domain at t t 1 is already known while the selected time steps for main process and local process are δ t m p and δ t l p respectively also assuming the relation of δ t m p n δ t l p exist where n is the ratio between time steps through fluid entry boundary and dummy grids data from main process at t t 1 are transmitted to local process and the boundary condition of local process is updated secondly simulations from t t 1 to t t 1 n δ t l p are carried out in local process after which data from local process at t t 1 n δ t l p are transmitted to main process and the boundary condition of main process is updated note that relation t t 1 n δ t l p t 1 δ t m p exist thirdly the simulation at t t 1 δ t m p is conducted which means that the simulation of main process proceeds to the next time step this time advance relation starts and ends at the certain time when the multi process refinement is applied and canceled note that the data exchange between main process and local process at fluid entry boundary and dummy grids which are within the pure fluid domain rather than at the fluid structure interface moreover the resolution of the fluid and structure parts are still solved as one entity in local process therefore concurrent multi process refinement method do not change the fact that the fsi method is a monolithic method rather than a partitioned method the latter of which solve the fluid and structure parts in different entities using staggered approach or non staggered sub iteration synchronization techniques felippa et al 2001 3 3 algorithm procedure the fsi method in section 2 and concurrent multi process refinement method is compiled using visual basic language and operated in a computational station which consists of an 8 core 3 60 ghz cpu and a 12 0 gb ram data transmission of concurrent multi process refinement method is based on the file mapping approach provided by visual basic which creates mapping relations from disk files to computer memory using this approach the link between different processes can be built by transmitting data through visiting memory rather than disk files leading to an increase of the data access speed among processes when concurrent multi process refinement method operates it first creates the file mapping of each process and then built the links of data transmission between processes by directly visiting memory the received data in each process update the boundary conditions for simulations while the data obtained through simulations are further saved in memory for the next data transmission fig 6 gives the flow chart of concurrent multi process refinement method applied in the monolithic fsi method sbmim from which the programming procedure of the algorithm is illustrated as can be seen procedure concurrent multi process refinement method is composed of the following steps 1 9 note that fig 6 and steps 1 9 takes a two process simulation as example however concurrent multi process refinement method is able to operate with more than two processes 1 the cfd fsi simulation in one process continues until simulation time reaches time t when concurrent multi process simulations are set to begin 2 at time t multi process simulations begin with set initial memory file mapping module which initializes the names and parameters of file mappings and disk files for the variables and mesh grids in different processes 3 create memory file mapping for processes module creates the file mappings between disk files and the computer memory for processes that need to be linked for data transmissions in this module different mapping addresses between each two multi processes are created and assigned in memory respectively where data between two multi processes can be visited and transmitted 4 when file mappings of the multi processes are built the cfd fsi simulation can be carried out in multi processes using the method in section 2 taking a two process division as example the simulation is divided into one main process mp with time step δ t m p and one local process lp with time step δ t l p note that δ t m p δ t l p 5 assuming the simulation at time t in main process has already been finished data for transmission at this time are obtained from the simulation results of main process in get mp data at t module and sent to the computer memory in send mp data module through the file mapping created before 6 local process accesses the data from main process in receive mp data module by visiting the memory and is solved with time step δ t l p the simulation of local process is conducted until the simulation time reaches t δ t m p when the simulation of main process should be continued to update the boundary conditions for local process 7 data of variables of local process at t δ t m p are obtained in get lp data at t δ t m p module and sent to main process in send lp data module through file mapping 8 received by main process in receive lp data module data from local process updates the boundary conditions for main process then the simulation of main process is conducted with time step δ t m p until the simulation time reaches t 2 δ t m p 9 looping the steps from 5 8 until the simulation time reaches the total simulation time t m u l t i o v e r set for multi process simulations the multi process simulation is over and the cfd fsi in one process continues from time t m u l t i o v e r 3 4 advantages and limitations advantages of concurrent multi process refinement method are analyzed first as we know fsi methods can be divided into two categories considering the coupling manners which are the partitioned fsi methods and monolithic fsi methods partitioned fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains respectively and iteratively in each time step the fluid solver predicts the position velocity and pressure of all grids or particles on the fluid structure interface within the fluid domain then the fluid force is acted on the structure domain to calculate the deformation and velocity of the structure while the updated variables of the deformable structure is applied back to the fluid domain to correct the fluid velocity and pressure until convergence as a result the total iteration number would be the iteration number of fluid denoted as m 1 multiply the iteration number of structure denoted as n 1 that is m 1 n 1 on another aspect monolithic fsi methods such as sbmim establish a monolithic fsi equation using the continuity relation between the fluid and structure domains in each time step variables of the fluid and structure domains such as the velocity and pressure of fluid grids and deformation and velocity of structure elements are solved using the monolithic fsi equation at the same time as a result the total iteration number would be the iteration number of solving the monolithic fsi equation since sbmim constructs the monolithic fsi equation through the pressure poisson equation of the fluid using mobile solid boundaries hu et al 2016 the total iteration number would be the iteration number of the fluid denoted as m 2 usually a relation of m 2 m 1 n 1 is expected since m 1 and m 2 are close in value and thus the monolithic fsi method in this paper is relatively computational inexpensive compared to the partitioned fsi methods the monolithic fsi equation usually complicates the governing equations making it more difficult to get the solution compared with pure cfd simulations in addition the monolithic fsi equation requires a unified time step for both the fluid and structure domains although the time step of the fluid domain according to the courant number criterion can be much larger than the time step of the structure domain when a high sampling frequency is requirement for high frequency structural vibrations to deal with these two problems concurrent multi process refinement method divides the large scale computational domain into processes of fsi simulations and pure cfd simulations the dimension of the monolithic fsi equation is reduced by localizing the fsi area while the unnecessary unified time step is avoided by different time steps to solve the monolithic fsi equation traditional refinement shown in fig 2 a requires a simulation time of t 2 m 2 where t 2 is the time step number and m 2 is the iteration number in one time step multi process refinement shown in fig 2 b requires a simulation time of t 2 r ml m m t 2 m l where m m and m l are the iteration number of main process and local process in one time step and r ml is the ratio of time step of main process against time step of local process since m 2 m m m l is expected due to the larger application area of the monolithic fsi equation using traditional refinement it is easy to found that t 2 m 2 t 2 r ml m m t 2 m l indicating that concurrent multi process refinement method can further lower the computation cost in monolithic fsi methods compared to the traditional refinement method there are also some limitations of concurrent multi process refinement method for simulations containing fsi and elastic responses of structures when the computation domain is divided into main process and local process the monolithic fsi equation is only solved in local process while pure cfd simulation is conducted in main process as a result fsi effects mainly the added mass effects are actually not included in main process narrowing the area actually influenced by fsi therefore it should be noted that the area selection of local process should be careful so that the fsi effects would not be under estimated for simulations containing fsi and elastic responses of structures it is recommended that a refinement study on area selection should be carried out first to determine the local process area near the elastic structures and the main process area far from the elastic structures in this paper a detailed refinement study on local process selection can be found in section 4 2 in which an error estimation is carried out also compared with massive parallel fsi simulations using super computers concurrent multi process refinement method might lose its advantage in efficiency since this method is designed for low cost computational facilities like ordinary personal computers 4 refinement study in this section two cases of refinement study are introduced using concurrent multi process refinement method applied in the monolithic fsi method including the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank and the dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall the liquid sloshing case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in cfd simulation with nonlinear free surface evolutions and gives an error estimation on different refinements including coarse medium fine and multi process grids the dam breaking case compares the results by present methods and by previous literatures and gives an error estimation on refinements with different local process areas 4 1 liquid sloshing in a baffled tank the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank is one typical cfd case which has been widely investigated and considered suitable for the refinement study the top panel of fig 7 gives the illustration of the liquid sloshing in a tank with a baffle which is designed similar to the one in jung et al 2012 the tank is 0 8 m in length and 0 5 m in height while the liquid which is water in the tank is 0 35 m in depth a fixed rigid 0 28 m long baffle is clamped at the middle of the tank bottom three pressure gauges are installed at the left p1 right p2 wall of the tank and left top p3 of the baffle to monitor fluid pressures the tank is under pure surge motion defined by the sinusoidal function of 4 1 x s a s sin ω t where x s is the surge motion transversally a s and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the surge motion which are fixed as a s 0 02 m and ω 5 82 r a d s respectively physical properties within the fluid domain are chosen as fluid density 1000 kg m3 fluid kinematical viscosity 0 000001145 m2 s air pressure 101263 4pa acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 following the courant number criterion three groups of grid sizes and time steps are adopted to give a grid independence test which are the coarse medium and fine grids shown in table 1 in addition a multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method is applied to compare with the coarse medium and fine grids in which the three processes are named as main process local process a and local process b shown in the bottom panel of fig 7 the total simulation time for the coarse medium fine and multi process grids are 6s including five whole sloshing periods firstly a grid independence test on the liquid sloshing are conducted with the coarse medium and fine grids which cost 1 h 7 h and 66 h of computation respectively the time histories at pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 are shown in fig 8 a fig 8 b and fig 8 c indicating that a rather satisfactory agreement among the three simulation cases however using the relative standard error rse deviations of the pressure results with coarse and medium grids are obtained based on the pressure results with the fine grid given in fig 8 d it is seen that the rses of the coarse grid are 12 3 11 7 and 9 3 at p1 p2 and p3 while the rses of the medium gird are 6 8 7 8 and 4 8 at p1 p2 and p3 by halving the grid size and time step from coarse to medium grid the relative standard error is reduced by more than 42 averagely but the computational cost is increased by about seven times it was stated that a recommended method for grid refinement study and error estimation is called the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 which was based on the richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 gci is a measure of the percentage of how far the computed value is away from the asymptotic numerical value and has been evaluated over several hundred cases procedures and formulas of the gci method can be found in many previous papers roache 2003 celik et al 2008 park et al 2015 etc and thus they are not listed here table 2 shows the mean values of the key variable which is pressure obtained from the fine grid subscript 1 medium grid subscript 2 and coarse grid subscript 3 solutions and the results of corresponding gcis note that gci21 means the gci of medium grid against fine grid while gci32 means the gci of coarse grid against medium grid it is seen that there is a reduction in gcis with successive grid refinement indicating the solution is reaching towards a grid independent result in addition gci32 at pressure monitor p3 is much larger than the ones at p1 and p2 which means that medium grid performs well at p1 and p2 but leads to a relatively larger error at p3 thus to obtain a convinced pressure value at p3 a fine grid might be necessary after conducting the grid independence test the simulation of liquid sloshing using concurrent multi process refinement method is carried out fig 9 illustrates the snapshots of the liquid sloshing in the last surge period of the tank using multi process grid in which the grid size reduces from the bottom to the free surface of the tank in three divided linked processes it is seen that within the area in local process b the fine grid shows good performance in vortex and free surface evolutions the vortexes induced by the baffle are still clear in direction and size although the baffle is relatively long besides new small vortexes along with the rolling and breaking of the free surface can be captured which are not shown in jung et al 2012 in fact the vortex and free surface evolutions in jung et al 2012 were relatively coarse and simple due to the reason of using a relatively coarse grid compared to the multi process grid in this paper which still showed good agreement with the experimental measurement and existing numerical results however the vortex in the finer grid and the violent rolling and breaking of the free surface surely have an important influence on the loads acting on the wall and baffle of the tank for instance the comparison of pressures in fig 8 shows that the finer grid is not only more precise according to the rse and gci but also on the depth of the amplitude peak and trough in one period of sloshing which are induced by the vortex and free surface elevations the pressure time histories of the multi process grid at pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 and the rses of the multi process grid against the fine grid are given in fig 10 by comparing the pressure histories from the multi process grid in fig 10 a and the fine grid in fig 8 it is seen that the multi process grid shows good agreements with the fine grid on pressures the rses of the multi process grid against the fine grid at p1 p2 and p3 are merely 0 2 0 2 and 0 4 respectively indicating that the relative standard error between multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method and the fine grid in the whole simulation area is small enough to be neglected in the meanwhile among the fine grid subscript 1 multi process grid subscript 2 and medium grid subscript 3 gcis are calculated in table 3 from which it is seen that gcis of multi process grid against fine grid are all smaller than 0 5 therefore from view of both the vortex and free surface evolutions and the pressure time histories concurrent multi process refinement method performs satisfactorily as a refinement method additionally shown in table 1 applying the multi process grid reduced the computational cost by more than half compared to the fine grid which proves that concurrent multi process refinement method balanced the accuracy and efficiency at the same time it should be clarified that when studying the sloshing loads on the side walls of the liquid tank and the sloshing loads on the vertical baffle are not focused a medium grid is enough for the accuracy of simulation however when attention is paid on the sloshing loads on the vertical baffle especially the loads near the upper end of the baffle a fine grid or multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method should be applied 4 2 dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall the dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall is widely used to validate fsi methods since the violent free surface movement and strong impact are involved the case is designed similar to the ones by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 who used different mps fem methods a 0 1 m 0 2 m water dam breaks and slams an elastic vertical wall 0 352 m away from it the 0 352 m high vertical wall is fixed at the lower end and free at the upper end a pressure gauge pg is placed on the wall 0 02 m from its lower end physical properties are chosen as fluid density 1000 kg m3 fluid kinematical viscosity 0 000001145 m2 s air pressure 101263 4pa acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 elastic modulus of wall 0 2 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 wall density 7860 kg m3 wall thickness 0 006 m in the fluid domain three groups of grid sizes are applied which are the coarse fine and multi process grids shown in table 4 while in the structure domain the elastic vertical wall is discretized into 61 elements note that the fine grid case gives a fluid grid number of 1250 which is the same with the number of fluid particles used by sun et al 2015 the whole simulation time is 10s and time step is chosen as 0 0001s small enough to capture the high frequency vibration of the elastic vertical wall and to guarantee the maximum courant number 1 for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 from the computation cost of the coarse fine and multi process grids in table 4 it is seen that the fine grid case takes about 0 83 h of computational cost which is over 3 times of the computational cost of the coarse grid case due to the smaller time step and larger number of grids compared to the cpu time of the simulation by sun et al 2015 which was 1 h the computational cost of the fine grid case in this paper is smaller since a monolithic fsi method is used in present study while sun et al 2015 applied a partitioned mps fem method as explained in section 3 4 the partitioned method is usually more computational expensive since iterations exist in both the fluid and structure domains by using concurrent multi process refinement method the simulation time is further reduced from 0 83 h to about 0 52 h indicating that concurrent multi process refinement method is able to further improve the efficiency of fsi simulation by localizing the fsi area and applying different time steps in multi processes fig 11 illustrates the snapshots of the dam breaking flow slamming event from which it is seen that the computational domain is divided into main process and local process using concurrent multi process refinement method the area near the vertical wall is refined in local process to guarantee the accuracy of the fsi simulation while the area far from the vertical wall is with a coarse grid system to accelerate the computation as expected local process gives good performance in the fsi area near the vertical wall such as the water impinging climbing rolling breaking and falling while main process controls the flow behavior that is relatively far from the vertical wall without considering fsi fig 12 gives the comparison of displacements at the wall free end and pressures at pg among the coarse fine and multi process grids showing that the coarse grid relatively produces larger errors both in displacement and pressure while the results of the fine grid and multi process grid are almost identical in order to validate the numerical methods displacement at the free end and pressure at pg of present results are compared with the numerical results by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 it is seen from fig 13 a that the displacement of present results agrees well with the one by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 although there are some acceptable discrepancies from fig 13 b it is observed that there is satisfactory agreement of the fluid pressures at pg between present result and the result by sun et al 2015 however the pressure was not given by zhang and wan 2018 therefore from both the displacement of the vertical wall and the fluid pressure on the wall the present fsi method and concurrent multi process refinement method are capable of producing good results compared with the previous literatures additionally by using concurrent multi process refinement method the computational cost can be further reduced than the original monolithic fsi method fig 14 depicts the residual error and iteration number of local process of the multi process simulation case in table 4 it is seen that at about 0 2 0 25s when initial slamming happens the residual error and iteration number are both relatively larger than average however the residual error decreases quickly with the iteration number showing a concave decreasing function during one time step as can be seen from the logarithmic coordinate of fig 14 a in the meanwhile the iteration number decreases quickly with the simulation time and is stabilized between 1 and 5 after initial slamming as shown in fig 14 b therefore it is proven that the present fsi method sbmim and concurrent multi process refinement method give good performance on convergence since one nature and purpose of concurrent multi process refinement method is to reduce the area of localized monolithic fsi coupling in multi scale problems a proper choice of local process area becomes a key issue in order to choose proper local process area refinement study on the effect of local process area is carried out based on the multi process refinement in table 4 three groups of local process selections are applied named as local process a local process b and local process c here main process and local process a are designed exactly the same with main process and local process in table 4 while local process b halves local process a and local process c further halves local process b in the horizontal direction as shown in fig 15 particularly area lengths in the horizontal direction of local process a local process b and local process c are 0 12 m 0 06 m and 0 03 m respectively grid sizes and time steps of the three local processes are selected the same with the ones of local process in table 4 which are 0 004 m and 0 0004s all the other physical properties stay the same with the previous choices displacements at the wall free end and pressures at pg obtained in local process a local process b and local process c are shown in fig 16 on one aspect it is observed that in the 1st half period of structural vibration local process c gives smaller vibration period thus higher frequency than local process a and local process b the reason lies in that local process c might be too small for the localized fsi simulation to accurately highlight the added mass induced by the strong coupling between the fluid and structure on the other aspect the vibration periods obtained in local process a and local process b are quite close indicating that local process b might be enough for the accurate calculation of the added mass in the localized fsi simulation using the gci method the structural vibration frequency and maximum pressure at pg are deemed as the key variables both from the structure and fluid points of view it should be mentioned that the structural vibration frequency here is limited within the 1st half period of the structural vibration as the strong fsi process has already finished after water falling and free vibration dominates after the 1st half period depicted in fig 11 table 5 gives gcis among local process a subscript 1 local process b subscript 2 and local process c subscript 3 the result shows that the convergence conditions of both key variables are monotonic as there are reductions in the gcis of both key variables with successive grid refinement gci21 gci32 which indicates that the dependency of the simulation results on the grid size has been reduced and the solution is reaching towards the grid independent solution it is also shown that gci21 calculated between local process a and local process b is rather small in view of both key variables in the meanwhile gci32 calculated between local process b and local process c is relatively larger as such gcis among different local processes prove the conclusion that local process b might be enough for the localized fsi simulation but local process c might be too limited for the accurate calculation of the added mass in the strong coupling between the fluid and structure it is suggested by the authors that local process selection is suitable when gcis of key variables are smaller than 1 so that the strong coupling between the fluid and structure e g the added mass can be fully considered 5 application green water slamming induced by freak wave freak wave also called as rogue wave or monster wave is a kind of extreme wave that has led to many destructions and accidents in recent decades kjeldsen 1984 lavrenov 1998 dysthe et al 2008 etc when marine structures encounter with freak waves green water and overtopping events are the most commonly observed consequences which might cause severe impact on superstructures qin et al 2017a 2017b 2017c therefore it is necessary to study the green water impact issue caused by freak waves especially when hydroelastic effects cannot be neglected faltinsen et al 1997 however several problems are raised on the accuracy and efficiency balance of fsi simulation of this issue firstly the relatively long simulation time of wave generation and propagation doesn t cohere with the transient simulation time of fsi secondly the grid size of wave simulation which requires a relatively coarse grid to reduce computational cost doesn t cohere with the grid size of local fsi simulation which requires a fine grid to guarantee accuracy thirdly the small time step required by accurate calculation of high frequency structural vibration doesn t cohere with the relatively large time step required by wave simulation especially for monolithic fsi method lastly solving the monolithic fsi equation in the whole domain brings unnecessary difficulty and costs too much time in this section the green water impact on deck house structures caused by freak waves are simulated using concurrent multi process refinement method to conquer the problems listed before this case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in dealing with practical multi scale ocean engineering problems including localized fsi simulations with high frequency structural vibrations a numerical wave tank is built of 10 m in length 1 m in height and 0 7 m in water depth where three gauges are placed 3 m gauge 1 4 m gauge 2 and 5 m gauge 3 from the wave making boundary freak waves based on peregrine breather of nonlinear schrödinger equation is applied akhmediev et al 2009 chabchoub et al 2012 hu et al 2015 etc which is to reach the maximum crest at gauge 2 at 10s with carrier wave number k 2 223 rad m and amplitude a 0 1 m physical properties within the fluid

wave and the platform a verification on freak wave generation is conducted with the grid size of 0 02 m and time step of 0 002s the numerical results of free surface elevations at gauge 1 gauge 2 and gauge 3 are compared with the theoretical results in fig 17 a showing satisfactory agreement the platform structure which is 1 m in length and 0 2 m in height is fixed 4 m from the wave making boundary and 0 08 m above the still water line on the platform a 0 2 m long clamped clamped vertical wall is placed at the middle representing the deck house wall which is treated as a 0 001 m thick elastic structure with elastic modulus 210 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 and material density 7860 kg m3 three pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 are located at the bottom middle and top of the vertical wall the green water impact simulation is divided into three processes using concurrent multi process refinement method namely main process local process a and local process b grid sizes and time steps of which are given in table 6 the vertical deck house wall is discretized into 40 euler beam elements it should be noticed that the time step in local process b is 0 00005s which is 1 20 of the time step in local process a due to the reason that the coupled fsi equation of eq 2 16 is solved in local process b as mentioned before in order to capture the high frequency vibration of the elastic steel structures solution of the monolithic fsi equation requires a much smaller time step compared to the ones in main process and local process a the total simulation time of freak wave generation and propagation in main process is 20s while the simulation times in local process a and local process b are both 1s before the green water event occurs the crest shape of the freak wave at 9 40s is shown in fig 17 b indicating a nonlinear wave crest with a steep front and a gentle back from 9 92s to 10 78s in which period the green water event lasts the free surfaces and velocity vectors black arrows in main process local process a and local process b are illustrated in fig 18 it is seen that with the refinement of multi processes the large scale cfd wave simulation and the small scale fsi simulation are well combined using concurrent multi process refinement method nonlinear behaviors of fluid climbing rolling breaking and splashing are fully simulated in the small scale fsi simulation in local process b leading to more convincible loads on the elastic structure and thus a more reliable hydroelastic response moreover the small time step 0 00005s applied to solve the monolithic fsi equation is restricted within local process b which significantly reduces the computational cost by the comparison among one process two processes and three processes performance of concurrent multi process refinement method can be seen from a series of contrast simulation tests listed in table 7 it is seen that directly applying a fine grid in one main process to guarantee the accuracy of local fsi simulation is computational expensive with over 100 h of simulation by using a two process division computational cost can be reduced to 0 8 h of wave simulation and 2 3 h of fsi simulation and thus a total cost of 3 1 h however the computational cost of using two process division still overruns the cost of using three process division which is 1 8 h consisting of 0 8 h of wave simulation and 0 1 h of green water simulation and 0 9 h of fsi simulation therefore conclusion could be drawn that on condition of a reasonable division concurrent multi process refinement method improves the computational efficiency by applying more processes concurrently the pressure time histories at p1 p2 and p3 and displacements of node 11 node 21 and node 31 of the wall are given in fig 19 from which the hydroelastic effects can be clearly observed through the oscillations of the pressures and displacements as a result of fsi vibration frequency of the vertical wall would be changing overtime with the impact of on deck water by using a fast fourier transform fft the vibration frequency of displacements and oscillation frequency of pressures are obtained which vary from 37 hz to 133 hz corresponding to a vibration period from 0 0270s to 0 0075s from the lowest vibration and oscillation period the reason of using a much smaller time step in fsi simulations which is 0 00005s in local process b 1 20 of the time step in local process a can be reasonably explained as that only such small time step is able to capture the high frequency structural vibrations and pressure oscillations in other words the usage of a much smaller time step in fsi simulations is determined by the high sampling frequency requirement of solving the monolithic fsi equation however in the fluid domain that is far away from the fsi area the sampling frequency requirement of solving pure cfd is much smaller leading to the tolerance of using much larger time steps in main process and local process a according to the courant number criterion further considering the fsi problem of an elastic horizontal deck added at top of the deck house wall a four process division is utilized by concurrent multi process refinement method the 0 08 m long and 0 0015 m thick horizontal deck is fixed at the right end and free at the left end which is discretized into 32 euler beam elements three pressure monitors p4 p5 and p6 are located at the right end middle point and left end of the horizontal deck by further dividing local process b the simulation is composed of main process local process a local process b and local process c thus the fsi simulation solving the monolithic fsi equation is carried out in local process c grid sizes and time steps in main process local process a local process b and local process c are listed in table 8 snapshots of the events in local process a local process b and local process c are illustrated in fig 20 from which the impact phenomena including violent fluid rolling breaking falling and splashing can be observed the pressure time histories at p4 p5 and p6 and displacements of node 1 node 17 and node 33 of the deck are given in fig 21 by applying the fft on displacement time histories it is seen that the vibration frequency of the horizontal deck varies from 110 hz to 196 hz corresponding to vibration period from 0 0091s to 0 0051s from the lowest vibration period it is seen that the sampling frequency requirement of the horizontal deck becomes even higher than the one of vertical wall due to a larger structural rigidity therefore the simulation time step in solving the monolithic fsi equation should be further reduced which is 0 000025s in local process c 1 2 of the time step in local process b as a result the computational cost using a four process division is increased to 2 2 h consisting of 0 8 0 1 and 0 2 h of cfd simulations in main process local process a and local process b and 1 1 h of fsi simulation in local process c when dealing with multi scale fsi problems such as the freak wave propagates overtops in large scale and causes slamming in small scale the computational cost is usually high using the traditional monolithic fsi and refinement method by reasonable division of the fluid domain concurrent multi process refinement method is able to save computational cost through multi grid sizes and multi time steps to multi processes as such the scale differences between large scale problems such as the wave propagation and overtopping and small scale problems such as the green water impact are well handled leading to a well balanced monolithic fsi simulation in accuracy and efficiency however as mentioned in section 3 4 and section 4 2 the division of multi processes should be carefully chosen when dealing with multi scale fsi problems to avoid under estimation of fsi effects the added mass in particular 6 conclusions in this paper a concurrent multi process refinement method applied in two dimensional fluid structure interaction problems is developed which divides the fsi simulation into concurrent multi processes with different grid sizes and time steps as an important supplement of the simple based monolithic implicit method sbmim initially proposed by hu et al 2016 concurrent multi process refinement method solves the accuracy and efficiency problems encountered during the implementation of the monolithic fsi method in dealing with multi scale fsi problems and in predicting high frequency structural vibrations by using the file mapping provided in visual basic the split multi processes are linked in pairs in a pair of processes data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between main process and local process through fluid entry boundary and dummy grid with proper interpolations and time advance strategy the multi grid sizes in main process and local process localize the fsi area so that the monolithic fsi equation can be solved in a limited scale saving the computational cost induced by solution of the monolithic fsi equation the multi time steps in main process and local process balance the accuracy and efficiency temporally especially under condition that a high sampling frequency is required to capture the high frequency structural vibrations of large rigidity structures two refinement study cases are given in the paper using the gci method including a case of the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank and a case of the dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall the liquid sloshing case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in cfd simulations with nonlinear free surface evolutions and gives an error estimation on the coarse medium fine and multi process grids the dam breaking case compares the results by present methods and by previous literatures and gives an error estimation on different selected local process areas simulations of the green wave impact caused by a freak wave is conducted to show the practical application of concurrent multi process refinement method in multi scale fsi problems with high frequency structural vibrations using monolithic fsi methods from which it is seen that the present method can deal with ocean engineering problems composed of large scale cfd issues such as the wave propagation and small scale fsi issues such as the on deck wave slamming in addition it is known that fsi coupling problems can well be explained by the fluid added mass in relation to the object mass the ratio of which can determine whether a strong coupling is required or whether a weak coupling suffices by using the fft method table 9 gives the object mass maximum added mass and r added the ratio between maximum added mass and object mass from which it can be observed that the added mass effect is quite severe in all the three fsi coupling simulations in this paper this proves that the monolithically strong coupled coupling method applied in this study is necessary and is able to give good results in evaluating the added mass effects the main innovation of the paper is the development of concurrent multi process refinement method which is based on a simple based monolithic implicit method used for strong coupling fsi simulations the novelty of concurrent multi process refinement method lies in that it provides a solution of balancing the accuracy and efficiency in monolithic fsi methods especially in dealing with multi scale fsi problems and high frequency structural vibrations in addition concurrent multi process refinement method shows its great advantages in cfd fsi simulations using low cost computational facilities making it possible for researchers to conduct time costing monolithic fsi simulations using ordinary personal computers further study might be focused on the development of concurrent multi process refinement method using adaptive meshing and time step and the potential of parallel computation in multi cpus

sloshing dam breaking impact wave slamming 1 introduction numerical simulation of fluid structure interaction fsi has quite a range of applications in scientific and engineering fields e g aeroelastic problems farhat et al 2006 yao and marques 2017 ilie 2018 etc hydroelastic problems de rosis et al 2014 sun et al 2015 hu et al 2016 etc and hemodynamic problems torii et al 2009 kamensky et al 2015 chen and luo 2018 etc with the development of computational facilities and multi physics theories numerical simulations of fsi problems are widely conducted in different scientific and engineering fields nowadays which save a large amount of physical experiment costs and bring in much convenience to researchers as such different numerical methods have been developed to model various coupled fsi phenomena when fsi effects are non negligible from the perspective of discrete strategy fsi methods can be categorized into mesh based methods and meshless method on one aspect mesh based methods are widely used as the numerical approaches in dealing with fsi problems in which the computational domain is discretized by a set of grids or meshes and the governing equations are solved by numerical schemes such as the finite volume method fvm finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem firstly it is called a fully eulerian method if the meshes are fixed in space in which additional techniques should be used to capture the free surface such as volume of fluid vof and level set ls wick 2013 richter 2013 cottet and maitre 2016 hu et al 2016 etc generally speaking fully eulerian method using interface capturing methods such as vof is accurate and suitable for complex geometry deformation such as violent free surface evolutions however it requires solution of additional equations to capture the free surface interface and thus increases the numerical complexity secondly it is called an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method if moving meshes are used to track the changing free surface in which the meshes move independently to track the free surface interface deformation farhat and lakshminarayan 2014 wu and cai 2014 basting et al 2017 calandrini and aulisa 2019 etc space time method is another kind of moving mesh strategy to track free surface in which the time variable is treated as an additional spatial coordinate to solve the governing equations over a generalized space time domain takizawa and tezduyar 2011 bazilevs et al 2013 etc the interface tracking methods such as ale and space time show advantage in the accuracy of capturing moving fluid structure interface while they suffer mesh distortion when the free surface changes dramatically thirdly boundary element method bem is the other kind of mesh based method to simulate fsi problems except that the computation domain is only meshed at the free surface and fluid structure interface zhang et al 2013 rodríguez tembleque et al 2015 ravnik et al 2016 heltai et al 2017 etc however bem is usually limited to relatively simple geometries and physics which makes it hard to handle strong nonlinear phenomena such as wave breaking and slamming moreover meshless methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method and moving particle semi implicit mps method have found their way in recent years in dealing with fsi problems involving complex and nonlinear free surface evolutions since the fluid and structure particles follow exactly the motion within a fully lagrangian frame and thus meshless methods are also called the particle methods sph method works by dividing the fluid and structure into a set of discrete moving particles that follow the n s equations and handling particle particle interaction through a kernel function yang 2011 liu et al 2013 hu et al 2014 li et al 2015 fourey et al 2017 etc mps method is similar to the sph method yet it applies simplified differential operator models solely based on a local weighted averaging process without taking the gradient of a kernel function mitsume et al 2014 hwang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 hwang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2018 etc meshless methods such as the sph and mps have advantages in describing violent free surface evolutions and avoiding distortion of meshes however meshless methods usually have difficulty in setting boundary conditions and suffer computational inefficiency compared to mesh based methods from the perspective of coupling strategy fsi methods can be categorized into partitioned fsi methods and monolithic fsi methods partitioned fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains in partitioned solvers and interactively link them with appropriate coupling approaches farhat and lesoinne 2000 matthies and steindorf 2003 küttler and wall 2008 liu et al 2014 etc partitioned fsi methods are popular among researchers due to the reason that they take the best advantages of existing fluid solvers fluent and star ccm for example and structure solvers ansys and abaqus for example besides partitioned fsi methods are relatively simple in theory and easy for programming and they perform well for weak coupled fsi problems however partitioned fsi methods might suffer from the problem of computational instability and inaccuracy for strong coupled fsi problems monolithic fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains simultaneously in a fully coupled way in which the fluid and structure domains are combined to form a monolithic relation through fluid structure interface boundary conditions le tallec and mouro 2001 hübner et al 2004 heil et al 2008 hu et al 2016 etc using monolithic fsi equations monolithic fsi methods have shown advantages in computational stability efficiency as well as the accuracy for strong coupled fsi problems although monolithic fsi methods are favorable for the stability and efficiency of calculation they lose the advantage of efficiency under certain conditions since the complete system of nonlinear algebraic equations that formed from the coupled governing equations of the fluid and structure domains are solved as a whole monolithic fsi methods are usually believed to be too computational expensive for use in large scale or multi scale problems förster et al 2007 heil et al 2008 in other words when the simulation domain fluid domain mainly is large monolithic methods have to solve the coupled equations in the whole domain at every single time step additionally it is well acknowledged that usually calculation of the structure domain requires a much smaller time step compared to the fluid domain so that the high frequency structural vibration of metal structures can be captured precisely using a high sampling frequency however the time step for the fluid and structure domains applied in monolithic fsi methods are usually the same increasing the simulation cost enormously moreover although many researchers have contributed a great deal in the cost saving of the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations using refinement methods löhner 2001 plewa et al 2005 ahmed and john 2015 fenández tena et al 2017 etc and parallel computing methods gropp et al 2001 amritkar et al 2014 crespo et al 2015 afzal et al 2017 etc methods on improving efficiency of monolithic fsi methods are still in need of investigation especially using low cost computational facilities the origin of coupling problems can well be explained by the fluid added mass the significance of which determines whether a strong coupling is required or whether a weak coupling suffices to solve significant added mass issues hu et al 2016 presented a simple based implicit method sbmim for the strong coupling of fsi which was validated and proved to be stable and robust under extreme simulation circumstances however several problems were found on the computational efficiency when the simulation is conducted in multi scale and when the vibration frequency of the structure is high based on sbmim a concurrent multi process refinement method is developed to solve the computational efficiency problems in this study for multi scale problems the structure mainly interacts with the fluid nearby and the far away fluid adds little to the interaction therefore concurrent multi process refinement method split the fluid in two parts the nearby fluid and the far away fluid the nearby fluid is solved simultaneously with the structure forming the local process the far away fluid is solved using a weak coupling with the nearby fluid forming the main process in this way simulations of the nearby fluid and the far away fluid can be conducted concurrently in multi processes localizing the fsi simulation area moreover different grid sizes and time steps can be applied in multi processes overcoming the difficulty of using monolithic fsi method when very small time step is required by high frequency structural vibrations of metal structures through file mappings on the computer s memory data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between multi processes on the fluid entry boundary using dummy grid with proper interpolations and time advance strategy in order to show the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method two refinement studies are carried out namely a liquid sloshing case and a dam breaking impact case simulations of the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank are conducted to give an error estimation regarding grid sizes and time steps using a gci method simulations of the dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall is conducted to verify the accuracy of present methods and to discuss the selection of localized fsi simulation area simulations of the green water impact a deck house caused by freak wave are conducted to show the performance of the method in balancing accuracy and efficiency when dealing with practical multi scale ocean engineering problems with high frequency structural vibrations through the three validation and application cases it is seen that concurrent multi process refinement method shows advantages in multi scale fsi simulations using monolithic fsi methods and in prediction of high frequency structural vibrations through the calculations of the added mass in the dam breaking case and the green water impact case it is also seen that the method is quite stable and robust for strong coupled fsi issues in which the added mass is significant by applying concurrent multi process refinement method the efficiency and accuracy of fsi simulations are balanced and improved especially for fsi simulations using low cost computational facilities like ordinary personal computers pure cfd simulations which solves the n s equations and fsi simulations which solves the strong coupled fsi equation are divided in multi processes different grid sizes and time steps can be applied in multi processes concurrently to meet the accuracy requirement of strong coupled fsi area and the efficiency requirement of the others more importantly the very small time step required by the high frequency structural vibrations can be avoided in the pure cfd processes where fsi plays a negligible role however it needs to mention that since the basic idea of concurrent multi process refinement method lies in the splitting of the fluid domain the area selection of local process should be careful so that the origin of strong coupling e g the added mass would not be under estimated 2 fluid structure interaction method 2 1 governing equations the fluid refers to liquid which is assumed to be viscous newtonian and incompressible by applying the vof youngs method youngs 1982 to reconstruct the free surface governing equations of the fluid include the continuity equation the momentum conservation equation and the fluid volume transportation equation written as follows 2 1 θ u 0 2 2 u t u u σ f ρ f f f 2 3 θ f f t θ u f f 0 where u ρ f f f and σ f are the velocity density body force and cauchy stress tensor of the fluid f f denotes the transportation volume of the fluid while the ratio of the volume occupied of fluid is described by θ which equals 1 where fluid can flow across the mesh boundary freely and 0 where the mesh boundary is solid lin 2007 governing equation of the structure is given by the structure momentum equation 2 4 ρ s w σ s f s where w ρ s f s and σ s are the displacement density body force and first piola kirchhoff stress tensor of the structure on the fluid structure interface velocity and traction force of the fluid domain must agree with the structure domain 2 5 u w 2 6 σ f n f σ s n s where n f and n s are the unit outward normal vector of the fluid boundary and the unit outward normal vector of the structure boundary 2 2 fluid structure coupling a self developed solver is utilized for fsi simulations which solves the incompressible navier stokes n s equations under two dimensional flow conditions in cfd simulations and solves the monolithic fsi equation in fsi simulations finite element method fem is used to discretize two dimensional euler beams simplified from structures that meet the cylindrical bending assumption timoshenko and woinowsky krieger 1959 the structure here is assumed to be under small displacement and within the elastic range the structural dynamic equation can be written as 2 7 m w c w k w f where m is the global matrix of mass c is the global matrix of damping k is the global matrix of stiffness f is the nodal force vector implicit houbolt scheme houbolt 1950 which has been proved unconditionally stable newmark 1959 johnson 1966 nickel 1971 is used to calculate the structural velocity and acceleration at time t δ t with time step δ t and thus eq 2 7 is rewritten as 2 8 2 m δ t 2 11 c 6 δ t k w t δ t f t δ t 5 m δ t 2 3 c δ t w t 4 m δ t 2 3 c 2 δ t w t δ t m δ t 2 c 3 δ t w t 2 δ t from eqs 2 5 and 2 6 the relation between fluid velocity u c o u p l e t δ t on the fluid structure interface and structure displacement w and the relation between the structure nodal force f t δ t and fluid pressure p c o u p l e t δ t on fluid structure interface are given as 2 9 u c o u

on fluid structure interface only the pressure related force is considered viscous effect is neglected at fluid structure interface since it plays an unimportant role in the simulation cases that this fsi method is designed for simple method patankar and spalding 1972 is used to solve the fluid governing equations finite difference method fdm is used to discretize the fluids while a fixed staggered grid eulerian grid system is used within which the pressure is defined at the grid center and the velocity is defined at the grid boundaries center central difference scheme cds is used for the pressure gradients and diffusion terms and the combination of the central difference and upwind difference scheme uds is used for advection terms using a two step projection method on eq 2 2 tentative velocity is expressed as 2 11 u t δ t u t δ t f f t δ t ν 2 u t u t u t where ν is the kinematic viscosity u t δ t is the tentative velocity at time t δ t u t is the true velocity at time t the tentative velocity is further updated as the true velocity with the use of correct fluid pressure at time t δ t using relation as 2 12 u t δ t u t δ t δ t p t δ t ρ f where p t δ t is the fluid pressure at time t δ t obtained by solving pressure poisson equation as 2 13 2 θ p t δ t ρ f θ u t δ t δ t here fluid pressure p t δ t in eq 2 13 can be solved using a successive over relaxation sor method for the fluid grids with fluid structure interfaces on their boundaries the interfaces can be treated as mobile solid boundaries hu et al 2016 therefore the simple based pressure poisson equation can be modified by replacing the tentative velocity in eq 2 13 with the mobile solid boundary velocity 2 14 p c o u p l e t δ t b c o u p l e u c o u p l e t δ t where b c o u p l e is the conversion matrix function formed in coupling calculation through simultaneous equations of eq 2 9 eq 2 10 and eq 2 11 structure nodal force is obtained as 2 15 f t δ t a c o u p l e 2 b c o u p l e a c o u p l e 1 w t δ t combining eq 2 15 with eq 2 8 the coupled structural dynamic equation is written as 2 16 2 m δ t 2 11 c 6 δ t k w t δ t a c o u p l e 2 b c o u p l e a c o u p l e 1 w t δ t 5 m δ t 2 3 c δ t w t 4 m δ t 2 3 c 2 δ t w t δ t m δ t 2 c 3 δ t w t 2 δ t here the relation between w and w are given as w t δ t 11 w t δ t 18 w t 9 w t δ t 2 w t 2 δ t 6 δ t following the houbolt scheme eq 2 16 is a monolithic fsi equation solved in an implicit way within a single iteration step δ t the fluid and structure domains are solved simultaneously more detailed derivations deductions validations and convergence tests of the monolithic fsi equation can be found in hu et al 2016 fig 1 gives the flow chart of the monolithic fsi method explained as the following 1 module set initial condition creates meshing of the fluids and structures and sets the initial simulation parameters 2 at each time step of the fsi simulation tentative velocity of the fluid is obtained in module calculate temp velocity using a two step projection following the simple method 3 matrices assembling and coupled fsi equation solving of eq 2 16 using the houbolt scheme are conducted in module solve coupled fsi equation 4 after solving the coupled fsi equation the structural response is calculated while the fluid velocity at fluid structure interface is obtained through eq 2 9 in module get structure response 5 then in module correct fluid pressure the fluid pressure is corrected through sor iteration of eq 2 14 using the obtained velocity at fluid structure interface until convergence note that criterion max i j p i j m 1 p i j m 0 001 ρ f is applied in this fsi method where p i j m 1 and p i j m denote the pressures of the m 1 th and mth iterations 6 after the fluid pressure converges real velocity of the fluid is updated using the corrected fluid pressure in module update fluid velocity while the fluid free surface is reconstructed using the vof method 7 updating the time to the next step the procedure goes back to module calculate temp velocity again and the simulation time proceeds to the next step 3 concurrent multi process refinement method 3 1 descriptions in section 2 the monolithic fsi method is briefly introduced which is capable of solving various strong coupled fsi problems however when encountered with realistic fsi simulation requirements such as simulations in multi scale and with high frequency structural vibrations the fsi method is faced with several problems on the efficiency and accuracy of computations listed as follows firstly for the fsi simulation using a monolithic fsi equation solution of the fluid domain is connected with the structure domain inseparably which means that the simulation is conducted solving the monolithic fsi equation in the whole computational domain undoubtedly this would lead to extra computational costs by changing the n s equations into the coupled fsi equations since the conversion matrices formed in the monolithic fsi equation eq 2 16 could be difficult and inefficient to solve secondly complex structures usually complicate the boundary of the fluid domain around where grids must be refined to achieve computational accuracy traditional refinement method solves the large scale matrix assembled by the governing equations in all the coarse and fine grids of the fluid domain within a single time step however it is know that solving a large scale matrix is rather inefficient compared to solving several small scale matrices especially with ordinary computational facilities like personal computers thirdly maximum time step in the fluid domain is usually defined according to the courant number c max u i j δ t δ x where u i j is the fluid velocity in every grids and δ t and δ x are the corresponding time step and grid length john and anderson 1995 godderidge et al 2006 therefore it is seen that finer grids require smaller time step and coarser grids fit for larger time step however existing monolithic fsi methods assign the same time step fixed or adaptive to all the grids in the fluid domain regardless of the fact that only local refined grids need smaller time step which increases the computational cost enormously lastly for fsi problems with relatively large rigidity structures such as metal structures time step in the structure domain would be significantly reduced compared to the time step in the fluid domain so that the high frequency structural vibrations could be captured accurately using high sampling frequencies the ratio of time step between the fluid and structure domains might be up to 20 times or larger however for monolithic fsi equations like eq 2 16 it is impossible to separate the time step between the fluid and structure domains in this section a concurrent multi process refinement method is developed which is capable of solving the monolithic fsi problems described above being different from traditional refinement method concurrent multi process refinement method divides the computational domain into several subdomains in different processes shown in fig 2 multi processes exist at the same time and are computed concurrently with corresponding multi grid sizes and multi time steps where data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between two processes through fluid entry boundaries and dummy grids by applying the method efficiency and accuracy of monolithic fsi simulations are balanced in four aspects firstly the monolithic fsi equation is solved within the fsi process while the n s equations are solved in other processes where fsi is not included secondly the fluid domain is divided into several subdomains and simulated in multi processes with different grid sizes concurrently which decomposes the total matrix into several smaller matrices in a single time step compared with the traditional refinement method thirdly larger and smaller time steps are applied in different simulation processes which guarantees the simulation efficiency in coarser grids and the simulation accuracy in finer grids simultaneously lastly the high sampling frequency thus small time step requirement in the structure domain caused by the high frequency structural vibrations is avoided in the fluid domain that is far from the fsi area and have little influence on the fsi coupling 3 2 numerical implementation in order to explain the numerical implementation of concurrent multi process refinement method developed in this paper a specific illustration of wave structure interaction is given in fig 3 the interaction problem is divided into two processes where generation and propagation of the wave are simulated in main process with a larger grid size and time step and the interaction between wave and structure are simulated in local process with a smaller grid size and time step in concurrent multi process refinement method the data between main process and local process are linked and transmitted through the fluid entry boundary which is similar to the wave making boundary velocity inlet in numerical implementation of wave generation shown in fig 3 as the red solid lines dummy grids are introduced in main process shown as the yellow colored grids in fig 3 as its literal meaning dummy grids are virtual grids acting as virtual boundary of the fluid domain in main process fluid entry boundary and dummy grids are the bridge of data transmissions through which relations of variables of fluid velocity components and pressure between main process and local process are built bi directionally in particular dummy grids act as the boundary condition for main process while the column grids on fluid entry boundary within dummy grids act as the boundary condition for local process the data transmissions of variables between main process and local process are illustrated in fig 4 in main process assuming the fluid velocity on the right left top and bottom boundary

local process are calculated using the new boundary condition of the column grids on fluid entry boundary within dummy grids the descriptions above explains the data transmission between multi processes in one time step note that one time step here denotes the last time step in local process when data are transmitted from local process to main process or the last time step in main process when data are transmitted from main process to local process to better explain the time advance strategy fig 5 gives the sketch of the time relation between main process mp and local process lp temporally firstly assuming the computational domain at t t 1 is already known while the selected time steps for main process and local process are δ t m p and δ t l p respectively also assuming the relation of δ t m p n δ t l p exist where n is the ratio between time steps through fluid entry boundary and dummy grids data from main process at t t 1 are transmitted to local process and the boundary condition of local process is updated secondly simulations from t t 1 to t t 1 n δ t l p are carried out in local process after which data from local process at t t 1 n δ t l p are transmitted to main process and the boundary condition of main process is updated note that relation t t 1 n δ t l p t 1 δ t m p exist thirdly the simulation at t t 1 δ t m p is conducted which means that the simulation of main process proceeds to the next time step this time advance relation starts and ends at the certain time when the multi process refinement is applied and canceled note that the data exchange between main process and local process at fluid entry boundary and dummy grids which are within the pure fluid domain rather than at the fluid structure interface moreover the resolution of the fluid and structure parts are still solved as one entity in local process therefore concurrent multi process refinement method do not change the fact that the fsi method is a monolithic method rather than a partitioned method the latter of which solve the fluid and structure parts in different entities using staggered approach or non staggered sub iteration synchronization techniques felippa et al 2001 3 3 algorithm procedure the fsi method in section 2 and concurrent multi process refinement method is compiled using visual basic language and operated in a computational station which consists of an 8 core 3 60 ghz cpu and a 12 0 gb ram data transmission of concurrent multi process refinement method is based on the file mapping approach provided by visual basic which creates mapping relations from disk files to computer memory using this approach the link between different processes can be built by transmitting data through visiting memory rather than disk files leading to an increase of the data access speed among processes when concurrent multi process refinement method operates it first creates the file mapping of each process and then built the links of data transmission between processes by directly visiting memory the received data in each process update the boundary conditions for simulations while the data obtained through simulations are further saved in memory for the next data transmission fig 6 gives the flow chart of concurrent multi process refinement method applied in the monolithic fsi method sbmim from which the programming procedure of the algorithm is illustrated as can be seen procedure concurrent multi process refinement method is composed of the following steps 1 9 note that fig 6 and steps 1 9 takes a two process simulation as example however concurrent multi process refinement method is able to operate with more than two processes 1 the cfd fsi simulation in one process continues until simulation time reaches time t when concurrent multi process simulations are set to begin 2 at time t multi process simulations begin with set initial memory file mapping module which initializes the names and parameters of file mappings and disk files for the variables and mesh grids in different processes 3 create memory file mapping for processes module creates the file mappings between disk files and the computer memory for processes that need to be linked for data transmissions in this module different mapping addresses between each two multi processes are created and assigned in memory respectively where data between two multi processes can be visited and transmitted 4 when file mappings of the multi processes are built the cfd fsi simulation can be carried out in multi processes using the method in section 2 taking a two process division as example the simulation is divided into one main process mp with time step δ t m p and one local process lp with time step δ t l p note that δ t m p δ t l p 5 assuming the simulation at time t in main process has already been finished data for transmission at this time are obtained from the simulation results of main process in get mp data at t module and sent to the computer memory in send mp data module through the file mapping created before 6 local process accesses the data from main process in receive mp data module by visiting the memory and is solved with time step δ t l p the simulation of local process is conducted until the simulation time reaches t δ t m p when the simulation of main process should be continued to update the boundary conditions for local process 7 data of variables of local process at t δ t m p are obtained in get lp data at t δ t m p module and sent to main process in send lp data module through file mapping 8 received by main process in receive lp data module data from local process updates the boundary conditions for main process then the simulation of main process is conducted with time step δ t m p until the simulation time reaches t 2 δ t m p 9 looping the steps from 5 8 until the simulation time reaches the total simulation time t m u l t i o v e r set for multi process simulations the multi process simulation is over and the cfd fsi in one process continues from time t m u l t i o v e r 3 4 advantages and limitations advantages of concurrent multi process refinement method are analyzed first as we know fsi methods can be divided into two categories considering the coupling manners which are the partitioned fsi methods and monolithic fsi methods partitioned fsi methods solve the fluid and structure domains respectively and iteratively in each time step the fluid solver predicts the position velocity and pressure of all grids or particles on the fluid structure interface within the fluid domain then the fluid force is acted on the structure domain to calculate the deformation and velocity of the structure while the updated variables of the deformable structure is applied back to the fluid domain to correct the fluid velocity and pressure until convergence as a result the total iteration number would be the iteration number of fluid denoted as m 1 multiply the iteration number of structure denoted as n 1 that is m 1 n 1 on another aspect monolithic fsi methods such as sbmim establish a monolithic fsi equation using the continuity relation between the fluid and structure domains in each time step variables of the fluid and structure domains such as the velocity and pressure of fluid grids and deformation and velocity of structure elements are solved using the monolithic fsi equation at the same time as a result the total iteration number would be the iteration number of solving the monolithic fsi equation since sbmim constructs the monolithic fsi equation through the pressure poisson equation of the fluid using mobile solid boundaries hu et al 2016 the total iteration number would be the iteration number of the fluid denoted as m 2 usually a relation of m 2 m 1 n 1 is expected since m 1 and m 2 are close in value and thus the monolithic fsi method in this paper is relatively computational inexpensive compared to the partitioned fsi methods the monolithic fsi equation usually complicates the governing equations making it more difficult to get the solution compared with pure cfd simulations in addition the monolithic fsi equation requires a unified time step for both the fluid and structure domains although the time step of the fluid domain according to the courant number criterion can be much larger than the time step of the structure domain when a high sampling frequency is requirement for high frequency structural vibrations to deal with these two problems concurrent multi process refinement method divides the large scale computational domain into processes of fsi simulations and pure cfd simulations the dimension of the monolithic fsi equation is reduced by localizing the fsi area while the unnecessary unified time step is avoided by different time steps to solve the monolithic fsi equation traditional refinement shown in fig 2 a requires a simulation time of t 2 m 2 where t 2 is the time step number and m 2 is the iteration number in one time step multi process refinement shown in fig 2 b requires a simulation time of t 2 r ml m m t 2 m l where m m and m l are the iteration number of main process and local process in one time step and r ml is the ratio of time step of main process against time step of local process since m 2 m m m l is expected due to the larger application area of the monolithic fsi equation using traditional refinement it is easy to found that t 2 m 2 t 2 r ml m m t 2 m l indicating that concurrent multi process refinement method can further lower the computation cost in monolithic fsi methods compared to the traditional refinement method there are also some limitations of concurrent multi process refinement method for simulations containing fsi and elastic responses of structures when the computation domain is divided into main process and local process the monolithic fsi equation is only solved in local process while pure cfd simulation is conducted in main process as a result fsi effects mainly the added mass effects are actually not included in main process narrowing the area actually influenced by fsi therefore it should be noted that the area selection of local process should be careful so that the fsi effects would not be under estimated for simulations containing fsi and elastic responses of structures it is recommended that a refinement study on area selection should be carried out first to determine the local process area near the elastic structures and the main process area far from the elastic structures in this paper a detailed refinement study on local process selection can be found in section 4 2 in which an error estimation is carried out also compared with massive parallel fsi simulations using super computers concurrent multi process refinement method might lose its advantage in efficiency since this method is designed for low cost computational facilities like ordinary personal computers 4 refinement study in this section two cases of refinement study are introduced using concurrent multi process refinement method applied in the monolithic fsi method including the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank and the dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall the liquid sloshing case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in cfd simulation with nonlinear free surface evolutions and gives an error estimation on different refinements including coarse medium fine and multi process grids the dam breaking case compares the results by present methods and by previous literatures and gives an error estimation on refinements with different local process areas 4 1 liquid sloshing in a baffled tank the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank is one typical cfd case which has been widely investigated and considered suitable for the refinement study the top panel of fig 7 gives the illustration of the liquid sloshing in a tank with a baffle which is designed similar to the one in jung et al 2012 the tank is 0 8 m in length and 0 5 m in height while the liquid which is water in the tank is 0 35 m in depth a fixed rigid 0 28 m long baffle is clamped at the middle of the tank bottom three pressure gauges are installed at the left p1 right p2 wall of the tank and left top p3 of the baffle to monitor fluid pressures the tank is under pure surge motion defined by the sinusoidal function of 4 1 x s a s sin ω t where x s is the surge motion transversally a s and ω are the amplitude and frequency of the surge motion which are fixed as a s 0 02 m and ω 5 82 r a d s respectively physical properties within the fluid domain are chosen as fluid density 1000 kg m3 fluid kinematical viscosity 0 000001145 m2 s air pressure 101263 4pa acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 following the courant number criterion three groups of grid sizes and time steps are adopted to give a grid independence test which are the coarse medium and fine grids shown in table 1 in addition a multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method is applied to compare with the coarse medium and fine grids in which the three processes are named as main process local process a and local process b shown in the bottom panel of fig 7 the total simulation time for the coarse medium fine and multi process grids are 6s including five whole sloshing periods firstly a grid independence test on the liquid sloshing are conducted with the coarse medium and fine grids which cost 1 h 7 h and 66 h of computation respectively the time histories at pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 are shown in fig 8 a fig 8 b and fig 8 c indicating that a rather satisfactory agreement among the three simulation cases however using the relative standard error rse deviations of the pressure results with coarse and medium grids are obtained based on the pressure results with the fine grid given in fig 8 d it is seen that the rses of the coarse grid are 12 3 11 7 and 9 3 at p1 p2 and p3 while the rses of the medium gird are 6 8 7 8 and 4 8 at p1 p2 and p3 by halving the grid size and time step from coarse to medium grid the relative standard error is reduced by more than 42 averagely but the computational cost is increased by about seven times it was stated that a recommended method for grid refinement study and error estimation is called the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 which was based on the richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 gci is a measure of the percentage of how far the computed value is away from the asymptotic numerical value and has been evaluated over several hundred cases procedures and formulas of the gci method can be found in many previous papers roache 2003 celik et al 2008 park et al 2015 etc and thus they are not listed here table 2 shows the mean values of the key variable which is pressure obtained from the fine grid subscript 1 medium grid subscript 2 and coarse grid subscript 3 solutions and the results of corresponding gcis note that gci21 means the gci of medium grid against fine grid while gci32 means the gci of coarse grid against medium grid it is seen that there is a reduction in gcis with successive grid refinement indicating the solution is reaching towards a grid independent result in addition gci32 at pressure monitor p3 is much larger than the ones at p1 and p2 which means that medium grid performs well at p1 and p2 but leads to a relatively larger error at p3 thus to obtain a convinced pressure value at p3 a fine grid might be necessary after conducting the grid independence test the simulation of liquid sloshing using concurrent multi process refinement method is carried out fig 9 illustrates the snapshots of the liquid sloshing in the last surge period of the tank using multi process grid in which the grid size reduces from the bottom to the free surface of the tank in three divided linked processes it is seen that within the area in local process b the fine grid shows good performance in vortex and free surface evolutions the vortexes induced by the baffle are still clear in direction and size although the baffle is relatively long besides new small vortexes along with the rolling and breaking of the free surface can be captured which are not shown in jung et al 2012 in fact the vortex and free surface evolutions in jung et al 2012 were relatively coarse and simple due to the reason of using a relatively coarse grid compared to the multi process grid in this paper which still showed good agreement with the experimental measurement and existing numerical results however the vortex in the finer grid and the violent rolling and breaking of the free surface surely have an important influence on the loads acting on the wall and baffle of the tank for instance the comparison of pressures in fig 8 shows that the finer grid is not only more precise according to the rse and gci but also on the depth of the amplitude peak and trough in one period of sloshing which are induced by the vortex and free surface elevations the pressure time histories of the multi process grid at pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 and the rses of the multi process grid against the fine grid are given in fig 10 by comparing the pressure histories from the multi process grid in fig 10 a and the fine grid in fig 8 it is seen that the multi process grid shows good agreements with the fine grid on pressures the rses of the multi process grid against the fine grid at p1 p2 and p3 are merely 0 2 0 2 and 0 4 respectively indicating that the relative standard error between multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method and the fine grid in the whole simulation area is small enough to be neglected in the meanwhile among the fine grid subscript 1 multi process grid subscript 2 and medium grid subscript 3 gcis are calculated in table 3 from which it is seen that gcis of multi process grid against fine grid are all smaller than 0 5 therefore from view of both the vortex and free surface evolutions and the pressure time histories concurrent multi process refinement method performs satisfactorily as a refinement method additionally shown in table 1 applying the multi process grid reduced the computational cost by more than half compared to the fine grid which proves that concurrent multi process refinement method balanced the accuracy and efficiency at the same time it should be clarified that when studying the sloshing loads on the side walls of the liquid tank and the sloshing loads on the vertical baffle are not focused a medium grid is enough for the accuracy of simulation however when attention is paid on the sloshing loads on the vertical baffle especially the loads near the upper end of the baffle a fine grid or multi process grid using concurrent multi process refinement method should be applied 4 2 dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall the dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall is widely used to validate fsi methods since the violent free surface movement and strong impact are involved the case is designed similar to the ones by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 who used different mps fem methods a 0 1 m 0 2 m water dam breaks and slams an elastic vertical wall 0 352 m away from it the 0 352 m high vertical wall is fixed at the lower end and free at the upper end a pressure gauge pg is placed on the wall 0 02 m from its lower end physical properties are chosen as fluid density 1000 kg m3 fluid kinematical viscosity 0 000001145 m2 s air pressure 101263 4pa acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 elastic modulus of wall 0 2 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 wall density 7860 kg m3 wall thickness 0 006 m in the fluid domain three groups of grid sizes are applied which are the coarse fine and multi process grids shown in table 4 while in the structure domain the elastic vertical wall is discretized into 61 elements note that the fine grid case gives a fluid grid number of 1250 which is the same with the number of fluid particles used by sun et al 2015 the whole simulation time is 10s and time step is chosen as 0 0001s small enough to capture the high frequency vibration of the elastic vertical wall and to guarantee the maximum courant number 1 for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 from the computation cost of the coarse fine and multi process grids in table 4 it is seen that the fine grid case takes about 0 83 h of computational cost which is over 3 times of the computational cost of the coarse grid case due to the smaller time step and larger number of grids compared to the cpu time of the simulation by sun et al 2015 which was 1 h the computational cost of the fine grid case in this paper is smaller since a monolithic fsi method is used in present study while sun et al 2015 applied a partitioned mps fem method as explained in section 3 4 the partitioned method is usually more computational expensive since iterations exist in both the fluid and structure domains by using concurrent multi process refinement method the simulation time is further reduced from 0 83 h to about 0 52 h indicating that concurrent multi process refinement method is able to further improve the efficiency of fsi simulation by localizing the fsi area and applying different time steps in multi processes fig 11 illustrates the snapshots of the dam breaking flow slamming event from which it is seen that the computational domain is divided into main process and local process using concurrent multi process refinement method the area near the vertical wall is refined in local process to guarantee the accuracy of the fsi simulation while the area far from the vertical wall is with a coarse grid system to accelerate the computation as expected local process gives good performance in the fsi area near the vertical wall such as the water impinging climbing rolling breaking and falling while main process controls the flow behavior that is relatively far from the vertical wall without considering fsi fig 12 gives the comparison of displacements at the wall free end and pressures at pg among the coarse fine and multi process grids showing that the coarse grid relatively produces larger errors both in displacement and pressure while the results of the fine grid and multi process grid are almost identical in order to validate the numerical methods displacement at the free end and pressure at pg of present results are compared with the numerical results by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 it is seen from fig 13 a that the displacement of present results agrees well with the one by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 although there are some acceptable discrepancies from fig 13 b it is observed that there is satisfactory agreement of the fluid pressures at pg between present result and the result by sun et al 2015 however the pressure was not given by zhang and wan 2018 therefore from both the displacement of the vertical wall and the fluid pressure on the wall the present fsi method and concurrent multi process refinement method are capable of producing good results compared with the previous literatures additionally by using concurrent multi process refinement method the computational cost can be further reduced than the original monolithic fsi method fig 14 depicts the residual error and iteration number of local process of the multi process simulation case in table 4 it is seen that at about 0 2 0 25s when initial slamming happens the residual error and iteration number are both relatively larger than average however the residual error decreases quickly with the iteration number showing a concave decreasing function during one time step as can be seen from the logarithmic coordinate of fig 14 a in the meanwhile the iteration number decreases quickly with the simulation time and is stabilized between 1 and 5 after initial slamming as shown in fig 14 b therefore it is proven that the present fsi method sbmim and concurrent multi process refinement method give good performance on convergence since one nature and purpose of concurrent multi process refinement method is to reduce the area of localized monolithic fsi coupling in multi scale problems a proper choice of local process area becomes a key issue in order to choose proper local process area refinement study on the effect of local process area is carried out based on the multi process refinement in table 4 three groups of local process selections are applied named as local process a local process b and local process c here main process and local process a are designed exactly the same with main process and local process in table 4 while local process b halves local process a and local process c further halves local process b in the horizontal direction as shown in fig 15 particularly area lengths in the horizontal direction of local process a local process b and local process c are 0 12 m 0 06 m and 0 03 m respectively grid sizes and time steps of the three local processes are selected the same with the ones of local process in table 4 which are 0 004 m and 0 0004s all the other physical properties stay the same with the previous choices displacements at the wall free end and pressures at pg obtained in local process a local process b and local process c are shown in fig 16 on one aspect it is observed that in the 1st half period of structural vibration local process c gives smaller vibration period thus higher frequency than local process a and local process b the reason lies in that local process c might be too small for the localized fsi simulation to accurately highlight the added mass induced by the strong coupling between the fluid and structure on the other aspect the vibration periods obtained in local process a and local process b are quite close indicating that local process b might be enough for the accurate calculation of the added mass in the localized fsi simulation using the gci method the structural vibration frequency and maximum pressure at pg are deemed as the key variables both from the structure and fluid points of view it should be mentioned that the structural vibration frequency here is limited within the 1st half period of the structural vibration as the strong fsi process has already finished after water falling and free vibration dominates after the 1st half period depicted in fig 11 table 5 gives gcis among local process a subscript 1 local process b subscript 2 and local process c subscript 3 the result shows that the convergence conditions of both key variables are monotonic as there are reductions in the gcis of both key variables with successive grid refinement gci21 gci32 which indicates that the dependency of the simulation results on the grid size has been reduced and the solution is reaching towards the grid independent solution it is also shown that gci21 calculated between local process a and local process b is rather small in view of both key variables in the meanwhile gci32 calculated between local process b and local process c is relatively larger as such gcis among different local processes prove the conclusion that local process b might be enough for the localized fsi simulation but local process c might be too limited for the accurate calculation of the added mass in the strong coupling between the fluid and structure it is suggested by the authors that local process selection is suitable when gcis of key variables are smaller than 1 so that the strong coupling between the fluid and structure e g the added mass can be fully considered 5 application green water slamming induced by freak wave freak wave also called as rogue wave or monster wave is a kind of extreme wave that has led to many destructions and accidents in recent decades kjeldsen 1984 lavrenov 1998 dysthe et al 2008 etc when marine structures encounter with freak waves green water and overtopping events are the most commonly observed consequences which might cause severe impact on superstructures qin et al 2017a 2017b 2017c therefore it is necessary to study the green water impact issue caused by freak waves especially when hydroelastic effects cannot be neglected faltinsen et al 1997 however several problems are raised on the accuracy and efficiency balance of fsi simulation of this issue firstly the relatively long simulation time of wave generation and propagation doesn t cohere with the transient simulation time of fsi secondly the grid size of wave simulation which requires a relatively coarse grid to reduce computational cost doesn t cohere with the grid size of local fsi simulation which requires a fine grid to guarantee accuracy thirdly the small time step required by accurate calculation of high frequency structural vibration doesn t cohere with the relatively large time step required by wave simulation especially for monolithic fsi method lastly solving the monolithic fsi equation in the whole domain brings unnecessary difficulty and costs too much time in this section the green water impact on deck house structures caused by freak waves are simulated using concurrent multi process refinement method to conquer the problems listed before this case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in dealing with practical multi scale ocean engineering problems including localized fsi simulations with high frequency structural vibrations a numerical wave tank is built of 10 m in length 1 m in height and 0 7 m in water depth where three gauges are placed 3 m gauge 1 4 m gauge 2 and 5 m gauge 3 from the wave making boundary freak waves based on peregrine breather of nonlinear schrödinger equation is applied akhmediev et al 2009 chabchoub et al 2012 hu et al 2015 etc which is to reach the maximum crest at gauge 2 at 10s with carrier wave number k 2 223 rad m and amplitude a 0 1 m physical properties within the fluid domain are chosen as fluid density 1250 kg m3 fluid kinematical viscosity 0 000001145 m2 s air pressure 101263 4pa acceleration of gravity 9 81 m s2 before simulations of the interaction between freak wave and the platform a verification on freak wave generation is conducted with the grid size of 0 02 m and time step of 0 002s the numerical results of free surface elevations at gauge 1 gauge 2 and gauge 3 are compared with the theoretical results in fig 17 a showing satisfactory agreement the platform structure which is 1 m in length and 0 2 m in height is fixed 4 m from the wave making boundary and 0 08 m above the still water line on the platform a 0 2 m long clamped clamped vertical wall is placed at the middle representing the deck house wall which is treated as a 0 001 m thick elastic structure with elastic modulus 210 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 and material density 7860 kg m3 three pressure monitors p1 p2 and p3 are located at the bottom middle and top of the vertical wall the green water impact simulation is divided into three processes using concurrent multi process refinement method namely main process local process a and local process b grid sizes and time steps of which are given in table 6 the vertical deck house wall is discretized into 40 euler beam elements it should be noticed that the time step in local process b is 0 00005s which is 1 20 of the time step in local process a due to the reason that the coupled fsi equation of eq 2 16 is solved in local process b as mentioned before in order to capture the high frequency vibration of the elastic steel structures solution of the monolithic fsi equation requires a much smaller time step compared to the ones in main process and local process a the total simulation time of freak wave generation and propagation in main process is 20s while the simulation times in local process a and local process b are both 1s before the green water event occurs the crest shape of the freak wave at 9 40s is shown in fig 17 b indicating a nonlinear wave crest with a steep front and a gentle back from 9 92s to 10 78s in which period the green water event lasts the free surfaces and velocity vectors black arrows in main process local process a and local process b are illustrated in fig 18 it is seen that with the refinement of multi processes the large scale cfd wave simulation and the small scale fsi simulation are well combined using concurrent multi process refinement method nonlinear behaviors of fluid climbing rolling breaking and splashing are fully simulated in the small scale fsi simulation in local process b leading to more convincible loads on the elastic structure and thus a more reliable hydroelastic response moreover the small time step 0 00005s applied to solve the monolithic fsi equation is restricted within local process b which significantly reduces the computational cost by the comparison among one process two processes and three processes performance of concurrent multi process refinement method can be seen from a series of contrast simulation tests listed in table 7 it is seen that directly applying a fine grid in one main process to guarantee the accuracy of local fsi simulation is computational expensive with over 100 h of simulation by using a two process division computational cost can be reduced to 0 8 h of wave simulation and 2 3 h of fsi simulation and thus a total cost of 3 1 h however the computational cost of using two process division still overruns the cost of using three process division which is 1 8 h consisting of 0 8 h of wave simulation and 0 1 h of green water simulation and 0 9 h of fsi simulation therefore conclusion could be drawn that on condition of a reasonable division concurrent multi process refinement method improves the computational efficiency by applying more processes concurrently the pressure time histories at p1 p2 and p3 and displacements of node 11 node 21 and node 31 of the wall are given in fig 19 from which the hydroelastic effects can be clearly observed through the oscillations of the pressures and displacements as a result of fsi vibration frequency of the vertical wall would be changing overtime with the impact of on deck water by using a fast fourier transform fft the vibration frequency of displacements and oscillation frequency of pressures are obtained which vary from 37 hz to 133 hz corresponding to a vibration period from 0 0270s to 0 0075s from the lowest vibration and oscillation period the reason of using a much smaller time step in fsi simulations which is 0 00005s in local process b 1 20 of the time step in local process a can be reasonably explained as that only such small time step is able to capture the high frequency structural vibrations and pressure oscillations in other words the usage of a much smaller time step in fsi simulations is determined by the high sampling frequency requirement of solving the monolithic fsi equation however in the fluid domain that is far away from the fsi area the sampling frequency requirement of solving pure cfd is much smaller leading to the tolerance of using much larger time steps in main process and local process a according to the courant number criterion further considering the fsi problem of an elastic horizontal deck added at top of the deck house wall a four process division is utilized by concurrent multi process refinement method the 0 08 m long and 0 0015 m thick horizontal deck is fixed at the right end and free at the left end which is discretized into 32 euler beam elements three pressure monitors p4 p5 and p6 are located at the right end middle point and left end of the horizontal deck by further dividing local process b the simulation is composed of main process local process a local process b and local process c thus the fsi simulation solving the monolithic fsi equation is carried out in local process c grid sizes and time steps in main process local process a local process b and local process c are listed in table 8 snapshots of the events in local process a local process b and local process c are illustrated in fig 20 from which the impact phenomena including violent fluid rolling breaking falling and splashing can be observed the pressure time histories at p4 p5 and p6 and displacements of node 1 node 17 and node 33 of the deck are given in fig 21 by applying the fft on displacement time histories it is seen that the vibration frequency of the horizontal deck varies from 110 hz to 196 hz corresponding to vibration period from 0 0091s to 0 0051s from the lowest vibration period it is seen that the sampling frequency requirement of the horizontal deck becomes even higher than the one of vertical wall due to a larger structural rigidity therefore the simulation time step in solving the monolithic fsi equation should be further reduced which is 0 000025s in local process c 1 2 of the time step in local process b as a result the computational cost using a four process division is increased to 2 2 h consisting of 0 8 0 1 and 0 2 h of cfd simulations in main process local process a and local process b and 1 1 h of fsi simulation in local process c when dealing with multi scale fsi problems such as the freak wave propagates overtops in large scale and causes slamming in small scale the computational cost is usually high using the traditional monolithic fsi and refinement method by reasonable division of the fluid domain concurrent multi process refinement method is able to save computational cost through multi grid sizes and multi time steps to multi processes as such the scale differences between large scale problems such as the wave propagation and overtopping and small scale problems such as the green water impact are well handled leading to a well balanced monolithic fsi simulation in accuracy and efficiency however as mentioned in section 3 4 and section 4 2 the division of multi processes should be carefully chosen when dealing with multi scale fsi problems to avoid under estimation of fsi effects the added mass in particular 6 conclusions in this paper a concurrent multi process refinement method applied in two dimensional fluid structure interaction problems is developed which divides the fsi simulation into concurrent multi processes with different grid sizes and time steps as an important supplement of the simple based monolithic implicit method sbmim initially proposed by hu et al 2016 concurrent multi process refinement method solves the accuracy and efficiency problems encountered during the implementation of the monolithic fsi method in dealing with multi scale fsi problems and in predicting high frequency structural vibrations by using the file mapping provided in visual basic the split multi processes are linked in pairs in a pair of processes data of velocity and pressure variables are transmitted between main process and local process through fluid entry boundary and dummy grid with proper interpolations and time advance strategy the multi grid sizes in main process and local process localize the fsi area so that the monolithic fsi equation can be solved in a limited scale saving the computational cost induced by solution of the monolithic fsi equation the multi time steps in main process and local process balance the accuracy and efficiency temporally especially under condition that a high sampling frequency is required to capture the high frequency structural vibrations of large rigidity structures two refinement study cases are given in the paper using the gci method including a case of the liquid sloshing in a baffled tank and a case of the dam breaking flow slamming a vertical wall the liquid sloshing case shows the performance of concurrent multi process refinement method in cfd simulations with nonlinear free surface evolutions and gives an error estimation on the coarse medium fine and multi process grids the dam breaking case compares the results by present methods and by previous literatures and gives an error estimation on different selected local process areas simulations of the green wave impact caused by a freak wave is conducted to show the practical application of concurrent multi process refinement method in multi scale fsi problems with high frequency structural vibrations using monolithic fsi methods from which it is seen that the present method can deal with ocean engineering problems composed of large scale cfd issues such as the wave propagation and small scale fsi issues such as the on deck wave slamming in addition it is known that fsi coupling problems can well be explained by the fluid added mass in relation to the object mass the ratio of which can determine whether a strong coupling is required or whether a weak coupling suffices by using the fft method table 9 gives the object mass maximum added mass and r added the ratio between maximum added mass and object mass from which it can be observed that the added mass effect is quite severe in all the three fsi coupling simulations in this paper this proves that the monolithically strong coupled coupling method applied in this study is necessary and is able to give good results in evaluating the added mass effects the main innovation of the paper is the development of concurrent multi process refinement method which is based on a simple based monolithic implicit method used for strong coupling fsi simulations the novelty of concurrent multi process refinement method lies in that it provides a solution of balancing the accuracy and efficiency in monolithic fsi methods especially in dealing with multi scale fsi problems and high frequency structural vibrations in addition concurrent multi process refinement method shows its great advantages in cfd fsi simulations using low cost computational facilities making it possible for researchers to conduct time costing monolithic fsi simulations using ordinary personal computers further study might be focused on the development of concurrent multi process refinement method using adaptive meshing and time step and the potential of parallel computation in multi cpus

22134,the water entry behaviors of projectiles with cylindrical buffer head were studied experimentally and theoretically focusing on projectile dynamics and impact reduction based on the elastic perfectly plastic strain rate dependent compacting model the equation of motion was developed for the projectiles to describe their motion before compaction of the buffer the validity of the equation was proven both experimentally and numerically the peak deceleration of the projectiles was investigated by numerical simulations in ls dyna using lagrange euler coupling and an empirical formula was proposed to accurately describe the impact reduction based on the experimental and numerical results when the impact velocity and buffer dimension were held constant an optimum buffer density existed

length good agreements were observed between the analytical and experimental results keywords water entry cylindrical buffer dynamics impact 1 introduction despite extensive studies there is still no satisfactory theoretical solution to date for the water entry of projectiles because it is a very complex process the initial developments of water entry theory can be traced back to 1929 when von karman von karman 1929 proposed several mathematical solutions to describe the impact forces acting upon rigid bodies during water entry in 1932 wagner 1932 further extended the earlier work of von karman by mathematically analyzing the vertical water entry impact of two dimensional wedge at a small deadrise angle sedov 1934 later applied wagner s theoretical solution to larger deadrise angles and yu 1945 considered three dimensional effects by applying correction factors after world war ii the research interest in the water entry problem increasingly turned to underwater ordnance and was extended to the area of hydroballistics and the impact and dynamic peak stress during water entry process received significant attention shiffman and spencer 1945a 1945b 1951 investigated the vertical impact of spheres and cones upon water entry they emphasized added mass as an important concept in their early work shiffman and spencer 1945a 1945b and later extended hillman s solution hillman 1946 for a 120 cone to give an improved approximate solution applicable to any cone angle shiffman and spencer 1951 their conclusions were in good agreement with the experimental works of watanabe 1930a 1930b as well as with hillman s solution hillman 1946 in the mean time typical works on the water entry of projectiles were also undertaken by may schnitzer abelson waugh and others may and woodhull 1948 may 1970 schnitzer 1953 abelson 1971 waugh and stubstad 1972 these pioneering researchers have largely built a framework for the problem of water entry impact although may pointed out in 1970 that more work on water entry was still needed to eliminate guesswork may 1970 as theory developed in the field of water entry research was also carried out on reducing entry impact to make sure that the projectile itself would stay intact upon water entry and remain functional to maximize damage only until reaching the intended target in 1931 by taking into account the elasticity of float gear pabst 1931 introduced his assumptions into the mechanical model of von karman von karman 1929 by assuming the elastic function of the water entry structure as a linear spring in order to mitigate the peak stress of water entry hinckley and yang 1975 analyzed the mitigation of shock and the absorption of energy under impact loading conditions with crushable materials and concluded that rigid polyurethane pu foam was an effective material to mitigate shock baldwin jr et al 1977 tested various nose shapes of projectiles especially their cone body and derived a set of equations to calculate the total resistance during the vertical water entry of a projectile with an arch nose these investigations constitute the theoretical basis of reducing water entry impact however the water entry impact and its mitigation are still not well understood even in modern times zhang et al 1993 developed a theoretical model to simulate the impact buckling of the coupled fluid structure system and performed experiments in which an elastic plastic column its upper end attached to a large mass and its lower end to a flat plate perpendicularly impacted water from various drop heights in 2003 park et al 2003 developed a numerical method to compute the impact forces and the ricochet behaviors of high speed water entry bodies guo et al 2012a 2012b 2012c studied high speed projectiles striking water horizontally and the effects of nose shapes on velocity attenuations and drag coefficient recent water entry studies took deformable materials into account as well for example tate et al fanning et al 2017 compared deformable elastomeric spheres with their rigid counterpart to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions nose shape and cushion materials are considered in many water entry studies and it is thus of interest to find a method to describe the complex situation of water entry for projectiles with cushioning material in this work extensive experiments with accelerometer and digital high speed photography as well as numerical simulations were performed for the water entry of projectiles bearing full size cylindrical buffer heads made of rigid polyurethane pu foam the dynamics of the projectiles during water entry were studied the impact loads of the projectiles with buffer head were observed and an empirical maximum deceleration model was proposed with consideration of the density of the rigid pu and the initial velocity 2 experimental investigation 2 1 device setup since pool test was not suitable for inspecting high velocity water entry we established an alternative experimental setup assembled as shown in fig 1 the projectile equipped with an acceleration sensor was shot into the water tank the initial speed and motion process were recorded by laser beam and high speed camera and the deceleration data were obtained by oscilloscope a constant current power was used to supply power to the acceleration sensor the projectile was fired off from a standard artillery device aiming at the diaphragm of the water tank a low burning rate propellant was employed to make sure that the buffer head would not be destroyed by large acceleration the acceleration and initial velocity of the projectiles were adjusted by tuning the mass of the propellant in the cartridge a phantom digital high speed camera was deployed to record the fluid the projectile and the deformation of the buffer head upon the entry the selected frame rate was 10000 per second i e one frame was taken every 100 μs these settings were chosen based on early numerical simulation results by ls dyna and autodyn the transparent impact resistant water tank was made of polycarbonate composite material and there was no cover on the tank two holes were cut in the front and the back pieces of the polycarbonate and were sealed by two pieces of diaphragms analogously to guo z zhang w et al guo et al 2012c the diaphragms were made of 0 2 mm thick acrylic sheets when a projectile was fired at 71 3 m s to penetrate the diaphragms the velocity and attitude of the projectiles showed no difference before and after the penetrate proving that the 0 2 mm thick acrylic sheets were ideal to seal the water tank and would not affect the water entry process the projectile was fired into the front hole to penetrate the fluid horizontally and it either left the tank from the back hole by itself or was manually unloaded before each run water was replenished and the tank was sealed with fresh diaphragms projectiles with buffer heads of different density were fired into the water tank all projectiles and buffer heads were of the same size the projectiles were made of 2a12 aluminum 150 mm in diameter 3 kg mass and the buffer heads were made of rigid pu also 150 mm in diameter inside each projectile was installed an accelerometer which was attached to a flexible cable for power supply and collection of signal waveforms table 1 shows the parameters of the accelerometer a tail rod was connected to the projectile with a thread to facilitate acceleration three pu densities 0 12 0 18 and 0 25 g cm3 of the buffer heads were tested fig 2 fig 3 shows the assembled projectile 2 2 experimental result the buffer head deformed greatly upon water entry fig 4 a the initial velocity and buffer density jointly determined when and where the compaction of the buffer head took place the compacted buffer head then crushed and broke apart from the projectile fig 4c and d this automatic separation of the buffer head was a desirable feature in terms of engineering since the buffering effect was needed only in the initial stage we tested the three buffer densities at two initial velocities and the results were divided into the high velocity group 95 m s and the low velocity group 70 m s since many of the water entry devices are equipped with air deceleration devices the water entry speed is mostly within this speed range or even lower projectiles without buffer head were also fired similarly for comparison fig 5 demonstrates the velocity attenuation over time of the projectiles with buffer head camera images were collected only for the first 2 ms because water entry was quick for the projectiles with buffer head of 0 12 g cm3 and 0 18 g cm3 pu deceleration became more significant when the projectile shot farther into the tank however this situation was not readily observed for the projectile with 0 25 g cm3 pu buffer head probably because the dense pu compacted too early and the buffering effect was poorer several sensors were used on the projectiles to measure deceleration fig 6 draws a typical deceleration curve although the response frequency of the sensors was not high enough to measure real time deceleration in the very quick water entry process the recorded maximum values sufficed for studying the buffering effect because the sensor had a limited range of measurement the maximum deceleration of the projectile with rigid head could not be experimentally obtained but could only be calculated by numerical simulations table 2 lists the data we obtained in experiments 3 numerical simulations numerical simulation was carried out to obtain more details and data during water entry the water entry process was more clearly observed by considering cylindrical polyurethane foam as the buffer similarly as in the experiments 3 1 numerical simulation setup numerical simulations were conducted using the explicit finite element code of ls dyna thus considering the fluid solid interactions between the projectile and water the coupled lagrange euler technique was adopted to simulate the interaction problems with the lagrange mesh for the projectile and the euler mesh for water all projectiles had a same mass of 3 kg their initial velocities ranged in 70 130 m s and five polyurethane densities were considered in the simulations table 3 lists the initial conditions of the numerical simulations a 3d one quarter symmetric numerical model was employed for the water entry fig 7 presents the numerical models and the mesh construction in which the mesh size was determined from a convergence study from the material database of ls dyna mat closed cell foam was selected as the material model for polyurethane foam hence giving michael et al 1987 1 δ y a b 1 c λ where δ y is yield stress a b and c are constants and γ is a function of the volumetric strain all of which can be obtained as follows 2 a 23 7 φ 1 676 mpa 3 b 19 2 φ 1 645 mpa 4 c 2 21 31 1 φ 5 γ v 1 γ 0 6 e 3130 2 φ 220 mpa where φ is the density ratio of the initial pu foam to compacted pu v is the volumetric strain i e the ratio of the existing volume to the initial volume γ 0 is the initial volume strain of the foam material normally γ0 0 and e is young s modulus numerical simulations were then run for projectiles equipped with pu buffer of different density 0 12 0 15 0 18 0 21 and 0 25 g cm3 that entered water at varying initial velocity the material model of water and 2a12 aluminum can be easily found in the material database 3 2 simulation results the numerical results were compared with the experimental results in the earlier section to verify simulation effectiveness figs 8 and 9 because the response frequency of sensors was not high enough the voltage could not be timely reset after the projectile passed the maximum point which caused the discrepancy in figs 8 b and 9 b nevertheless since the focus of this paper is peak acceleration this discrepancy was inconsequential as the maximum value of acceleration obtained by the sensor showed good agreement with simulation the velocity attenuation curve also showed good agreement therefore the numerical models were well validated and deemed to adequately capture the water entry behaviors fig 10 shows the stress cloud map of a typical water entry process from the numerical simulation and illustrates both the deformation of the buffer head and the stress time history of whole projectile body during water entry high stress occurred upon contact between the buffer head and water at which time the buffer head started to deform giving stress waves that propagated backward thanks to the yield stress of the buffer the projectile body did not experience significant stress the buffer head then deformed further as the projectile was further extruded until the buffer fully compacted and after the compaction of the buffer peak stress and peak deceleration were observed upon strong impact figs 8 10 show that the water entry of projectiles with buffer head could be divided roughly into two stages in the buffering stage the rigid pu buffer head mitigated the peak stress and limited deceleration to a low level next in the compaction stage the compacted buffer head crushed and broke apart and the stress and deceleration of the projectile increased fig 11 clearly illustrates the two stages hence the simulation was well validated and could be used for subsequent analyses 4 projectile dynamics in the buffering stage the v t curves of the buffered projectiles showed that the velocity of projectiles decreased almost uniformly in the buffering stage it was previously reported may 1952 that at an entry velocity of 8 m s surface forces are important and missile behavior depends greatly on surface condition instead the projectile velocity considered in this work was much higher 70 m s and the effect of surface condition thus became negligible in the subsequent analyses consider an object with an initial velocity of v 0 penetrating into water along a linear trajectory in the x direction fig 12 the motion equation of the object can be described by newton s second law while ignoring gravity and buoyancy 7 m d 2 x 1 d t 2 f d d t m d x 2 d t f f σ t a f ε t ε t where x 1 and x 2 denote the front face of the projectile and the buffer respectively m is the projectile mass f is the drag force m is the added mass σ t is the instantaneous stress a is the stress area of the buffer which can be assumed to be a constant and ε t and ε t represent the strain and the strain rate respectively equation 1 can be integrated to give velocity as a function of time 8 d x 1 d t t v 0 0 t f m d t v 1 t d x 2 d t t 0 t f m d t v 2 t according to the elastic perfectly plastic strain rate dependent compacting model hinckley and yang 1975 σ t can be considered as a function of the strain rate ε t before buffer compaction 9 σ t σ y t 795 28 1 ln ε t ρ 1 64 p a where σ yt is the instantaneous yield stress and ρ is the initial density of the rigid polyurethane foam in kg m3 the strain rate in equation 9 is an instantaneous value because the buffering stage is very short the strain rate could not be easily measured with high precision but was instead assumed as a constant over the entire buffering stage of water entry therefore 10 ε t ε v 0 l 0 where ε is the average strain rate and l 0 is the length of the buffer the motion equation can thus be written as 11 v 1 t v 0 a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 ln ε v 2 t a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 ln ε ε v 0 l 0 the v 2 t values were not obtained from the experiments since the front face of the buffer could not be readily observed fig 13 shows the measured simulated and calculated v 1 t values for the projectiles with five different buffers the red dotted line is a rough dividing line between the buffering stage and the compaction stage the model calculation gave v 1 t values that were in good agreement with both experiments and simulations of the buffering stage the buffering stage terminated when 1 the buffer head had become compacted 2 the extrusion stress fell below the yield stress σ t σ y or 3 the buffer material broke apart before compaction took place 5 impact of water entry 5 1 cushioning effect of the polyurethane foam a buffer free object is unlike a buffered object in that peak deceleration occurs at the beginning when it enters water figs 14 and 15 since the peak deceleration is a great force on the object it is imperative to effectively reduce the peak deceleration to ensure the structural integrity of the projectile upon water entry table 4 lists the maximum deceleration and reduction rate for each tested and simulated sample which proved that the buffer head could effectively reduce the impact from water entry 5 2 empirical formula of maximum deceleration for projectiles equipped with cylindrical buffer head peak deceleration is related to the density diameter and thickness of the cylindrical buffer as well as the initial velocity of the projectile the diameter and thickness of the cylindrical buffer were constants in the current experiment fig 16 shows that a good quadratic relationship could be found between peak deceleration and buffer density for the buffered projectiles fired at different initial velocity this result prompted us to develop a new equation to describe the relations of 1 peak deceleration 2 buffer density and 3 initial velocity at a particular size of cylindrical buffer by introducing the dimensionless parameters λ1 λ2 and λ3 the new equation can be proposed as 12 a max a λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 where ρ pu is the initial density of the rigid polyurethane foam ρ 0 is the density of compacted pu v 0 is the initial velocity v w is sound velocity in water v w 1500 m s and d and l 0 are the diameter and thickness of the buffer respectively according to the fitting curves shown in fig 16 at each initial velocity the peak deceleration could be expressed as 13 a max a λ 1 2 b λ 1 c the parameters a b and c are associated with the initial velocity zero initial velocity would have meant no deceleration and the curves thus passed through the origin the values of a b and c were obtained by fitting the data points in fig 16 and are listed in table 5 fig 17 shows the relationship between the parameters and λ2 from which the parameters a b and c could be determined 14 a a 1 v 0 v w a 2 15 b b 1 v 0 v w b 2 16 c c 1 v 0 v w c 2 hence the peak deceleration for different initial velocity could be expressed as follows 17 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 1 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 1 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 2 table 6 lists the constants in equation 17 the unit of a max is g the maximum acceleration of a projectile of any mass upon its water entry can be calculated according to newton s second law as follows 18 a max m a max m in this work m 3 kg m is the mass of any other projectile amax is the corresponding maximum acceleration 5 3 extension of the empirical formula section 4 2 1 only considered the case where diameter to thickness ratio of the pu buffer was λ3 2 and proved that λ3 2 could fit equation 17 in order to verify the accuracy of the empirical model λ3 1 and λ3 3 were considered additionally and numerical simulations at different initial velocity and buffer density were carried out figs 18 and 19 illustrate the water entry for λ3 1 and λ3 3 respectively assuming 0 12 g cm3 buffer head density and 70 m s initial velocity the deformation of the buffer head was basically the same as in λ3 2 both could well fit in the form of equation 17 with a different set of parameters the corresponding maximum deceleration could be expressed as follows for λ3 1 and λ3 3 19 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 1 and 20 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 3 table 7 lists the constants in equations 19 and 20 6 discussion this paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the water entry behaviors of projectiles with cylindrical buffer head results showed that the buffer head made of polyurethane foam could greatly reduce impact and the water entry process could be divided into two stages i e the buffering stage and the compaction stage the projectile dynamics in the buffering stage was examined both experimentally and theoretically the results showed that the deceleration of the projectiles was quite low in the first stage and depended on the mechanical properties of materials combining the elastic perfectly plastic strain rate dependent compacting model the equation of motion could be described as 21 v 1 t v 0 a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 i n ε v 2 t a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 i n ε ε v 0 l 0 however it should be noted that ε in reality dose not remain constant during water entry and its precise mathematical expression should be further studied nevertheless good agreements were found between the experimentally observed velocity time history and that predicted by the analytical cavity model fig 13 a number of major features such as penetration distance projectiles velocity acceleration in the buffering stage with different kinds of buffer head etc could also be well captured by the analytical model to accurately describe the reduction of impact the maximum deceleration for different initial velocities and different buffer densities were further examined in numerical simulations analyses showed that the peak deceleration was reached after the buffer head had compacted and fig 16 shows a typical curve the maximum deceleration could be described as 22 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 the parameters varied with the size of the buffer head λ3 whose typical values are shown in table 6 the results showed that an optimal material density existed for reducing the impact under different condition projectiles with higher initial velocity suffered from higher impact during water entry in addition λ3 also notably affected the impact since numerical simulations showed that peak deceleration increased significantly when λ3 was higher it could be speculated that a larger contact area would increase resistance although excessive thinning of the buffer head would undermine the buffering effect equation 18 could be applied to determine the maximum deceleration of projectiles of any mass since the projectile mass for fitting was 3 kg in the current tests equation 18 could be written as 23 a max 3 a max m note that the unit of a max is g 7 conclusions in this paper the water entry behavior of projectiles with cylindrical buffer head was studied experimentally and numerically the current work within its scope allows the following main conclusions to be drawn 1 an effective numerical simulation method was developed for the water entry of projectiles with buffer heads the velocity time history and maximum deceleration of the projectile s water entry obtained from the simulation were in good agreement with experimental observations 2

impact of spheres and cones upon water entry they emphasized added mass as an important concept in their early work shiffman and spencer 1945a 1945b and later extended hillman s solution hillman 1946 for a 120 cone to give an improved approximate solution applicable to any cone angle shiffman and spencer 1951 their conclusions were in good agreement with the experimental works of watanabe 1930a 1930b as well as with hillman s solution hillman 1946 in the mean time typical works on the water entry of projectiles were also undertaken by may schnitzer abelson waugh and others may and woodhull 1948 may 1970 schnitzer 1953 abelson 1971 waugh and stubstad 1972 these pioneering researchers have largely built a framework for the problem of water entry impact although may pointed out in 1970 that more work on water entry was still needed to eliminate guesswork may 1970 as theory developed in the field of water entry research was also carried out on reducing entry impact to make sure that the projectile itself would stay intact upon water entry and remain functional to maximize damage only until reaching the intended target in 1931 by taking into account the elasticity of float gear pabst 1931 introduced his assumptions into the mechanical model of von karman von karman 1929 by assuming the elastic function of the water entry structure as a linear spring in order to mitigate the peak stress of water entry hinckley and yang 1975 analyzed the mitigation of shock and the absorption of energy under impact loading conditions with crushable materials and concluded that rigid polyurethane pu foam was an effective material to mitigate shock baldwin jr et al 1977 tested various nose shapes of projectiles especially their cone body and derived a set of equations to calculate the total resistance during the vertical water entry of a projectile with an arch nose these investigations constitute the theoretical basis of reducing water entry impact however the water entry impact and its mitigation are still not well understood even in modern times zhang et al 1993 developed a theoretical model to simulate the impact buckling of the coupled fluid structure system and performed experiments in which an elastic plastic column its upper end attached to a large mass and its lower end to a flat plate perpendicularly impacted water from various drop heights in 2003 park et al 2003 developed a numerical method to compute the impact forces and the ricochet behaviors of high speed water entry bodies guo et al 2012a 2012b 2012c studied high speed projectiles striking water horizontally and the effects of nose shapes on velocity attenuations and drag coefficient recent water entry studies took deformable materials into account as well for example tate et al fanning et al 2017 compared deformable elastomeric spheres with their rigid counterpart to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions nose shape and cushion materials are considered in many water entry studies and it is thus of interest to find a method to describe the complex situation of water entry for projectiles with cushioning material in this work extensive experiments with accelerometer and digital high speed photography as well as numerical simulations were performed for the water entry of projectiles bearing full size cylindrical buffer heads made of rigid polyurethane pu foam the dynamics of the projectiles during water entry were studied the impact loads of the projectiles with buffer head were observed and an empirical maximum deceleration model was proposed with consideration of the density of the rigid pu and the initial velocity 2 experimental investigation 2 1 device setup since pool test was not suitable for inspecting high velocity water entry we established an alternative experimental setup assembled as shown in fig 1 the projectile equipped with an acceleration sensor was shot into the water tank the initial speed and motion process were recorded by laser beam and high speed camera and the deceleration data were obtained by oscilloscope a constant current power was used to supply power to the acceleration sensor the projectile was fired off from a standard artillery device aiming at the diaphragm of the water tank a low burning rate propellant was employed to make sure that the buffer head would not be destroyed by large acceleration the acceleration and initial velocity of the projectiles were adjusted by tuning the mass of the propellant in the cartridge a phantom digital high speed camera was deployed to record the fluid the projectile and the deformation of the buffer head upon the entry the selected frame rate was 10000 per second i e one frame was taken every 100 μs these settings were chosen based on early numerical simulation results by ls dyna and autodyn the transparent impact resistant water tank was made of polycarbonate composite material and there was no cover on the tank two holes were cut in the front and the back pieces of the polycarbonate and were sealed by two pieces of diaphragms analogously to guo z zhang w et al guo et al 2012c the diaphragms were made of 0 2 mm thick acrylic sheets when a projectile was fired at 71 3 m s to penetrate the diaphragms the velocity and attitude of the projectiles showed no difference before and after the penetrate proving that the 0 2 mm thick acrylic sheets were ideal to seal the water tank and would not affect the water entry process the projectile was fired into the front hole to penetrate the fluid horizontally and it either left the tank from the back hole by itself or was manually unloaded before each run water was replenished and the tank was sealed with fresh diaphragms projectiles with buffer heads of different density were fired into the water tank all projectiles and buffer heads were of the same size the projectiles were made of 2a12 aluminum 150 mm in diameter 3 kg mass and the buffer heads were made of rigid pu also 150 mm in diameter inside each projectile was installed an accelerometer which was attached to a flexible cable for power supply and collection of signal waveforms table 1 shows the parameters of the accelerometer a tail rod was connected to the projectile with a thread to facilitate acceleration three pu densities 0 12 0 18 and 0 25 g cm3 of the buffer heads were tested fig 2 fig 3 shows the assembled projectile 2 2 experimental result the buffer head deformed greatly upon water entry fig 4 a the initial velocity and buffer density jointly determined when and where the compaction of the buffer head took place the compacted buffer head then crushed and broke apart from the projectile fig 4c and d this automatic separation of the buffer head was a desirable feature in terms of engineering since the buffering effect was needed only in the initial stage we tested the three buffer densities at two initial velocities and the results were divided into the high velocity group 95 m s and the low velocity group 70 m s since many of the water entry devices are equipped with air deceleration devices the water entry speed is mostly within this speed range or even lower projectiles without buffer head were also fired similarly for comparison fig 5 demonstrates the velocity attenuation over time of the projectiles with buffer head camera images were collected only for the first 2 ms because water entry was quick for the projectiles with buffer head of 0 12 g cm3 and 0 18 g cm3 pu deceleration became more significant when the projectile shot farther into the tank however this situation was not readily observed for the projectile with 0 25 g cm3 pu buffer head probably because the dense pu compacted too early and the buffering effect was poorer several sensors were used on the projectiles to measure deceleration fig 6 draws a typical deceleration curve although the response frequency of the sensors was not high enough to measure real time deceleration in the very quick water entry process the recorded maximum values sufficed for studying the buffering effect because the sensor had a limited range of measurement the maximum deceleration of the projectile with rigid head could not be experimentally obtained but could only be calculated by numerical simulations table 2 lists the data we obtained in experiments 3 numerical simulations numerical simulation was carried out to obtain more details and data during water entry the water entry process was more clearly observed by considering cylindrical polyurethane foam as the buffer similarly as in the experiments 3 1 numerical simulation setup numerical simulations were conducted using the explicit finite element code of ls dyna thus considering the fluid solid interactions between the projectile and water the coupled lagrange euler technique was adopted to simulate the interaction problems with the lagrange mesh for the projectile and the euler mesh for water all projectiles had a same mass of 3 kg their initial velocities ranged in 70 130 m s and five polyurethane densities were considered in the simulations table 3 lists the initial conditions of the numerical simulations a 3d one quarter symmetric numerical model was employed for the water entry fig 7 presents the numerical models and the mesh construction in which the mesh size was determined from a convergence study from the material database of ls dyna mat closed cell foam was selected as the material model for polyurethane foam hence giving michael et al 1987 1 δ y a b 1 c λ where δ y is yield stress a b and c are constants and γ is a function of the volumetric strain all of which can be obtained as follows 2 a 23 7 φ 1 676 mpa 3 b 19 2 φ 1 645 mpa 4 c 2 21 31 1 φ 5 γ v 1 γ 0 6 e 3130 2 φ 220 mpa where φ is the density ratio of the initial pu foam to compacted pu v is the volumetric strain i e the ratio of the existing volume to the initial volume γ 0 is the initial volume strain of the foam material normally γ0 0 and e is young s modulus numerical simulations were then run for projectiles equipped with pu buffer of different density 0 12 0 15 0 18 0 21 and 0 25 g cm3 that entered water at varying initial velocity the material model of water and 2a12 aluminum can be easily found in the material database 3 2 simulation results the numerical results were compared with the experimental results in the earlier section to verify simulation effectiveness figs 8 and 9 because the response frequency of sensors was not high enough the voltage could not be timely reset after the projectile passed the maximum point which caused the discrepancy in figs 8 b and 9 b nevertheless since the focus of this paper is peak acceleration this discrepancy was inconsequential as the maximum value of acceleration obtained by the sensor showed good agreement with simulation the velocity attenuation curve also showed good agreement therefore the numerical models were well validated and deemed to adequately capture the water entry behaviors fig 10 shows the stress cloud map of a typical water entry process from the numerical simulation and illustrates both the deformation of the buffer head and the stress time history of whole projectile body during water entry high stress occurred upon contact between the buffer head and water at which time the buffer head started to deform giving stress waves that propagated backward thanks to the yield stress of the buffer the projectile body did not experience significant stress the buffer head then deformed further as the projectile was further extruded until the buffer fully compacted and after the compaction of the buffer peak stress and peak deceleration were observed upon strong impact figs 8 10 show that the water entry of projectiles with buffer head could be divided roughly into two stages in the buffering stage the rigid pu buffer head mitigated the peak stress and limited deceleration to a low level next in the compaction stage the compacted buffer head crushed and broke apart and the stress and deceleration of the projectile increased fig 11 clearly illustrates the two stages hence the simulation was well validated and could be used for subsequent analyses 4 projectile dynamics in the buffering stage the v t curves of the buffered projectiles showed that the velocity of projectiles decreased almost uniformly in the buffering stage it was previously reported may 1952 that at an entry velocity of 8 m s surface forces are important and missile behavior depends greatly on surface condition instead the projectile velocity considered in this work was much higher 70 m s and the effect of surface condition thus became negligible in the subsequent analyses consider an object with an initial velocity of v 0 penetrating into water along a linear trajectory in the x direction fig 12 the motion equation of the object can be described by newton s second law while ignoring gravity and buoyancy 7 m d 2 x 1 d t 2 f d d t m d x 2 d t f f σ t a f ε t ε t where x 1 and x 2 denote the front face of the projectile and the buffer respectively m is the projectile mass f is the drag force m is the added mass σ t is the instantaneous stress a is the stress area of the buffer which can be assumed to be a constant and ε t and ε t represent the strain and the strain rate respectively equation 1 can be integrated to give velocity as a function of time 8 d x 1 d t t v 0 0 t f m d t v 1 t d x 2 d t t 0 t f m d t v 2 t according to the elastic perfectly plastic strain rate dependent compacting model hinckley and yang 1975 σ t can be considered as a function of the strain rate ε t before buffer compaction 9 σ t σ y t 795 28 1 ln ε t ρ 1 64 p a where σ yt is the instantaneous yield stress and ρ is the initial density of the rigid polyurethane foam in kg m3 the strain rate in equation 9 is an instantaneous value because the buffering stage is very short the strain rate could not be easily measured with high precision but was instead assumed as a constant over the entire buffering stage of water entry therefore 10 ε t ε v 0 l 0 where ε is the average strain rate and l 0 is the length of the buffer the motion equation can thus be written as 11 v 1 t v 0 a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 ln ε v 2 t a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 ln ε ε v 0 l 0 the v 2 t values were not obtained from the experiments since the front face of the buffer could not be readily observed fig 13 shows the measured simulated and calculated v 1 t values for the projectiles with five different buffers the red dotted line is a rough dividing line between the buffering stage and the compaction stage the model calculation gave v 1 t values that were in good agreement with both experiments and simulations of the buffering stage the buffering stage terminated when 1 the buffer head had become compacted 2 the extrusion stress fell below the yield stress σ t σ y or 3 the buffer material broke apart before compaction took place 5 impact of water entry 5 1 cushioning effect of the polyurethane foam a buffer free object is unlike a buffered object in that peak deceleration occurs at the beginning when it enters water figs 14 and 15 since the peak deceleration is a great force on the object it is imperative to effectively reduce the peak deceleration to ensure the structural integrity of the projectile upon water entry table 4 lists the maximum deceleration and reduction rate for each tested and simulated sample which proved that the buffer head could effectively reduce the impact from water entry 5 2 empirical formula of maximum deceleration for projectiles equipped with cylindrical buffer head peak deceleration is related to the density diameter and thickness of the cylindrical buffer as well as the initial velocity of the projectile the diameter and thickness of the cylindrical buffer were constants in the current experiment fig 16 shows that a good quadratic relationship could be found between peak deceleration and buffer density for the buffered projectiles fired at different initial velocity this result prompted us to develop a new equation to describe the relations of 1 peak deceleration 2 buffer density and 3 initial velocity at a particular size of cylindrical buffer by introducing the dimensionless parameters λ1 λ2 and λ3 the new equation can be proposed as 12 a max a λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 where ρ pu is the initial density of the rigid polyurethane foam ρ 0 is the density of compacted pu v 0 is the initial velocity v w is sound velocity in water v w 1500 m s and d and l 0 are the diameter and thickness of the buffer respectively according to the fitting curves shown in fig 16 at each initial velocity the peak deceleration could be expressed as 13 a max a λ 1 2 b λ 1 c the parameters a b and c are associated with the initial velocity zero initial velocity would have meant no deceleration and the curves thus passed through the origin the values of a b and c were obtained by fitting the data points in fig 16 and are listed in table 5 fig 17 shows the relationship between the parameters and λ2 from which the parameters a b and c could be determined 14 a a 1 v 0 v w a 2 15 b b 1 v 0 v w b 2 16 c c 1 v 0 v w c 2 hence the peak deceleration for different initial velocity could be expressed as follows 17 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 1 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 1 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 2 table 6 lists the constants in equation 17 the unit of a max is g the maximum acceleration of a projectile of any mass upon its water entry can be calculated according to newton s second law as follows 18 a max m a max m in this work m 3 kg m is the mass of any other projectile amax is the corresponding maximum acceleration 5 3 extension of the empirical formula section 4 2 1 only considered the case where diameter to thickness ratio of the pu buffer was λ3 2 and proved that λ3 2 could fit equation 17 in order to verify the accuracy of the empirical model λ3 1 and λ3 3 were considered additionally and numerical simulations at different initial velocity and buffer density were carried out figs 18 and 19 illustrate the water entry for λ3 1 and λ3 3 respectively assuming 0 12 g cm3 buffer head density and 70 m s initial velocity the deformation of the buffer head was basically the same as in λ3 2 both could well fit in the form of equation 17 with a different set of parameters the corresponding maximum deceleration could be expressed as follows for λ3 1 and λ3 3 19 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 1 and 20 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 3 table 7 lists the constants in equations 19 and 20 6 discussion this paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on the water entry behaviors of projectiles with cylindrical buffer head results showed that the buffer head made of polyurethane foam could greatly reduce impact and the water entry process could be divided into two stages i e the buffering stage and the compaction stage the projectile dynamics in the buffering stage was examined both experimentally and theoretically the results showed that the deceleration of the projectiles was quite low in the first stage and depended on the mechanical properties of materials combining the elastic perfectly plastic strain rate dependent compacting model the equation of motion could be described as 21 v 1 t v 0 a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 i n ε v 2 t a t ρ 1 64 m 795 28 1 i n ε ε v 0 l 0 however it should be noted that ε in reality dose not remain constant during water entry and its precise mathematical expression should be further studied nevertheless good agreements were found between the experimentally observed velocity time history and that predicted by the analytical cavity model fig 13 a number of major features such as penetration distance projectiles velocity acceleration in the buffering stage with different kinds of buffer head etc could also be well captured by the analytical model to accurately describe the reduction of impact the maximum deceleration for different initial velocities and different buffer densities were further examined in numerical simulations analyses showed that the peak deceleration was reached after the buffer head had compacted and fig 16 shows a typical curve the maximum deceleration could be described as 22 a max a 1 λ 2 a 2 λ 1 2 b 1 λ 2 b 2 λ 1 c 1 λ 2 c 2 λ 1 ρ p u ρ 0 λ 2 v 0 v w λ 3 d l 0 the parameters varied with the size of the buffer head λ3 whose typical values are shown in table 6 the results showed that an optimal material density existed for reducing the impact under different condition projectiles with higher initial velocity suffered from higher impact during water entry in addition λ3 also notably affected the impact since numerical simulations showed that peak deceleration increased significantly when λ3 was higher it could be speculated that a larger contact area would increase resistance although excessive thinning of the buffer head would undermine the buffering effect equation 18 could be applied to determine the maximum deceleration of projectiles of any mass since the projectile mass for fitting was 3 kg in the current tests equation 18 could be written as 23 a max 3 a max m note that the unit of a max is g 7 conclusions in this paper the water entry behavior of projectiles with cylindrical buffer head was studied experimentally and numerically the current work within its scope allows the following main conclusions to be drawn 1 an effective numerical simulation method was developed for the water entry of projectiles with buffer heads the velocity time history and maximum deceleration of the projectile s water entry obtained from the simulation were in good agreement with experimental observations 2
