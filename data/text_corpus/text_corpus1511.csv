7555,climate change is expected to alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in high latitude inland waters a critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected we sampled stable water isotopes in soils lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the western siberia lowlands our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with and displaces large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season furthermore we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high latitude systems these isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes keywords stable water isotopes hydrological connectivity runoff generation snowmelt low relief 1 introduction high latitude regions are experiencing alarming hydrological changes as a consequence of global climate change ipcc 2014 tetzlaff et al 2013 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 white et al 2007 the future climate is expected to result in a multitude of hydrologically important changes in precipitation patterns and frequencies lenderink and meijgaard 2008 bintanja and selten 2014 water vapour pressure willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 in high latitude regions air temperature is a crucial control for the cryogenic processes that play a key role in their energy and water balances woo et al 2008 wild 2009 recent literature reports accelerating rates of permafrost thaw which is expected to have cascading effects on the high latitude environment river flow regimes and associated biogeochemical interactions frey and mcclelland 2009 giesler et al 2014 lyon et al 2009 of particular importance is the amplified release of organic carbon due to permafrost thaw frey and smith 2005 kuhry et al 2010 lessels et al 2015 o donnell et al 2012 however the hydrological connections that determine carbon mobilization and fluxes in high latitude watersheds remain inadequately understood yi et al 2012 zakharova et al 2014 the hydrology of high latitude areas differs from temperate climates due to the strong influence of permafrost extensive lake and wetland distribution and the transmissive properties of the dominant organic soils bowling et al 2003 carey and quinton 2004 quinton and marsh 1999 woo et al 2008 zakharova et al 2014 thawing permafrost is altering the hydrological regime and overall landscape structure by either increasing the number of lakes in continuous permafrost regions by thermokarst development or decreasing lake number and surface area by accelerated drainage of thermokarst lakes in discontinuous permafrost terrain smith et al 2007b smith et al 2005 deepening the active layer and associated changes in lake and wetland distribution alter landscape scale hydrological connectivity quinton et al 2011 smith et al 2007b zakharova et al 2014 this is expected to result in deeper hydrological flow paths thus increasing water travel times and hydrological connectivity in the north frampton and destouni 2015 karlsson et al 2012 it has been suggested that these changes have resulted in an increased discharge of major rivers draining pan arctic watersheds peterson et al 2002 smith et al 2007a stable water isotopes of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o provide a useful and increasingly applied tool for integrating hydrological process information across various scales mcdonnell and beven 2014 existing isotope hydrology studies in high latitude areas have been mostly conducted on two contrasting scales one line of isotope work has looked into large scale hydrological responses at the outlets of major pan arctic watersheds 105 106 km2 leading to improved understanding of the main river source water that drain into the arctic ocean cooper et al 2008 welp et al 2005 yi et al 2012 at the other end of the spectrum isotope studies at the hillslope and headwater catchment scale typically 1 100 km2 have substantially increased understanding of detailed hydrological processes contributing to runoff generation for high latitude including permafrost influenced catchments carey and quinton 2004 hayashi et al 2004 song et al 2017 streletskiy et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015b throckmorton et al 2016 there has been some stable water isotope work at the intermediate scale 102 105 km2 between the small and the large scale studies to determine evaporation signals and rates in high latitude lakes gibson 2001 narancic et al 2017 and studying footprints of climatic forcing on river isotope composition lachniet et al 2016 this important work in high latitude environments is from landscapes where topography exerts a major control on hydrology water sources flow paths and drainage structures in low relief watersheds strongly affected by permafrost or lakes wetlands are much less extensively researched zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 particularly at scales that would address intermediate scales and bridge the gap from small experimental catchments to regional and continental scale watersheds jasechko et al 2017 woo et al 2008 yi et al 2012 a major knowledge gap remains as to how small scale runoff generation processes aggregate into a watershed response in high latitude areas we seek to address this research gap the specific objectives of our work are i to map the spatio temporal variability of stable water isotope composition in rivers soils lakes and snow over multiple seasons and years along a 11 latitudinal gradient from the boreal permafrost free south to the northern arctic permafrost dominated environments in western siberia ii understand temporal changes in water sources of the river ob by collecting a high resolution river water isotope time series and iii based on the isotopic signatures we formulate an improved conceptual understanding of the internal drainage structure of this vast wetland and permafrost influenced high latitude region that links small scale process understanding to regional watershed response 2 materials and methods 2 1 study transect in the western siberia lowlands our study area encompasses a 1700 km long transect in the western siberia lowlands wsl encompassing three major high latitude watersheds the ob pur and taz with total watershed areas of 2 972 000 112 000 and 150 000 km2 respectively the transect fig 1 runs primarily northwest in the ob watershed between 56 and 62 n and turns northeast crossing the pur watershed between 63 and 66 3 n and the taz watershed 66 9 67 5 n spanning in total 11 latitude 1200 km from south to north except for the northern part of the pur and the taz the wsl has a moderate continental climate with marked seasonal variability between short summers and long cold winters the mean annual temperature ranges from 0 5 c in the southern parts of the transect gradually decreasing with latitude down to 9 5 c in the north annual precipitation is lowest in the southern areas with 550 mm increases to 650 700 mm around 63 n and reduces to 600 mm at the northern parts rivers sampled in the ob watershed 63 n are on permafrost free areas in the southern region approx 60 n and on isolated 60 62 n and sporadic and discontinuous 62 63 n permafrost in the north brown et al 2002 sampled rivers in the pur watershed 63 n all run on sporadic and discontinuous permafrost and samples taken from the taz 67 n watershed are on continuous permafrost annual runoff increases northward with 160 220 mm a 1 in the southern permafrost free zone to 280 320 mm a 1 in the permafrost affected northern areas the geology of the wsl consist of sedimentary rocks dominated by sandstones and shales ulmishek 2003 overlain by quaternary aeolian and fluvial sand silt and clay deposits ranging from a few meters to 200 250 m in thickness pokrovsky et al 2015 because of the cool air temperatures flat relief and waterlogged conditions the area is dominated by organic peat soils with thickness between 1 and 3 m mantling the mineral sub soils frey et al 2007 peatlands in the wsl are dominated by ombrogenous bogs hydrologically sourced by precipitation fens sourced by precipitation and lateral surface and subsurface groundwater flow and lakes kirpotin et al 2009 in the permafrost zone lakes typically form in response to thermal erosion and permafrost thaw thermokarst whereas in the permafrost free areas peat erosion is the key process of lake formation wetland and lake cover in the wsl can vary from 20 to 80 percent over the year depending on the seasonal hydrological conditions zakharova et al 2014 previous work in the wsl has quantitatively shown their importance in dynamically modulating streamflow response by storing snowmelt and rainfall but more detailed process understanding of their influence on runoff generation is needed zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 the wsl offer a natural laboratory to study large scale lowland hydrology in an area with a spectrum of soil frost and permafrost conditions relatively homogenous geology with sedimentary basement rock minimal orographic influences and uniform annual precipitation pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2014 our hydrological understanding of the wsl needs to be improved because of its profound importance for global carbon nutrient and fresh water delivery to the arctic ocean frey and smith 2005 pokrovsky et al 2015 smith and alsdorf 1998 furthermore among high latitude areas the wsl are especially vulnerable to climate change as much of the area resides in the discontinuous permafrost zone where small increases in temperature can lead to drastic changes in permafrost conditions kirpotin et al 2009 romanovsky et al 2010 2 2 stable water isotope sampling design and protocols river sampling was focused on the main stem and tributaries n 59 of the ob taz and pur rivers along the study transect fig 1 catchment areas of the sampling locations varied between 10 and 7 7 105 km2 median 270 8 km2 rivers were primarily sampled between 2014 and 2015 with three major seasonal campaigns in both years firstly targeting baseflow during the winter snow covered period in february march secondly sampling the snowmelt period between april may and the final one targeting the summer flows in july august because of the large sampling area logistical challenges prevented us from sampling all tributaries in all campaigns the sampled locations for each campaign are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 some additional river samples from different tributaries were collected throughout the intensive monitoring and in the summer of 2016 sampling was achieved by grab sample collection from the middle of the river channel if possible from a bridge or from the river banks from the depth of 0 5 m within the actively flowing river never stagnant water lake sampling was primarily focused in the open water season of 2016 the majority of the samples were collected from four lake clusters representing different permafrost zones fig s2 kogalym 62 3 n kahnymey 63 8 n urengoy 66 0 n and tazovky 67 4 n with the first campaign occurred immediately after snowmelt when the lakes become accessible in may june second in midsummer in august and the final sampling before freeze up in september october fig s2 lake water samples were taken from a boat in the middle of each lake at a depth of 0 5 m thermokarst lakes of wsl are extremely shallow 1 0 0 5 m depth polishchuk et al 2017 and therefore the depth of sampling at the small lakes 1000 m2 area was 0 25 m if water had excess organic matter samples were filtered immediately on site using sterile plastic syringes through single use pre washed acetate cellulose filter units the first 2 ml of filtrate were discarded the soil solutions were sampled in the summer of 2015 primarily from four areas coinciding with the lake sampling in kogalym kahnymey and tazovky and with a more western location at the latitude of urengoy fig s2 the sampling was done with ceramic cup suction lysimeters and from variable depths in the active layer between 20 and 50 cm which was typically 10 cm above the permafrost table soil samples were filtered in the field using sartorius 0 45 µm filters and syringes details of soil solution sampling are given in raudina et al 2017 in addition to our spatially distributed sampling we performed local high frequency sampling of the ob mid reaches at kaibasovo 16 km upstream of the nikolskoe river stage gauging station fig 1 the sampling interval was initially monthly starting in jan 2015 then every two days between 30 oct 2015 24 apr 2016 and every day for snowmelt period 24 april 31 may 2016 sampling was conducted as grab sampling 2 m offshore in an area of free river flow all samples were collected into 3 5 ml glass vials and stored in the dark at 4 6 c until analysis samples were analysed at the university of aberdeen using a los gatos dlt 100 laser isotope analyser with instrument precision 0 4 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o isotope ratios are reported in the δ notation using the vienna standard mean ocean water standards coplen 1994 2 3 secondary data sources to further improve our understanding of the isotope hydrology of the wsl using hydrometeorological data to support our analysis we utilised data from the following additional sources stable water isotopes in precipitation were downloaded from the gnip database iaea wmo 2017 kurita et al 2004 station locations fig 1 data fig 2 the monitoring period of the stations was between 1970 and 2000 varying between stations and the precipitation monitoring did not overlap with our own sampling however the sampling stations envelope our study area in terms of both latitude and longitude therefore providing baseline information of the typical spatial variability and seasonality of precipitation isotope composition in the wsl vasil chuk et al 2016 reported isotopic composition of snow along the same transect as our sampling for february march of 2014 and full details of the sampling are provided therein and by shevchenko et al 2016 we used the data as an additional reference isotopic signature of snow that enters the landscape during snowmelt in 2014 data for the discharge and isotopic composition of the river ob at its outlet salekhard fig 1 was produced by the arctic great rivers observatory arctic gro freely available at the portal www arcticgreatrivers org mcclelland et al 2008 gro provided flow and isotope data in the ob was used to contextualize the hydrological regime during our isotope sampling the discharge at nikolskoe located at the mid reaches of the ob near where high frequency isotope sampling took place was obtained from the russian hydrological service the discharge at nikolskoe where only the water level was measured was calculated using two adjacent gauging stations where the river discharges are measured dubrovino n 55 28 30 24 e 83 16 44 23 243 km upstream of nikolskoe and kolpashevo n 58 18 53 64 e 82 57 00 48 214 km downstream of nikolskoe 2 4 data analysis the data were grouped spatially according to the major watersheds having different permafrost regimes permafrost occurrence is less frequent in the ob compared to the pur and taz pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2009 to visualise and analyse the temporal variability of isotopes in the area we grouped the samples according to the seasonality of the hydrological regime i e winter nov mar with baseflow conditions spring april june with snowmelt influence and summer fall july oct with summer rainfall and evaporation effects zakharova et al 2009 the specific timing of the hydrological regime e g the start of the snowmelt period vary along the transect because of the long distance between the southern and northernmost sampling locations but also between years zakharova et al 2014 this makes the selected time periods somewhat approximate nevertheless the sampling of rivers and lakes targets and generally captures these specific periods we calculated deuterium excess d excess as δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 deuterium excess is associated with kinetic isotopic fractionation processes which are typically indicative of evaporation or condensation when a d excess value equals 10 the sample is located on the global meteoric water line gmwl samples with values 10 plot below the gmwl and signal a deviation from the equilibrium fractionation conditions i e the sampled water has been subjected to evaporation dansgaard 1964 d excess can also reflect different environmental characteristics in precipitation moisture sources gat 1996 we used d excess as additional index to distinguish between evaporated and non evaporated stream water sources 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of isotopes the gnip precipitation data shows strong seasonality with isotopically depleted samples taken during months with cold air temperature fig 2 isotopes in the river samples had slightly higher median 15 3 values only for δ18o are reported values compared to the median of gnip precipitation samples 15 6 but the variability was significantly lower interquartile range iqr 1 7 in rivers 8 5 in precipitation fig 3 comparing rivers lakes and soils lakes showed the most pronounced enrichment of heavy isotopes median 11 1 which was most likely primarily caused by evaporation fractionation but also the influence of more enriched summer precipitation fig 3 soil solutions were also more enriched median 13 0 than rivers but less than lakes snow samples collected by vasil chuk et al 2016 were most depleted more negative in heavy isotopes median 28 8 and plotted outside the typical values of all other samples river soils lakes and thereby provided a potentially good tracer for the snowmelt signal in the landscape the local meteoric water line lmwl i e the regression line of the gnip precipitation samples fig 2 fig 3 had a slope of 7 86 similar to the gmwl with a slope of 8 the slope of the regression line in all water samples was lower than the lmwl fig 3 in the order of soils 4 64 lakes 5 54 rivers 6 08 there was surprisingly consistent limited change in the river isotope ratios along the transect from south to north fig 4 a interestingly instead of a constant linear south north depletion along the transect we found an increased enrichment around the latitude 62 n best highlighted by the locally weighted least squares regression loess of the river samples there seemed to be relatively small latitudinal isotopic differences between lakes and soils typically lakes and soils were more enriched than rivers but isotopic compositions were overlapping at all latitudes as for δ18o in the permafrost influenced latitudes 60 n variability in d excess tended to be higher whereas the samples from lower latitudes were clustering more tightly between 5 and 10 fig 4b there appeared to be decreased levels of d excess high evaporation signal around the latitude 62 n coinciding with the latitude of increased δ18o enrichment lakes had high variability and seasonal differences in d excess at all latitudes in soil waters despite the more limited data set the overall values and variability were similar across the sampled transect 3 2 temporal variability of isotopes contemporaneous data for both river flow and stable water isotopes in the river ob are shown in fig s1 as a reference for the observed long term variability at the river outlet river samples from the transect showed higher temporal variability than the arctic gro monitoring at the ob outlet fig 5 shows arctic gro monthly mean and standard deviation fig s1 presents the full time series the arctic gro data showed a typical annual cycle of depleted winter spring and enriched summer values fig 4 this progressive enrichment of streams in our dataset was best seen in the summer of 2015 perhaps the most striking finding in the temporal dynamics of our sampled river isotopes was the relatively modest depletion of streams during snowmelt when the snowpack with a very depleted negative isotopic signal see winter 2013 in fig 5 melted in early may flow in the river ob outlet was elevated approximately tenfold within less than a month despite the substantial flux of depleted snowmelt water we saw the stream isotope values across the transect changing only slightly in 2014 if at all in 2015 towards more depleted signatures we used deuterium excess to explore signals of evaporation in the landscape and particularly in the sampled rivers fig 6 the volume weighted average of precipitation d excess calculated from the gnip data was 5 2 which is below the d excess of the average global meteoric water 10 in general the d excess median for rivers 7 2 and soils 8 5 plotted above the median of precipitation d excess but importantly there were low d excess values in rivers i e signs of evaporated water plotting below the average regional precipitation value of 5 2 not only in the summer but also during winter and spring in both the ob and pur taz watersheds fig 6 snow showed high d excess values median 11 8 typical for the area kurita et al 2005 lakes had the lowest d excess values median 3 4 with the majority plotting well below the precipitation d excess indicating a strong evaporation signal fig 6 high frequency isotope monitoring in the ob middle reaches at nikolskoe fig 1 showed elevated levels in δ18o and decreased d excess values coinciding with slightly increased flows in nov dec 2015 fig 7 as winter progressed there was a steady decline in δ18o during baseflow from january until march moving gradually from enriched evaporated water and summer precipitation to a more depleted water source likely from the well mixed deeper groundwater the d excess of the river plateaued near the value of 10 i e into a water source with minimal evaporation signal surprisingly at the start of snowmelt in late march there was a relatively minor shift of depletion in δ18o from isotope composition between 15 and 16 to values between 16 and 17 the water in the river during flood stager was not reflecting the isotopic composition of melted snow depleted in δ18o starting late april after the snowmelt the stream isotopes start to gradually turn more enriched with some peaks during high flows see e g start of may the peaks in isotopic enrichment in open water season are typically associated with low d excess values fig 7 3 3 water sources in the wsl inferred from temporal and spatial variability in isotopes when disaggregating the samples according to watersheds and hydrological seasons sites from the more northern pur taz watersheds tended to have more depleted δ18o signatures than the southern reaches of the ob in all seasons and in all water bodies fig 8 a in river samples there was a general isotopic evolution from depleted spring values to enrichment over the summer and a return to a more depleted level in the winter the observation that the spring snowmelt snow being depleted did not lead to substantial isotopic depletion in the streams is also evident in fig 8a as the spring and winter medians were very similar in both watersheds rivers exhibited notably low differences in d excess between seasons and watersheds fig 8b with only minimally decreased levels increased evaporation signal in the summer lakes and soils showed differences in d excess both 1 between watersheds with more clear evaporation signals lower median in d excess values in the ob and 2 between seasons with lowest d excess during summer though seasonality was most clearly evident in the lakes which may also reflect the more temporally extensive sampling 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of isotopes the spatial and temporal extent of our stable water isotope dataset is rare even when compared to work in more temperate climates e g jasechko et al 2017 with such a dataset we are in a position to begin to bridge the gap between understanding gained from isotope studies in large pan arctic watershed outlets cooper et al 2008 welp et al 2005 yi et al 2010 yi et al 2012 and smaller scale studies hayashi et al 2004 song et al 2017 streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 to better understand runoff generation and water sources in permafrost influenced lowland areas with extensive lake and wetland coverage in north america lachniet et al 2016 sampled rivers and gibson 2001 lakes at scales similar to ours providing information on isotopic variability in high latitude landscapes however these were confined to shorter monitoring periods and single waterbody type rivers or lakes constraining the development of a more integrated conceptualisation of northern large scale hydrology the expected damped variability of isotopes in rivers compared to precipitation fig 3 indicates mixing of rainfall snowmelt with stored water within the landscape as it traverses the sampled catchments the more enriched median in rivers indicates a preferential sourcing of river water from isotopically heavier summer precipitation fig 2 and or water enriched by evaporation from storage in the landscape rather than winter precipitation in the form of snowmelt the slope of the regression line in all water samples was lower than the lmwl fig 3 in the order of soils lakes rivers which can be interpreted as an evaporation signal in all waterbodies with slope of the lines agreeing with global analysis by gibson et al 2008 the more northern pur taz watersheds were isotopically more depleted compared to the middle reaches of the ob fig 8a this was likely related to the isotopic composition of precipitation which is typically more depleted in northern latitudes due to colder air temperatures even so according to one way analysis of variance test the gnip stations station locations in fig 1 data in fig 2 did not differ in their mean values for precipitations isotopes at the significance level of 0 05 the gnip data even though collected before our study suggests that the isotope variability in precipitation along either north south or east west gradient is not a decisive factor in the isotope variability in the wsl in comparison lachniet et al 2016 reported a 8 3 1000 km south north gradient for rivers in the yukon and alaska the lower south north gradient in the wsl was likely a result of the low elevation with less orographic distillation and major water vapour sources shifting temporally between the atlantic and the pacific oceans reducing the continentality effect in precipitation along the transect kurita et al 2005 the lakes and soil water in the wsl typically had an enriched isotope signal fig 3 but lakes were most clearly distinguished by their low d excess values fig 6 previous work found similar isotopic enrichment of high latitude lakes in north america and used it to estimate evaporation rates from lakes or entire catchments gibson 2001 narancic et al 2017 the wsl has been shown to have anomalously high evaporation rates compared to other high latitude watersheds because of the high percentage of lake and wetland cover and therefore water available for free water evaporation serreze et al 2002 zakharova et al 2014 in further work our dataset will be used to analyse evaporation rates in the very shallow lakes typically 0 5 1 5 m across the wsl at the four sites that were intensively monitored in 2016 our soil sampling focused on summer because the soil is generally frozen from september july and we can therefore say less about the seasonality differences between the frozen and thawed state of soil water isotopes than those of lakes and rivers nevertheless the spatial extent of our soil water sampling in the high latitude environments is unusual as prior work has been looking at soil isotope variability in plot hillslope or small catchment scale carey and quinton 2004 peralta tapia et al 2015 streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 based on the higher intercept of the regression line fig 3 soil water samples appear to be more clearly sourced by enriched summer precipitation than lakes and rivers in july 2015 when soils rivers and lakes were sampled during the same time period the soil isotopes cluster in the same range as the rivers and lakes figs 5 and 6 pointing to a hydrological connection between the three in the wsl as suggested by zakharova et al 2014 typically lakes and soils were more enriched than rivers fig 3 but isotopic compositions were overlapping at all latitudes fig 4 suggesting common sources and connectivity in some of the sampled tributaries as a result of permafrost thaw high latitude watersheds are expected to shift towards more groundwater dominated systems with deeper active layers evans and ge 2017 frampton and destouni 2015 in terms of the isotopic variability in rivers this would be manifested in greater damping due to the lower influence of frozen soils generating overland flow and rapid transmission of a snowmelt isotope signal and greater mixing in the thawed subsurface in our data isotopic variability in spring snowmelt in the taz pur 63 n watersheds with strong permafrost influence is greater than in the ob watershed 63 n fig 8a with weaker permafrost influence which can be interpreted as subtle evidence of permafrost influenced hydrological routing of the depleted snowmelt water to streams more quickly in more northern catchments however the presence of permafrost is difficult to map for large areas walvoord and kurylyk 2016 woo et al 2008 and other categorizations than the primary watershed could have been selected in our study the samples taken south of 60 n would be most likely to be in the permafrost free zone fig 1 if comparing the variability south and north of 60 n fig 4 the rivers in permafrost free areas 60 n do appear to be less variable in both δ18o and d excess and cluster more tightly together higher latitudes more influenced by permafrost 60 n showed more distinct separation between spring winter and summer samples this makes a stronger case for permafrost increasing the isotopic variability than seen in fig 8 which could be inferred as more rapid surface flow component in the northern than the southern parts of the wsl more catchment specific analysis considering attributes such as air temperature relative humidity permafrost coverage lake forest and bog proportion on the watershed as in pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2014 is needed to better understand the reasons for spatial isotope variability in the wsl however the additional analysis are beyond the scope of the current this work and will be addressed in our future research 4 2 temporal variability of isotopes both of our datasets the high frequency sampling of the middle ob fig 7 and spatial sampling along the transect fig 5 showed a strikingly modest signal of isotopic depletion in rivers during snowmelt the isotopic snowmelt signal in high latitude rivers varies a clear snowmelt depletion signal 3 is typical in permafrost dominated mountain fed catchments mcnamara et al 1997 streletskiy et al 2015 welp et al 2005 or in snow influenced environments in general taylor et al 2002 in a study encompassing a similar spatial scale to ours welp et al 2005 stable water isotopes were used to calculate that the winter precipitation snowmelt accounts for 60 of flow in the arctic 650 000 km2 watershed of kolyma northeast siberia underlain by continuous permafrost in the yukon and alaska lachniet et al 2016 reached similar conclusions of snowmelt dominance as they did not find a warm season precipitation isotope signal in their river transect ranging from permafrost free to continuous permafrost our data indicate a contrasting situation in the wsl where a depleted river signal from snowmelt is not obvious figs 5 and 8 a likely explanation is that there is a high mixing volume in lakes wetlands and soils in the wsl to absorb and substantially mix the pulse of depleted snowmelt runoff before it reaches the streams furthermore the river isotope composition is leaning towards being more enriched suggesting snowmelt primarily displaces precipitation inputs from the previous summer and or evaporated waters fig 3 similar isotope based work by yi et al 2010 and gibson et al 2016 also suggests large wetland influence in the runoff generation in the athabasca and mckenzie rivers systems in canada the long term monitoring by arctic gro fig s1 generally supports this showing a gradual depletion of the ob isotopic composition over the winter similar to the one seen in fig 7 winter 2012 2013 in fig s1 shows the clearest example having the most data points during the entire 10 years of arctic gro isotope data a sudden depletion during after snowmelt occurred only in 2015 according to long term monitoring by russian hydrological survey at the ob river middle course spring of 2015 experienced an anomalously high flood with a return period of 20 40 years however from our data depletion from snowmelt was not substantial in 2015 fig 5 when the data were grouped according to seasons and watersheds fig 8a we observed that the median in δ18o is remarkably similar for winter baseflow and spring snowmelt in both watersheds with strong and weak permafrost influence contrasts in topography and permafrost extent provide potential explanations for the different snowmelt depletion in the wsl compared to other large scale isotope studies in high latitude catchments the transect of lachniet et al 2016 in alaska had greater topographic variability steeper slopes are prone to promote surface flow from snowmelt runoff woo 1986 the kolyma watershed studied by welp et al 2005 is completely underlain by permafrost which is also likely to lead to more marked less mixed snowmelt runoff compared to lower permafrost influence carey and quinton 2004 streletskiy et al 2015 nonetheless zhou et al 2015 used isotopes for hydrograph separation at the shule river basin 14104 km2 at the tibetian plateau a mountainous watershed with 80 permafrost coverage and found a strong groundwater dominance 4 3 water sources in the wsl inferred from temporal and spatial variability in isotopes stable water isotope techniques have revolutionised the understanding of how water is stored and released in the environment kendall and mcdonnell 1998 most geographic and climatic regions from headwaters to continental watershed scales exhibit damping of the isotope signal from precipitation to streamflow confirming substantial storage and mixing of water in the runoff generation process mcguire et al 2005 jasechko et al 2016 in comparison to temperate regions where most isotope work has been done work in snow influenced areas has shown the important presence of snowmelt water in streams by typically reporting depleted steam isotope composition during snowmelt taylor et al 2002 tetzlaff et al 2015b frozen soil seasonal and permafrost intuitively promotes the rapid routing of snowmelt in the landscape by blocking infiltration carey and quinton 2004 woo et al 2008 but firm conclusions on this has been difficult to establish on catchment scales with isotope data carey and quinton 2004 lindström et al 2002 song et al 2017 the multi year isotope sampling in the wsl allowed us to develop an integrated conceptual model of the dominant runoff generation processes during all main hydrological seasons winter spring snowmelt summer and to hypothesise likely transient hydrological connections in this vast lowland area influenced by permafrost fig 9 previous large scale hydrological work focused on the wsl has been successful in isolating volumetric contributions of snowmelt groundwater summer rainfall and evaporation and finding relationships with seasonal water balance components and climatic variables novikov et al 2009 serreze et al 2002 yang et al 2004 ye et al 2004 zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 zakharova et al 2014 however it has not been possible to assess the dynamics of hydrological connectivity and storage in the wsl which is crucial to better understand and link hydrological and biogeochemical processes this is because the release of c and other elements from high latitude landscapes is intimately controlled by the interactions between temperature soil thaw and permafrost melt see section 4 4 below previous work in the wsl and similar wetland influenced high latitude watersheds suggests great potential for the landscape to mix and store high volumes of snowmelt water which we hypothesise to cause the modest isotopic depletion during snowmelt work in the wsl by zakharova et al 2011 used hydrometric data and remote sensing estimates of spatially distributed snow cover concluding that on average 30 of snowmelt water was retained in the lakes and wetlands during the year of melt further zakharova et al 2014 quantified that the permafrost free area of wsl has a wetland storage variation 1 5 2 5 times the annual runoff with a lower storage capacity of 0 5 times annual runoff in the permafrost zone smith et al 2012 used peat soil core analysis and gis data to reach similar water storage estimates of 3 times the ob annual runoff in the wsl peatlands when the smith et al 2012 estimate of 2000 mm water storage in watershed averaged water equivalent is compared with the typical snow water equivalent 200 250 mm of in the northern wls zakharova et al 2011 there is clearly sufficient storage capacity for snowmelt mixing assuming that this storage is available the onset of snowmelt common understanding is that this storage would be frozen during snowmelt particularly so in permafrost affected regions but our isotope data suggests that in fact a substantial fraction of the surface storage is available to mix the isotopically depleted snowmelt signal other isotope work in boreal catchments has shown that wetlands acts as isostats tetzlaff et al 2014 where the water storage in the wetlands mixes and damped diverse temporally variable source waters to set the river isotope compositions lessels et al 2016 this has been quantitatively supported by subsequent isotope based modelling studies soulsby et al 2015 in northern alaska bowling et al 2003 found that 25 50 of annual snowmelt was needed to fill the storage deficit caused by evaporation in the previous year substantial isotopic mixing of snowmelt in lake wetland dominated systems was also documented in the mackenzie basin canada where hayashi et al 2004 used isotopes and hydrometric measurements to show how lake wetland complexes hydrologically connect to streams during snowmelt and how 50 of the stream water during snowmelt originated from water stored in lakes and wetlands over winter these percentages generally point to volumes of snowmelt that does not contribute to runoff in the short term i e water either stored or evaporated during the snowmelt period our data suggest that the landscape in the wsl is not only a sink for the snowmelt water but has great capacity to mix water in lakes and wetlands before it reaches the streams surface hydrological connections between streams lakes and wetlands in permafrost landscapes are established and disconnected dynamically and quickly after rainfall and or snowmelt bowling et al 2003 hayashi et al 2004 quinton and roulet 1998 smith and alsdorf 1998 used remote sensing sar data to show how 90 of the lakes in the river ob floodplain near salekhard were up to 90 hydrologically connected to the river at the peak of snowmelt with a rapid decline in connectivity as the flows subsided analysis in zakharova et al 2014 showed how the maximum wetted area in catchments in the wsl typically reaches 80 in the spring after snowmelt and subsequently recedes to fractions between 80 and 20 throughout the growing season depending on the hydrological regime in our study lakes and soils typically had an enriched isotope signal and a distinctly negative d excess we therefore hypothesise that rivers showing signs of low d excess values are hydrologically connected to lakes and or wetlands lachniet et al 2016 streletskiy et al 2015 indeed we found a low d excess values in the streams in all seasons and across latitudes fig 8b suggesting an active ongoing hydrological connection in several rivers from evaporated water residing in lakes the dynamic surface connection and low d excess values after rainfall events in our data was evident in the high frequency monitoring of the ob at nikolskoe fig 7 the low d excess values occurring with the elevated δ18o during autumn rainfall events nov dec 2015 suggested evaporated water sourcing the stream this is more likely to originate from water displaced from the landscape than the incoming rainfall similarly yi et al 2012 observed an enriched isotope signal at the ob outlet during normal summer flows and attributed this to mixture of groundwater summer precipitation and water stored in the wetlands sourcing the summer flows in the ob we even saw low d excess values in some of the rivers immediately after snowmelt fig 6 suggesting snowmelt mixing with and displacing water stored in the lakes and soils over winter as shown by hayashi et al 2004 using water isotopes in a similar landscape mckenzie basin in northern canada in addition to the dynamic activation of surficial hydrological connectivity subsurface connections are known to exist in permafrost influenced catchments either in supra permafrost active layer or deeper sub permafrost groundwater flow and taliks woo 1986 and their importance is expected to increase with thawing permafrost frampton and destouni 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 our data suggests a persistent connection between rivers and the landscape as rivers carry water with an evaporated signal low d excess in all seasons including winter fig 6 fig 8b furthermore the similarity in d excess in the pur taz and ob watersheds suggests a similar degree of connectivity between rives and the landscape in watersheds with weak and strong permafrost influence and also for all seasons which was an unexpected finding fig 8b streletskiy et al 2015 hypothesised similar over winter hydrological connection in the unfrozen active layer in a 320 km2 catchment in discontinuous permafrost in the northern part of the yenisey watershed in siberia where they documented low d excess values in winter baseflow yang et al 2017 found close hydrological connections between river thermokarst lakes and degrading permafrost at the beiluhe basin qinghai tibet plateau using stable water isotopes it should be noted that because of the spatial extent of the sampling campaigns see fig s2 and associated logistical challenges the temporal variability along the transect inevitably remains somewhat uncertain some areas are less intensively sampled which may cause biases in the analysis of spatial and temporal variability therefore our interpretation of the isotopic variability is necessarily preliminary in nature and the patchy nature of the sampling precludes robust statistical testing the different seasons or waterbodies in addition in the absence of rain samples from the events during our monitoring period uncertainty in the source of water with low d excess remains because rainfall can also carry a low d excess signal varying with precipitation moisture sources gat 1996 nevertheless the data set remains useful and an evidence base for the inferences drawn and subsequent hypothesis testing 4 4 wider implications an interesting finding was that both the d excess and δ18o values in rivers peaked around 62 n fig 4 instead of decreasing for d excess or increasing for δ18o linearly towards southern latitudes with higher evaporative potential and enriched precipitation respectively both the gnip precipitation isotope data and kurita et al 2005 suggest that this anomalous variability is not caused by persistent patterns of oceanic moisture sources instead we propose that the increase around 62 n could be caused by an intensified hydrological significance of lakes and wetlands because their abundance is highest around the same latitudes pokrovsky et al 2016 zakharova et al 2014 this hypothesis requires further research examining catchment specific lake and wetland percentages which is beyond the scope of this work influence of climate change in permafrost hydrology has been primarily viewed from the perspective of active layer development and the resulting longer subsurface flow paths leading to longer water residence times walvoord and kurylyk 2016 if the importance of lakes in sourcing stream flow can be shown that would provide further evidence that the changes observed in the lake abundance in the high latitude regions quinton et al 2011 smith et al 2007b caused by climate change are likely to have profound hydrological consequences on stream water sources our study also points towards high storage and mixing volumes in the landscape which increase residence time and would imply a damped and delayed response of rivers to biogeochemical processes such as contamination and accelerated nutrient cycling however with the observed persistent hydrological connectivity between landscape and rivers fig 9 solutes such as doc could be delivered to streams all year round likely with peaks during snowmelt avagyan et al 2016 giesler et al 2014 when the water stored in the landscape is displaced to rivers frey and smith 2005 found that higher peatland percentage increases the doc flux in the wsl but only in permafrost free catchments they propose two explanations for lower doc export from permafrost catchments 1 doc transport is restricted by the permafrost creating a physical barrier to infiltration and hydrological connectivity this confines doc generation and transport to shallow active layer or 2 the doc increases in lower latitudes are driven by higher air temperatures causing elevated doc production our work suggests a hydrological connection between the landscape and rivers in both permafrost conditions so the latter explanation for higher doc export in frey and smith 2005 from permafrost free catchments may be more likely future temperature increases with increased melt in permafrost regions is likely strengthen such connectivity and doc release the potential implications for subsequent degassing of co2 from lakes and rivers and associated ch4 release from wetland areas are beyond the scope of the current study but are important in terms of the global carbon budget cole et al 2007 tracer aided models adjusted to northern snow influenced conditions ala aho et al 2017 fekete et al 2006 smith et al 2016 tetzlaff et al 2015a could utilize long term datasets with good spatial coverage like the one we present in this work to hypothesis development and testing hydrological model development for permafrost areas is a persistent challenge in regions with sparse data and few suitable simulation codes bowling and lettenmaier 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in particular more continuous sampling of rivers has the potential to reveal activation of hydrological connections like in fig 9 and could provide valuable data for hydrological parametrisation and modelling 5 conclusion the unprecedented spatio temporal scale of our stable water isotope sampling in the western siberian lowlands wsl allowed an improved conceptual understanding of dominant runoff generation processes and the hydrological connectivity in this wetland and permafrost influenced landscape our findings suggest significant surface water storage capacity in the wsl is involved in intensive isotopic mixing of snowmelt water and dictates that only a relatively small proportion of the water molecules released from melting snow contributed to rivers flow during the spring based on this and the isotopic evaporation signal low d excess value we hypothesise that the primary runoff generation mechanism in wsl is the displacement of water already stored in the lakes wetlands and soils to rivers as shallow subsurface flow and supra permafrost flow also the isotope evaporation signal suggests that even in snow covered winter baseflow period many rivers in the wsl remain hydrologically connected by drainage from the surrounding lakes and wetlands in the landscape there were some but surprisingly limited evidence of permafrost causing short circuiting of less well mixed snowmelt rapidly to rivers but this permafrost influence in the wsl needs additional research the improved conceptual understanding of the runoff generation and hydrological connectivity gained in this work is important framework that can be tested with modelling and provides insights relevant to future pathways of solute and sediment

7555,climate change is expected to alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes in high latitude inland waters a critical question for understanding contemporary and future responses to environmental change is how the spatio temporal dynamics of runoff generation processes will be affected we sampled stable water isotopes in soils lakes and rivers on an unprecedented spatio temporal scale along a 1700 km transect over three years in the western siberia lowlands our findings suggest that snowmelt mixes with and displaces large volumes of water stored in the organic soils and lakes to generate runoff during the thaw season furthermore we saw a persistent hydrological connection between water bodies and the landscape across permafrost regions our findings help to bridge the understanding between small and large scale hydrological studies in high latitude systems these isotope data provide a means to conceptualise hydrological connectivity in permafrost and wetland influenced regions which is needed for an improved understanding of future biogeochemical changes keywords stable water isotopes hydrological connectivity runoff generation snowmelt low relief 1 introduction high latitude regions are experiencing alarming hydrological changes as a consequence of global climate change ipcc 2014 tetzlaff et al 2013 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 white et al 2007 the future climate is expected to result in a multitude of hydrologically important changes in precipitation patterns and frequencies lenderink and meijgaard 2008 bintanja and selten 2014 water vapour pressure willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 in high latitude regions air temperature is a crucial control for the cryogenic processes that play a key role in their energy and water balances woo et al 2008 wild 2009 recent literature reports accelerating rates of permafrost thaw which is expected to have cascading effects on the high latitude environment river flow regimes and associated biogeochemical interactions frey and mcclelland 2009 giesler et al 2014 lyon et al 2009 of particular importance is the amplified release of organic carbon due to permafrost thaw frey and smith 2005 kuhry et al 2010 lessels et al 2015 o donnell et al 2012 however the hydrological connections that determine carbon mobilization and fluxes in high latitude watersheds remain inadequately understood yi et al 2012 zakharova et al 2014 the hydrology of high latitude areas differs from temperate climates due to the strong influence of permafrost extensive lake and wetland distribution and the transmissive properties of the dominant organic soils bowling et al 2003 carey and quinton 2004 quinton and marsh 1999 woo et al 2008 zakharova et al 2014 thawing permafrost is altering the hydrological regime and overall landscape structure by either increasing the number of lakes in continuous permafrost regions by thermokarst development or decreasing lake number and surface area by accelerated drainage of thermokarst lakes in discontinuous permafrost terrain smith et al 2007b smith et al 2005 deepening the active layer and associated changes in lake and wetland distribution alter landscape scale hydrological connectivity quinton et al 2011 smith et al 2007b zakharova et al 2014 this is expected to result in deeper hydrological flow paths thus increasing water travel times and hydrological connectivity in the north frampton and destouni 2015 karlsson et al 2012 it has been suggested that these changes have resulted in an increased discharge of major rivers draining pan arctic watersheds peterson et al 2002 smith et al 2007a stable water isotopes of hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o provide a useful and increasingly applied tool for integrating hydrological process information across various scales mcdonnell and beven 2014 existing isotope hydrology studies in high latitude areas have been mostly conducted on two contrasting scales one line of isotope work has looked into large scale hydrological responses at the outlets of major pan arctic watersheds 105 106 km2 leading to improved understanding of the main river source water that drain into the arctic ocean cooper et al 2008 welp et al 2005 yi et al 2012 at the other end of the spectrum isotope studies at the hillslope and headwater catchment scale typically 1 100 km2 have substantially increased understanding of detailed hydrological processes contributing to runoff generation for high latitude including permafrost influenced catchments carey and quinton 2004 hayashi et al 2004 song et al 2017 streletskiy et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015b throckmorton et al 2016 there has been some stable water isotope work at the intermediate scale 102 105 km2 between the small and the large scale studies to determine evaporation signals and rates in high latitude lakes gibson 2001 narancic et al 2017 and studying footprints of climatic forcing on river isotope composition lachniet et al 2016 this important work in high latitude environments is from landscapes where topography exerts a major control on hydrology water sources flow paths and drainage structures in low relief watersheds strongly affected by permafrost or lakes wetlands are much less extensively researched zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 particularly at scales that would address intermediate scales and bridge the gap from small experimental catchments to regional and continental scale watersheds jasechko et al 2017 woo et al 2008 yi et al 2012 a major knowledge gap remains as to how small scale runoff generation processes aggregate into a watershed response in high latitude areas we seek to address this research gap the specific objectives of our work are i to map the spatio temporal variability of stable water isotope composition in rivers soils lakes and snow over multiple seasons and years along a 11 latitudinal gradient from the boreal permafrost free south to the northern arctic permafrost dominated environments in western siberia ii understand temporal changes in water sources of the river ob by collecting a high resolution river water isotope time series and iii based on the isotopic signatures we formulate an improved conceptual understanding of the internal drainage structure of this vast wetland and permafrost influenced high latitude region that links small scale process understanding to regional watershed response 2 materials and methods 2 1 study transect in the western siberia lowlands our study area encompasses a 1700 km long transect in the western siberia lowlands wsl encompassing three major high latitude watersheds the ob pur and taz with total watershed areas of 2 972 000 112 000 and 150 000 km2 respectively the transect fig 1 runs primarily northwest in the ob watershed between 56 and 62 n and turns northeast crossing the pur watershed between 63 and 66 3 n and the taz watershed 66 9 67 5 n spanning in total 11 latitude 1200 km from south to north except for the northern part of the pur and the taz the wsl has a moderate continental climate with marked seasonal variability between short summers and long cold winters the mean annual temperature ranges from 0 5 c in the southern parts of the transect gradually decreasing with latitude down to 9 5 c in the north annual precipitation is lowest in the southern areas with 550 mm increases to 650 700 mm around 63 n and reduces to 600 mm at the northern parts rivers sampled in the ob watershed 63 n are on permafrost free areas in the southern region approx 60 n and on isolated 60 62 n and sporadic and discontinuous 62 63 n permafrost in the north brown et al 2002 sampled rivers in the pur watershed 63 n all run on sporadic and discontinuous permafrost and samples taken from the taz 67 n watershed are on continuous permafrost annual runoff increases northward with 160 220 mm a 1 in the southern permafrost free zone to 280 320 mm a 1 in the permafrost affected northern areas the geology of the wsl consist of sedimentary rocks dominated by sandstones and shales ulmishek 2003 overlain by quaternary aeolian and fluvial sand silt and clay deposits ranging from a few meters to 200 250 m in thickness pokrovsky et al 2015 because of the cool air temperatures flat relief and waterlogged conditions the area is dominated by organic peat soils with thickness between 1 and 3 m mantling the mineral sub soils frey et al 2007 peatlands in the wsl are dominated by ombrogenous bogs hydrologically sourced by precipitation fens sourced by precipitation and lateral surface and subsurface groundwater flow and lakes kirpotin et al 2009 in the permafrost zone lakes typically form in response to thermal erosion and permafrost thaw thermokarst whereas in the permafrost free areas peat erosion is the key process of lake formation wetland and lake cover in the wsl can vary from 20 to 80 percent over the year depending on the seasonal hydrological conditions zakharova et al 2014 previous work in the wsl has quantitatively shown their importance in dynamically modulating streamflow response by storing snowmelt and rainfall but more detailed process understanding of their influence on runoff generation is needed zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 the wsl offer a natural laboratory to study large scale lowland hydrology in an area with a spectrum of soil frost and permafrost conditions relatively homogenous geology with sedimentary basement rock minimal orographic influences and uniform annual precipitation pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2014 our hydrological understanding of the wsl needs to be improved because of its profound importance for global carbon nutrient and fresh water delivery to the arctic ocean frey and smith 2005 pokrovsky et al 2015 smith and alsdorf 1998 furthermore among high latitude areas the wsl are especially vulnerable to climate change as much of the area resides in the discontinuous permafrost zone where small increases in temperature can lead to drastic changes in permafrost conditions kirpotin et al 2009 romanovsky et al 2010 2 2 stable water isotope sampling design and protocols river sampling was focused on the main stem and tributaries n 59 of the ob taz and pur rivers along the study transect fig 1 catchment areas of the sampling locations varied between 10 and 7 7 105 km2 median 270 8 km2 rivers were primarily sampled between 2014 and 2015 with three major seasonal campaigns in both years firstly targeting baseflow during the winter snow covered period in february march secondly sampling the snowmelt period between april may and the final one targeting the summer flows in july august because of the large sampling area logistical challenges prevented us from sampling all tributaries in all campaigns the sampled locations for each campaign are shown in the supplementary material fig s2 some additional river samples from different tributaries were collected throughout the intensive monitoring and in the summer of 2016 sampling was achieved by grab sample collection from the middle of the river channel if possible from a bridge or from the river banks from the depth of 0 5 m within the actively flowing river never stagnant water lake sampling was primarily focused in the open water season of 2016 the majority of the samples were collected from four lake clusters representing different permafrost zones fig s2 kogalym 62 3 n kahnymey 63 8 n urengoy 66 0 n and tazovky 67 4 n with the first campaign occurred immediately after snowmelt when the lakes become accessible in may june second in midsummer in august and the final sampling before freeze up in september october fig s2 lake water samples were taken from a boat in the middle of each lake at a depth of 0 5 m thermokarst lakes of wsl are extremely shallow 1 0 0 5 m depth polishchuk et al 2017 and therefore the depth of sampling at the small lakes 1000 m2 area was 0 25 m if water had excess organic matter samples were filtered immediately on site using sterile plastic syringes through single use pre washed acetate cellulose filter units the first 2 ml of filtrate were discarded the soil solutions were sampled in the summer of 2015 primarily from four areas coinciding with the lake sampling in kogalym kahnymey and tazovky and with a more western location at the latitude of urengoy fig s2 the sampling was done with ceramic cup suction lysimeters and from variable depths in the active layer between 20 and 50 cm which was typically 10 cm above the permafrost table soil samples were filtered in the field using sartorius 0 45 µm filters and syringes details of soil solution sampling are given in raudina et al 2017 in addition to our spatially distributed sampling we performed local high frequency sampling of the ob mid reaches at kaibasovo 16 km upstream of the nikolskoe river stage gauging station fig 1 the sampling interval was initially monthly starting in jan 2015 then every two days between 30 oct 2015 24 apr 2016 and every day for snowmelt period 24 april 31 may 2016 sampling was conducted as grab sampling 2 m offshore in an area of free river flow all samples were collected into 3 5 ml glass vials and stored in the dark at 4 6 c until analysis samples were analysed at the university of aberdeen using a los gatos dlt 100 laser isotope analyser with instrument precision 0 4 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o isotope ratios are reported in the δ notation using the vienna standard mean ocean water standards coplen 1994 2 3 secondary data sources to further improve our understanding of the isotope hydrology of the wsl using hydrometeorological data to support our analysis we utilised data from the following additional sources stable water isotopes in precipitation were downloaded from the gnip database iaea wmo 2017 kurita et al 2004 station locations fig 1 data fig 2 the monitoring period of the stations was between 1970 and 2000 varying between stations and the precipitation monitoring did not overlap with our own sampling however the sampling stations envelope our study area in terms of both latitude and longitude therefore providing baseline information of the typical spatial variability and seasonality of precipitation isotope composition in the wsl vasil chuk et al 2016 reported isotopic composition of snow along the same transect as our sampling for february march of 2014 and full details of the sampling are provided therein and by shevchenko et al 2016 we used the data as an additional reference isotopic signature of snow that enters the landscape during snowmelt in 2014 data for the discharge and isotopic composition of the river ob at its outlet salekhard fig 1 was produced by the arctic great rivers observatory arctic gro freely available at the portal www arcticgreatrivers org mcclelland et al 2008 gro provided flow and isotope data in the ob was used to contextualize the hydrological regime during our isotope sampling the discharge at nikolskoe located at the mid reaches of the ob near where high frequency isotope sampling took place was obtained from the russian hydrological service the discharge at nikolskoe where only the water level was measured was calculated using two adjacent gauging stations where the river discharges are measured dubrovino n 55 28 30 24 e 83 16 44 23 243 km upstream of nikolskoe and kolpashevo n 58 18 53 64 e 82 57 00 48 214 km downstream of nikolskoe 2 4 data analysis the data were grouped spatially according to the major watersheds having different permafrost regimes permafrost occurrence is less frequent in the ob compared to the pur and taz pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2009 to visualise and analyse the temporal variability of isotopes in the area we grouped the samples according to the seasonality of the hydrological regime i e winter nov mar with baseflow conditions spring april june with snowmelt influence and summer fall july oct with summer rainfall and evaporation effects zakharova et al 2009 the specific timing of the hydrological regime e g the start of the snowmelt period vary along the transect because of the long distance between the southern and northernmost sampling locations but also between years zakharova et al 2014 this makes the selected time periods somewhat approximate nevertheless the sampling of rivers and lakes targets and generally captures these specific periods we calculated deuterium excess d excess as δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 deuterium excess is associated with kinetic isotopic fractionation processes which are typically indicative of evaporation or condensation when a d excess value equals 10 the sample is located on the global meteoric water line gmwl samples with values 10 plot below the gmwl and signal a deviation from the equilibrium fractionation conditions i e the sampled water has been subjected to evaporation dansgaard 1964 d excess can also reflect different environmental characteristics in precipitation moisture sources gat 1996 we used d excess as additional index to distinguish between evaporated and non evaporated stream water sources 3 results 3 1 spatial variability of isotopes the gnip precipitation data shows strong seasonality with isotopically depleted samples taken during months with cold air temperature fig 2 isotopes in the river samples had slightly higher median 15 3 values only for δ18o are reported values compared to the median of gnip precipitation samples 15 6 but the variability was significantly lower interquartile range iqr 1 7 in rivers 8 5 in precipitation fig 3 comparing rivers lakes and soils lakes showed the most pronounced enrichment of heavy isotopes median 11 1 which was most likely primarily caused by evaporation fractionation but also the influence of more enriched summer precipitation fig 3 soil solutions were also more enriched median 13 0 than rivers but less than lakes snow samples collected by vasil chuk et al 2016 were most depleted more negative in heavy isotopes median 28 8 and plotted outside the typical values of all other samples river soils lakes and thereby provided a potentially good tracer for the snowmelt signal in the landscape the local meteoric water line lmwl i e the regression line of the gnip precipitation samples fig 2 fig 3 had a slope of 7 86 similar to the gmwl with a slope of 8 the slope of the regression line in all water samples was lower than the lmwl fig 3 in the order of soils 4 64 lakes 5 54 rivers 6 08 there was surprisingly consistent limited change in the river isotope ratios along the transect from south to north fig 4 a interestingly instead of a constant linear south north depletion along the transect we found an increased enrichment around the latitude 62 n best highlighted by the locally weighted least squares regression loess of the river samples there seemed to be relatively small latitudinal isotopic differences between lakes and soils typically lakes and soils were more enriched than rivers but isotopic compositions were overlapping at all latitudes as for δ18o in the permafrost influenced latitudes 60 n variability in d excess tended to be higher whereas the samples from lower latitudes were clustering more tightly between 5 and 10 fig 4b there appeared to be decreased levels of d excess high evaporation signal around the latitude 62 n coinciding with the latitude of increased δ18o enrichment lakes had high variability and seasonal differences in d excess at all latitudes in soil waters despite the more limited data set the overall values and variability were similar across the sampled transect 3 2 temporal variability of isotopes contemporaneous data for both river flow and stable water isotopes in the river ob are shown in fig s1 as a reference for the observed long term variability at the river outlet river samples from the transect showed higher temporal variability than the arctic gro monitoring at the ob outlet fig 5 shows arctic gro monthly mean and standard deviation fig s1 presents the full time series the arctic gro data showed a typical annual cycle of depleted winter spring and enriched summer values fig 4 this progressive enrichment of streams in our dataset was best seen in the summer of 2015 perhaps the most striking finding in the temporal dynamics of our sampled river isotopes was the relatively modest depletion of streams during snowmelt when the snowpack with a very depleted negative isotopic signal see winter 2013 in fig 5 melted in early may flow in the river ob outlet was elevated approximately tenfold within less than a month despite the substantial flux of depleted snowmelt water we saw the stream isotope values across the transect changing only slightly in 2014 if at all in 2015 towards more depleted signatures we used deuterium excess to explore signals of evaporation in the landscape and particularly in the sampled rivers fig 6 the volume weighted average of precipitation d excess calculated from the gnip data was 5 2 which is below the d excess of the average global meteoric water 10 in general the d excess median for rivers 7 2 and soils 8 5 plotted above the median of precipitation d excess but importantly there were low d excess values in rivers i e signs of evaporated water plotting below the average regional precipitation value of 5 2 not only in the summer but also during winter and spring in both the ob and pur taz watersheds fig 6 snow showed high d excess values median 11 8 typical for the area kurita et al 2005 lakes had the lowest d excess values median 3 4 with the majority plotting well below the precipitation d excess indicating a strong evaporation signal fig 6 high frequency isotope monitoring in the ob middle reaches at nikolskoe fig 1 showed elevated levels in δ18o and decreased d excess values coinciding with slightly increased flows in nov dec 2015 fig 7 as winter progressed there was a steady decline in δ18o during baseflow from january until march moving gradually from enriched evaporated water and summer precipitation to a more depleted water source likely from the well mixed deeper groundwater the d excess of the river plateaued near the value of 10 i e into a water source with minimal evaporation signal surprisingly at the start of snowmelt in late march there was a relatively minor shift of depletion in δ18o from isotope composition between 15 and 16 to values between 16 and 17 the water in the river during flood stager was not reflecting the isotopic composition of melted snow depleted in δ18o starting late april after the snowmelt the stream isotopes start to gradually turn more enriched with some peaks during high flows see e g start of may the peaks in isotopic enrichment in open water season are typically associated with low d excess values fig 7 3 3 water sources in the wsl inferred from temporal and spatial variability in isotopes when disaggregating the samples according to watersheds and hydrological seasons sites from the more northern pur taz watersheds tended to have more depleted δ18o signatures than the southern reaches of the ob in all seasons and in all water bodies fig 8 a in river samples there was a general isotopic evolution from depleted spring values to enrichment over the summer and a return to a more depleted level in the winter the observation that the spring snowmelt snow being depleted did not lead to substantial isotopic depletion in the streams is also evident in fig 8a as the spring and winter medians were very similar in both watersheds rivers exhibited notably low differences in d excess between seasons and watersheds fig 8b with only minimally decreased levels increased evaporation signal in the summer lakes and soils showed differences in d excess both 1 between watersheds with more clear evaporation signals lower median in d excess values in the ob and 2 between seasons with lowest d excess during summer though seasonality was most clearly evident in the lakes which may also reflect the more temporally extensive sampling 4 discussion 4 1 spatial variability of isotopes the spatial and temporal extent of our stable water isotope dataset is rare even when compared to work in more temperate climates e g jasechko et al 2017 with such a dataset we are in a position to begin to bridge the gap between understanding gained from isotope studies in large pan arctic watershed outlets cooper et al 2008 welp et al 2005 yi et al 2010 yi et al 2012 and smaller scale studies hayashi et al 2004 song et al 2017 streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 to better understand runoff generation and water sources in permafrost influenced lowland areas with extensive lake and wetland coverage in north america lachniet et al 2016 sampled rivers and gibson 2001 lakes at scales similar to ours providing information on isotopic variability in high latitude landscapes however these were confined to shorter monitoring periods and single waterbody type rivers or lakes constraining the development of a more integrated conceptualisation of northern large scale hydrology the expected damped variability of isotopes in rivers compared to precipitation fig 3 indicates mixing of rainfall snowmelt with stored water within the landscape as it traverses the sampled catchments the more enriched median in rivers indicates a preferential sourcing of river water from isotopically heavier summer precipitation fig 2 and or water enriched by evaporation from storage in the landscape rather than winter precipitation in the form of snowmelt the slope of the regression line in all water samples was lower than the lmwl fig 3 in the order of soils lakes rivers which can be interpreted as an evaporation signal in all waterbodies with slope of the lines agreeing with global analysis by gibson et al 2008 the more northern pur taz watersheds were isotopically more depleted compared to the middle reaches of the ob fig 8a this was likely related to the isotopic composition of precipitation which is typically more depleted in northern latitudes due to colder air temperatures even so according to one way analysis of variance test the gnip stations station locations in fig 1 data in fig 2 did not differ in their mean values for precipitations isotopes at the significance level of 0 05 the gnip data even though collected before our study suggests that the isotope variability in precipitation along either north south or east west gradient is not a decisive factor in the isotope variability in the wsl in comparison lachniet et al 2016 reported a 8 3 1000 km south north gradient for rivers in the yukon and alaska the lower south north gradient in the wsl was likely a result of the low elevation with less orographic distillation and major water vapour sources shifting temporally between the atlantic and the pacific oceans reducing the continentality effect in precipitation along the transect kurita et al 2005 the lakes and soil water in the wsl typically had an enriched isotope signal fig 3 but lakes were most clearly distinguished by their low d excess values fig 6 previous work found similar isotopic enrichment of high latitude lakes in north america and used it to estimate evaporation rates from lakes or entire catchments gibson 2001 narancic et al 2017 the wsl has been shown to have anomalously high evaporation rates compared to other high latitude watersheds because of the high percentage of lake and wetland cover and therefore water available for free water evaporation serreze et al 2002 zakharova et al 2014 in further work our dataset will be used to analyse evaporation rates in the very shallow lakes typically 0 5 1 5 m across the wsl at the four sites that were intensively monitored in 2016 our soil sampling focused on summer because the soil is generally frozen from september july and we can therefore say less about the seasonality differences between the frozen and thawed state of soil water isotopes than those of lakes and rivers nevertheless the spatial extent of our soil water sampling in the high latitude environments is unusual as prior work has been looking at soil isotope variability in plot hillslope or small catchment scale carey and quinton 2004 peralta tapia et al 2015 streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 based on the higher intercept of the regression line fig 3 soil water samples appear to be more clearly sourced by enriched summer precipitation than lakes and rivers in july 2015 when soils rivers and lakes were sampled during the same time period the soil isotopes cluster in the same range as the rivers and lakes figs 5 and 6 pointing to a hydrological connection between the three in the wsl as suggested by zakharova et al 2014 typically lakes and soils were more enriched than rivers fig 3 but isotopic compositions were overlapping at all latitudes fig 4 suggesting common sources and connectivity in some of the sampled tributaries as a result of permafrost thaw high latitude watersheds are expected to shift towards more groundwater dominated systems with deeper active layers evans and ge 2017 frampton and destouni 2015 in terms of the isotopic variability in rivers this would be manifested in greater damping due to the lower influence of frozen soils generating overland flow and rapid transmission of a snowmelt isotope signal and greater mixing in the thawed subsurface in our data isotopic variability in spring snowmelt in the taz pur 63 n watersheds with strong permafrost influence is greater than in the ob watershed 63 n fig 8a with weaker permafrost influence which can be interpreted as subtle evidence of permafrost influenced hydrological routing of the depleted snowmelt water to streams more quickly in more northern catchments however the presence of permafrost is difficult to map for large areas walvoord and kurylyk 2016 woo et al 2008 and other categorizations than the primary watershed could have been selected in our study the samples taken south of 60 n would be most likely to be in the permafrost free zone fig 1 if comparing the variability south and north of 60 n fig 4 the rivers in permafrost free areas 60 n do appear to be less variable in both δ18o and d excess and cluster more tightly together higher latitudes more influenced by permafrost 60 n showed more distinct separation between spring winter and summer samples this makes a stronger case for permafrost increasing the isotopic variability than seen in fig 8 which could be inferred as more rapid surface flow component in the northern than the southern parts of the wsl more catchment specific analysis considering attributes such as air temperature relative humidity permafrost coverage lake forest and bog proportion on the watershed as in pokrovsky et al 2015 zakharova et al 2014 is needed to better understand the reasons for spatial isotope variability in the wsl however the additional analysis are beyond the scope of the current this work and will be addressed in our future research 4 2 temporal variability of isotopes both of our datasets the high frequency sampling of the middle ob fig 7 and spatial sampling along the transect fig 5 showed a strikingly modest signal of isotopic depletion in rivers during snowmelt the isotopic snowmelt signal in high latitude rivers varies a clear snowmelt depletion signal 3 is typical in permafrost dominated mountain fed catchments mcnamara et al 1997 streletskiy et al 2015 welp et al 2005 or in snow influenced environments in general taylor et al 2002 in a study encompassing a similar spatial scale to ours welp et al 2005 stable water isotopes were used to calculate that the winter precipitation snowmelt accounts for 60 of flow in the arctic 650 000 km2 watershed of kolyma northeast siberia underlain by continuous permafrost in the yukon and alaska lachniet et al 2016 reached similar conclusions of snowmelt dominance as they did not find a warm season precipitation isotope signal in their river transect ranging from permafrost free to continuous permafrost our data indicate a contrasting situation in the wsl where a depleted river signal from snowmelt is not obvious figs 5 and 8 a likely explanation is that there is a high mixing volume in lakes wetlands and soils in the wsl to absorb and substantially mix the pulse of depleted snowmelt runoff before it reaches the streams furthermore the river isotope composition is leaning towards being more enriched suggesting snowmelt primarily displaces precipitation inputs from the previous summer and or evaporated waters fig 3 similar isotope based work by yi et al 2010 and gibson et al 2016 also suggests large wetland influence in the runoff generation in the athabasca and mckenzie rivers systems in canada the long term monitoring by arctic gro fig s1 generally supports this showing a gradual depletion of the ob isotopic composition over the winter similar to the one seen in fig 7 winter 2012 2013 in fig s1 shows the clearest example having the most data points during the entire 10 years of arctic gro isotope data a sudden depletion during after snowmelt occurred only in 2015 according to long term monitoring by russian hydrological survey at the ob river middle course spring of 2015 experienced an anomalously high flood with a return period of 20 40 years however from our data depletion from snowmelt was not substantial in 2015 fig 5 when the data were grouped according to seasons and watersheds fig 8a we observed that the median in δ18o is remarkably similar for winter baseflow and spring snowmelt in both watersheds with strong and weak permafrost influence contrasts in topography and permafrost extent provide potential explanations for the different snowmelt depletion in the wsl compared to other large scale isotope studies in high latitude catchments the transect of lachniet et al 2016 in alaska had greater topographic variability steeper slopes are prone to promote surface flow from snowmelt runoff woo 1986 the kolyma watershed studied by welp et al 2005 is completely underlain by permafrost which is also likely to lead to more marked less mixed snowmelt runoff compared to lower permafrost influence carey and quinton 2004 streletskiy et al 2015 nonetheless zhou et al 2015 used isotopes for hydrograph separation at the shule river basin 14104 km2 at the tibetian plateau a mountainous watershed with 80 permafrost coverage and found a strong groundwater dominance 4 3 water sources in the wsl inferred from temporal and spatial variability in isotopes stable water isotope techniques have revolutionised the understanding of how water is stored and released in the environment kendall and mcdonnell 1998 most geographic and climatic regions from headwaters to continental watershed scales exhibit damping of the isotope signal from precipitation to streamflow confirming substantial storage and mixing of water in the runoff generation process mcguire et al 2005 jasechko et al 2016 in comparison to temperate regions where most isotope work has been done work in snow influenced areas has shown the important presence of snowmelt water in streams by typically reporting depleted steam isotope composition during snowmelt taylor et al 2002 tetzlaff et al 2015b frozen soil seasonal and permafrost intuitively promotes the rapid routing of snowmelt in the landscape by blocking infiltration carey and quinton 2004 woo et al 2008 but firm conclusions on this has been difficult to establish on catchment scales with isotope data carey and quinton 2004 lindström et al 2002 song et al 2017 the multi year isotope sampling in the wsl allowed us to develop an integrated conceptual model of the dominant runoff generation processes during all main hydrological seasons winter spring snowmelt summer and to hypothesise likely transient hydrological connections in this vast lowland area influenced by permafrost fig 9 previous large scale hydrological work focused on the wsl has been successful in isolating volumetric contributions of snowmelt groundwater summer rainfall and evaporation and finding relationships with seasonal water balance components and climatic variables novikov et al 2009 serreze et al 2002 yang et al 2004 ye et al 2004 zakharova et al 2009 zakharova et al 2011 zakharova et al 2014 however it has not been possible to assess the dynamics of hydrological connectivity and storage in the wsl which is crucial to better understand and link hydrological and biogeochemical processes this is because the release of c and other elements from high latitude landscapes is intimately controlled by the interactions between temperature soil thaw and permafrost melt see section 4 4 below previous work in the wsl and similar wetland influenced high latitude watersheds suggests great potential for the landscape to mix and store high volumes of snowmelt water which we hypothesise to cause the modest isotopic depletion during snowmelt work in the wsl by zakharova et al 2011 used hydrometric data and remote sensing estimates of spatially distributed snow cover concluding that on average 30 of snowmelt water was retained in the lakes and wetlands during the year of melt further zakharova et al 2014 quantified that the permafrost free area of wsl has a wetland storage variation 1 5 2 5 times the annual runoff with a lower storage capacity of 0 5 times annual runoff in the permafrost zone smith et al 2012 used peat soil core analysis and gis data to reach similar water storage estimates of 3 times the ob annual runoff in the wsl peatlands when the smith et al 2012 estimate of 2000 mm water storage in watershed averaged water equivalent is compared with the typical snow water equivalent 200 250 mm of in the northern wls zakharova et al 2011 there is clearly sufficient storage capacity for snowmelt mixing assuming that this storage is available the onset of snowmelt common understanding is that this storage would be frozen during snowmelt particularly so in permafrost affected regions but our isotope data suggests that in fact a substantial fraction of the surface storage is available to mix the isotopically depleted snowmelt signal other isotope work in boreal catchments has shown that wetlands acts as isostats tetzlaff et al 2014 where the water storage in the wetlands mixes and damped diverse temporally variable source waters to set the river isotope compositions lessels et al 2016 this has been quantitatively supported by subsequent isotope based modelling studies soulsby et al 2015 in northern alaska bowling et al 2003 found that 25 50 of annual snowmelt was needed to fill the storage deficit caused by evaporation in the previous year substantial isotopic mixing of snowmelt in lake wetland dominated systems was also documented in the mackenzie basin canada where hayashi et al 2004 used isotopes and hydrometric measurements to show how lake wetland complexes hydrologically connect to streams during snowmelt and how 50 of the stream water during snowmelt originated from water stored in lakes and wetlands over winter these percentages generally point to volumes of snowmelt that does not contribute to runoff in the short term i e water either stored or evaporated during the snowmelt period our data suggest that the landscape in the wsl is not only a sink for the snowmelt water but has great capacity to mix water in lakes and wetlands before it reaches the streams surface hydrological connections between streams lakes and wetlands in permafrost landscapes are established and disconnected dynamically and quickly after rainfall and or snowmelt bowling et al 2003 hayashi et al 2004 quinton and roulet 1998 smith and alsdorf 1998 used remote sensing sar data to show how 90 of the lakes in the river ob floodplain near salekhard were up to 90 hydrologically connected to the river at the peak of snowmelt with a rapid decline in connectivity as the flows subsided analysis in zakharova et al 2014 showed how the maximum wetted area in catchments in the wsl typically reaches 80 in the spring after snowmelt and subsequently recedes to fractions between 80 and 20 throughout the growing season depending on the hydrological regime in our study lakes and soils typically had an enriched isotope signal and a distinctly negative d excess we therefore hypothesise that rivers showing signs of low d excess values are hydrologically connected to lakes and or wetlands lachniet et al 2016 streletskiy et al 2015 indeed we found a low d excess values in the streams in all seasons and across latitudes fig 8b suggesting an active ongoing hydrological connection in several rivers from evaporated water residing in lakes the dynamic surface connection and low d excess values after rainfall events in our data was evident in the high frequency monitoring of the ob at nikolskoe fig 7 the low d excess values occurring with the elevated δ18o during autumn rainfall events nov dec 2015 suggested evaporated water sourcing the stream this is more likely to originate from water displaced from the landscape than the incoming rainfall similarly yi et al 2012 observed an enriched isotope signal at the ob outlet during normal summer flows and attributed this to mixture of groundwater summer precipitation and water stored in the wetlands sourcing the summer flows in the ob we even saw low d excess values in some of the rivers immediately after snowmelt fig 6 suggesting snowmelt mixing with and displacing water stored in the lakes and soils over winter as shown by hayashi et al 2004 using water isotopes in a similar landscape mckenzie basin in northern canada in addition to the dynamic activation of surficial hydrological connectivity subsurface connections are known to exist in permafrost influenced catchments either in supra permafrost active layer or deeper sub permafrost groundwater flow and taliks woo 1986 and their importance is expected to increase with thawing permafrost frampton and destouni 2015 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 our data suggests a persistent connection between rivers and the landscape as rivers carry water with an evaporated signal low d excess in all seasons including winter fig 6 fig 8b furthermore the similarity in d excess in the pur taz and ob watersheds suggests a similar degree of connectivity between rives and the landscape in watersheds with weak and strong permafrost influence and also for all seasons which was an unexpected finding fig 8b streletskiy et al 2015 hypothesised similar over winter hydrological connection in the unfrozen active layer in a 320 km2 catchment in discontinuous permafrost in the northern part of the yenisey watershed in siberia where they documented low d excess values in winter baseflow yang et al 2017 found close hydrological connections between river thermokarst lakes and degrading permafrost at the beiluhe basin qinghai tibet plateau using stable water isotopes it should be noted that because of the spatial extent of the sampling campaigns see fig s2 and associated logistical challenges the temporal variability along the transect inevitably remains somewhat uncertain some areas are less intensively sampled which may cause biases in the analysis of spatial and temporal variability therefore our interpretation of the isotopic variability is necessarily preliminary in nature and the patchy nature of the sampling precludes robust statistical testing the different seasons or waterbodies in addition in the absence of rain samples from the events during our monitoring period uncertainty in the source of water with low d excess remains because rainfall can also carry a low d excess signal varying with precipitation moisture sources gat 1996 nevertheless the data set remains useful and an evidence base for the inferences drawn and subsequent hypothesis testing 4 4 wider implications an interesting finding was that both the d excess and δ18o values in rivers peaked around 62 n fig 4 instead of decreasing for d excess or increasing for δ18o linearly towards southern latitudes with higher evaporative potential and enriched precipitation respectively both the gnip precipitation isotope data and kurita et al 2005 suggest that this anomalous variability is not caused by persistent patterns of oceanic moisture sources instead we propose that the increase around 62 n could be caused by an intensified hydrological significance of lakes and wetlands because their abundance is highest around the same latitudes pokrovsky et al 2016 zakharova et al 2014 this hypothesis requires further research examining catchment specific lake and wetland percentages which is beyond the scope of this work influence of climate change in permafrost hydrology has been primarily viewed from the perspective of active layer development and the resulting longer subsurface flow paths leading to longer water residence times walvoord and kurylyk 2016 if the importance of lakes in sourcing stream flow can be shown that would provide further evidence that the changes observed in the lake abundance in the high latitude regions quinton et al 2011 smith et al 2007b caused by climate change are likely to have profound hydrological consequences on stream water sources our study also points towards high storage and mixing volumes in the landscape which increase residence time and would imply a damped and delayed response of rivers to biogeochemical processes such as contamination and accelerated nutrient cycling however with the observed persistent hydrological connectivity between landscape and rivers fig 9 solutes such as doc could be delivered to streams all year round likely with peaks during snowmelt avagyan et al 2016 giesler et al 2014 when the water stored in the landscape is displaced to rivers frey and smith 2005 found that higher peatland percentage increases the doc flux in the wsl but only in permafrost free catchments they propose two explanations for lower doc export from permafrost catchments 1 doc transport is restricted by the permafrost creating a physical barrier to infiltration and hydrological connectivity this confines doc generation and transport to shallow active layer or 2 the doc increases in lower latitudes are driven by higher air temperatures causing elevated doc production our work suggests a hydrological connection between the landscape and rivers in both permafrost conditions so the latter explanation for higher doc export in frey and smith 2005 from permafrost free catchments may be more likely future temperature increases with increased melt in permafrost regions is likely strengthen such connectivity and doc release the potential implications for subsequent degassing of co2 from lakes and rivers and associated ch4 release from wetland areas are beyond the scope of the current study but are important in terms of the global carbon budget cole et al 2007 tracer aided models adjusted to northern snow influenced conditions ala aho et al 2017 fekete et al 2006 smith et al 2016 tetzlaff et al 2015a could utilize long term datasets with good spatial coverage like the one we present in this work to hypothesis development and testing hydrological model development for permafrost areas is a persistent challenge in regions with sparse data and few suitable simulation codes bowling and lettenmaier 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in particular more continuous sampling of rivers has the potential to reveal activation of hydrological connections like in fig 9 and could provide valuable data for hydrological parametrisation and modelling 5 conclusion the unprecedented spatio temporal scale of our stable water isotope sampling in the western siberian lowlands wsl allowed an improved conceptual understanding of dominant runoff generation processes and the hydrological connectivity in this wetland and permafrost influenced landscape our findings suggest significant surface water storage capacity in the wsl is involved in intensive isotopic mixing of snowmelt water and dictates that only a relatively small proportion of the water molecules released from melting snow contributed to rivers flow during the spring based on this and the isotopic evaporation signal low d excess value we hypothesise that the primary runoff generation mechanism in wsl is the displacement of water already stored in the lakes wetlands and soils to rivers as shallow subsurface flow and supra permafrost flow also the isotope evaporation signal suggests that even in snow covered winter baseflow period many rivers in the wsl remain hydrologically connected by drainage from the surrounding lakes and wetlands in the landscape there were some but surprisingly limited evidence of permafrost causing short circuiting of less well mixed snowmelt rapidly to rivers but this permafrost influence in the wsl needs additional research the improved conceptual understanding of the runoff generation and hydrological connectivity gained in this work is important framework that can be tested with modelling and provides insights relevant to future pathways of solute and sediment

7556,the relationship between climate indices with australian river streamflow asf may provide valuable information for long lead streamflow forecasting for australian rivers the current study examines the correlations between three climate indices sst 500 mb meridional wind u500 and 500 mb geopotential height z500 and 135 unimpaired asf gauges for 1971 2011 using the singular value decomposition svd method first svd method was applied to check the sst asf correlated regions of influence and then extended sst asf variabilities were used to determine the correlated regions within z500 and u500 fields based on the teleconnection the most correlated region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n was identified and its persistency was checked by lag analysis up to 2 years from seasonal to yearly time scale the results displayed positive correlation for the south and south eastern part of australia while negative correlation prevails in the north eastern region at 95 significance level the most correlated region was found situated along the south pacific convergence zone spcz axis which may be considered as a probable climate driver for asf the persistency of this region was checked by a separate climate indicator mean vertical velocity 500 mb and found prominent in dry period than the wet period this persistent teleconnected region may be potentially useful for long lead forecasting of asf keywords climate indices australian streamflow asf singular value decomposition svd teleconnection correlation 1 introduction australia is a vast continent island surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans ocean atmospheric climate drivers are commonly inter related with precipitation and streamflow variabilities of rivers on this mid latitude country cashen 2011 river water plays a significant role in the australian economy particularly within the agricultural sector irrigation sector consumes approximately 65 of the bulk net water resources in australia pia 2017 the other two major users of water are manufacturing industries 23 and household sectors 11 pia 2017 although australians are ranked third radcliffe 2004 in terms of per capita water uses but the paradoxical situation is that most of the people live 80 in coastal towns where the major fresh water resources are insufficient this indicates that australian inland freshwater resources with sufficient quantity are not adequate to meet the increasing water demands when considering the impacts of climate variability abs 2008 again australian rivers have the characteristics of carrying low discharge whittington and liston 2003 with high inter annual flow variability finlayson and mcmahon 1988 simpson et al 1993 puckridge et al 1998 chiew and mcmahon 2002 verdon et al 2004 chiew 2006 dutta et al 2006 poff et al 2006 fiddes and timbal 2016 the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall streamflow is related to global climate pattern the new climate projection indicates that southern mainland australia will experience less rainfall streamflow during winter and spring but tasmania will still have high winter rainfall streamflow csiro 2015 in the same report it is indicated that the trend of natural fluctuations of rainfall streamflow will dominate rest of australia due to climate change until 2030 understanding the effect of climate variability on australian streamflow asf is vital in determining the river flow kalra and ahmad 2009 kalra et al 2013 sagarika et al 2015a sagarika et al 2015b and scaling the recent trends of catchment based flood and drought conditions

on the climate variability can be used to improve the long lead forecasting for seasonal streamflow this will enable the efficient allocation of river water in various competing sub sectors the relationship between climate variables and asf can also be helpful to tackle flood and drought situations in australian river basins hydrologist and climatologist explored numerous climate indices and their teleconnections with continental streamflow tootle and piechota 2006 aziz et al 2010 lamb et al 2011 kalra et al 2014 sagarika et al 2015a sagarika et al 2015b among the known climate indices the el niño southern oscillation enso is the most significant climate index influencing australian seasonal precipitation nicholls et al 1997 chiew et al 1998 meneghini et al 2007 ummenhofer et al 2009 bowman et al 2010 and subsequently streamflow the enso cycle usually starts in april may and ends in march april of the following year following the global enso phenomena it has been observed that australian precipitation tends to have a weaker enso relationship since mid 1970 houghton et al 1996 this time period is characterized mainly by three phases such as el niño warm la niña cold and neutral sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean el niño is associated with less rainfall while la niña enhances rainfall volume verdon et al 2004 enso s impacts on precipitation typically include inland eastern australia southwest part of western australia coastal new south wales and western tasmania grdc 2016a similar to enso the indian ocean dipole iod is another phenomenon functioning in the indian ocean with influence on northern tip and west to south easterly part of australia cai et al 2009a iod cycles normally start from may to june intensified

et al 2011 and impacts precipitation streamflow in asf particularly during the winter spring season ashok et al 2003 meyers et al 2007 positive iod phases are seen when warmer sst is found in the western indian ocean along the coast of madagascar and cooler sst prevails in the southern equatorial region of sumatra coast this pattern suggests less precipitation or a drought situation bom 2017 in most of australia negative iod phases are characterized by warmer ssts in the south eastern equatorial region of indian ocean near australia cooler ssts observed in the western equatorial indian pacific near africa contributing high amounts of precipitation streamflow bom 2017 various studies have identified the relationship between enso and iod phenomena with australian precipitation streamflow condition for example piechota et al 1998 detected a strong link between enso phenomena and 10 eastern australian streamflow gauge stations power et al 1999 discussed rapid changes of enso phenomena which influenced australian precipitation without giving proper outer australian influence reasons ashok et al 2003 analyzed the influence of iod events on australian winter precipitation

relationship during asymmetric enso condition with intense rainfall condition of eastern australia he and guan 2013 found teleconnection between precipitation and multiple climate indices for south australian region in a similar study abbot and marohasy 2014 described concurrent teleconnections between climate indices and rainfall for queensland vance et al 2015 showed indo pacific atmospheric teleconnection with australian rainfall while studying drought condition forootan et al 2016 worked on enso iod influences on precipitation variability over the 13 largest australian river basins for 3 decades 1981 2014 jaffrés et al 2017 described the teleconnection between ocean atmosphere with whole australian weather pattern that is related to continental drought and flood excess rainfall streamflow condition moreover it has also been reported in the fifth assessment report ar5 of intergovernmental panel on climate change ippc that the enso remains the dominant mode of inter annual climate variability in the tropical pacific and affects the global rainfall including australia in the 21st century the warming and cooling mechanism in the west pacific and in the central and eastern equatorial pacific respectively together develop the uniform sst zone and merges with major convergence zones creating the intertropical convergence zone itcz cai et al 2009b these sst variabilities mostly influence drive climatic rainfall streamflow phenomena in australia while australian precipitation variability correlates with various known climate indices for example enso and iod i e sst variation there are likely other teleconnections between climate data fields and asf which are not yet clearly understood other teleconnections such as 500 mb geopotential height z500 and 500 mb zonal wind u500 http www esrl noaa gov may help explaining anomalous seasonal or yearly asf variability the main aspect of using these additional indices is to observe how a major index sst correlates with streamflow and portrays with them previous studies show that geo potential height variabilities are highly correlated with australian rainfall cai et al 2011 2012 pook et al 2013 dong and dai 2015 l

used sst and z500 separately to show their relationship with us river streamflow lamb 2010 observed the combined effect of sst z500 and u500 with colorado river streamflow and identified a most correlated region known as hondo similarly lavers et al 2010 displayed the significant relationship between dyfi river uk streamflow and geopotential height and zonal wind in a very recent study pathak et al 2017 examined the changing teleconnectivity among mountainous snow water equivalent swe runoff of western usa and sst z500 and u500 but there is no study showing such natural connection of these climate indices to asf the combined natural connection of these climate indices sst z500 and u500 with asf may be able to identify a most persistent region that is correlated with asf from seasonal to inter annual scale and thus may provide better long lead streamflow forecasting system for australian rivers in this paper first the sst asf is analyzed using svd method to find the regions of influence next the svd analysis is done with extended sst asf variabilities to find the most correlated regions within z500 and u500 fields the persistency of most correlated regions is further checked by yearly lag and seasonal analysis sagarika et al 2015a explained that the seasonal analysis performed better inter relationships than a whole water year analysis in order to check the annual and seasonal teleconnections svd analyses were further performed for seasonal and yearly data of sst z500 u500 predictor and asf predictand through the lag analysis common persistent region was found which remained consistent from seasonal to inter annual time scale the most persistent region identified in this study may be used as probable climate drivers for long lead streamflow forecasting 2 data 2 1 australian streamflow asf data australian stream asf data was collected from the bureau of meteorology bom in australia the bom maintains a database of asf for a total of 222 high quality unimpaired gauge stations zhang et al 2016 unimpaired stations are those which have no anthropogenic interferences affecting the natural flow e g dams weirs and diversions these gauge stations are important because it records long term uninterrupted climatic memory e g streamflow among 222 unimpaired gauge stations 135 stations were found having continuous asf data for 1971 2011 and were selected for this study out of these 135 gauge stations 24 stations are located in nsw act states 38 in victoria 43 in queensland 7 in tasmania 4 in south australia 9 in northern territory 2 in the north of west australia and 8 in the south of western australia fig 1 as shown in fig 1 all gauge stations are located near the coastal zones of australia this is because that midland of australia is almost desert and barren land where perennial unimpaired stations are rare 2 2 climate data the climate data for the same period 1971 2011 covers the study area of longitudes 30 e to 70 w and latitudes 60 s to 50 n this boundary partial indo pacific ocean is based on the information of bom on australian tropical cyclone track records of over 100 years 1906 2007 tootle and piechota 2006 identified that ocean sst has a significant and consistent relationship with the sea storms cyclones footprints 2 2 1 sea surface temperature sst data the monthly average sst data used in this study

found that the geopotential height hgt field above the northwest australian tropical cyclone tc area has a significant correlation with wintertime climate variability along with tc frequency hgt is also used to observe the phenomenon of blocking in the australian region which affects the persistence of abnormal seasonal climate patterns pook et al 2013 tasambay salazar et al 2015 showed that seasonal enso is highly teleconnected with hgt particularly in the south pacific basin additionally areas within hgt data have been used to improve streamflow forecasting skill grantz et al 2005 2 2 3

indo pacific basin 2 2 4 data processing the climate data used in this study are stored in network common data form or netcdf file format these raw files data were extracted and processed by the open access tool panoply version 4 5 1 which was originally developed by schmunk in 2002 and it is a product of nasa goddard institute for space studies http www giss nasa gov tools panoply this is capable of reading multi dimensional climate data arrays in netcdf format and providing two dimensional data organized into tables this data was then exported to a spreadsheet and standardized based upon the desired timescale prior to standardization the sst data with land mask values 9999 were removed and total sst grid cells came down to 5921 the asf data were processed based on australian water year 1st march to 28th february of the following year the rainfall pattern is different in different places of australia for example northern australia above 20 s experiences rainfall mostly during summer months while southern australia below 20 s experiences rainfall during winter months this rainfall takes a longer time to convert into streamflow due to the vast land scape as well as the presence of fewer water bodies the characteristics of streamflow are mostly assessed in terms of annual time step which means they show non normal distribution typically positively skewed but they are independent and non seasonal dow 2009 the seasonal variation in streamflow is removed by the use of annual series rather than using daily or monthly data 3 methodology this study utilizes the singular value decomposition svd method to identify connections between the various climate variables and asf data fields first svd method was applied for the sst asf relationships and next extended sst asf svd analysis was performed to identify the correlation with z500 and u500 datasets svd method was further applied to check for persistency of most correlated regions using yearly lag and seasonal analysis numerous studies have used svd method to evaluate the relationships between climate indices and hydrological rainfall streamflow variability nakamura 1996 uvo et al 1998 waliser et al 1999 enfield and alfaro 1999 giannini et al 2000 rajagopalan et al 2000 dettinger and diaz 2000 martín et al 2004 shabbar and skinner 2004 tootle and piechota 2006 oikonomou et al 2010 aziz et al 2010 tootle and piechota 2006 identified the relationship between 639 unimpaired streamflow stations of united states and sst of pacific and atlantic in another study tootle et al 2008 identified influential sst regions for rivers in colombia lamb et al 2011 identified a new significant sst region for streamflow in the colorado river basin oubeidillah et al 2012 discovered possible teleconnection regions between the atlantic ocean ssts and adour garonne basin streamflow of france kalra et al 2014 identified teleconnection for 864 continental u s streamflow river stations to pacific and atlantic ocean sagarika et al 2015a investigated for 240 unimpaired us streamflow stations by identifying connections with sst and z500 data they further pointed to significant regions of pacific ocean sst and z500 fields that related to 90 unregulated western u s streamflow stations for 50 years 1960 2010 svd finds covariance between two spatially distributed climate datasets with similar length prohaska 1976 the underlying assumption of svd method is that it reveals about the linear relationship of two given data set which may not be realistic newman and sardeshmukh 1995 studied about this limitation of svd method hu 1997 also suggested that two separate climate data sets singular vectors may provide unreliable physical correlation while creating heterogeneous maps through svd analysis in spite of these limitations svd modes still showed better ability to explain more squared covariance between the two climate fields comparing to other similar statistical techniques such as canonical correlation and combined principal component analysis bretherton et al 1992 wallace et al 1992 the svd eliminates spatial and temporal bias by identifying new regions that were not predetermined but related to asf the sequence of data asf and climate indices input for svd analysis is shown in table 1 within the study period 1971 2011 there exists 13 el niño positive 12 la niña negative and 16 neutral years of enso modes based on the threshold value of 0 5 used by power et al 1999 different enso phases from 1971 to 2011 are shown in fig 2 during this time period a total of 6 and 7 years was identified as positive and negative iod respectively the positive iod years are 1972 1982 1983 1994 1997 and 2006 and the negative iod years include 1974 1981 1989 1992 1996 1998 and 2010 a full description of svd analysis is given in bretherton et al 1992 and strang 1998 the svd code used in this research was adopted from lamb 2011 and modified accordingly similar modification in svd code was also made in other studies tootle et al 2006 soukup et al 2009 aziz et al 2010 in this study the svd model code was written in matlab version 2014a though the detail description of svd method can be found in the above studies a brief description is presented here for the convenience of the reader first the cross covariance matrix was computed between standardized climate t and streamflow s data fields this utilized the physical information of the relationship between two climate fields svd was applied to the covariance matrix which decomposes the cross covariance matrix into three matrices e g orthogonal diagonal eigenvalues orthogonal strang 1998 1 svd ts cover u σ v where u v and σ represent the left and right singular heterogeneous matrices and a non zero diagonal matrix of singular values of the original matrix respectively the diagonal values of σ are used to compute the squared covariance fraction scf for each mode specifically a column of u and v in this study only scf values greater than 10 were considered the scf was calculated by dividing each of diagonal values from the matrix sign as a vector by the sum of all values in diagonal eigenvalues 2 scf s i i 2 i 1 135 s i i 2 in this equation s represents the vector of diagonal eigenvalues the next step is to compute the temporal expansion series by multiplying the first mode of u or v with the original t or s matrix this creates the left temporal expansion series ltes a data vector 3 ltes u t 4 rtes v s finally the ltes is correlated with each grid cell in s and the rtes is correlated with each grid cell in t to compute the heterogeneous correlation uvo et al 1998 rajagopalan et al 2000 the values at 95 significance level were mapped based on pearson r correlation coefficient to display the influential regions of climate drivers and asf for different seasonal time or specified years the same ltes and rtes are also correlated with the u500 and z500 data fields to track the sst asf teleconnection through the atmosphere in fact the scf measures relationship strength of the two climatic fields by providing the total squared covariance that is explained by the svd mode the mode singular values were ordered in ascending format i e 1st mode is always greater than other modes these singular values were then squared and divided by the two variables of climate data points e g sst z500 u500 and asf readings these provide the normalized square covariance nsc wallace et al 1992 bretherton et al 1992 5 c f 2 n s n f where c f 2 is the sum of squares of the singular values ns is the number of climate data sst z500 u500 points and nf is the number of asf stations 1 3 5 similar to scf nsc also identified the comparative measurement of svd decomposition sagarika et al 2015a 4 results in this section the results of correlation between sst z500 and u500 with asf are illustrated the significantly correlated regions are defined which may be considered as the responsive climate indices for seasonal and all year conditions the blue color represents negative correlation while red color shows positive correlation 95 significance level nonsignificant asf stations are represented by black dots 4 1 climate asf yearly analysis the nation wide australian stream gauge showed either positive negative response when they are evaluated with sst anomalies for enso iod phases fig 3 during this study period 1971 2011 there were 5 years 1972 1982 1994 1997 and 2006 with combined positive iod and el nino events and 5 years combined with negative iod and la nina events 1974 1994 1966 1998 and 2006 the yearly analysis was performed to understand the behavior between asf and indo pacific ssts for whole study period without considering the specific climate cycle enso iod as bias free tootle et al 2006 sagarika et al 2015a the heterogeneous correlation maps at 95 significance level r 0 45 for all year 1971 2011 sst analysis are presented in fig 4 for the indo pacific ocean svd explained 56 and 26 of scf for the first mode and the second mode respectively with nsc of 2 32 fig 4 out of a total of 5921 cells 1370 cells were significant for the 1st mode the positively correlated asf stations are seen in the state of act nsw victoria south australia south eastern queensland south of western australia tasmania northern territory and negatively correlated stations are exhibited in north east of queensland state next the extension of sst asf is correlated with z500 and u500 standardized data for yearly analysis fig 4 it is found that significant cells are 1011 and 1918 for z500 and u500 respectively out of 4725 cells the evaluation against z500 and u500 showed a large difference in terms of heterogeneous correlation maps z500 significantly found active mainly in the large mid latitude regions while u500 found active in the equatorial indian ocean and mid of north south pacific ocean it also indicated that the significant regions in each of these maps are related to each other the ssts driving the pressure and the winds which in turn drive the ssts at the yearly lag 0 condition later additional lagged year lag 1 2 years analysis was performed to understand the persistency of the heterogeneous regions for whole year analysis during the simultaneous lagged year analyses it is noticeable that the significant regions decreased in size for z500 and u500 fig 4 as expected the scf value decreased as the lag increases for the 1 year lag scf is 43 1st mode with nsc of 2 01 while for 2 year lag it is 42 1st mode with nsc of 2 16 fig 4 however the svd results of mode 2 and 3 showed insignificant scf values from the lag analysis a defined region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n showed significant amount of covariance with asf over the water year this region is indicated as black dash line in fig 4 the specified region follows most but not all of south pacific convergence zone spcz axis 155 e to 140 w 0 to 30 s van der wiel et al 2016 the spcz a branch of itcz lies diagonally from near the solomon islands to the cook islands and beyond the pacific ocean and having influence by hydro climatic conditions in nearby countries as well as australia by associating with inter decadal pacific oscillation and enso folland et al 2002 the axis of the spcz is defined as a thick yellow line in fig 4 it is also visualized from fig 4 that the persistent region is having a tendency of southward movement during lag year test although correlation trend of asf with climate drivers remain the same the probable movement tendency of the persistent region might be modulated by the el niño and la niña events as similar characteristics was found for spcz by other researchers trenberth 1976 folland et al 2002 widlansky et al 2011 according to climate data http ggweather com enso oni htm there is a moderate to a strong range of la niña events occurred during 1969 1971 the presence of la niña events is evident in fig 4 when lag year analyses were performed for the search of the persistent region 4 2 seasonal teleconnection of asf climate asf seasonal analysis were performed using svd for four seasons summer dec feb autumn march may winter june aug spring sep oct and dry dec may and wet june nov seasons the summary statistics of seasonal svd and heterogeneous correlation maps are shown in table 2 and fig 5 a f respectively for different seasons table 2 presents seasonal scf values in different modes with different lag times results revealed that the scf values of svd mode 1 are more significant than mode 2 or mode 3 the highest scf value 59 for the 1st mode is found for the spring season at lag 0 and the lowest scf value 46 is detected for the summer season at lag 0 the other squared covariances found at lag 0 conditions for autumn winter dry and wet seasons were 51 54 56 and 55 respectively it is interesting to note that although summer scf value 46 was the lowest among the other seasonal scf values at lag 0 conditions but the highest scf values were found for summer season during lag analysis lag 1 and lag 2 at 1st mode i e 57 and 43 respectively similarly the scf values at 1st mode for autumn winter spring dry and wet seasons at lag 1 condition were 43 42 43 40 and 41 respectively likewise the scf values at 1st mode for autumn winter spring dry and wet seasons at lag 2 conditions were 41 40 39 42 and 42 respectively further analyses of significant cell values pearson correlations between ltes and rtes and nsc for seasonal climate variability were performed for first mode only table 2 it was determined from the cell analysis and found that the spring season showing higher number of grids cells 1464 sst cells 1257 z500 cells and 2259 u500 cell at lag 0 meaning the spring season is more correlated with asf as expected the highest nsc value 2 31 found for the spring season at lag 0 condition the other nsc values in svd first mode analysis lag 0 were found 1 93 2 07 2 09 2 14 and 2 16 for summer autumn winter dry and wet seasons respectively table 2 results also exhibit that summer at lag 0 and lag 3 autumn at lag 2 winter at lag 2 and dry at lag 1 seasons contained three scf modes the other predictor periods including lag contained two scf modes predictor periods cases resulted 3 modes of scf that have higher correlation values r 0 5 between ltes rtes compare to 2 modes of predictor periods cases table 2 the seasonal heterogeneous maps first mode were produced and shown in fig 5a f the results revealed significant positive and negative correlations of asf gauges the seasonal asf showed significant positive correlation for the gauges located in the states of nsw act victoria south eastern queensland tasmania south australia northern territory and negative correlation for gauges located in southern west australia the major correlated asf sst z500 u500 clusters were identified in tropical indo pacific southern pacific and the northern indian ocean large positive correlated regions were found near the equatorial belt of indo pacific for both sst asf and z500 at lag 0 conditions in summer fig 5a spring fig 5d and dry season 5e respectively the persistent region black dashed line was found around spcz axis for a lag 1 year and lag 2 year conditions which are similar to the results found in all year analysis 4 1 the other climate drivers such as z500 and u500 are unable to provide any consistent region for summer spring and dry season the results of sst asf correlation analysis for wet period australian winter autumn and wet season with different lags lag 0 1 2 years show that the persistent region segregates and pushes itself towards south and southeast of near equator fig 5b c and f results also revealed that the z500 and u500 are incapable of identifying the persistent region in the lag analysis lag 1 and 2 years it is to note that all the asf gauges show similar positive negative correlation trend with climate indices in the lag analysis except tasmanian gauges this dissimilar nature of correlation in tasmania may be the effect of westerly wind belt that blows around the southern hemisphere between 40 and 50 south which is known as southern annular mode sam grdc 2016b this wind regularly blows over tasmania and have a significant influence on rainfall patterns over this state however the effect of sam was not investigated in this study 4 3 persistency check for black dashed zone in this research a persistent region black dashed 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n was identified which may act as a climate driver for seasonal to yearly asf to confirm the persistency of this region an additional analysis was performed using four 3 months seasonal and two 6 months seasonal periods predictor with mean vertical velocity climate index basically vertical velocity has the capacity to encompass regions of moist convection and rainfall in order to visualize this cloud band movement seasonal mean vertical velocity data 500 millibar was analyzed and extracted online using the website of noaa physical sciences center https www esrl noaa gov psd cgi bin db search dbsearch pl dataset cdc derived ncep reanalysis products pressure level variable omega 28dp dt 29 statistic mean group 0 submit search fig 6 the results show that the persistent region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n for the dry period nov may is comparatively more profound 0 ὣ 0 06 ὣ than the wet period jun nov vincent 1994 reported that the higher frequency negative signal up to 0 06 ὣ is most likely associated with spcz thick yellow line condition which falls into black dashed zone in this study fig 6 this shows that the persistent region black dashed zone may have stronger and extensive relation in summer dry situation comparing to other seasonal variation 5 discussion the locations of 135 unimpaired gauges identify correlative trends and detects long term variability in australian streamflow the result of this study gives an overview of regional streamflow patterns with respect to climate drivers that have been varying due to global climate changes from seasonal to annual time scale in general svd analysis revealed positive correlation trend mostly in the south eastern australia victoria new south wales including australian capital territory south australia tasmania and southeast part of queensland similar patterns also appear in the southwest of western australia in contrast negatively correlated trends are noted in the northern part of northern territory in separate recent studies by zhang et al 2014 and 2016 it was identified that most of the eastern states and southwest of western australia s river streamflow experienced substantial loss due to precipitation diminution since 1950 while northwest of western australia has become wetter over this period these living gauges for streamflow monitoring across australia support the findings of this study showing similar changes in long term streamflow availability for entire study period 1971 2011 the positively correlated gauges agree with the decreasing trend of streamflow patterns while negatively correlated gauges demonstrate wetter north condition again due to the geographic location there are tropical e g baroclinic and extratropical e g barotropic phenomena that response to enso and iod events in australia the impacts of long term trends in tropical sst on australian climate particularly spring and winter precipitation streamflow depend on mean warming frequency and magnitude of enso and iod events cai et al 2011 current research supports this fact when sst z500 is evaluated against asf at lag 0 condition fig 5c and d in fact composite enso iod affects north eastern and southern australian precipitation streamflow as enso normally affects lower latitudes of eastern australia and iod influences higher latitudes western part of australia meyers et al 2007 in the present study svd analyses of sst z500 u500 and seasonal annual asf identified significant ocean atmospheric regions which mostly show climate variations in different enso and iod conditions in a separate study by kirono et al 2010 identified that nino4 region 160 e to 150 w and 5 s and 5 n is one of the best predictors of precipitation streamflow for spring and summer in north east australia spring in eastern australia and spring and autumn in northern australia kirono et al 2010 also identified that the indonesian index ii is the best predictor in northwest australia northwest coast of australia and southwest of australia for summer precipitation streamflow but their study areas covered only three catchments in australia two from nsw moree and wangaratta and one from northern territory darwin thus nino4 and ii may not be used as favorable seasonal climate indices for long lead forecasting for other catchments the results for persistency analyses with lag years lag 1 and 2 years do not show the consistent relationship in ocean atmospheric regions but as a nature of this relationship the identified region and its nearby surroundings show better persistency particularly for sst correlation the z500 shows relatively strong correlation with asf only at the lag 0 condition on the other hand the u500 does not show a strong correlation with asf for long lead forecasting but based on sst correlation it is interesting to note that this persistent region normally exhibits positive correlation with asf as shown in figs 4 5 it is mentioned earlier that the significant portion of this region coincides with spcz as marked by other researchers philander 1985 vincent 1994 matthews et al 1996 folland et al 2002 for summer season the persistent region moved southward on the lag 1 year and diminish at lag 2 years during the svd simulation process fig 5a but a tail band of sst appears at the southeast location of this region similarly autumn time persistent region shows a good positive signal at lag 0 and lag 2 years fig 5b for winter and spring sst correlated persistent region performed relatively well at all lag condition fig 5c d again dry season relationship was found better than the wet season in sst based persistent region fig 5e and f this paper presented mostly sst based persistent region which used spcz as semi vehicle to identify its mechanism in a recent study by salinger et al 2014 identified that the spcz has proven rainfall correlation with australian warm november april season however the current study shows that the persistent region has slightly better scf value 1st mode at the lag 0 condition for the spring season 59 than summer season 57 moreover it is found strongest in the spring season in zero lag time fig 5d the lag sessions lag 1 and 2 years for autumn and wet season show relatively weaker relations than the zero lag time it also shows a tendency of moving towards southeast diagonally fig 5b and f this indicates decreasing sst has an impact on spcz strength van der wiel et al 2016 normally spcz is known for the largest rainfall band in the southern hemisphere http spice legos obs mip fr spcz spcz wshop brief report pdf but the thick cloud band of spcz is not fully followed by the southward trend of the persistent region the convection process of this region produces heating that exists in seasonal variations while they are compared with mean vertical velocity climate index fig 6 basically vertical velocity comparisons support the presence of black dashed region of the current study further an sst time series index was created for the black dashed zone 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n by taking the annual average of the entire cell ssts within that region this sst time series was then correlated to each asf it was found that 107 asf stations showed a positive correlation 0 02 0 37 out of 135 asf stations the negative correlation 0 01 to 0 41 was found mostly in queensland region it is interesting to note that the correlation test shows the positive relationship 80 of asf gauges which is very similar to the svd analysis results for the persistent region however the results presented in this study are based on the limiting factor of continuous data of unimpaired streamflow records up to recent years out of 222 only 135 stations were found having continuous data for the study period which is relatively low in number for australia the absence of continuous unimpaired data is mainly due to the land dynamic characteristics of river catchments for all gauge stations with the available data the current study identified a persistent region black dashed 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n which may be considered as probable climate drivers for asf this identified spatial temporal persistent region e g grid cells fall in this region can be used in the nonparametric forecast model for various long lead forecasting such as seasonal to inter annual streamflow variability the utilisation of such data in skill based nonparametric forecast model has been shown by various researchers piechota et al 2001 soukup et al 2009 oubeidillah et al 2011 the non parametric forecast model produces series of exceedance probability curves at various lag steps which can indicate the likelihood of streamflow volume with equal exceeding probabilities for a certain period this forecasted streamflow volume may be very useful for decision making for water resources managers particularly for planning of dam and reservoir operation and allocating water for multiple sectors 6 conclusions the goal of this paper was to identify the relationship between the climate indices and asf in different seasons and time periods and to identify the most influential climate driving zone for australian rivers the svd method was applied for the correlations between sst and asf further extended sst asf svd analysis was performed for the correlation with z500 and u500 the svd analysis confirmed an existence of a long term correlation between asf and climate indices in a broader spatial scale the svd results initially identified different global oceanic atmospheric regions that influence with seasonal to yearly asf conditions the results also identified the most correlated zone black dashed within the boundary of longitudes 150 e to 105 w and latitudes 35 s to 5 n that partially rides on spcz mechanism which was verified by an independent climate driver such as vertical velocity the identified zone may provide useful information for seasonal streamflow forecasting in australian rivers thus the use of svd integrates inter annual i e enso and iod signals and incorporates all modes of oceanic sst variability results of positive or negative correlation of gauges show significant trend of streamflow variation e g decreasing or increasing this variation of trends in streamflow was also shown by other researchers zhang et al 2014 2016 the implications of these findings may be useful for future water resources management especially when the climate change variability is considered overall the major contributions of this research work are as follows 1 the inclusion of z500 and u500 climate indices along with sst index for analysis of asf variability seasonal to yearly this provides a better indication of the relative capacity of major climate drivers to identify correlated regions 2 analysis of asf trend positive decremented and negative incremented from seasonal to yearly basis for the last four decades 1971 2011 which will be helpful for regional water planning and adaption of future water management policy 3 the strong correlation between ocean atmospheric regions with unimpaired asf gauges was identified and checked for their persistency in seasonal to yearly time scale through lag analysis the mapped correlated regions may deliver additional perception into the physical mechanisms and drivers of asf for future research 4 the identified persistent regions may be used as probable climate drivers for long lead streamflow forecasting for australian rivers it is noted at this stage that some physical mechanisms for sst z500 u500 with asf are not well understood due to unexplained variances therefore the next step may include developing a forecasting approach utilizing the teleconnection between the persistent region and asf trends the new work should consider the hydro climatology of this persistent region for determining the effective basin wise forecasting model for seasonal to yearly runoff acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the scholarship grant australia

z500 and u500 fields based on the teleconnection the most correlated region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n was identified and its persistency was checked by lag analysis up to 2 years from seasonal to yearly time scale the results displayed positive correlation for the south and south eastern part of australia while negative correlation prevails in the north eastern region at 95 significance level the most correlated region was found situated along the south pacific convergence zone spcz axis which may be considered as a probable climate driver for asf the persistency of this region was checked by a separate climate indicator mean vertical velocity 500 mb and found prominent in dry period than the wet period this persistent teleconnected region may be potentially useful for long lead forecasting of asf keywords climate indices australian streamflow asf singular value decomposition svd teleconnection correlation 1 introduction australia is a vast continent island surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans ocean atmospheric climate drivers are commonly inter related with precipitation and streamflow variabilities of rivers on this mid latitude country cashen 2011 river water plays a significant role in the australian economy particularly within the agricultural sector irrigation sector consumes approximately 65 of the bulk net water resources in australia pia 2017 the other two major users of water are manufacturing industries 23 and household sectors 11 pia 2017 although australians are ranked third radcliffe 2004 in terms of per capita water uses but the paradoxical situation is that most of the people live 80 in coastal towns where the major fresh water resources are insufficient this indicates that australian inland freshwater resources with sufficient quantity are not adequate to meet the increasing water demands when considering the impacts of climate variability abs 2008 again australian rivers have the characteristics of carrying low discharge whittington and liston 2003 with high inter annual flow variability finlayson and mcmahon 1988 simpson et al 1993 puckridge et al 1998 chiew and mcmahon 2002 verdon et al 2004 chiew 2006 dutta et al 2006 poff et al 2006 fiddes and timbal 2016 the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall streamflow is related to global climate pattern the new climate projection indicates that southern mainland australia will experience less rainfall streamflow during winter and spring but tasmania will still have high winter rainfall streamflow csiro 2015 in the same report it is indicated that the trend of natural fluctuations of rainfall streamflow will dominate rest of australia due to climate change until 2030 understanding the effect of climate variability on australian streamflow asf is vital in determining the river flow kalra and ahmad 2009 kalra et al 2013 sagarika et al 2015a sagarika et al 2015b and scaling the recent trends of catchment based flood and drought conditions mcvicar and jupp 1998 ishak et al 2010 micevski et al 2006 middelmann fernandes 2010 van dijk et al 2013 ishak et al 2013 for sustainable management of water resources zhang et al 2014 this knowledge on the climate variability can be used to improve the long lead forecasting for seasonal streamflow this will enable the efficient allocation of river water in various competing sub sectors the relationship between climate variables and asf can also be helpful to tackle flood and drought situations in australian river basins hydrologist and climatologist explored numerous climate indices and their teleconnections with continental streamflow tootle and piechota 2006 aziz et al 2010 lamb et al 2011 kalra et al 2014 sagarika et al 2015a sagarika et al 2015b among the known climate indices the el niño southern oscillation enso is the most significant climate index influencing australian seasonal precipitation nicholls et al 1997 chiew et al 1998 meneghini et al 2007 ummenhofer et al 2009 bowman et al 2010 and subsequently streamflow the enso cycle usually starts in april may and ends in march april of the following year following the global enso phenomena it has been observed that australian precipitation tends to have a weaker enso relationship since mid 1970 houghton et al 1996 this time period is characterized mainly by three phases such as el niño warm la niña cold and neutral sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific ocean el niño is associated with less rainfall while la niña enhances rainfall volume verdon et al 2004 enso s impacts on precipitation typically include inland eastern australia southwest part of western australia coastal new south wales and western tasmania grdc 2016a similar to enso the indian ocean dipole iod is another phenomenon functioning in the indian ocean with influence on northern tip and west to south easterly part of australia cai et al 2009a iod cycles normally start from may to june intensified during august october and then rapidly decay bom 2017 it basically contains two distinct effective modes positive and negative cashen 2011 iod normally matures during the australian spring season cai et al 2011 and impacts precipitation streamflow in asf particularly during the winter spring season ashok et al 2003 meyers et al 2007 positive iod phases are seen when warmer sst is found in the western indian ocean along the coast of madagascar and cooler sst prevails in the southern equatorial region of sumatra coast this pattern suggests less precipitation or a drought situation bom 2017 in most of australia negative iod phases are characterized by warmer ssts in the south eastern equatorial region of indian ocean near australia cooler ssts observed in the western equatorial indian pacific near africa contributing high amounts of precipitation streamflow bom 2017 various studies have identified the relationship between enso and iod phenomena with australian precipitation streamflow condition for example piechota et al 1998 detected a strong link between enso phenomena and 10 eastern australian streamflow gauge stations power et al 1999 discussed rapid changes of enso phenomena which influenced australian precipitation without giving proper outer australian influence reasons ashok et al 2003 analyzed the influence of iod events on australian winter precipitation meyers et al 2007 reported on precipitation trends during positive and negative phases of the indo pacific enso iod region cai and cowan 2008 described the relation between south eastern australian precipitations with sst wave trains of extended indian ocean la niña conditions throughout the indonesian sea kirono et al 2010 investigated changing lag relationships between runoff of southwest australia and 12 climate indices cashen 2011 observed the significance of enso iod phases over australia s largest river basin the murray darling taschetto et al 2011 investigated the influence of indian ocean sst on australian summer rainfall during el nino events in a separate study cai et al 2011 diagnosed enso iod impacts on australian precipitation trends king et al 2013 found the relationship during asymmetric enso condition with intense rainfall condition of eastern australia he and guan 2013 found teleconnection between precipitation and multiple climate indices for south australian region in a similar study abbot and marohasy 2014 described concurrent teleconnections between climate indices and rainfall for queensland vance et al 2015 showed indo pacific atmospheric teleconnection with australian rainfall while studying drought condition forootan et al 2016 worked on enso iod influences on precipitation variability over the 13 largest australian river basins for 3 decades 1981 2014 jaffrés et al 2017 described the teleconnection between ocean atmosphere with whole australian weather pattern that is related to continental drought and flood excess rainfall streamflow condition moreover it has also been reported in the fifth assessment report ar5 of intergovernmental panel on climate change ippc that the enso remains the dominant mode of inter annual climate variability in the tropical pacific and affects the global rainfall including australia in the 21st century the warming and cooling mechanism in the west pacific and in the central and eastern equatorial pacific respectively together develop the uniform sst zone and merges with major convergence zones creating the intertropical convergence zone itcz cai et al 2009b these sst variabilities mostly influence drive climatic rainfall streamflow phenomena in australia while australian precipitation variability correlates with various known climate indices for example enso and iod i e sst variation there are likely other teleconnections between climate data fields and asf which are not yet clearly understood other teleconnections such as 500 mb geopotential height z500 and 500 mb zonal wind u500 http www esrl noaa gov may help explaining anomalous seasonal or yearly asf variability the main aspect of using these additional indices is to observe how a major index sst correlates with streamflow and portrays with them previous studies show that geo potential height variabilities are highly correlated with australian rainfall cai et al 2011 2012 pook et al 2013 dong and dai 2015 l heureux et al 2016 and global precipitation sagarika et al 2015a similarly zonal wind related to meridional wind over indian ocean is responsible for tropical rainfall shaman and tziperman 2007 as part of northern australia falls near tropical zone teleconnection of zonal wind u500 may be important with asf including sst however kalra et al 2014 and sagarika et al 2015a sagarika et al 2015b used sst and z500 separately to show their relationship with us river streamflow lamb 2010 observed the combined effect of sst z500 and u500 with colorado river streamflow and identified a most correlated region known as hondo similarly lavers et al 2010 displayed the significant relationship between dyfi river uk streamflow and geopotential height and zonal wind in a very recent study pathak et al 2017 examined the changing teleconnectivity among mountainous snow water equivalent swe runoff of western usa and sst z500 and u500 but there is no study showing such natural connection of these climate indices to asf the combined natural connection of these climate indices sst z500 and u500 with asf may be able to identify a most persistent region that is correlated with asf from seasonal to inter annual scale and thus may provide better long lead streamflow forecasting system for australian rivers in this paper first the sst asf is analyzed using svd method to find the regions of influence next the svd analysis is done with extended sst asf variabilities to find the most correlated regions within z500 and u500 fields the persistency of most correlated regions is further checked by yearly lag and seasonal analysis sagarika et al 2015a explained that the seasonal analysis performed better inter relationships than a whole water year analysis in order to check the annual and seasonal teleconnections svd analyses were further performed for seasonal and yearly data of sst z500 u500 predictor and asf predictand through the lag analysis common persistent region was found which remained consistent from seasonal to inter annual time scale the most persistent region identified in this study may be used as probable climate drivers for long lead streamflow forecasting 2 data 2 1 australian streamflow asf data australian stream asf data was collected from the bureau of meteorology bom in australia the bom maintains a database of asf for a total of 222 high quality unimpaired gauge stations zhang et al 2016 unimpaired stations are those which have no anthropogenic interferences affecting the natural flow e g dams weirs and diversions these gauge stations are important because it records long term uninterrupted climatic memory e g streamflow among 222 unimpaired gauge stations 135 stations were found having continuous asf data for 1971 2011 and were selected for this study out of these 135 gauge stations 24 stations are located in nsw act states 38 in victoria 43 in queensland 7 in tasmania 4 in south australia 9 in northern territory 2 in the north of west australia and 8 in the south of western australia fig 1 as shown in fig 1 all gauge stations are located near the coastal zones of australia this is because that midland of australia is almost desert and barren land where perennial unimpaired stations are rare 2 2 climate data the climate data for the same period 1971 2011 covers the study area of longitudes 30 e to 70 w and latitudes 60 s to 50 n this boundary partial indo pacific ocean is based on the information of bom on australian tropical cyclone track records of over 100 years 1906 2007 tootle and piechota 2006 identified that ocean sst has a significant and consistent relationship with the sea storms cyclones footprints 2 2 1 sea surface temperature sst data the monthly average sst data used in this study

found that the geopotential height hgt field above the northwest australian tropical cyclone tc area has a significant correlation with wintertime climate variability along with tc frequency hgt is also used to observe the phenomenon of blocking in the australian region which affects the persistence of abnormal seasonal climate patterns pook et al 2013 tasambay salazar et al 2015 showed that seasonal enso is highly teleconnected with hgt particularly in the south pacific basin additionally areas within hgt data have been used to improve streamflow forecasting skill grantz et al 2005 2 2 3

location of the jet stream yang et al 2002 these studies demonstrated that both hgt and uwnd having a high level of teleconnections during seasonal monsoon precipitation in the tropical regions of indo pacific basin 2 2 4 data processing the climate data used in this study are stored in network common data form or netcdf file format these raw files data were extracted and processed by the open access tool panoply version 4 5 1 which was originally developed by schmunk in 2002 and it is a product of nasa goddard institute for space studies http www giss nasa gov tools panoply this is capable of reading multi dimensional climate data arrays in netcdf format and providing two dimensional data organized into tables this data was then exported to a spreadsheet and standardized based upon the desired timescale prior to standardization the sst data with land mask values 9999 were removed and total sst grid cells came down to 5921 the asf data were processed based on australian water year 1st march to 28th february of the following year the rainfall pattern is different in different places of australia for example northern australia above 20 s experiences rainfall mostly during summer months while southern australia below 20 s experiences rainfall during winter months this rainfall takes a longer time to convert into streamflow due to the vast land scape as well as the presence of fewer water bodies the characteristics of streamflow are mostly assessed in terms of annual time step which means they show non normal distribution typically positively skewed but they are independent and non seasonal dow 2009 the seasonal variation in streamflow is removed by the use of annual series rather than using daily or monthly data 3 methodology this study utilizes the singular value decomposition svd method to identify connections between the various climate variables and asf data fields first svd method was applied for the sst asf relationships and next extended sst asf svd analysis was performed to identify the correlation with z500 and u500 datasets svd method was further applied to check for persistency of most correlated regions using yearly lag and seasonal analysis numerous studies have used svd method to evaluate the relationships between climate indices and hydrological rainfall streamflow variability nakamura 1996 uvo et al 1998 waliser et al 1999 enfield and alfaro 1999 giannini et al 2000 rajagopalan et al 2000 dettinger and diaz 2000 martín et al 2004 shabbar and skinner 2004 tootle and piechota 2006 oikonomou et al 2010 aziz et al 2010 tootle and piechota 2006 identified the relationship between 639 unimpaired streamflow stations of united states and sst of pacific and atlantic in another study tootle et al 2008 identified influential sst regions for rivers in colombia lamb et al 2011 identified a new significant sst region for streamflow in the colorado river basin oubeidillah et al 2012 discovered possible teleconnection regions between the atlantic ocean ssts and adour garonne basin streamflow of france kalra et al 2014 identified teleconnection for 864 continental u s streamflow river stations to pacific and atlantic ocean sagarika et al 2015a investigated for 240 unimpaired us streamflow stations by identifying connections with sst and z500 data they further pointed to significant regions of pacific ocean sst and z500 fields that related to 90 unregulated western u s streamflow stations for 50 years 1960 2010 svd finds covariance between two spatially distributed climate datasets with similar length prohaska 1976 the underlying assumption of svd method is that it reveals about the linear relationship of two given data set which may not be realistic newman and sardeshmukh 1995 studied about this limitation of svd method hu 1997 also suggested that two separate climate data sets singular vectors may provide unreliable physical correlation while creating heterogeneous maps through svd analysis in spite of these limitations svd modes still showed better ability to explain more squared covariance between the two climate fields comparing to other similar statistical techniques such as canonical correlation and combined principal component analysis bretherton et al 1992 wallace et al 1992 the svd eliminates spatial and temporal bias by identifying new regions that were not predetermined but related to asf the sequence of data asf and climate indices input for svd analysis is shown in table 1 within the study period 1971 2011 there exists 13 el niño positive 12 la niña negative and 16 neutral years of enso modes based on the threshold value of 0 5 used by power et al 1999 different enso phases from 1971 to 2011 are shown in fig 2 during this time period a total of 6 and 7 years was identified as positive and negative iod respectively the positive iod years are 1972 1982 1983 1994 1997 and 2006 and the negative iod years include 1974 1981 1989 1992 1996 1998 and 2010 a full description of svd analysis is given in bretherton et al 1992 and strang 1998 the svd code used in this research was adopted from lamb 2011 and modified accordingly similar modification in svd code was also made in other studies tootle et al 2006 soukup et al 2009 aziz et al 2010 in this study the svd model code was written in matlab version 2014a though the detail description of svd method can be found in the above studies a brief description is presented here for the convenience of the reader first the cross covariance matrix was computed between standardized climate t and streamflow s data fields this utilized the physical information of the relationship between two climate fields svd was applied to the covariance matrix which decomposes the cross covariance matrix into three matrices e g orthogonal diagonal eigenvalues orthogonal strang 1998 1 svd ts cover u σ v where u v and σ represent the left and right singular heterogeneous matrices and a non zero diagonal matrix of singular values of the original matrix respectively the diagonal values of σ are used to compute the squared covariance fraction scf for each mode specifically a column of u and v in this study only scf values greater than 10 were considered the scf was calculated by dividing each of diagonal values from the matrix sign as a vector by the sum of all values in diagonal eigenvalues 2 scf s i i 2 i 1 135 s i i 2 in this equation s represents the vector of diagonal eigenvalues the next step is to compute the temporal expansion series by multiplying the first mode of u or v with the original t or s matrix this creates the left temporal expansion series ltes a data vector 3 ltes u t 4 rtes v s finally the ltes is correlated with each grid cell in s and the rtes is correlated with each grid cell in t to compute the heterogeneous correlation uvo et al 1998 rajagopalan et al 2000 the values at 95 significance level were mapped based on pearson r correlation coefficient to display the influential regions of climate drivers and asf for different seasonal time or specified years the same ltes and rtes are also correlated with the u500 and z500 data fields to track the sst asf teleconnection through the atmosphere in fact the scf measures relationship strength of the two climatic fields by providing the total squared covariance that is explained by the svd mode the mode singular values were ordered in ascending format i e 1st mode is always greater than other modes these singular values were then squared and divided by the two variables of climate data points e g sst z500 u500 and asf readings these provide the normalized square covariance nsc wallace et al 1992 bretherton et al 1992 5 c f 2 n s n f where c f 2 is the sum of squares of the singular values ns is the number of climate data sst z500 u500 points and nf is the number of asf stations 1 3 5 similar to scf nsc also identified the comparative measurement of svd decomposition sagarika et al 2015a 4 results in this section the results of correlation between sst z500 and u500 with asf are illustrated the significantly correlated regions are defined which may be considered as the responsive climate indices for seasonal and all year conditions the blue color represents negative correlation while red color shows positive correlation 95 significance level nonsignificant asf stations are represented by black dots 4 1 climate asf yearly analysis the nation wide australian stream gauge showed either positive negative response when they are evaluated with sst anomalies for enso iod phases fig 3 during this study period 1971 2011 there were 5 years 1972 1982 1994 1997 and 2006 with combined positive iod and el nino events and 5 years combined with negative iod and la nina events 1974 1994 1966 1998 and 2006 the yearly analysis was performed to understand the behavior between asf and indo pacific ssts for whole study period without considering the specific climate cycle enso iod as bias free tootle et al 2006 sagarika et al 2015a the heterogeneous correlation maps at 95 significance level r 0 45 for all year 1971 2011 sst analysis are presented in fig 4 for the indo pacific ocean svd explained 56 and 26 of scf for the first mode and the second mode respectively with nsc of 2 32 fig 4 out of a total of 5921 cells 1370 cells were significant for the 1st mode the positively correlated asf stations are seen in the state of act nsw victoria south australia south eastern queensland south of western australia tasmania northern territory and negatively correlated stations are exhibited in north east of queensland state next the extension of sst asf is correlated with z500 and u500 standardized data for yearly analysis fig 4 it is found that significant cells are 1011 and 1918 for z500 and u500 respectively out of 4725 cells the evaluation against z500 and u500 showed a large difference in terms of heterogeneous correlation maps z500 significantly found active mainly in the large mid latitude regions while u500 found active in the equatorial indian ocean and mid of north south pacific ocean it also indicated that the significant regions in each of these maps are related to each other the ssts driving the pressure and the winds which in turn drive the ssts at the yearly lag 0 condition later additional lagged year lag 1 2 years analysis was performed to understand the persistency of the heterogeneous regions for whole year analysis during the simultaneous lagged year analyses it is noticeable that the significant regions decreased in size for z500 and u500 fig 4 as expected the scf value decreased as the lag increases for the 1 year lag scf is 43 1st mode with nsc of 2 01 while for 2 year lag it is 42 1st mode with nsc of 2 16 fig 4 however the svd results of mode 2 and 3 showed insignificant scf values from the lag analysis a defined region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n showed significant amount of covariance with asf over the water year this region is indicated as black dash line in fig 4 the specified region follows most but not all of south pacific convergence zone spcz axis 155 e to 140 w 0 to 30 s van der wiel et al 2016 the spcz a branch of itcz lies diagonally from near the solomon islands to the cook islands and beyond the pacific ocean and having influence by hydro climatic conditions in nearby countries as well as australia by associating with inter decadal pacific oscillation and enso folland et al 2002 the axis of the spcz is defined as a thick yellow line in fig 4 it is also visualized from fig 4 that the persistent region is having a tendency of southward movement during lag year test although correlation trend of asf with climate drivers remain the same the probable movement tendency of the persistent region might be modulated by the el niño and la niña events as similar characteristics was found for spcz by other researchers trenberth 1976 folland et al 2002 widlansky et al 2011 according to climate data http ggweather com enso oni htm there is a moderate to a strong range of la niña events occurred during 1969 1971 the presence of la niña events is evident in fig 4 when lag year analyses were performed for the search of the persistent region 4 2 seasonal teleconnection of asf climate asf seasonal analysis were performed using svd for four seasons summer dec feb autumn march may winter june aug spring sep oct and dry dec may and wet june nov seasons the summary statistics of seasonal svd and heterogeneous correlation maps are shown in table 2 and fig 5 a f respectively for different seasons table 2 presents seasonal scf values in different modes with different lag times results revealed that the scf values of svd mode 1 are more significant than mode 2 or mode 3 the highest scf value 59 for the 1st mode is found for the spring season at lag 0 and the lowest scf value 46 is detected for the summer season at lag 0 the other squared covariances found at lag 0 conditions for autumn winter dry and wet seasons were 51 54 56 and 55 respectively it is interesting to note that although summer scf value 46 was the lowest among the other seasonal scf values at lag 0 conditions but the highest scf values were found for summer season during lag analysis lag 1 and lag 2 at 1st mode i e 57 and 43 respectively similarly the scf values at 1st mode for autumn winter spring dry and wet seasons at lag 1 condition were 43 42 43 40 and 41 respectively likewise the scf values at 1st mode for autumn winter spring dry and wet seasons at lag 2 conditions were 41 40 39 42 and 42 respectively further analyses of significant cell values pearson correlations between ltes and rtes and nsc for seasonal climate variability were performed for first mode only table 2 it was determined from the cell analysis and found that the spring season showing higher number of grids cells 1464 sst cells 1257 z500 cells and 2259 u500 cell at lag 0 meaning the spring season is more correlated with asf as expected the highest nsc value 2 31 found for the spring season at lag 0 condition the other nsc values in svd first mode analysis lag 0 were found 1 93 2 07 2 09 2 14 and 2 16 for summer autumn winter dry and wet seasons respectively table 2 results also exhibit that summer at lag 0 and lag 3 autumn at lag 2 winter at lag 2 and dry at lag 1 seasons contained three scf modes the other predictor periods including lag contained two scf modes predictor periods cases resulted 3 modes of scf that have higher correlation values r 0 5 between ltes rtes compare to 2 modes of predictor periods cases table 2 the seasonal heterogeneous maps first mode were produced and shown in fig 5a f the results revealed significant positive and negative correlations of asf gauges the seasonal asf showed significant positive correlation for the gauges located in the states of nsw act victoria south eastern queensland tasmania south australia northern territory and negative correlation for gauges located in southern west australia the major correlated asf sst z500 u500 clusters were identified in tropical indo pacific southern pacific and the northern indian ocean large positive correlated regions were found near the equatorial belt of indo pacific for both sst asf and z500 at lag 0 conditions in summer fig 5a spring fig 5d and dry season 5e respectively the persistent region black dashed line was found around spcz axis for a lag 1 year and lag 2 year conditions which are similar to the results found in all year analysis 4 1 the other climate drivers such as z500 and u500 are unable to provide any consistent region for summer spring and dry season the results of sst asf correlation analysis for wet period australian winter autumn and wet season with different lags lag 0 1 2 years show that the persistent region segregates and pushes itself towards south and southeast of near equator fig 5b c and f results also revealed that the z500 and u500 are incapable of identifying the persistent region in the lag analysis lag 1 and 2 years it is to note that all the asf gauges show similar positive negative correlation trend with climate indices in the lag analysis except tasmanian gauges this dissimilar nature of correlation in tasmania may be the effect of westerly wind belt that blows around the southern hemisphere between 40 and 50 south which is known as southern annular mode sam grdc 2016b this wind regularly blows over tasmania and have a significant influence on rainfall patterns over this state however the effect of sam was not investigated in this study 4 3 persistency check for black dashed zone in this research a persistent region black dashed 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n was identified which may act as a climate driver for seasonal to yearly asf to confirm the persistency of this region an additional analysis was performed using four 3 months seasonal and two 6 months seasonal periods predictor with mean vertical velocity climate index basically vertical velocity has the capacity to encompass regions of moist convection and rainfall in order to visualize this cloud band movement seasonal mean vertical velocity data 500 millibar was analyzed and extracted online using the website of noaa physical sciences center https www esrl noaa gov psd cgi bin db search dbsearch pl dataset cdc derived ncep reanalysis products pressure level variable omega 28dp dt 29 statistic mean group 0 submit search fig 6 the results show that the persistent region 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n for the dry period nov may is comparatively more profound 0 ὣ 0 06 ὣ than the wet period jun nov vincent 1994 reported that the higher frequency negative signal up to 0 06 ὣ is most likely associated with spcz thick yellow line condition which falls into black dashed zone in this study fig 6 this shows that the persistent region black dashed zone may have stronger and extensive relation in summer dry situation comparing to other seasonal variation 5 discussion the locations of 135 unimpaired gauges identify correlative trends and detects long term variability in australian streamflow the result of this study gives an overview of regional streamflow patterns with respect to climate drivers that have been varying due to global climate changes from seasonal to annual time scale in general svd analysis revealed positive correlation trend mostly in the south eastern australia victoria new south wales including australian capital territory south australia tasmania and southeast part of queensland similar patterns also appear in the southwest of western australia in contrast negatively correlated trends are noted in the northern part of northern territory in separate recent studies by zhang et al 2014 and 2016 it was identified that most of the eastern states and southwest of western australia s river streamflow experienced substantial loss due to precipitation diminution since 1950 while northwest of western australia has become wetter over this period these living gauges for streamflow monitoring across australia support the findings of this study showing similar changes in long term streamflow availability for entire study period 1971 2011 the positively correlated gauges agree with the decreasing trend of streamflow patterns while negatively correlated gauges demonstrate wetter north condition again due to the geographic location there are tropical e g baroclinic and extratropical e g barotropic phenomena that response to enso and iod events in australia the impacts of long term trends in tropical sst on australian climate particularly spring and winter precipitation streamflow depend on mean warming frequency and magnitude of enso and iod events cai et al 2011 current research supports this fact when sst z500 is evaluated against asf at lag 0 condition fig 5c and d in fact composite enso iod affects north eastern and southern australian precipitation streamflow as enso normally affects lower latitudes of eastern australia and iod influences higher latitudes western part of australia meyers et al 2007 in the present study svd analyses of sst z500 u500 and seasonal annual asf identified significant ocean atmospheric regions which mostly show climate variations in different enso and iod conditions in a separate study by kirono et al 2010 identified that nino4 region 160 e to 150 w and 5 s and 5 n is one of the best predictors of precipitation streamflow for spring and summer in north east australia spring in eastern australia and spring and autumn in northern australia kirono et al 2010 also identified that the indonesian index ii is the best predictor in northwest australia northwest coast of australia and southwest of australia for summer precipitation streamflow but their study areas covered only three catchments in australia two from nsw moree and wangaratta and one from northern territory darwin thus nino4 and ii may not be used as favorable seasonal climate indices for long lead forecasting for other catchments the results for persistency analyses with lag years lag 1 and 2 years do not show the consistent relationship in ocean atmospheric regions but as a nature of this relationship the identified region and its nearby surroundings show better persistency particularly for sst correlation the z500 shows relatively strong correlation with asf only at the lag 0 condition on the other hand the u500 does not show a strong correlation with asf for long lead forecasting but based on sst correlation it is interesting to note that this persistent region normally exhibits positive correlation with asf as shown in figs 4 5 it is mentioned earlier that the significant portion of this region coincides with spcz as marked by other researchers philander 1985 vincent 1994 matthews et al 1996 folland et al 2002 for summer season the persistent region moved southward on the lag 1 year and diminish at lag 2 years during the svd simulation process fig 5a but a tail band of sst appears at the southeast location of this region similarly autumn time persistent region shows a good positive signal at lag 0 and lag 2 years fig 5b for winter and spring sst correlated persistent region performed relatively well at all lag condition fig 5c d again dry season relationship was found better than the wet season in sst based persistent region fig 5e and f this paper presented mostly sst based persistent region which used spcz as semi vehicle to identify its mechanism in a recent study by salinger et al 2014 identified that the spcz has proven rainfall correlation with australian warm november april season however the current study shows that the persistent region has slightly better scf value 1st mode at the lag 0 condition for the spring season 59 than summer season 57 moreover it is found strongest in the spring season in zero lag time fig 5d the lag sessions lag 1 and 2 years for autumn and wet season show relatively weaker relations than the zero lag time it also shows a tendency of moving towards southeast diagonally fig 5b and f this indicates decreasing sst has an impact on spcz strength van der wiel et al 2016 normally spcz is known for the largest rainfall band in the southern hemisphere http spice legos obs mip fr spcz spcz wshop brief report pdf but the thick cloud band of spcz is not fully followed by the southward trend of the persistent region the convection process of this region produces heating that exists in seasonal variations while they are compared with mean vertical velocity climate index fig 6 basically vertical velocity comparisons support the presence of black dashed region of the current study further an sst time series index was created for the black dashed zone 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n by taking the annual average of the entire cell ssts within that region this sst time series was then correlated to each asf it was found that 107 asf stations showed a positive correlation 0 02 0 37 out of 135 asf stations the negative correlation 0 01 to 0 41 was found mostly in queensland region it is interesting to note that the correlation test shows the positive relationship 80 of asf gauges which is very similar to the svd analysis results for the persistent region however the results presented in this study are based on the limiting factor of continuous data of unimpaired streamflow records up to recent years out of 222 only 135 stations were found having continuous data for the study period which is relatively low in number for australia the absence of continuous unimpaired data is mainly due to the land dynamic characteristics of river catchments for all gauge stations with the available data the current study identified a persistent region black dashed 150 e to 105 w and 35 s to 5 n which may be considered as probable climate drivers for asf this identified spatial temporal persistent region e g grid cells fall in this region can be used in the nonparametric forecast model for various long lead forecasting such as seasonal to inter annual streamflow variability the utilisation of such data in skill based nonparametric forecast model has been shown by various researchers piechota et al 2001 soukup et al 2009 oubeidillah et al 2011 the non parametric forecast model produces series of exceedance probability curves at various lag steps which can indicate the likelihood of streamflow volume with equal exceeding probabilities for a certain period this forecasted streamflow volume may be very useful for decision making for water resources managers particularly for planning of dam and reservoir operation and allocating water for multiple sectors 6 conclusions the goal of this paper was to identify the relationship between the climate indices and asf in different seasons and time periods and to identify the most influential climate driving zone for australian rivers the svd method was applied for the correlations between sst and asf further extended sst asf svd analysis was performed for the correlation with z500 and u500 the svd analysis confirmed an existence of a long term correlation between asf and climate indices in a broader spatial scale the svd results initially identified different global oceanic atmospheric regions that influence with seasonal to yearly asf conditions the results also identified the most correlated zone black dashed within the boundary of longitudes 150 e to 105 w and latitudes 35 s to 5 n that partially rides on spcz mechanism which was verified by an independent climate driver such as vertical velocity the identified zone may provide useful information for seasonal streamflow forecasting in australian rivers thus the use of svd integrates inter annual i e enso and iod signals and incorporates all modes of oceanic sst variability results of positive or negative correlation of gauges show significant trend of streamflow variation e g decreasing or increasing this variation of trends in streamflow was also shown by other researchers zhang et al 2014 2016 the implications of these findings may be useful for future water resources management especially when the climate change variability is considered overall the major contributions of this research work are as follows 1 the inclusion of z500 and u500 climate indices along with sst index for analysis of asf variability seasonal to yearly this provides a better indication of the relative capacity of major climate drivers to identify correlated regions 2 analysis of asf trend positive decremented and negative incremented from seasonal to yearly basis for the last four decades 1971 2011 which will be helpful for regional water planning and adaption of future water management policy 3 the strong correlation between ocean atmospheric regions with unimpaired asf gauges was identified and checked for their persistency in seasonal to yearly time scale through lag analysis the mapped correlated regions may deliver additional perception into the physical mechanisms and drivers of asf for future research 4 the identified persistent regions may be used as probable climate drivers for long lead streamflow forecasting for australian rivers it is noted at this stage that some physical mechanisms for sst z500 u500 with asf are not well understood due to unexplained variances therefore the next step may include developing a forecasting approach utilizing the teleconnection between the persistent region and asf trends the new work should consider the hydro climatology of this persistent region for determining the effective basin wise forecasting model for seasonal to yearly runoff acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the scholarship grant australia

7557,although past work has noted that contrasts in turbidity often are detectable on remotely sensed images of rivers downstream from confluences no systematic methodology has been developed for assessing mixing over distance of confluent flows with differing surficial suspended sediment concentrations sssc in contrast to field measurements of mixing below confluences satellite remote sensing can provide detailed information on spatial distributions of sssc over long distances this paper presents a methodology that uses remote sensing data to estimate spatial patterns of sssc downstream of confluences along large rivers and to determine changes in the amount of mixing over distance from confluences the method develops a calibrated random forest rf model by relating training sssc data from river gaging stations to derived spectral indices for the pixels corresponding to gaging station locations the calibrated model is then used to predict sssc values for every river pixel in a remotely sensed image which provides the basis for mapping of spatial variability in ssscs along the river the pixel data are used to estimate average surficial values of sssc at cross sections spaced uniformly along the river based on the cross section data a mixing metric is computed for each cross section the spatial pattern of change in this metric over distance can be used to define rates and length scales of surficial mixing of suspended sediment downstream of a confluence this type of information is useful for exploring the potential influence of various controlling factors on mixing downstream of confluences for evaluating how mixing in a river system varies over time and space and for determining how these variations influence water quality and ecological conditions along the river keywords landsat water quality confluence remote sensing suspended sediment mixing 1 introduction the transport of suspended sediment and associated nutrients or contaminants within river systems plays an important role in watershed processes these material fluxes influence water quality habitat conditions biogeochemical cycles and channel morphodynamics beschta et al 1987 doxaran et al 2009 2002a the transport of suspended sediment within large river systems traditionally has been evaluated by obtaining measurements of sediment concentrations at gaging stations edwards and glysson 1999 this approach while useful does not permit evaluations of spatial variability in suspended sediment concentrations within a river system such variability is often pronounced especially at and downstream of river confluences confluences are important sites for mixing within river systems at these locations flows with potentially different physical and chemical properties converge and begin to mix within and downstream of a confluence a mixing interface defined by an abrupt lateral contrast in turbidity conductivity or temperature gaudet and roy 1995 konsoer and rhoads 2013 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 typically exists between the two confluent flows this interface is visible at the surface if the two flows have a pronounced contrast in turbidity the mixing interface can either dissipate over a short distance downstream of the confluence if the two flows mix rapidly lane et al 2008 or persist for long distances downstream of the confluence if the two flows mix slowly bouchez et al 2010 mackay 1970 the efficacy of transverse mixing processes largely determines the quality of water downstream of a confluence mixing of suspended sediment downstream of confluences has not been extensively studied past work investigating this issue in small streams has relied on manual collection of samples using a depth integrated sampler kenworthy and rhoads 1995 such an approach is time consuming and only suitable for wadeable streams in large rivers suspended sediment concentrations are typically measured using heavy reel mounted samplers deployed from a bridge cableway or boat diplas et al 2008 edwards and glysson 1999 access to confluences is limited particularly when measurements are obtained from bridges as is most often the case more recently acoustic methods have been used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations in rivers guerrero et al 2016 szupiany et al 2012 all such methods perform well for determining the distribution of suspended sediments within individual cross sections at a particular time however the capacity of such methods to characterize spatial and temporal variations of suspended sediment concentrations over long distances is limited patterns of mixing downstream of confluences can occur over varying lengths from a few channel widths to lengths as long as several hundred channel widths depending on different controlling factors to characterize these patterns new methods are needed that can provide detailed information on the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentrations at large temporal and spatial scales such observations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of mixing downstream of confluences in large river systems an alternative method for evaluating water quality conditions at and downstream of confluences is to use remote sensing techniques satellite remote sensing with synoptic coverage and data availability over several decades provides an ideal platform with which to study processes at large spatial and temporal scales the estimation of surficial suspended sediment concentrations ssscs from remotely sensed imagery can be realized through an empirical approach that relates water quality parameters directly to spectral properties using various empirical modeling techniques many studies have linked turbidity and ssscs in lakes or estuaries to spectral indices cox et al 1998 dekker et al 2002 duan et al 2009 hellweger et al 2004 kallio et al 2008 kloiber et al 2002 lathrop 1992 lavery et al 1993 odermatt et al 2012 olmanson et al 2008 pattiaratchi et al 1994 wu et al 2015 2008 zhang et al 2014 however past studies are limited to specific ranges of ssscs found within a specific water body which may not work well for rivers where concentrations can vary substantially both spatially and temporally numerous studies have used remote sensing to explore ssscs in inland rivers using sensors ranging from relatively high spatial resolution e g landsat with 30 m aranuvachapun and walling 1988 doxaran et al 2002b herrault et al 2016 lymburner et al 2016 mertes et al 1993 montanher et al 2014 onderka and pekárová 2008 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 to relatively coarse resolution e g modis with 250 1000 m spatial resolution espinoza villar et al 2013 2012 gomez et al 1995 kilham and roberts 2011 mangiarotti et al 2013 miller and mckee 2004 park and latrubesse 2015 shi and wang 2009 son and wang 2012 because of its high radiometric resolution modis imagery is generally preferred for examing sssc in big rivers like the amazon however the use of these data to examine transverse mixing in large rivers less than a few kilometers wide is limited because the river width is covered by only a few pixels and individual pixels extend laterally across large percentages of the total river width mertes and magadzire 2007 ssscs in rivers can be detected at relatively high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution using multispectral sensors matthews 2011 but the challenge is to develop a model that can estimate sssc equally well over a wide range of concentrations the goal of this paper is to present a method based on multispectral remote sensing imagery for characterizing in detail spatial patterns of ssscs in large rivers and to illustrate how the method can be used to assess surficial lateral mixing of suspended sediment at and downstream of large river confluences the method yields a wealth of information on length scales and rates of surficial mixing in large river systems allowing spatial variation in mixing to be examined at an unprecedented level of detail thereby improving our understanding of this important water quality process 2 study area to develop the methodology for analyzing mixing at and downstream of large river confluences using remote sensing a reach beginning at the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers and extending 110 km downstream was selected for analysis fig 1 the watershed of the mississippi river basin upstream of the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers drains an area of about 1 800 000 km2 with the drainage area of the mississippi river equal to 500 000 km2 and the drainage area of the missouri river equal to 1 300 000 km2 although the missouri river has a substantially larger drainage area than the mississippi river its mean annual discharge at the confluence is substantially less than that of the upper mississippi river however the mean annual depth averaged suspended sediment concentration dssc of the missouri river 395 mg l is over twice as large as that of the mississippi river 140 mg l table 1 both the mississippi and missouri rivers have been subjected to extensive anthropogenic modifications over the past 150 years for purposes of flood control and commercial navigation alterations include but are not limited to impoundments construction of levees deepening of the channel and construction of lock and dams these modifications along with major changes in conservation practices in the watersheds of these rivers have generally produced declines in the suspended sediment loads of the mississippi and missouri rivers since 1950 heimann et al 2011 3 methodology the methodology for examining mixing downstream of river confluences involves development of an empirical model for predicting sssc of each river pixel in a remotely sensed image and development of a model for spatially averaging the sssc data based on geographical and geometrical characterization of the river channel fig 2 sssc modeling focuses on the use of satellite imagery and random forest rf analysis to develop an empirical model for predicting ssscs from spectral information spatial averaging focuses on spatial representation of the river system along the path of the river for the purpose of determining spatial variation in ssscs over discrete segments of the river system the combination of these two methodological components leads to estimates of an index of mixing which can be mapped over the entire reach of the river downstream of the confluence 3 1 development of an empirical model of sssc 3 1 1 image data landsat 5 thematic mapper tm imagery of the study reach collected between 1985 and 2011 were used as input data for development of a model to estimate values of sssc landsat 5 was selected because of its extensive historical availability a spatial resolution conducive to mapping spatial variation in sssc in large rivers 30 m ground sample distance and sufficient availability of imagery to develop an empirical model relating sssc to spectral information over a multidecadal timescale matthews 2011 the imagery was calibrated to surface reflectance using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system masek et al 2013 only 100 cloud free imagery was used in model development to avoid effects of cloud cover resulting in a dataset of 143 images over 26 years 3 1 2 discharge and suspended sediment data data on discharge and dssc in the mississippi river and missouri river were obtained from u s geological survey river gaging stations located within the study reach fig 1 the discharge data provide information on the relative strength of the flows at the confluence and the suspended sediment data are required to calibrate and test the predictive model of sssc using spectral data from satellite imagery daily discharge data are available for mississippi river at grafton il upstream of the confluence and at st louis mo downstream of the confluence for the period 1985 2011 the st charles station usgs station 06935965 fig 1 on the missouri river started collecting discharge data in 2000 usgs stations that provide data on dssc are categorized as either daily or periodic stations defined by the frequency and number of samples collected the data collection procedures follow methods described by edwards glysson 1999 for daily stations vertical samples are collected once each day at a single location single location data are adjusted on the basis of multi vertical samples collected less frequently at 5 10 additional locations across the channel using either equal discharge increment edi or equal width increment ewi method edwards and glysson 1988 final computations of dssc are performed using the method described by porterfield 1977 because the multispectral scanner only can sense differences in reflectance on the surface of the river whereas the sediment data reported by the usgs represent depth averaged values an implicit assumption of the analysis is that depth averaged values of suspended sediment concentration dssc provide reasonably accurate information on the variations in suspended sediment concentrations at the surface sssc that are detected by the scanner stations on mississippi river upstream grafton il and downstream st louis mo of the confluence are daily stations where sufficient discharge and dssc data are collected to produce reliable daily dssc values daily data at the st louis station are available for the entire period of analysis whereas suspended sediment data were collected at the mississippi river station 05587450 from 1989 to 2011 dssc data are also available for the missouri river station at st charles 06935965 for three years beginning in october 2005 table 2 3 1 3 channel edge and centerline edges of water of the river digitized for each image in arcgis provided the basis for masking the images so that only pixels consisting entirely of water were included in boundary delineation of the river pixels that included land or a mixture of water and channel banks were excluded from the analysis using the right and left edges of water a centerline along the river downstream of the missouri mississippi confluence was created with planform statistics tool developed by national center for earth surface dynamics nced in university of minnesota https repository nced umn edu browser php current keyword keyword 5 dataset id 15 the tool uses edges of water to establish evenly spaced river centerline points at user defined intervals centerline vertex locations were saved as text file as well as an esri shapefile a matlab program pcs curvature developed by güneralp and rhoads 2007 was used to fit piecewise cubic splines pcs to the centerline points to provide a continuous representation of the channel centerline this program can also determine the coordinates of endpoints of cross sections oriented orthogonal to the channel centerline at user specified intervals in this study orthogonal cross sections were established at a spacing of one half 500 m the average river width 1000 m beginning at the confluence of the missouri and mississippi rivers and extending 110 km to the downstream end of the study reach this spacing provided sufficient detail for examining how mixing varies over the length of the river and also corresponds to the recommended spacing for digitization of river centerlines 3 1 4 modeling sssc in this study sssc was modeled as a function of the non thermal landsat bands and spectral indices using a random forest rf regression model liaw and wiener 2002 rf a machine learning algorithm is relatively insensitive to noise and outliers and is effective at predicting responses for relationships that may be nonlinear or contain interaction effects breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 a training and testing database was constructed by identifying the pixels for each of the 143 landsat images that correspond to the locations of the three usgs stations with sssc data if sediment data were available for all three gaging stations for the complete set of 143 images a dataset of n 429 would have existed for model development and calibration because sediment data were not available for all three stations for all images the total number of cases for model development and calibration was n 271 for each image acquisition date the usgs gaging station dssc measurement for the same date if available was determined and reflectance values for different spectral bands of the pixel at the position of the gaging station were linked to the dssc measurement in addition to the reflectance values the dssc measurement was also related to a set of indices that have been found to be useful in predicting sssc table 3 a rf model was developed by randomly selecting half of the dataset n 136 as training data the resulting model consisted of 8000 trees using a mtry value of 5 which controls the number of variables available for splitting at each tree node the model was developed in r using the raster package for working with raster datasets the spatial tools package for parallel raster processing and the randomforest package for modeling jonathan 2014 liaw and wiener 2002 robert 2016 the model was tested by applying it to the remaining half of the dataset n 135 and calculating the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae pearson s r and percent bias of predicted versus observed values both the training and test datasets had similar statistical characteristics the mean sssc of the training dataset was 219 mg l with a range of 19 mg l 1700 mg l whereas the mean sssc of the test dataset was 213 mg l with a range of 34 mg l 1270 mg l 3 2 spatial averaging of ssscs and quantification of mixing 3 2 1 spatial representation of river cross sections quantification of mixing from the model predicted sssc rasters involved several steps aimed at generating spatially distributed data that can be used to compute spatially averaged values of ssscs downstream of the confluence fig 2 masking of the image data limited the extent of the analysis to the water pixels within the river channel on all images the extracted raster pixel values were stored for further analysis the river centerline and transects orthogonal to this centerline provided the basis for transforming the geographic coordinates of each pixel latitude longitude to an s streamwise and n cross stream coordinate system a common frame of reference for meandering rivers legleiter and kyriakidis 2007 the centroids of all pixels within the river were assigned s coordinates based on arc length longitudinal distance from the upstream junction corner s 0 along the channel centerline s coordinate and n coordinates based on the distance along transects orthogonal to the channel centerline n coordinate fig 3 the centerline has an n coordinate of zero values of n to the right of the channel centerline looking downstream are positive whereas values of n to the left of the centerline are negative this coordinate transformation was achieved by calculating the euclidean distance from a pixel to the centerline which becomes the n coordinate of the pixel 3 2 2 spatial averaging of sssc spatial averaging is performed to reduce noise in sssc values produced by spatial variations in spectral properties on the river surface associated with local variations in the turbidity of turbulent flow at the time the image was acquired the area of the river within the study reach was divided into 500 m long segments based on s coordinate values such that a representative cross section rcs lies at the center of each segment fig 3 for example if an rcs has an s value of 500 m the segment domain includes all locations with s values between 250 m and 750 m this rcs is established to capture the mean characteristics of ssscs within the entire 500 m long segment each 500 m segment region was divided into 10 subsegments each with a length of 50 m in the s direction for each image date all sssc pixels within this subsegment were extracted the n coordinates of each pixel within the subsegments were normalized to the width of the rcs 1 n n pixel s n value width of rcs local width of 50 m subsegment thus if the width of the rcs and a subsegment are the same the normalized and absolute n values of a pixels are identical however where the width of the river is not constant over the 500 m block the normalized and absolute n values differ this normalization was performed to accommodate changes in width within a segment so that pixels near the bank in a subsegment project onto a position near the banks on the rcs to determine the appropriate lateral position of each pixel projected onto the rcs the rcs was divided laterally into evenly spaced 30 m bins all pixels within the 500 m segment with standardized n coordinates that lie within a particular 30 m bin along the rcs were then determined fig 3 the mean of the predicted sssc values for all of these pixels was computed and the average value was assigned to that particular bin along the rcs this process was completed for all 500 m segments within the 110 km study reach the spatial averaging procedure produced cross sections spaced at 500 m intervals containing mean values of ssscs at 30 m lateral intervals these mean values represent average concentrations of sssc along the cross sections as derived from sssc values for all individual pixels within 500 m swaths of the river centered on the cross sections the computation of spatial averages was in a few cases complicated by the local presence of exposed bars or barges within the river channel which produced splits in the path of the flow around these objects the method accommodated these situations by masking the objects from the analysis masking is performed by creating holes in the river boundary polygon such that the width n coordinate of the channel is preserved but the pixels representing bars or barges are not extracted for further processing during spatial averaging these blank areas are excluded from the computation of spatial averages that are projected onto the representative cross section 3 2 3 calculation of mixing metric most established indices of river mixing are not useful for determining the magnitude of mixing downstream of confluences because these indices do not adequately distinguish between mixed and unmixed cases when the initial contrast in tracer values of the confluent flows is low a commonly used index of mixing is rutherford 1994 2 p mr x min x max where p mr is mixing ratio and x min and x max are minimum and maximum values respectively of a tracer within a river cross section an alternative metric yotsukura and cobb 1972 is 3 p m 1 1 2 0 q x x 1 d q q where p m is the percent mixing in a cross section x is the local value of a local quantity of interest x is the cross sectionally averaged value of x and q is the total discharge at the cross section both of these metrics are insensitive to initial differences in magnitudes of x the quantity being mixed between two confluent rivers if two confluent rivers have small initial differences in values of x the values of p mr and p m will be close to one immediately below the confluence even if the two rivers have not mixed at all i e values of x on one side of the mixing interface are consistently different than values of x on the other side of the mixing interface ideally a mixing index for a confluence should be evaluated in relation to the initial contrast in characteristics of x where the flows initially converge to accommodate shortcomings in previous mixing metrics we developed a new model 4 p mx 1 1 n x i x n 1 a x k 1 x 1 1 b x k 2 x 2 a b 1 m x ju x u m where p mx is the percent transverse mixing in a cross section x i is the value of sssc for a pixel in a cross section downstream of the confluence x is the mean value of x at the downstream cross section n is the number of pixels in the downstream cross section x ju is the value of sssc for a pixel in the two cross sections upstream of the confluence one cross section on each confluent river x u is the mean of the pixels for the two cross sections upstream of the confluence and m is the number of pixels in the two cross sections upstream of the confluence the term 1 a x k 1 x 1 1 b x k 2 x 2 a b is the mean initial variability in the upstream tributaries this parameter accommodates the effect of inherent variability in the tracer values at cross sections upstream of the confluence here x 1 and x 2 are the mean values of x k in tributaries 1 and 2 respectively while a and b are total number of pixels in each tributary the value of p mx starts from 0 at the confluence and increases to a maximum value of 1 for fully mixed flow however due to the low radiometric resolution of landsat imagery for water bodies achieving p mx 1 may not be possible thus cross sections with values of p mx 0 95 are considered fully mixed an approach that accords to the standard for complete mixing based on eq 2 rutherford 1994 plots of p mx values over distance along the downstream channel provide information on spatial variations in the rate of mixing using this index spatial patterns and rates of transverse mixing of sssc downstream of the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers were calculated using the rf model and the spatial averaging procedure for three test cases these cases were selected based on differences in incoming flow conditions and spatial patterns of mixing downstream from the confluence on march 30 1998 case 1 both rivers had moderate levels of flow but the discharge q momentum flux m ρqu where ρ is density and u is mean streamwise velocity and sssc in the missouri river exceeded q m and sssc in the mississippi river table 4 on april 24 1991 case 2 q and m were nearly twice as large in the mississippi river as in the missouri river but as on march 30 1998 sssc in the missouri river was nearly three times the value in the mississippi river on september 26th 2001 case 3 flows on both rivers were relatively low although the two rivers have nearly identical discharges the momentum flux ρqu on the missouri river was about four times the value of m on the mississippi river due to the high velocity on the missouri river again the missouri river had a much greater sssc than that of the mississippi river 4 results 4 1 accuracy of the sssc predictions overall the rf model predicts values ofssscs reasonably well in the mississippi and missouri rivers fig 4 the r value of the fitted rf model is 0 84 linear regression analysis between predicted sssc values of the training data used to develop the model and corresponding measured suspended sediment concentrations yields a strong correlation r2 0 95 fig 4a the strong influence of the large number of ssscs 800 mg l on the rf analysis causes the fitted model to underpredict slightly large values of sediment concentration 800 mg l the relation between predicted and observed values of the test data is not as strong as the relation for the training data but is still quite good r2 0 72 this value of r2 is comparable to results r2 0 78 reported in a previous study aimed at predicting ssscs from remotely sensed imagery in freshwater systems olmanson et al 2008 the model underpredicts high values of sssc 500 mg l for the test data with the degree of underprediction somewhat larger than that for the training data the vast majority of the test data are less than 500 mg l 93 and the net bias of prediction for the entire set of test data is only 0 7 for high observed sscs 600 mg l variance of the predicted data increases noticeably a tendency observed with data on ssscs derived from other spaceborne sensors like modis park and latrubesse 2014 for the rf model this effect can partly be attributed to the fact that only 7 of the total observations are greater than 500 mg l and just 2 are greater than 1000 mg l the results of model calibration and testing indicate that the rf model adequately captures the relation between sssc and reflectance but that given the values of root mean square error rmse 115 mg l and mean absolute error mae 68 3 mg l for the test data sssc predictions should be interpreted cautiously when contrasts in ssscs between the two rivers are small 100 mg l the metric incmse which provides a measure of the importance of each variable included in the model shows that the red to green ratio along with the near infrared nir and red bands are the most effective predictors of sssc concentrations table 5 these findings are consistent with previous studies where high correlations 0 8 between predicted and observed data were reported using similar spectral bands and indices table 3 doxaran et al 2003 duan et al 2009 onderka and pekárová 2008 wu et al 2008 4 2 patterns of sssc for three test cases differences in patterns and rates of mixing for the three test cases illustrate the utility of the method for capturing spatial and temporal variations in lateral mixing downstream of confluences in large rivers 4 2 1 case 1 rapid mixing on march 30 1988 the discharges in both rivers were nearly identical but the missouri river with its higher velocities had about three times the momentum of the mississippi river table 4 the sssc of the missouri river was 543 mg l which was more than three times the sssc of the mississippi river 174 mg l the map of contrast in sssc indicates that high initial sssc contrast across the channel at the confluence rapidly diminishes within few channel widths downstream on this date fig 5 a this case represents relatively rapid mixing immediately downstream of the confluence x 0 5 km concentrations on the missouri river and mississippi river sides of the confluence differ dramatically indicating a lack of mixing fig 6 the pronounced gradient in sssc between the two sides of the confluence marks the location of the mixing interface separating the confluent flows the value of pmx at this location 0 08 shows that little to no mixing has occurred relative to conditions upstream of the confluence where by definition pmx 0 the cross sectional plots of reach averaged sssc reveal that the slope of the maximum contrast gradient delimiting the mixing interface remains near the center of the channel nn 0 and rapidly diminishes downstream fig 6 mixing is essentially complete pmx 0 95 27 5 km downstream from the confluence mixing in this case results in a cross sectional average value of sssc that is more similar to that of mississippi river upstream of the confluence than the average concentrations of two rivers upstream of the confluence values of percent mixing for each rcs depict the evolution of mixing downstream of the confluence fig 7 mixing increases rapidly over the first 6 km in a linear fashion until reaching a peak and then subsequently declines locally this peak corresponds to a section of the river where the channel is relatively wide compared to other locations downstream of the confluence fig 7 at this location the mixing interface remains near the same absolute location with respect to the left bank of the river as upstream and downstream but shifts location in position relative to the channel centerline nn due to local widening of the channel thus the number of pixels on the right missouri side of the mixing interface increases relative to the number of pixels on the left mississippi side resulting in an apparent increase in mixing i e the contrast in sssc relative to conditions upstream of the confluence decreases because the percentage of pixels corresponding to flow on the missouri river side of the mi increases although this apparent increase in mixing could be accommodated by weighting the contribution of each pixel to the p mx value by the proportion of the total discharge this pixel represents such an approach would require information on the distribution of the discharge across each rcs p mx values decrease over the next 4 km as the channel narrows back to its width upstream of the widened section leading to an apparent unmixing in the plot downstream from a distance of 10 km mixing again increases linearly but at a lower rate than immediately downstream of the confluence 4 2 2 case 2 slow mixing on april 24th 1991 the total discharge at the confluence was relatively large but the discharge of the mississippi river was more than two times the discharge of the missouri river resulting in relatively low discharge and momentum ratios table 4 despite having a higher discharge than the missouri river the mississippi river was far less turbid with a sssc value of 300 mg l about one third of the sssc of the missouri river 1010 mg l as can be seen from the map of ssscs fig 5 flows from each river remain clearly separated immediately downstream from the confluence eventually mixing much farther downstream this case represents relatively slow mixing notable in this case is the cross channel contrast in sssc on the mississippi river upstream of the mississippi river missouri river confluence which reflects the contribution of relatively clear water to the mississippi river from the illinois river which joins the mississippi river about 35 km upstream in contrast to the case 1 the sssc contrast between the two confluent flows remains mostly unchanged within initial 30 km downstream of the confluence fig 8 the gradient in sssc near the center of the channel defining the mixing interface decreases over distance indicating expansion of this interface between 40 and 80 km slow mixing continues to reduce the sssc contrast across the channel to less than half of its initial value complete mixing pmx 0 95 is achieved near the end of the study reach at 107 km downstream of the confluence in this case the cross sectional average sssc at the location of complete mixing is about 800 mg l a value intermediate between the initial concentrations of the two rivers but more similar to the sssc of the missouri river than to the sssc of the mississippi river upstream of the confluence thus in contrast to case 1 the addition of sediment by the missouri river resulted in a substantial increase in the sssc of the mississippi river overall the spatial pattern of mixing along the reach is characterized by a slow linear increase in values of p mx in the downstream direction fig 9 4 2 3 case 3 minor mixing on sept 26 2001 discharges of both rivers upstream of the confluence were relatively low discharges with the discharge of the mississippi river being slightly less than the discharge of the missouri river discharge table 4 the higher discharge and velocity in the missouri river compared to the mississippi river on this date resulted in a high momentum ratio the sssc of the missouri river was nearly eight times greater than the sssc of the mississippi river being 599 mg l and 75 mg l respectively the two flows generally remain separate in the upstream portion of the study reach fig 5c and do not mix much downstream over the entire length of the study reach this case represents minor mixing table 3 cross sectional plots of rcs at different locations downstream of the confluence show that complete mixing does not occur over the length of the study reach the value of pmx at a distance of 110 km is only 0 5 and although the total range in concentrations has diminished slightly a strong lateral gradient in sssc is still evident at this location fig 10 the lack of mixing is also evident from the pmx plot which exhibits considerable scatter and no clear trend over the length of the reach fig 11 values of pmx lie between 0 125 and 0 30 over the first 15 km from the confluence and then increase very gradually to values between 0 25 and 0 5 between 15 km and 75 km over the last 35 km of the reach values increase somewhat systematically from about 0 25 to 0 5 but this trend is disrupted by local increases in pmx above 0 5 locally 5 discussion and conclusion the abundant availability of multispectral satellite imagery over the past few decades provides a unique opportunity to understand spatial and temporal variations in mixing in downstream of confluences in river systems although past work has indicated that remote sensing is useful for qualitatively depicting lateral mixing downstream of large river confluences e g park and latrubesse 2014 the research presented in this paper has developed a method for quantifying the amount of surficial mixing an advantage of the method is that it provides an effective alternative to ground based measurements of mixing in large rivers that are time consuming and expensive to obtain and can only provide information on mixing over a limited spatial and temporal domain by contrast the remote sensing method yields maps depicting spatio temporal heterogeneity in surficial suspended sediment concentrations that can be used to characterize lateral mixing at specific cross sections along the river and to quantify changes in the magnitude of lateral mixing over long distances downstream from a confluence the availability of remote sensing data for many different times also provides a basis for determining how mixing downstream of confluences varies over time and with different flow and suspended sediment conditions the rf model shows that a robust relationship exists between sssc and ratios of red and green bands and nir and green bands these results confirm the findings reported in literature for remote sensing of turbidity or secchi disk depths using broad band sensors doxaran et al 2006 2003 duan et al 2009 where high correlations were achieved using red green and nir green band ratios the results of model testing as well as application of the model to three test cases indicate that the model captures spatial patterns that reflect differences in sscs between confluent flows the rf model calibrated to a training dataset based on landsat 5 tm data performed reasonably well in estimating ssscs of an independent dataset but underestimated ssscs greater than 500 800 mg l most observed ssscs for the mississippi river and missouri river gaging stations are 400 mg l fig 4 moreover the highest concentrations in the case studies may be underestimated which would only enhance the initial difference in sssc at the confluence nevertheless the rmse and mae of the model indicates that it should be applied with caution to evaluate mixing when the initial sssc contrast between the two confluent flows is low obviously not all of variation in reflectance in the bands used to model sssc is due to variation in sediment alone other properties such as suspended organic solids undoubtedly contribute to variations in reflectance also the rf model is fitted using average spectral characteristics for the set of pixels that extends across the river at the locations of gaging stations where mean sediment concentrations are reported the mean concentrations for a cross section of the river are based on rating relations between an individual sample collected each day locally within the cross section and cross sectional concentrations these relations are not precise and can introduce error individual samples from which cross sectional concentrations are derived are collected beneath the surface whereas the spectral information from remote sensing represents conditions at the surface additionally the specific time of day at which the individual sample is collected usually does not coincide with the time of day the sensor obtained the image error introduced by this factor presumably is small because suspended sediment concentrations vary slowly over periods of several days on the mississippi river local spatial variation in reflectance related to turbulence at the river surface was evident in the images introducing variability into surface values of reflectance obtained at specific times the effect of local variation in reflectance on the results is mitigated by the spatial averaging of sssc estimates over segments of the river length sun glint may also contribute to local variability in spectral reflectance but again spatial averaging helps to mitigate the influence of this variability on the results all of these factors complicate the effort to model with a high degree of accuracy the relation between spectral information derived from remotely sensed imagery and reported suspended sediment concentrations in rivers further work is needed to unravel the independent influences of these complicating factors on predictive accuracy strong cross stream variations in predicted ssscs which correspond to contrasts in ssscs of the two confluent rivers upstream of the confluence and to visible contrasts between flows from the two rivers downstream of the confluence strongly suggest that none of the complicating factors has sufficient influence on the results to overwhelm the dominant influence of contrasts in sssc on spectral reflectance application of the method to three test cases with different characteristics of flow and sediment concentration at the confluence of the missouri and mississippi rivers demonstrates that it is an effective tool for characterizing spatial patterns of surficial suspended sediment concentrations downstream of confluences within large river systems the test cases reveal substantial differences in amounts and spatial patterns of surficial mixing of suspended sediment for different flow events in the cases of rapid and minor mixing both have similar discharge ratios and momentum ratios but mixing was completed within 28 km in one case while the two rivers remained relatively unmixed for 110 km in other the only major difference is the initial sssc difference between the two flows in the minor mixing case the initial sssc difference is much greater than in the rapid mixing case and in the slow mixing case thus no clear relationship is evident between characteristics of flow and sediment at the confluence and downstream patterns and rates of lateral mixing for the three contrasting cases examined in this study however analysis of three cases is not sufficient to comprehensively assess relationships between controlling factors discharge ratio momentum flux ratio sediment concentration ratio total discharge and mixing downstream of river confluences further analysis using a large number of cases is needed to determine whether variations in incoming flow and sediment characteristics at large river confluences are strongly related to patterns and rates of downstream mixing the analysis using remote sensing data also examines only surficial patterns of mixing and does not take into account mixing beneath the surface of the flow mixing can be strongly influenced by secondary flows in the immediate vicinity of the confluence that can result in subsurface interpenetration of one flow into the other lewis and rhoads 2015 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 density effects induced by large differences in temperature or sediment concentrations of confluent flows can also produce horizontal stratification of flows downstream of confluences that may result in misleading interpretations of mixing based on surface information only laraque et al 2009 ramõn et al 2013 the results of the cases studies do demonstrate that the remote sensing method developed herein provides detailed spatial information that can be used to provide assessments of mixing downstream of confluences in large river systems based on patterns of surficial suspended sediment concentrations by combining the method with field investigations the relation between surficial patterns of mixing at and downstream of confluences with patterns detected throughout the entire flow column can be explored the method proposed here does not deal automatically with multiple channels but does accommodate manually obstacles such as bars small islands and barges that produce splits in the path of the flow future refinements will aim to adapt the method for application to multithread fluvial systems such as braided or anastomosing rivers acknowledgement this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
7557,although past work has noted that contrasts in turbidity often are detectable on remotely sensed images of rivers downstream from confluences no systematic methodology has been developed for assessing mixing over distance of confluent flows with differing surficial suspended sediment concentrations sssc in contrast to field measurements of mixing below confluences satellite remote sensing can provide detailed information on spatial distributions of sssc over long distances this paper presents a methodology that uses remote sensing data to estimate spatial patterns of sssc downstream of confluences along large rivers and to determine changes in the amount of mixing over distance from confluences the method develops a calibrated random forest rf model by relating training sssc data from river gaging stations to derived spectral indices for the pixels corresponding to gaging station locations the calibrated model is then used to predict sssc values for every river pixel in a remotely sensed image which provides the basis for mapping of spatial variability in ssscs along the river the pixel data are used to estimate average surficial values of sssc at cross sections spaced uniformly along the river based on the cross section data a mixing metric is computed for each cross section the spatial pattern of change in this metric over distance can be used to define rates and length scales of surficial mixing of suspended sediment downstream of a confluence this type of information is useful for exploring the potential influence of various controlling factors on mixing downstream of confluences for evaluating how mixing in a river system varies over time and space and for determining how these variations influence water quality and ecological conditions along the river keywords landsat water quality confluence remote sensing suspended sediment mixing 1 introduction the transport of suspended sediment and associated nutrients or contaminants within river systems plays an important role in watershed processes these material fluxes influence water quality habitat conditions biogeochemical cycles and channel morphodynamics beschta et al 1987 doxaran et al 2009 2002a the transport of suspended sediment within large river systems traditionally has been evaluated by obtaining measurements of sediment concentrations at gaging stations edwards and glysson 1999 this approach while useful does not permit evaluations of spatial variability in suspended sediment concentrations within a river system such variability is often pronounced especially at and downstream of river confluences confluences are important sites for mixing within river systems at these locations flows with potentially different physical and chemical properties converge and begin to mix within and downstream of a confluence a mixing interface defined by an abrupt lateral contrast in turbidity conductivity or temperature gaudet and roy 1995 konsoer and rhoads 2013 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 rhoads and sukhodolov 2008 typically exists between the two confluent flows this interface is visible at the surface if the two flows have a pronounced contrast in turbidity the mixing interface can either dissipate over a short distance downstream of the confluence if the two flows mix rapidly lane et al 2008 or persist for long distances downstream of the confluence if the two flows mix slowly bouchez et al 2010 mackay 1970 the efficacy of transverse mixing processes largely determines the quality of water downstream of a confluence mixing of suspended sediment downstream of confluences has not been extensively studied past work investigating this issue in small streams has relied on manual collection of samples using a depth integrated sampler kenworthy and rhoads 1995 such an approach is time consuming and only suitable for wadeable streams in large rivers suspended sediment concentrations are typically measured using heavy reel mounted samplers deployed from a bridge cableway or boat diplas et al 2008 edwards and glysson 1999 access to confluences is limited particularly when measurements are obtained from bridges as is most often the case more recently acoustic methods have been used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations in rivers guerrero et al 2016 szupiany et al 2012 all such methods perform well for determining the distribution of suspended sediments within individual cross sections at a particular time however the capacity of such methods to characterize spatial and temporal variations of suspended sediment concentrations over long distances is limited patterns of mixing downstream of confluences can occur over varying lengths from a few channel widths to lengths as long as several hundred channel widths depending on different controlling factors to characterize these patterns new methods are needed that can provide detailed information on the spatial distribution of suspended sediment concentrations at large temporal and spatial scales such observations are crucial for understanding the dynamics of mixing downstream of confluences in large river systems an alternative method for evaluating water quality conditions at and downstream of confluences is to use remote sensing techniques satellite remote sensing with synoptic coverage and data availability over several decades provides an ideal platform with which to study processes at large spatial and temporal scales the estimation of surficial suspended sediment concentrations ssscs from remotely sensed imagery can be realized through an empirical approach that relates water quality parameters directly to spectral properties using various empirical modeling techniques many studies have linked turbidity and ssscs in lakes or estuaries to spectral indices cox et al 1998 dekker et al 2002 duan et al 2009 hellweger et al 2004 kallio et al 2008 kloiber et al 2002 lathrop 1992 lavery et al 1993 odermatt et al 2012 olmanson et al 2008 pattiaratchi et al 1994 wu et al 2015 2008 zhang et al 2014 however past studies are limited to specific ranges of ssscs found within a specific water body which may not work well for rivers where concentrations can vary substantially both spatially and temporally numerous studies have used remote sensing to explore ssscs in inland rivers using sensors ranging from relatively high spatial resolution e g landsat with 30 m aranuvachapun and walling 1988 doxaran et al 2002b herrault et al 2016 lymburner et al 2016 mertes et al 1993 montanher et al 2014 onderka and pekárová 2008 tan et al

et al 2013 miller and mckee 2004 park and latrubesse 2015 shi and wang 2009 son and wang 2012 because of its high radiometric resolution modis imagery is generally preferred for examing sssc in big rivers like the amazon however the use of these data to examine transverse mixing in large rivers less than a few kilometers wide is limited because the river width is covered by only a few pixels and individual pixels extend laterally across large percentages of the total river width mertes and magadzire 2007 ssscs in rivers can be detected at relatively high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution using multispectral sensors matthews 2011 but the challenge is to develop a model that can estimate sssc equally well over a wide range of concentrations the goal of this paper is to present a method based on multispectral remote sensing imagery for characterizing in detail spatial patterns of ssscs in large rivers and to illustrate how the method can be used to assess surficial lateral mixing of suspended sediment at and downstream of large river confluences the method yields a wealth of information on length scales and rates of surficial mixing in large river systems allowing spatial variation in mixing to be examined at an unprecedented level of detail thereby improving our understanding of this important water quality process 2 study area to develop the methodology for analyzing mixing at and downstream of large river confluences using remote sensing a reach beginning at the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers and extending 110 km downstream was selected for analysis fig 1 the watershed of the mississippi river basin upstream of the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers drains an area of about 1 800 000 km2 with the drainage area of the mississippi river equal to 500 000 km2 and the drainage area of the missouri river equal to 1 300 000 km2 although the missouri river has a substantially larger drainage area than the mississippi river its mean annual discharge at the confluence is substantially less than that of the upper mississippi river however the mean annual depth averaged suspended sediment concentration dssc of the missouri river 395 mg l is over twice as large as that of the mississippi river 140 mg l table 1 both the mississippi and missouri rivers have been subjected to extensive anthropogenic modifications over the past 150 years for purposes of flood control and commercial navigation alterations include but are not limited to impoundments construction of levees deepening of the channel and construction of lock and dams these modifications along with major changes in conservation practices in the watersheds of these rivers have generally produced declines in the suspended sediment loads of the mississippi and missouri rivers since 1950 heimann et al 2011 3 methodology the methodology for examining mixing downstream of river confluences involves development of an empirical model for predicting sssc of each river pixel in a remotely sensed image and development of a model for spatially averaging the sssc data based on geographical and geometrical characterization of the river channel fig 2 sssc modeling focuses on the use of satellite imagery and random forest rf analysis to develop an empirical model for predicting ssscs from spectral information spatial averaging focuses on spatial representation of the river system along the path of the river for the purpose of determining spatial variation in ssscs over discrete segments of the river system the combination of these two methodological components leads to estimates of an index of mixing which can be mapped over the entire reach of the river downstream of the confluence 3 1 development of an empirical model of sssc 3 1 1 image data landsat 5 thematic mapper tm imagery of the study reach collected between 1985 and 2011 were used as input data for development of a model to estimate values of sssc landsat 5 was selected because of its extensive historical availability a spatial resolution conducive to mapping spatial variation in sssc in large rivers 30 m ground sample distance and sufficient availability of imagery to develop an empirical model relating sssc to spectral information over a multidecadal timescale matthews 2011 the imagery was calibrated to surface reflectance using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system masek et al 2013 only 100 cloud free imagery was used in model development to avoid effects of cloud cover resulting in a dataset of 143 images over 26 years 3 1 2 discharge and suspended sediment data data on discharge and dssc in the mississippi river and missouri river were obtained from u s geological survey river gaging stations located within the study reach fig 1 the discharge data provide information on the relative strength of the flows at the confluence and the suspended sediment data are required to calibrate and test the predictive model of sssc using spectral data from satellite imagery daily discharge data are available for mississippi river at grafton il upstream of the confluence and at st louis mo downstream of the confluence for the period 1985 2011 the st charles station usgs station 06935965 fig 1 on the missouri river started collecting discharge data in 2000 usgs stations that provide data on dssc are categorized as either daily or periodic stations defined by the frequency and number of samples collected the data collection procedures follow methods described by edwards glysson 1999 for daily stations vertical samples are collected once each day at a single location single location data are adjusted on the basis of multi vertical samples collected less frequently at 5 10 additional locations across the channel using either equal discharge increment edi or equal width increment ewi method edwards and glysson 1988 final computations of dssc are performed using the method described by porterfield 1977 because the multispectral scanner only can sense differences in reflectance on the surface of the river whereas the sediment data reported by the usgs represent depth averaged values an implicit assumption of the analysis is that depth averaged values of suspended sediment concentration dssc provide reasonably accurate information on the variations in suspended sediment concentrations at the surface sssc that are detected by the scanner stations on mississippi river upstream grafton il and downstream st louis mo of the confluence are daily stations where sufficient discharge and dssc data are collected to produce reliable daily dssc values daily data at the st louis station are available for the entire period of analysis whereas suspended sediment data were collected at the mississippi river station 05587450 from 1989 to 2011 dssc data are also available for the missouri river station at st charles 06935965 for three years beginning in october 2005 table 2 3 1 3 channel edge and centerline edges of water of the river digitized for each image in arcgis provided the basis for masking the images so that only pixels consisting entirely of water were included in boundary delineation of the river pixels that included land or a mixture of water and channel banks were excluded from the analysis using the right and left edges of water a centerline along the river downstream of the missouri mississippi confluence was created with planform statistics tool developed by national center for earth surface dynamics nced in university of minnesota https repository nced umn edu browser php current keyword keyword 5 dataset id 15 the tool uses edges of water to establish evenly spaced river centerline points at user defined intervals centerline vertex locations were saved as text file as well as an esri shapefile a matlab program pcs curvature developed by güneralp and rhoads 2007 was used to fit piecewise cubic splines pcs to the centerline points to provide a continuous representation of the channel centerline this program can also determine the coordinates of endpoints of cross sections oriented orthogonal to the channel centerline at user specified intervals in this study orthogonal cross sections were established at a spacing of one half 500 m the average river width 1000 m beginning at the confluence of the missouri and mississippi rivers and extending 110 km to the downstream end of the study reach this spacing provided sufficient detail for examining how mixing varies over the length of the river and also corresponds to the recommended spacing for digitization of river centerlines 3 1 4 modeling sssc in this study sssc was modeled as a function of the non thermal landsat bands and spectral indices using a random forest rf regression model liaw and wiener 2002 rf a machine learning algorithm is relatively insensitive to noise and outliers and is effective at predicting responses for relationships that may be nonlinear or contain interaction effects breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 a training and testing database was constructed by identifying the pixels for each of the 143 landsat images that correspond to the locations of the three usgs stations with sssc data if sediment data were available for all three gaging stations for the complete set of 143 images a dataset of n 429 would have existed for model development and calibration because sediment data were not available for all three stations for all images the total number of cases for model development and calibration was n 271 for each image acquisition date the usgs gaging station dssc measurement for the same date if available was determined and reflectance values for different spectral bands of the pixel at the position of the gaging station were linked to the dssc measurement in addition to the reflectance values the dssc measurement was also related to a set of indices that have been found to be useful in predicting sssc table 3 a rf model was developed by randomly selecting half of the dataset n 136 as training data the resulting model consisted of 8000 trees using a mtry value of 5 which controls the number of variables available for splitting at each tree node the model was developed in r using the raster package for working with raster datasets the spatial tools package for parallel raster processing and the randomforest package for modeling jonathan 2014 liaw and wiener 2002 robert 2016 the model was tested by applying it to the remaining half of the dataset n 135 and calculating the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae pearson s r and percent bias of predicted versus observed values both the training and test datasets had similar statistical characteristics the mean sssc of the training dataset was 219 mg l with a range of 19 mg l 1700 mg l whereas the mean sssc of the test dataset was 213 mg l with a range of 34 mg l 1270 mg l 3 2 spatial averaging of ssscs and quantification of mixing 3 2 1 spatial representation of river cross sections quantification of mixing from the model predicted sssc rasters involved several steps aimed at generating spatially distributed data that can be used to compute spatially averaged values of ssscs downstream of the confluence fig 2 masking of the image data limited the extent of the analysis to the water pixels within the river channel on all images the extracted raster pixel values were stored for further analysis the river centerline and transects orthogonal to this centerline provided the basis for transforming the geographic coordinates of each pixel latitude longitude to an s streamwise and n cross stream coordinate system a common frame of reference for meandering rivers legleiter and kyriakidis 2007 the centroids of all pixels within the river were assigned s coordinates based on arc length longitudinal distance from the upstream junction corner s 0 along the channel centerline s coordinate and n coordinates based on the distance along transects orthogonal to the channel centerline n coordinate fig 3 the centerline has an n coordinate of zero values of n to the right of the channel centerline looking downstream are positive whereas values of n to the left of the centerline are negative this coordinate transformation was achieved by calculating the euclidean distance from a pixel to the centerline which becomes the n coordinate of the pixel 3 2 2 spatial averaging of sssc spatial averaging is performed to reduce noise in sssc values produced by spatial variations in spectral properties on the river surface associated with local variations in the turbidity of turbulent flow at the time the image was acquired the area of the river within the study reach was divided into 500 m long segments based on s coordinate values such that a representative cross section rcs lies at the center of each segment fig 3 for example if an rcs has an s value of 500 m the segment domain includes all locations with s values between 250 m and 750 m this rcs is established to capture the mean characteristics of ssscs within the entire 500 m long segment each 500 m segment region was divided into 10 subsegments each with a length of 50 m in the s direction for each image date all sssc pixels within this subsegment were extracted the n coordinates of each pixel within the subsegments were normalized to the width of the rcs 1 n n pixel s n value width of rcs local width of 50 m subsegment thus if the width of the rcs and a subsegment are the same the normalized and absolute n values of a pixels are identical however where the width of the river is not constant over the 500 m block the normalized and absolute n values differ this normalization was performed to accommodate changes in width within a segment so that pixels near the bank in a subsegment project onto a position near the banks on the rcs to determine the appropriate lateral position of each pixel projected onto the rcs the rcs was divided laterally into evenly spaced 30 m bins all pixels within the 500 m segment with standardized n coordinates that lie within a particular 30 m bin along the rcs were then determined fig 3 the mean of the predicted sssc values for all of these pixels was computed and the average value was assigned to that particular bin along the rcs this process was completed for all 500 m segments within the 110 km study reach the spatial averaging procedure produced cross sections spaced at 500 m intervals containing mean values of ssscs at 30 m lateral intervals these mean values represent average concentrations of sssc along the cross sections as derived from sssc values for all individual pixels within 500 m swaths of the river centered on the cross sections the computation of spatial averages was in a few cases complicated by the local presence of exposed bars or barges within the river channel which produced splits in the path of the flow around these objects the method accommodated these situations by masking the objects from the analysis masking is performed by creating holes in the river boundary polygon such that the width n coordinate of the channel is preserved but the pixels representing bars or barges are not extracted for further processing during spatial averaging these blank areas are excluded from the computation of spatial averages that are projected onto the representative cross section 3 2 3 calculation of mixing metric most established indices of river mixing are not useful for determining the magnitude of mixing downstream of confluences because these indices do not adequately distinguish between mixed and unmixed cases when the initial contrast in tracer values of the confluent flows is low a commonly used index of mixing is rutherford 1994 2 p mr x min x max where p mr is mixing ratio and x min and x max are minimum and maximum values respectively of a tracer within a river cross section an alternative metric yotsukura and cobb 1972 is 3 p m 1 1 2 0 q x x 1 d q q where p m is the percent mixing in a cross section x is the local value of a local quantity of interest x is the cross sectionally averaged value of x and q is the total discharge at the cross section both of these metrics are insensitive to initial differences in magnitudes of x the quantity being mixed between two confluent rivers if two confluent rivers have small initial differences in values of x the values of p mr and p m will be close to one immediately below the confluence even if the two rivers have not mixed at all i e values of x on one side of the mixing interface are consistently different than values of x on the other side of the mixing interface ideally a mixing index for a confluence should be evaluated in relation to the initial contrast in characteristics of x where the flows initially converge to accommodate shortcomings in previous mixing metrics we developed a new model 4 p mx 1 1 n x i x n 1 a x k 1 x 1 1 b x k 2 x 2 a b 1 m x ju x u m where p mx is the percent transverse mixing in a cross section x i is the value of sssc for a pixel in a cross section downstream of the confluence x is the mean value of x at the downstream cross section n is the number of pixels in the downstream cross section x ju is the value of sssc for a pixel in the two cross sections upstream of the confluence one cross section on each confluent river x u is the mean of the pixels for the two cross sections upstream of the confluence and m is the number of pixels in the two cross sections upstream of the confluence the term 1 a x k 1 x 1 1 b x k 2 x 2 a b is the mean initial variability in the upstream tributaries this parameter accommodates the effect of inherent variability in the tracer values at cross sections upstream of the confluence here x 1 and x 2 are the mean values of x k in tributaries 1 and 2 respectively while a and b are total number of pixels in each tributary the value of p mx starts from 0 at the confluence and increases to a maximum value of 1 for fully mixed flow however due to the low radiometric resolution of landsat imagery for water bodies achieving p mx 1 may not be possible thus cross sections with values of p mx 0 95 are considered fully mixed an approach that accords to the standard for complete mixing based on eq 2 rutherford 1994 plots of p mx values over distance along the downstream channel provide information on spatial variations in the rate of mixing using this index spatial patterns and rates of transverse mixing of sssc downstream of the confluence of the mississippi and missouri rivers were calculated using the rf model and the spatial averaging procedure for three test cases these cases were selected based on differences in incoming flow conditions and spatial patterns of mixing downstream from the confluence on march 30 1998 case 1 both rivers had moderate levels of flow but the discharge q momentum flux m ρqu where ρ is density and u is mean streamwise velocity and sssc in the missouri river exceeded q m and sssc in the mississippi river table 4 on april 24 1991 case 2 q and m were nearly twice as large in the mississippi river as in the missouri river but as on march 30 1998 sssc in the missouri river was nearly three times the value in the mississippi river on september 26th 2001 case 3 flows on both rivers were relatively low although the two rivers have nearly identical discharges the momentum flux ρqu on the missouri river was about four times the value of m on the mississippi river due to the high velocity on the missouri river again the missouri river had a much greater sssc than that of the mississippi river 4 results 4 1 accuracy of the sssc predictions overall the rf model predicts values ofssscs reasonably well in the mississippi and missouri rivers fig 4 the r value of the fitted rf model is 0 84 linear regression analysis between predicted sssc values of the training data used to develop the model and corresponding measured suspended sediment concentrations yields a strong correlation r2 0 95 fig 4a the strong influence of the large number of ssscs 800 mg l on the rf analysis causes the fitted model to underpredict slightly large values of sediment concentration 800 mg l the relation between predicted and observed values of the test data is not as strong as the relation for the training data but is still quite good r2 0 72 this value of r2 is comparable to results r2 0 78 reported in a previous study aimed at predicting ssscs from remotely sensed imagery in freshwater systems olmanson et al 2008 the model underpredicts high values of sssc 500 mg l for the test data with the degree of underprediction somewhat larger than that for the training data the vast majority of the test data are less than 500 mg l 93 and the net bias of prediction for the entire set of test data is only 0 7 for high observed sscs 600 mg l variance of the predicted data increases noticeably a tendency observed with data on ssscs derived from other spaceborne sensors like modis park and latrubesse 2014 for the rf model this effect can partly be attributed to the fact that only 7 of the total observations are greater than 500 mg l and just 2 are greater than 1000 mg l the results of model calibration and testing indicate that the rf model adequately captures the relation between sssc and reflectance but that given the values of root mean square error rmse 115 mg l and mean absolute error mae 68 3 mg l for the test data sssc predictions should be interpreted cautiously when contrasts in ssscs between the two rivers are small 100 mg l the metric incmse which provides a measure of the importance of each variable included in the model shows that the red to green ratio along with the near infrared nir and red bands are the most effective predictors of sssc concentrations table 5 these findings are consistent with previous studies where high correlations 0 8 between predicted and observed data were reported using similar spectral bands and indices table 3 doxaran et al 2003 duan et al 2009 onderka and pekárová 2008 wu et al 2008 4 2 patterns of sssc for three test cases differences in patterns and rates of mixing for the three test cases illustrate the utility of the method for capturing spatial and temporal variations in lateral mixing downstream of confluences in large rivers 4 2 1 case 1 rapid mixing on march 30 1988 the discharges in both rivers were nearly identical but the missouri river with its higher velocities had about three times the momentum of the mississippi river table 4 the sssc of the missouri river was 543 mg l which was more than three times the sssc of the mississippi river 174 mg l the map of contrast in sssc indicates that high initial sssc contrast across the channel at the confluence rapidly diminishes within few channel widths downstream on this date fig 5 a this case represents relatively rapid mixing immediately downstream of the confluence x 0 5 km concentrations on the missouri river and mississippi river sides of the confluence differ dramatically indicating a lack of mixing fig 6 the pronounced gradient in sssc between the two sides of the confluence marks the location of the mixing interface separating the confluent flows the value of pmx at this location 0 08 shows that little to no mixing has occurred relative to conditions upstream of the confluence where by definition pmx 0 the cross sectional plots of reach averaged sssc reveal that the slope of the maximum contrast gradient delimiting the mixing interface remains near the center of the channel nn 0 and rapidly diminishes downstream fig 6 mixing is essentially complete pmx 0 95 27 5 km downstream from the confluence mixing in this case results in a cross sectional average value of sssc that is more similar to that of mississippi river upstream of the confluence than the average concentrations of two rivers upstream of the confluence values of percent mixing for each rcs depict the evolution of mixing downstream of the confluence fig 7 mixing increases rapidly over the first 6 km in a linear fashion until reaching a peak and then subsequently declines locally this peak corresponds to a section of the river where the channel is relatively wide compared to other locations downstream of the confluence fig 7 at this location the mixing interface remains near the same absolute location with respect to the left bank of the river as upstream and downstream but shifts location in position relative to the channel centerline nn due to local widening of the channel thus the number of pixels on the right missouri side of the mixing interface increases relative to the number of pixels on the left mississippi side resulting in an apparent increase in mixing i e the contrast in sssc relative to conditions upstream of the confluence decreases because the percentage of pixels corresponding to flow on the missouri river side of the mi increases although this apparent increase in mixing could be accommodated by weighting the contribution of each pixel to the p mx value by the proportion of the total discharge this pixel represents such an approach would require information on the distribution of the discharge across each rcs p mx values decrease over the next 4 km as the channel narrows back to its width upstream of the widened section leading to an apparent unmixing in the plot downstream from a distance of 10 km mixing again increases linearly but at a lower rate than immediately downstream of the confluence 4 2 2 case 2 slow mixing on april 24th 1991 the total discharge at the confluence was relatively large but the discharge of the mississippi river was more than two times the discharge of the missouri river resulting in relatively low discharge and momentum ratios table 4 despite having a higher discharge than the missouri river the mississippi river was far less turbid with a sssc value of 300 mg l about one third of the sssc of the missouri river 1010 mg l as can be seen from the map of ssscs fig 5 flows from each river remain clearly separated immediately downstream from the confluence eventually mixing much farther downstream this case represents relatively slow mixing notable in this case is the cross channel contrast in sssc on the mississippi river upstream of the mississippi river missouri river confluence which reflects the contribution of relatively clear water to the mississippi river from the illinois river which joins the mississippi river about 35 km upstream in contrast to the case 1 the sssc contrast between the two confluent flows remains mostly unchanged within initial 30 km downstream of the confluence fig 8 the gradient in sssc near the center of the channel defining the mixing interface decreases over distance indicating expansion of this interface between 40 and 80 km slow mixing continues to reduce the sssc contrast across the channel to less than half of its initial value complete mixing pmx 0 95 is achieved near the end of the study reach at 107 km downstream of the confluence in this case the cross sectional average sssc at the location of complete mixing is about 800 mg l a value intermediate between the initial concentrations of the two rivers but more similar to the sssc of the missouri river than to the sssc of the mississippi river upstream of the confluence thus in contrast to case 1 the addition of sediment by the missouri river resulted in a substantial increase in the sssc of the mississippi river overall the spatial pattern of mixing along the reach is characterized by a slow linear increase in values of p mx in the downstream direction fig 9 4 2 3 case 3 minor mixing on sept 26 2001 discharges of both rivers upstream of the confluence were relatively low discharges with the discharge of the mississippi river being slightly less than the discharge of the missouri river discharge table 4 the higher discharge and velocity in the missouri river compared to the mississippi river on this date resulted in a high momentum ratio the sssc of the missouri river was nearly eight times greater than the sssc of the mississippi river being 599 mg l and 75 mg l respectively the two flows generally remain separate in the upstream portion of the study reach fig 5c and do not mix much downstream over the entire length of the study reach this case represents minor mixing table 3 cross sectional plots of rcs at different locations downstream of the confluence show that complete mixing does not occur over the length of the study reach the value of pmx at a distance of 110 km is only 0 5 and although the total range in concentrations has diminished slightly a strong lateral gradient in sssc is still evident at this location fig 10 the lack of mixing is also evident from the pmx plot which exhibits considerable scatter and no clear trend over the length of the reach fig 11 values of pmx lie between 0 125 and 0 30 over the first 15 km from the confluence and then increase very gradually to values between 0 25 and 0 5 between 15 km and 75 km over the last 35 km of the reach values increase somewhat systematically from about 0 25 to 0 5 but this trend is disrupted by local increases in pmx above 0 5 locally 5 discussion and conclusion the abundant availability of multispectral satellite imagery over the past few decades provides a unique opportunity to understand spatial and temporal variations in mixing in downstream of confluences in river systems although past work has indicated that remote sensing is useful for qualitatively depicting lateral mixing downstream of large river confluences e g park and latrubesse 2014 the research presented in this paper has developed a method for quantifying the amount of surficial mixing an advantage of the method is that it provides an effective alternative to ground based measurements of mixing in large rivers that are time consuming and expensive to obtain and can only provide information on mixing over a limited spatial and temporal domain by contrast the remote sensing method yields maps depicting spatio temporal heterogeneity in surficial suspended sediment concentrations that can be used to characterize lateral mixing at specific cross sections along the river and to quantify changes in the magnitude of lateral mixing over long distances downstream from a confluence the availability of remote sensing data for many different times also provides a basis for determining how mixing downstream of confluences varies over time and with different flow and suspended sediment conditions the rf model shows that a robust relationship exists between sssc and ratios of red and green bands and nir and green bands these results confirm the findings reported in literature for remote sensing of turbidity or secchi disk depths using broad band sensors doxaran et al 2006 2003 duan et al 2009 where high correlations were achieved using red green and nir green band ratios the results of model testing as well as application of the model to three test cases indicate that the model captures spatial patterns that reflect differences in sscs between confluent flows the rf model calibrated to a training dataset based on landsat 5 tm data performed reasonably well in estimating ssscs of an independent dataset but underestimated ssscs greater than 500 800 mg l most observed ssscs for the mississippi river and missouri river gaging stations are 400 mg l fig 4 moreover the highest concentrations in the case studies may be underestimated which would only enhance the initial difference in sssc at the confluence nevertheless the rmse and mae of the model indicates that it should be applied with caution to evaluate mixing when the initial sssc contrast between the two confluent flows is low obviously not all of variation in reflectance in the bands used to model sssc is due to variation in sediment alone other properties such as suspended organic solids undoubtedly contribute to variations in reflectance also the rf model is fitted using average spectral characteristics for the set of pixels that extends across the river at the locations of gaging stations where mean sediment concentrations are reported the mean concentrations for a cross section of the river are based on rating relations between an individual sample collected each day locally within the cross section and cross sectional concentrations these relations are not precise and can introduce error individual samples from which cross sectional concentrations are derived are collected beneath the surface whereas the spectral information from remote sensing represents conditions at the surface additionally the specific time of day at which the individual sample is collected usually does not coincide with the time of day the sensor obtained the image error introduced by this factor presumably is small because suspended sediment concentrations vary slowly over periods of several days on the mississippi river local spatial variation in reflectance related to turbulence at the river surface was evident in the images introducing variability into surface values of reflectance obtained at specific times the effect of local variation in reflectance on the results is mitigated by the spatial averaging of sssc estimates over segments of the river length sun glint may also contribute to local variability in spectral reflectance but again spatial averaging helps to mitigate the influence of this variability on the results all of these factors complicate the effort to model with a high degree of accuracy the relation between spectral information derived from remotely sensed imagery and reported suspended sediment concentrations in rivers further work is needed to unravel the independent influences of these complicating factors on predictive accuracy strong cross stream variations in predicted ssscs which correspond to contrasts in ssscs of the two confluent rivers upstream of the confluence and to visible contrasts between flows from the two rivers downstream of the confluence strongly suggest that none of the complicating factors has sufficient influence on the results to overwhelm the dominant influence of contrasts in sssc on spectral reflectance application of the method to three test cases with different characteristics of flow and sediment concentration at the confluence of the missouri and mississippi rivers demonstrates that it is an effective tool for characterizing spatial patterns of surficial suspended sediment concentrations downstream of confluences within large river systems the test cases reveal substantial differences in amounts and spatial patterns of surficial mixing of suspended sediment for different flow events in the cases of rapid and minor mixing both have similar discharge ratios and momentum ratios but mixing was completed within 28 km in one case while the two rivers remained relatively unmixed for 110 km in other the only major difference is the initial sssc difference between the two flows in the minor mixing case the initial sssc difference is much greater than in the rapid mixing case and in the slow mixing case thus no clear relationship is evident between characteristics of flow and sediment at the confluence and downstream patterns and rates of lateral mixing for the three contrasting cases examined in this study however analysis of three cases is not sufficient to comprehensively assess relationships between controlling factors discharge ratio momentum flux ratio sediment concentration ratio total discharge and mixing downstream of river confluences further analysis using a large number of cases is needed to determine whether variations in incoming flow and sediment characteristics at large river confluences are strongly related to patterns and rates of downstream mixing the analysis using remote sensing data also examines only surficial patterns of mixing and does not take into account mixing beneath the surface of the flow mixing can be strongly influenced by secondary flows in the immediate vicinity of the confluence that can result in subsurface interpenetration of one flow into the other lewis and rhoads 2015 rhoads and kenworthy 1995 density effects induced by large differences in temperature or sediment concentrations of confluent flows can also produce horizontal stratification of flows downstream of confluences that may result in misleading interpretations of mixing based on surface information only laraque et al 2009 ramõn et al 2013 the results of the cases studies do demonstrate that the remote sensing method developed herein provides detailed spatial information that can be used to provide assessments of mixing downstream of confluences in large river systems based on patterns of surficial suspended sediment concentrations by combining the method with field investigations the relation between surficial patterns of mixing at and downstream of confluences with patterns detected throughout the entire flow column can be explored the method proposed here does not deal automatically with multiple channels but does accommodate manually obstacles such as bars small islands and barges that produce splits in the path of the flow future refinements will aim to adapt the method for application to multithread fluvial systems such as braided or anastomosing rivers acknowledgement this research did not receive

7558,long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land missing data due to equipment malfunction and other challenges have limited conclusions that can be made about annual flow and thus nutrient loads from field studies including assessments of the effect of controlled drainage water table depth data may be available during gaps in flow data providing a basis for filling missing drain flow data therefore the overall goal of this study was to examine the potential to estimate drain flow using water table observations the objectives were to evaluate how the shape of the relationship between drain flow and water table height above drain varies depending on the soil hydraulic conductivity profile to quantify how well the hooghoudt equation represented the water table drain flow relationship in five years of measured data at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac and to determine the impact of controlled drainage on drain flow using the filled dataset the shape of the drain flow water table height relationship was found to depend on the selected hydraulic conductivity profile estimated drain flow using the hooghoudt equation with measured water table height for both free draining and controlled periods compared well to observed flow with nash sutcliffe efficiency values above 0 7 and 0 8 for calibration and validation periods respectively using this method together with linear regression for the remaining gaps a long term drain flow record for a controlled drainage experiment at the dpac was used to evaluate the impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow in the controlled drainage sites annual flow was 14 49 lower than free drainage keywords drain flow estimation drainage water management layered soil hydraulic conductivity profile hooghoudt filling gap 1 introduction long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land this is essential for quantifying load used for determining the contribution of tile drains to nutrient loads and the impact of practices that have the potential to reduce loads yet monitoring drain flow is challenging equipment malfunction caused by power interruption lightning strikes and animals often causes data corruptions or interruptions one practice that requires long term flow records to properly evaluate is controlled drainage cd a practice used to reduce the transport of nitrate through tile drainage to surface waters by using a water control structure to vary the depth of the drainage outlet nitrate loss from tile drains with cd systems has been shown to be between 17 and over 80 lower than conventional drainage skaggs et al 2012a but monitoring challenges have made quantification difficult gunn et al 2015 stated that instrument failure and outlet submergence reduced measured drain flow records in a field in ohio and limited understanding of the effects of controlled drainage at the field scale adeuya et al 2012 discussed the restriction in drain flow measurements from two drained farms in indiana because of the submergence conditions of the outlet that required empirical data correction before load calculation cooke and verma 2012 found that uncertainties associated with the flow measurements due to the errors in the low flow measurements and the submergence conditions were the main reasons for uncertainty in annual flow and load estimations when drain flow data has gaps other measurements such as water table depth at a monitoring site may provide additional data that can be used in estimating the missing drain flow the relationship between midpoint water table height above drain m and drain flow q has been investigated in the laboratory or with field experiments since the 1950s luthin and worstell 1957 goins and taylor 1959 hoffman and schwab 1964 luthin and worstell 1957 analyzed field data collected by other researchers and showed that the relationship between m and q was approximately linear for homogeneous soils goins and taylor 1959 also found a linear relationship between m and q under field conditions when the water table is falling continuously however hoffman and schwab 1964 found that for an anisotropic soil the m q relationship was not linear in contrast to the results for homogeneous soils several theoretical equations have been developed for subsurface drainage design since 1940 that use the relationship between m and q hooghoudt 1940 kirkham 1958 van schilfgaarde 1963 yousfi et al 2014 the hooghoudt equation assumes an elliptical water table profile below the soil surface in which q varies with the squared m van schilfgaarde 1963 proposed a theoretical tile spacing equation for a falling water table in homogeneous soils hooghoudt developed the equivalent depth term and then a correction in the van schilfgaarde equation was made by substituting the equivalent depth for the thickness of the water bearing zone bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 although in these equations the goal was to facilitate drainage design these equations have been used to estimate q from m in drainmod skaggs 1978 and also to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity ke of wetland soils skaggs et al 2008 according to goins and taylor 1959 tile flow is more related to the position of the water table in the soil profile than to the height of the water table above the drain m because of the strong influence of the hydraulic conductivity profile in drainage the saturated hydraulic conductivity k is a time invariant physical parameter that varies with depth in the soil column under most field conditions the ke depends on the water table position in the soil profile and therefore varies over time as the water table depth changes the hooghoudt equation assumes a k that is constant with depth which can be unrealistic under most field conditions hydrologic models have assumed various hydraulic conductivity profiles topmodel assumes that k declines exponentially with depth beven and kirkby 1979 while ambroise et al 1996 generalized the topmodel concepts by incorporating different k transmissivity profiles within the original topmodel they introduced two alternative forms of subsurface k profiles including linear and parabolic and showed how the different k profiles can lead to different streamflow recession curves in the drainmod model a layered soil profile is assumed with each layer having a different k skaggs et al 2012b depending on the water table position a ke is calculated as a weighted average of the saturated layers the impact of the various representations of k in layered soils to the relationship between m and q has not been fully recognized even though the strong influence of conductivity in the soil profile on the drain flow was stated half a century ago goins and taylor 1959 drain flow and water table depth data have been collected at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac to evaluate the hydrological and environmental effects of cd however the drain flow record is not complete due to monitoring challenges preventing the calculation of annual flow and limiting the conclusions about nutrient loads the flow measurement limitation provides a motivation to develop a new method for estimating drain flow using measured water table depths the objectives of this paper are therefore to 1 explore the m q relationship using different k profiles in the hooghoudt equation 2 evaluate how well drain flow estimated based on the hooghoudt equation represented the measured flow at this field site and 3 determine the effect of cd on drain flow by estimating drain flow using water table depth observations with the hooghoudt equation for the entire monitoring period 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and field measurements the davis purdue agricultural center dpac is a research farm in eastern indiana located at 40 266 n 85 160 w fig 1 the controlled drainage experimental site is the 0 16 km2 39 acre field field w split into four quadrants northwest nw southwest sw northeast ne and southeast se with areas of 3 5 ha 3 5 ha 3 6 ha and 3 7 ha the elevation change in this field is approximately 3 m 1 slope soils at the site consist of blount silty clay loam somewhat poorly drained condit silty loam poorly drained pewamo clay loam very poorly drained and glynwood silt loam moderately well drained series based on an order 1 soil survey completed in 2001 blumhoff et al 2001 the drainage system was installed in september 2004 with laterals having an approximate depth of 1 m and spacing of 14 m utt 2010 each of the quadrants has its own 15 cm 6 inch sub main that connects to the outlet and empties into the 20 cm 8 inch main outlet at the northwest corner of the field drainage in the se and nw quadrants was controlled during some periods while the sw and ne were allowed to drain conventionally at all times a more detailed description of this site can be found in saadat et al 2017 the subsurface drain flow was monitored with two different methods throughout the study period the original method of monitoring drain flow used pressure transducers to measure water level in a circular flume installed in the subsurface drain brooks 2013 but the flow obtained from this method is uncertain because of frequent submergence of the outlet and errors associated with the measurements therefore these measurements were not used in this study since 2012 flow has been measured every hour by electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 that are installed downstream of the control structures fig 1 and offer the advantage of accurately measuring both forward and backward flow at very low flow as well as high flow levels brooks 2013 drain flow is often restricted downstream of the field by the subsurface county main with limited capacity and therefore backward flow can occur at times of high flow particularly in the lowest nw quadrant having a measure of backward flow enables the calculation of the net drain flow that exits the field electromagnetic flow meters require a signal converter to power the flow meter and provide a user interface to view or change the settings the signal converters however have stopped working many times due to major lightning strikes and for this reason and other sensor malfunctions drain flow data is often missing in each of the quadrants table 1 water table depth was measured throughout the entire 11 year period using observation wells in each quadrant located at the midpoint between two drains and within the expected area of influence of cd based on an elevation difference relative to the outlet of less than 0 3 m bou lahdou 2014 fig 1 these wells were perforated 5 cm pvc pipe installed to a depth of approximately 2 m pressure transducers global water wl 16 measured water table level every hour and data were stored in a data logger fitted inside the top of the pipe in one of the quadrants sw maintenance that required removing and replacing the water table elevation sensor in the observation well led to uncertainty in the absolute water table elevation the sensor measures water table relative to the sensor depth so during periods between maintenance activities the recorded water table elevation was adjusted up or down by a fixed amount relative to the drain elevation based on the assumption that drains flow only when water table is above the drain details of this process are provided in saadat et al 2017 water table depth measurements from june 2006 to december 2016 were used in this study 2 2 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 was used to estimate drain flow based on the measured water table depth this steady state equation is one of the best known of the theoretical drainage equations and is widely used for design and research purposes as selected for use in the drainmod model skaggs 1978 using experimental field data ferro 2016 found that the hooghoudt kirkham 1958 and yousfi et al 2014 theoretical equations for drainage design under steady state conditions had similar performance in estimating the ratio of height of water above drain m over drain spacing l therefore any of these equations can be used for practical applications in reality drainage is a non steady state process but a good approximation of drain flow can be obtained from the steady state formula presented by hooghoudt 1 q 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where q is the drain flow cm hr 1 m is the midpoint water table height above the drain cm for free drainage and above the drain outlet weir cm for controlled drainage ke is the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile cm hr 1 l is the distance between drains cm and de is the equivalent depth from the drain to the impermeable layer cm and can be obtained from the following equations presented by moody 1966 2 d e d 1 d l 8 π ln d r α 0 d l 0 3 3 d e l π 8 ln l r 1 15 d l 0 3 where d is the depth of the impermeable layer below drains cm and r is the effective drain radius alpha can be found by 4 α 3 55 1 6 d l 2 2 l 2 the equivalent depth d e was substituted for d in equation 1 in order to correct the resistance due to radial flow when assuming flow towards the drains is only horizontal the equivalent depth represents an imaginary thinner soil layer below the drains shown in fig 2 through which the same amount of water will flow per unit time as in the actual situation with combined radial and horizontal flow ritzema 1994 2 3 hydraulic conductivity profiles the saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity k varies with depth in many soils and three different theoretical profiles representing the variation in k with depth were compared to explore how the shape of the relationship between q and m varies depending on k profile the first was a constant profile based on the assumption of homogeneous soil in the original form of the hooghoudt equation meaning that the k is constant with depth the second is a layered profile calculating an equivalent effective hydraulic conductivity ke for parallel flow through a layered soil profile based on equation 4 similar to what is used in drainmod skaggs 1978 5 k e i 1 n k i d i i 1 n d i where ki is the hydraulic conductivity and di is the saturated thickness of soil layer i as shown in fig 3 and n is the number of layers in the soil profile ke is determined in each time step before every flow calculation and it depends on the position of water table because the thickness of the saturated zone in each layer di varies linearly with the water table position within the layer if the water table is below the layer di is zero while if the water table is above the layer di is equal to the layer thickness di the third profile was an exponential decline in k with depth which is used for example in topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and other models e g dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k at each depth is given by louis 1974 6 k d k 0 e α d where k 0 is the hydraulic connectivity at the ground surface α is the decay exponent defining the exponential relationship between k and depth and d is the depth below the ground surface fig 4 hydraulic conductivity k is commonly calibrated in models since it tends to be higher than k values measured in the laboratory or in the field chappell et al 1998 blain and milly 1991 hoffman and schwab 1964 also stated that k computed from tile outflow is believed to be a better estimate for tile design than that determined from core and auger hole measurements in the current paper the hooghoudt equation was calibrated with respect to observed m and q by adjusting the k and depth of each layer for the constant and layered k profiles in each time step the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile ke which is dependent on the water table position was calculated using the conductivity and depth values for each layer before the flow estimation k values and layer depths were allowed to change in the range reported in the official soil survey for these soil series for each k value and depth drain flow calculated using the hooghoudt equation was compared with observations and this process continued until the best efficiency and lowest bias between observed and estimated drain flow were obtained because many different combinations of k values provided a high efficiency with low bias the visual fit between the m q relationship from the observed data and the hooghoudt equation was another criteria k values that resulted in an even distribution of observations around the hooghoudt equation were retained a matlab script was written to automate calibration of the hooghoudt equation by adjusting k values in the range of 0 1 0 8 m day and layer depths in the defined range for representative soil series at each quadrant soil survey staff 2017 the pewamo soil series was used to represent the two southern quadrants because it is a very poorly drained soil and will tend to have a higher drain flow compared to other soil series at these plots in addition observation wells are located at this soil series for the two northern quadrants the condit was selected because it was at the well location and compared to the blount it is a more poorly drained soil instead of calibrating the hooghoudt equation for the exponential k profile the equivalent exponential profile was obtained based on the calibrated k values the hydraulic conductivity at the ground surface k0 in eq 5 was assumed to be equal to the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the first layer in the layered profile k1 the decay exponent α in eq 5 was then adjusted to yield an equivalent profile to the layered k profile 2 4 drain flow evaluation drain flow was estimated for each hour for which water table depth was available using the calibrated hooghoudt equation and measured water table depths drain flow estimates were calibrated and validated by comparing them with field observations both visually and statistically daily flow estimates and measurements from 2012 to 2015 were used for calibration and then estimated and measured drain flow from 2016 were used for validation the goodness of fit statistics were used for evaluating the drain flow estimation results including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias or error pe and correlation coefficient r2 7 nse 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i o i 2 8 pe 1 n p i 1 n o i 1 n o i 100 9 r 2 1 n o i p i n o p 2 1 n o i

between minus infinity and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit the value of r2 can vary from zero to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship between the observed and simulated values the pe value can vary from minus infinity to positive infinity a negative value indicates under prediction and positive value indicates over prediction 2 5 filling missing values with regression approach after gaps in drain flow data were filled using the hooghoudt equation and water table depth observations gaps in drain flow estimates remained due to missing values in the water table observations table 2 these missing values were estimated in order to accurately calculate monthly and annual values of drain flow the regression approach has been widely used for filling data gaps tomer et al 2003 haddad et al 2010 and was selected for this study linear regression equations of the daily flow observations from one quadrant against a paired quadrant with the same treatment free or controlled drainage were developed and utilized to fill the missing values fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 implication of different k profiles on the m q relationship the constant exponential and layered k profiles are shown in fig 6 for the sw quadrant for the layered profile calibrated k values by layer for each quadrant table 3 were used the total depth of the soil profile is defined by de the k is higher in the top layer in the nw and sw quadrants but higher in the bottom layer in the ne and se quadrants the soil series at the well location for both se and sw are the same however the proportions and locations of different soils within these quadrants are different and that can affect on the calibrated k values the reason for having a larger conductivity in the bottom layer of two quadrants is unknown one possible reason may be a sand layer below the tile drain or other heterogeneity in this glacial landscape for the constant profile k was also calibrated while for the exponential profile an equivalent profile to the layered soil table 4 was used to maintain the same average conductivity fig 7 shows how the hooghoudt equation can represent the m q relationship differently from a linear to parabolic relationship depending on the selected conductivity profile different k profiles resulted in a different relationship between m and q except for the nw quadrant where both constant and layered k profiles revealed almost the same relationship in all cases the constant k profile yields an approximately linear relationship that is consistent with earlier observations luthin and worstell 1957 goins and taylor 1959 these results indicate that there is not any conflict between the previous observations and the hooghoudt equation since hooghoudt can appear linear if the constant k profile is used in the equation however the relationship between m and q is not always linear for all fields and the correct k profile should be recognized and used in the hooghoudt equation these relationships are consistent with expected behavior in homogeneous soils k is constant with depth and therefore when water table drops through the soil profile drain flow decreases proportionally which results in an approximately linear plot of the m versus q however in the layered soils ke depends on the water table position in the soil profile this could lead to a non linear relationship between m and q in the layered soils for example if the top soil layer has a higher k e g sw and nw quadrants when the water table is near the surface the higher k is the predominant factor in the ke as reported by hoffman 1963 therefore when water table is in this layer drain flow decreases proportionally to a drop in water table however when the water table drops below the top layer the k of other layers are predominant and usually lower than the top layer and this can lead to a decrease in flow while water table has not decreased correspondingly 3 2 drain flow estimates using layered k profile among the three discussed hydraulic conductivity k profiles the layered k profile was chosen for prediction of drain flow because the layered k profile is more physically representative due to its relation to soil horizons in the soil profile this allows consideration of an anomalous layer such as a sand layer in between other soil layers while the non monotonic changes in k with depth is not accurately representable by the exponential profile the layered k profile is also more physically realistic due to soil compaction impacts on conductivity in homogenous soils that k is assumed constant soil compaction can decrease the k exponentially with depth while k which is related to the soil texture can vary for different soil layers in the layered k profile the relationship between observed daily m versus observed q and the observed m versus estimated q from the hooghoudt equation using layered k profile table 3 in the calibration period are shown in fig 8 in this figure rising water table events are separated from falling water table events to examine potential hysteresis in the m versus q relationship for the entire drainage period however the difference was found to be small for daily values and since the main goal of this analysis was to estimate drain flow for the entire drainage period both falling and rising events were considered together in the analysis drain flow is also constrained by the hydraulics of the drainage pipes for the outlet drains of these 3 5 ha quadrants which consist of corrugated pipes with diameter 15 cm at a slope of 0 1 the maximum flow is estimated to be 10 mm day asabe standards 2015 in the nw quadrant the hydraulic limit is lower because of an undersized outlet for the field and was set at 6 mm day based on observed maximum flow the se quadrant also appeared to have a lower flow limit but the 10 mm value was used since there was no known physical basis for a lower limit and other factors such as errors in the water table depth and drain flow measurements might have contributed to those scattered high water table events in this quadrant daily estimated and observed drain flow for the four year calibration period were in good agreement table 5 drain flow was under predicted in the ne and se quadrants and over predicted in the sw and nw quadrants with the lowest pe of 2 and the highest of 15 in the sw and se quadrants respectively in general free draining and controlled quadrants performed similarly in predicting drain flow although the nw which is a controlled quadrant had lower nse other factors such as restriction of drain flow through the main may be contributing to the lower performance of this quadrant in predicting flow in order to better understand the effect of controlled drainage on flow prediction free drainage and controlled drainage periods were separated and results showed that even in free drainage periods the nw had lower efficiency than other quadrants nse 0 7 time series of predicted and observed drain flow were plotted and compared visually an example for 9 months in the sw quadrant is shown in fig 9 besides the high values obtained for the nse visual inspection of this figure also indicates a good agreement between estimated and observed drain flow validation of the method using calibrated ke was conducted by comparing estimated and observed drain flow for 2016 fig 10 values obtained for both r2 and nse were above 0 8 for all four quadrants indicating a good agreement between estimated and observed values nse values of 0 91 and 0 84 for estimated drain flow in sw and nw quadrants respectively were even higher than that in the calibration period and for the other two quadrants nse were in a similar range predicted and observed drain flow were also compared on a monthly basis to determine whether the relationship predicts drain flow more accurately in some months than others fig 11 this figure indicates the differences between the total monthly values of predicted and observed drain flow including months when both observed and predicted values were available for all days in some months there was a complete drain flow dataset at least in one of the years however there was not any year with observation data for october in the ne and for december in the se quadrants in general months with higher flow had more disagreement between observed and predicted values specifically in the nw quadrant once again due to the downstream flow restrictions in the outlet backward flow occurred in this quadrant resulting in observed values that are lower than predictions the highest difference was in the nw quadrant in june 2015 with around 36 mm over prediction which occurred during very high flow total precipitation was 265 mm month while the 10 year mean precipitation for this month is only 135 mm month backward flow occurred in this quadrant more than 5 of the time during this month and the over prediction indicates an error in the method when flow is restricted downstream this could be addressed in future work by considering separately the periods when the pipes are pressurized by looking at the pressure transducer data available only for some periods at this site overall results indicate that calibrated ke and the hooghoudt equation did a good job in predicting daily drain flow from water table depth observations and this method can be used to estimate drain flow for the entire period of study however there are uncertainties associated with this method the hooghoudt equation is not a perfect representation of the physical system and the high variability of k over the field limits precision measurement uncertainties related to the water table and drain flow values can lead to parameter uncertainty in calibration of the hooghoudt equation the flow meter had an accuracy better than 2 at all flow levels and 0 2 at higher flow krohne waterflux 3070 2016 and the uncertainty related to the water level sensors was 0 2 of the full range global water wl 16 water 2016 an additional source of uncertainty for this experimental field could be more due to the limitation caused by the drain outlet and backward flow that sometimes occurred and the fact that this method is not able to take the backward flow into account 3 3 effect of controlled drainage on drain flow hourly drain flow was estimated for the whole range of water table heights from july 2006 through december 2016 using the calibrated ke and the hooghoudt equation estimated drain flow was combined with observations for the periods that drain flow were accurately measured at dpac 2012 2016 while only estimates of drain flow were used for the former years of study 2006 2011 the remaining gaps in drain flow were then filled using linear regression equations and the filled flow record used to determine the effect of controlled drainage at this site by comparing annual and monthly drain flow in free and controlled quadrants time series for 11 years of annual drain flow and precipitation are shown in fig 12 annual drain flow tended to follow the same trend for all quadrants except for the se quadrant in 2008 when annual flow decreased while it increased in other quadrants this could be due to the large number of missing days in this quadrant in the previous year 2007 210 missing days that has led to a higher flow value where the paired quadrant regression has been used for filling the gaps between the two free quadrants the ne usually has higher flow compared to the sw quadrant possibly because of a neighboring farm that allowed water to enter towards the northeast section of the experimental field overall annual drain flow followed the annual trends in precipitation as total precipitation increased annual flow increased annual drain flow for both free quadrants was greater than controlled quadrants the overall reduction in drain flow with cd over the 11 year period was 1182 mm the 11 year averages of annual drain flow and flow rate for each quadrant are given in table 6 the average annual drain flow of the two free and the two controlled quadrants was also calculated and compared for each year the results showed that the average annual drain flow of controlled quadrants was lower than free quadrants in all years between 14 and 49 this reduction is comparable to other findings reported in the literature as adeuya et al 2012 found a 15 24 decrease in annual drain flow with cd from a field in indiana similarly reductions of 18 to over 85 in the average annual flow with cd have been reported in the review by skaggs et al 2012a which included results from illinois iowa north carolina and ohio and also sweden and ontario more recently williams et al 2015 also reported 8 34 reduction in the annual flow with cd from a site in ohio the 11 year average of monthly drain flow fig 13 indicates the seasonal changes in drain flow as expected during the months that drainage was controlled monthly drain flow was greater in free quadrants than controlled in other months such as may june july october and november the average flow in controlled quadrants was more similar to the free quadrants in these months the height to which the outlet was raised in the control structure was lower than other months of control or no management was done at that time and all quadrants were freely drained this relatively higher flow in controlled quadrants during the months that all quadrants were freely drained or the outlet was not raised as high as other months again indicates the effectiveness of the controlled drainage in reducing monthly flow 4 conclusions this study explores how variation in hydraulic conductivity k with depth within field sites affects the observed relationship between midpoint water table height above drain and drain flow this clarifies interpretation of field results and demonstrates that the hooghoudt equation may still be applicable even when field data does not show the classic parabolic curve with this understanding this study demonstrates that drain flow can be estimated from the hooghoudt equation using water table depth measurements examination of the shape of the relatoinship of the water table height above drain m and drain flow q under various k profiles showed that the hooghoudt equation can be linear or parabolic depending on the selected k profile drain flow estimated from water table height using the layered k profile and the hooghoudt equation compared well to observed flow in both calibration and validation periods suggesting that this method could be used to fill in or extend the incomplete drain flow records when water table depth measurements are available using this method together with linear regression for the remaining gaps a long term drain flow record for a controlled drainage cd experiment at the davis purdue agriculture center was used to evaluate the impacts of cd on drain flow in the controlled drainage quadrants annual flow was 14 49 lower than free drainage the annual flow reductions ranged from 67 mm year to 200 mm year over the 11 year study period in the future these filled data sets will be used to evaluate the effect of cd on the nutrient losses through subsurface flow the long record of continuous drain flow will help to better evaluate the effects of cd on water quality and allow for a better understanding of the annual and seasonal changes in both the hydrological and environmental impacts of cd acknowledgements this

7558,long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land missing data due to equipment malfunction and other challenges have limited conclusions that can be made about annual flow and thus nutrient loads from field studies including assessments of the effect of controlled drainage water table depth data may be available during gaps in flow data providing a basis for filling missing drain flow data therefore the overall goal of this study was to examine the potential to estimate drain flow using water table observations the objectives were to evaluate how the shape of the relationship between drain flow and water table height above drain varies depending on the soil hydraulic conductivity profile to quantify how well the hooghoudt equation represented the water table drain flow relationship in five years of measured data at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac and to determine the impact of controlled drainage on drain flow using the filled dataset the shape of the drain flow water table height relationship was found to depend on the selected hydraulic conductivity profile estimated drain flow using the hooghoudt equation with measured water table height for both free draining and controlled periods compared well to observed flow with nash sutcliffe efficiency values above 0 7 and 0 8 for calibration and validation periods respectively using this method together with linear regression for the remaining gaps a long term drain flow record for a controlled drainage experiment at the dpac was used to evaluate the impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow in the controlled drainage sites annual flow was 14 49 lower than free drainage keywords drain flow estimation drainage water management layered soil hydraulic conductivity profile hooghoudt filling gap 1 introduction long records of continuous drain flow are important for quantifying annual and seasonal changes in the subsurface drainage flow from drained agricultural land this is essential for quantifying load used for determining the contribution of tile drains to nutrient loads and the impact of practices that have the potential to reduce loads yet monitoring drain flow is challenging equipment malfunction caused by power interruption lightning strikes and animals often causes data corruptions or interruptions one practice that requires long term flow records to properly evaluate is controlled drainage cd a practice used to reduce the transport of nitrate through tile drainage to surface waters by using a water control structure to vary the depth of the drainage outlet nitrate loss from tile drains with cd systems has been shown to be between 17 and over 80 lower than conventional drainage skaggs et al 2012a but monitoring challenges have made quantification difficult gunn et al 2015 stated that instrument failure and outlet submergence reduced measured drain flow records in a field in ohio and limited understanding of the effects of controlled drainage at the field scale adeuya et al 2012 discussed the restriction in drain flow measurements from two drained farms in indiana because of the submergence conditions of the outlet that required empirical data correction before load calculation cooke and verma 2012 found that uncertainties associated with the flow measurements due to the errors in the low flow measurements and the submergence conditions were the main reasons for uncertainty in annual flow and load estimations when drain flow data has gaps other measurements such as water table depth at a monitoring site may provide additional data that can be used in estimating the missing drain flow the relationship between midpoint water table height above drain m and drain flow q has been investigated in the laboratory or with field experiments since the 1950s luthin and worstell 1957 goins and taylor 1959 hoffman and schwab 1964 luthin and worstell 1957 analyzed field data collected by other researchers and showed that the relationship between m and q was approximately linear for homogeneous soils goins and taylor 1959 also found a linear relationship between m and q under field conditions when the water table is falling continuously however hoffman and schwab 1964 found that for an anisotropic soil the m q relationship was not linear in contrast to the results for homogeneous soils several theoretical equations have been developed for subsurface drainage design since 1940 that use the relationship between m and q hooghoudt 1940 kirkham 1958 van schilfgaarde 1963 yousfi et al 2014 the hooghoudt equation assumes an elliptical water table profile below the soil surface in which q varies with the squared m van schilfgaarde 1963 proposed a theoretical tile spacing equation for a falling water table in homogeneous soils hooghoudt developed the equivalent depth term and then a correction in the van schilfgaarde equation was made by substituting the equivalent depth for the thickness of the water bearing zone bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 although in these equations the goal was to facilitate drainage design these equations have been used to estimate q from m in drainmod skaggs 1978 and also to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity ke of wetland soils skaggs et al 2008 according to goins and taylor 1959 tile flow is more related to the position of the water table in the soil profile than to the height of the water table above the drain m because of the strong influence of the hydraulic conductivity profile in drainage the saturated hydraulic conductivity k is a time invariant physical parameter that varies with depth in the soil column under most field conditions the ke depends on the water table position in the soil profile and therefore varies over time as the water table depth changes the hooghoudt equation assumes a k that is constant with depth which can be unrealistic under most field conditions hydrologic models have assumed various hydraulic conductivity profiles topmodel assumes that k declines exponentially with depth beven and kirkby 1979 while ambroise et al 1996 generalized the topmodel concepts by incorporating different k transmissivity profiles within the original topmodel they introduced two alternative forms of subsurface k profiles including linear and parabolic and showed how the different k profiles can lead to different streamflow recession curves in the drainmod model a layered soil profile is assumed with each layer having a different k skaggs et al 2012b depending on the water table position a ke is calculated as a weighted average of the saturated layers the impact of the various representations of k in layered soils to the relationship between m and q has not been fully recognized even though the strong influence of conductivity in the soil profile on the drain flow was stated half a century ago goins and taylor 1959 drain flow and water table depth data have been collected at the davis purdue agricultural center dpac to evaluate the hydrological and environmental effects of cd however the drain flow record is not complete due to monitoring challenges preventing the calculation of annual flow and limiting the conclusions about nutrient loads the flow measurement limitation provides a motivation to develop a new method for estimating drain flow using measured water table depths the objectives of this paper are therefore to 1 explore the m q relationship using different k profiles in the hooghoudt equation 2 evaluate how well drain flow estimated based on the hooghoudt equation represented the measured flow at this field site and 3 determine the effect of cd on drain flow by estimating drain flow using water table depth observations with the hooghoudt equation for the entire monitoring period 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and field measurements the davis purdue agricultural center dpac is a research farm in eastern indiana located at 40 266 n 85 160 w fig 1 the controlled drainage experimental site is the 0 16 km2 39 acre field field w split into four quadrants northwest nw southwest sw northeast ne and southeast se with areas of 3 5 ha 3 5 ha 3 6 ha and 3 7 ha the elevation change in this field is approximately 3 m 1 slope soils at the site consist of blount silty clay loam somewhat poorly drained condit silty loam poorly drained pewamo clay loam very poorly drained and glynwood silt loam moderately well drained series based on an order 1 soil survey completed in 2001 blumhoff et al 2001 the drainage system was installed in september 2004 with laterals having an approximate depth of 1 m and spacing of 14 m utt 2010 each of the quadrants has its own 15 cm 6 inch sub main that connects to the outlet and empties into the 20 cm 8 inch main outlet at the northwest corner of the field drainage in the se and nw quadrants was controlled during some periods while the sw and ne were allowed to drain conventionally at all times a more detailed description of this site can be found in saadat et al 2017 the subsurface drain flow was monitored with two different methods throughout the study period the original method of monitoring drain flow used pressure transducers to measure water level in a circular flume installed in the subsurface drain brooks 2013 but the flow obtained from this method is uncertain because of frequent submergence of the outlet and errors associated with the measurements therefore these measurements were not used in this study since 2012 flow has been measured every hour by electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 that are installed downstream of the control structures fig 1 and offer the advantage of accurately measuring both forward and backward flow at very low flow as well as high flow levels brooks 2013 drain flow is often restricted downstream of the field by the subsurface county main with limited capacity and therefore backward flow can occur at times of high flow particularly in the lowest nw quadrant having a measure of backward flow enables the calculation of the net drain flow that exits the field electromagnetic flow meters require a signal converter to power the flow meter and provide a user interface to view or change the settings the signal converters however have stopped working many times due to major lightning strikes and for this reason and other sensor malfunctions drain flow data is often missing in each of the quadrants table 1 water table depth was measured throughout the entire 11 year period using observation wells in each quadrant located at the midpoint between two drains and within the expected area of influence of cd based on an elevation difference relative to the outlet of less than 0 3 m bou lahdou 2014 fig 1 these wells were perforated 5 cm pvc pipe installed to a depth of approximately 2 m pressure transducers global water wl 16 measured water table level every hour and data were stored in a data logger fitted inside the top of the pipe in one of the quadrants sw maintenance that required removing and replacing the water table elevation sensor in the observation well led to uncertainty in the absolute water table elevation the sensor measures water table relative to the sensor depth so during periods between maintenance activities the recorded water table elevation was adjusted up or down by a fixed amount relative to the drain elevation based on the assumption that drains flow only when water table is above the drain details of this process are provided in saadat et al 2017 water table depth measurements from june 2006 to december 2016 were used in this study 2 2 hooghoudt equation the hooghoudt equation bouwer and van schilfgaarde 1963 was used to estimate drain flow based on the measured water table depth this steady state equation is one of the best known of the theoretical drainage equations and is widely used for design and research purposes as selected for use in the drainmod model skaggs 1978 using experimental field data ferro 2016 found that the hooghoudt kirkham 1958 and yousfi et al 2014 theoretical equations for drainage design under steady state conditions had similar performance in estimating the ratio of height of water above drain m over drain spacing l therefore any of these equations can be used for practical applications in reality drainage is a non steady state process but a good approximation of drain flow can be obtained from the steady state formula presented by hooghoudt 1 q 4 k e m 2 d e m l 2 where q is the drain flow cm hr 1 m is the midpoint water table height above the drain cm for free drainage and above the drain outlet weir cm for controlled drainage ke is the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile cm hr 1 l is the distance between drains cm and de is the equivalent depth from the drain to the impermeable layer cm and can be obtained from the following equations presented by moody 1966 2 d e d 1 d l 8 π ln d r α 0 d l 0 3 3 d e l π 8 ln l r 1 15 d l 0 3 where d is the depth of the impermeable layer below drains cm and r is the effective drain radius alpha can be found by 4 α 3 55 1 6 d l 2 2 l 2 the equivalent depth d e was substituted for d in equation 1 in order to correct the resistance due to radial flow when assuming flow towards the drains is only horizontal the equivalent depth represents an imaginary thinner soil layer below the drains shown in fig 2 through which the same amount of water will flow per unit time as in the actual situation with combined radial and horizontal flow ritzema 1994 2 3 hydraulic conductivity profiles the saturated lateral hydraulic conductivity k varies with depth in many soils and three different theoretical profiles representing the variation in k with depth were compared to explore how the shape of the relationship between q and m varies depending on k profile the first was a constant profile based on the assumption of homogeneous soil in the original form of the hooghoudt equation meaning that the k is constant with depth the second is a layered profile calculating an equivalent effective hydraulic conductivity ke for parallel flow through a layered soil profile based on equation 4 similar to what is used in drainmod skaggs 1978 5 k e i 1 n k i d i i 1 n d i where ki is the hydraulic conductivity and di is the saturated thickness of soil layer i as shown in fig 3 and n is the number of layers in the soil profile ke is determined in each time step before every flow calculation and it depends on the position of water table because the thickness of the saturated zone in each layer di varies linearly with the water table position within the layer if the water table is below the layer di is zero while if the water table is above the layer di is equal to the layer thickness di the third profile was an exponential decline in k with depth which is used for example in topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 and other models e g dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k at each depth is given by louis 1974 6 k d k 0 e α d where k 0 is the hydraulic connectivity at the ground surface α is the decay exponent defining the exponential relationship between k and depth and d is the depth below the ground surface fig 4 hydraulic conductivity k is commonly calibrated in models since it tends to be higher than k values measured in the laboratory or in the field chappell et al 1998 blain and milly 1991 hoffman and schwab 1964 also stated that k computed from tile outflow is believed to be a better estimate for tile design than that determined from core and auger hole measurements in the current paper the hooghoudt equation was calibrated with respect to observed m and q by adjusting the k and depth of each layer for the constant and layered k profiles in each time step the effective lateral hydraulic conductivity of the profile ke which is dependent on the water table position was calculated using the conductivity and depth values for each layer before the flow estimation k values and layer depths were allowed to change in the range reported in the official soil survey for these soil series for each k value and depth drain flow calculated using the hooghoudt equation was compared with observations and this process continued until the best efficiency and lowest bias between observed and estimated drain flow were obtained because many different combinations of k values provided a high efficiency with low bias the visual fit between the m q relationship from the observed data and the hooghoudt equation was another criteria k values that resulted in an even distribution of observations around the hooghoudt equation were retained a matlab script was written to automate calibration of the hooghoudt equation by adjusting k values in the range of 0 1 0 8 m day and layer depths in the defined range for representative soil series at each quadrant soil survey staff 2017 the pewamo soil series was used to represent the two southern quadrants because it is a very poorly drained soil and will tend to have a higher drain flow compared to other soil series at these plots in addition observation wells are located at this soil series for the two northern quadrants the condit was selected because it was at the well location and compared to the blount it is a more poorly drained soil instead of calibrating the hooghoudt equation for the exponential k profile the equivalent exponential profile was obtained based on the calibrated k values the hydraulic conductivity at the ground surface k0 in eq 5 was assumed to be equal to the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of the first layer in the layered profile k1 the decay exponent α in eq 5 was then adjusted to yield an equivalent profile to the layered k profile 2 4 drain flow evaluation drain flow was estimated for each hour for which water table depth was available using the calibrated hooghoudt equation and measured water table depths drain flow estimates were calibrated and validated by comparing them with field observations both visually and statistically daily flow estimates and measurements from 2012 to 2015 were used for calibration and then estimated and measured drain flow from 2016 were used for validation the goodness of fit statistics were used for evaluating the drain flow estimation results including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse the percent bias or error pe and correlation coefficient r2 7 nse 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i o i 2 8 pe 1 n p i 1 n o i 1 n o i 100 9 r 2 1 n o i p i n o p 2 1 n o i 2 n o 2 1 n p i 2 n p 2 where o i is the daily measured value pi is the daily simulated o i is the average of measured values p i is the average of simulated values and n is the number of observed values the nse assesses the predictive power of a hydrological model and the r2 is a measure of how well trends in the estimated values follow trends in the observed values the nse value can vary between minus infinity and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect fit the value of r2 can vary from zero to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship between the observed and simulated values the pe value can vary from minus infinity to positive infinity a negative value indicates under prediction and positive value indicates over prediction 2 5 filling missing values with regression approach after gaps in drain flow data were filled using the hooghoudt equation and water table depth observations gaps in drain flow estimates remained due to missing values in the water table observations table 2 these missing values were estimated in order to accurately calculate monthly and annual values of drain flow the regression approach has been widely used for filling data gaps tomer et al 2003 haddad et al 2010 and was selected for this study linear regression equations of the daily flow observations from one quadrant against a paired quadrant with the same treatment free or controlled drainage were developed and utilized to fill the missing values fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 implication of different k profiles on the m q relationship the constant exponential and layered k profiles are shown in fig 6 for the sw quadrant for the layered profile calibrated k values by layer for each quadrant table 3 were used the total depth of the soil profile is defined by de the k is higher in the top layer in the nw and sw quadrants but higher in the bottom layer in the ne and se quadrants the soil series at the well location for both se and sw are the same however the proportions and locations of different soils within these quadrants are different and that can affect on the calibrated k values the reason for having a larger conductivity in the bottom layer of two quadrants is unknown one possible reason may be a sand layer below the tile drain or other heterogeneity in this glacial landscape for the constant profile k was also calibrated while for the exponential profile an equivalent profile to the layered soil table 4 was used to maintain the same average conductivity fig 7 shows how the hooghoudt equation can represent the m q relationship differently from a linear to parabolic relationship depending on the selected conductivity profile different k profiles resulted in a different relationship between m and q except for the nw quadrant where both constant and layered k profiles revealed almost the same relationship in all cases the constant k profile yields an approximately linear relationship that is consistent with earlier observations luthin and worstell 1957 goins and taylor 1959 these results indicate that there is not any conflict between the previous observations and the hooghoudt equation since hooghoudt can appear linear if the constant k profile is used in the equation however the relationship between m and q is not always linear for all fields and the correct k profile should be recognized and used in the hooghoudt equation these relationships are consistent with expected behavior in homogeneous soils k is constant with depth and therefore when water table drops through the soil profile drain flow decreases proportionally which results in an approximately linear plot of the m versus q however in the layered soils ke depends on the water table position in the soil profile this could lead to a non linear relationship between m and q in the layered soils for example if the top soil layer has a higher k e g sw and nw quadrants when the water table is near the surface the higher k is the predominant factor in the ke as reported by hoffman 1963 therefore when water table is in this layer drain flow decreases proportionally to a drop in water table however when the water table drops below the top layer the k of other layers are predominant and usually lower than the top layer and this can lead to a decrease in flow while water table has not decreased correspondingly 3 2 drain flow estimates using layered k profile among the three discussed hydraulic conductivity k profiles the layered k profile was chosen for prediction of drain flow because the layered k profile is more physically representative due to its relation to soil horizons in the soil profile this allows consideration of an anomalous layer such as a sand layer in between other soil layers while the non monotonic changes in k with depth is not accurately representable by the exponential profile the layered k profile is also more physically realistic due to soil compaction impacts on conductivity in homogenous soils that k is assumed constant soil compaction can decrease the k exponentially with depth while k which is related to the soil texture can vary for different soil layers in the layered k profile the relationship between observed daily m versus observed q and the observed m versus estimated q from the hooghoudt equation using layered k profile table 3 in the calibration period are shown in fig 8 in this figure rising water table events are separated from falling water table events to examine potential hysteresis in the m versus q relationship for the entire drainage period however the difference was found to be small for daily values and since the main goal of this analysis was to estimate drain flow for the entire drainage period both falling and rising events were considered together in the analysis drain flow is also constrained by the hydraulics of the drainage pipes for the outlet drains of these 3 5 ha quadrants which consist of corrugated pipes with diameter 15 cm at a slope of 0 1 the maximum flow is estimated to be 10 mm day asabe standards 2015 in the nw quadrant the hydraulic limit is lower because of an undersized outlet for the field and was set at 6 mm day based on observed maximum flow the se quadrant also appeared to have a lower flow limit but the 10 mm value was used since there was no known physical basis for a lower limit and other factors such as errors in the water table depth and drain flow measurements might have contributed to those scattered high water table events in this quadrant daily estimated and observed drain flow for the four year calibration period were in good agreement table 5 drain flow was under predicted in the ne and se quadrants and over predicted in the sw and nw quadrants with the lowest pe of 2 and the highest of 15 in the sw and se quadrants respectively in general free draining and controlled quadrants performed similarly in predicting drain flow although the nw which is a controlled quadrant had lower nse other factors such as restriction of drain flow through the main may be contributing to the lower performance of this quadrant in predicting flow in order to better understand the effect of controlled drainage on flow prediction free drainage and controlled drainage periods were separated and results showed that even in free drainage periods the nw had lower efficiency than other quadrants nse 0 7 time series of predicted and observed drain flow were plotted and compared visually an example for 9 months in the sw quadrant is shown in fig 9 besides the high values obtained for the nse visual inspection of this figure also indicates a good agreement between estimated and observed drain flow validation of the method using calibrated ke was conducted by comparing estimated and observed drain flow for 2016 fig 10 values obtained for both r2 and nse were above 0 8 for all four quadrants indicating a good agreement between estimated and observed values nse values of 0 91 and 0 84 for estimated drain flow in sw and nw quadrants respectively were even higher than that in the calibration period and for the other two quadrants nse were in a similar range predicted and observed drain flow were also compared on a monthly basis to determine whether the relationship predicts drain flow more accurately in some months than others fig 11 this figure indicates the differences between the total monthly values of predicted and observed drain flow including months when both observed and predicted values were available for all days in some months there was a complete drain flow dataset at least in one of the years however there was not any year with observation data for october in the ne and for december in the se quadrants in general months with higher flow had more disagreement between observed and predicted values specifically in the nw quadrant once again due to the downstream flow restrictions in the outlet backward flow occurred in this quadrant resulting in observed values that are lower than predictions the highest difference was in the nw quadrant in june 2015 with around 36 mm over prediction which occurred during very high flow total precipitation was 265 mm month while the 10 year mean precipitation for this month is only 135 mm month backward flow occurred in this quadrant more than 5 of the time during this month and the over prediction indicates an error in the method when flow is restricted downstream this could be addressed in future work by considering separately the periods when the pipes are pressurized by looking at the pressure transducer data available only for some periods at this site overall results indicate that calibrated ke and the hooghoudt equation did a good job in predicting daily drain flow from water table depth observations and this method can be used to estimate drain flow for the entire period of study however there are uncertainties associated with this method the hooghoudt equation is not a perfect representation of the physical system and the high variability of k over the field limits precision measurement uncertainties related to the water table and drain flow values can lead to parameter uncertainty in calibration of the hooghoudt equation the flow meter had an accuracy better than 2 at all flow levels and 0 2 at higher flow krohne waterflux 3070 2016 and the uncertainty related to the water level sensors was 0 2 of the full range global water wl 16 water 2016 an additional source of uncertainty for this experimental field could be more due to the limitation caused by the drain outlet and backward flow that sometimes occurred and the fact that this method is not able to take the backward flow into account 3 3 effect of controlled drainage on drain flow hourly drain flow was estimated for the whole range of water table heights from july 2006 through december 2016 using the calibrated ke and the hooghoudt equation estimated drain flow was combined with observations for the periods that drain flow were accurately measured at dpac 2012 2016 while only estimates of drain flow were used for the former years of study 2006 2011 the remaining gaps in drain flow were then filled using linear regression equations and the filled flow record used to determine the effect of controlled drainage at this site by comparing annual and monthly drain flow in free and controlled quadrants time series for 11 years of annual drain flow and precipitation are shown in fig 12 annual drain flow tended to follow the same trend for all quadrants except for the se quadrant in 2008 when annual flow decreased while it increased in other quadrants this could be due to the large number of missing days in this quadrant in the previous year 2007 210 missing days that has led to a higher flow value where the paired quadrant regression has been used for filling the gaps between the two free quadrants the ne usually has higher flow compared to the sw quadrant possibly because of a neighboring farm that allowed water to enter towards the northeast section of the experimental field overall annual drain flow followed the annual trends in precipitation as total precipitation increased annual flow increased annual drain flow for both free quadrants was greater than controlled quadrants the overall reduction in drain flow with cd over the 11 year period was 1182 mm the 11 year averages of annual drain flow and flow rate for each quadrant are given in table 6 the average annual drain flow of the two free and the two controlled quadrants was also calculated and compared for each year the results showed that the average annual drain flow of controlled quadrants was lower than free quadrants in all years between 14 and 49 this reduction is comparable to other findings reported in the literature as adeuya et al 2012 found a 15 24 decrease in annual drain flow with cd from a field in indiana similarly reductions of 18 to over 85 in the average annual flow with cd have been reported in the review by skaggs et al 2012a which included results from illinois iowa north carolina and ohio and also sweden and ontario more recently williams et al 2015 also reported 8 34 reduction in the annual flow with cd from a site in ohio the 11 year average of monthly drain flow fig 13 indicates the seasonal changes in drain flow as expected during the months that drainage was controlled monthly drain flow was greater in free quadrants than controlled in other months such as may june july october and november the average flow in controlled quadrants was more similar to the free quadrants in these months the height to which the outlet was raised in the control structure was lower than other months of control or no management was done at that time and all quadrants were freely drained this relatively higher flow in controlled quadrants during the months that all quadrants were freely drained or the outlet was not raised as high as other months again indicates the effectiveness of the controlled drainage in reducing monthly flow 4 conclusions this study explores how variation in hydraulic conductivity k with depth within field sites affects the observed relationship between midpoint water table height above drain and drain flow this clarifies interpretation of field results and demonstrates that the hooghoudt equation may still be applicable even when field data does not show the classic parabolic curve with this understanding this study demonstrates that drain flow can be estimated from the hooghoudt equation using water table depth measurements examination of the shape of the relatoinship of the water table height above drain m and drain flow q under various k profiles showed that the hooghoudt equation can be linear or parabolic depending on the selected k profile drain flow estimated from water table height using the layered k profile and the hooghoudt equation compared well to observed flow in both calibration and validation periods suggesting that this method could be used to fill in or extend the incomplete drain flow records when water table depth measurements are available using this method together with linear regression for the remaining gaps a long term drain flow record for a controlled drainage cd experiment at the davis purdue agriculture center was used to evaluate the impacts of cd on drain flow in the controlled drainage quadrants annual flow was 14 49 lower than free drainage the annual flow reductions ranged from 67 mm year to 200 mm year over the 11 year study period in the future these filled data sets will be used to evaluate the effect of cd on the nutrient losses through subsurface flow the long record of continuous drain flow will help to better evaluate the effects of cd on water quality and allow for a better understanding of the annual and seasonal changes in both the hydrological and environmental impacts of cd acknowledgements this

7559,several large scale field campaigns have been conducted over the last 20 years that require accurate measurements of soil moisture conditions these measurements are manually conducted using soil moisture probes which require calibration the calibration process involves the collection of hundreds of soil moisture cores which is extremely labor intensive in 2012 a field campaign was conducted in southern manitoba in which 55 fields were sampled and calibration equations were derived for each field the soil moisture active passive experiment 2016 smapvex16 was conducted in this same region and 21 of the same fields were resampled this study examines the temporal transferability of calibration equations between these two field campaigns it was found that the larger range in soil moisture over which samples were collected in 2012 average range 0 11 0 41 m3 m 3 generally resulted in lower errors when used in 2016 average range 0 24 0 44 m3 m 3 than the equations derived in 2016 when used with data collected in 2012 combining the data collected in 2012 and 2016 did not improve the errors overall these results suggest that the transfer of calibration equations from one year to the next is not recommended keywords soil moisture calibration impedance probes 1 introduction knowledge of soil moisture variability both spatially and temporally at different scales is important for the validation of applications such as land surface models and remote sensing products crow et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2008 western et al 2002 although gravimetric sampling provides the most accurate estimation of soil moisture it is labor intensive and time consuming electromagnetic sensors have been investigated extensively as an alternative for measuring soil moisture numerous studies have been conducted which investigate calibration strategies for soil moisture sensors that relate the measured soil dielectric permittivity to soil water content through e g bogena et al 2017 ojo et al 2015 rosenbaum et al 2010 rowlandson et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 studies have also examined the variability between different commercially available soil moisture sensors a study by walker et al 2004 found that sensors requiring soil disturbance for installation presented the highest errors in soil moistures retrieval despite calibration efforts cosh et al 2016 using data from a soil moisture sensor testbed found that electromagnetic sensors installed at a depth of 5 cm when scaled to the field had similar root mean square errors all of which were 0 04 m3 m 3 more specifically studies have noted that lower frequency sensors exhibit sensitivity in the measurements of the soil dielectric permittivity resulting from the soil electrical conductivity seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and murdock 2004 and changes in soil temperature merlin et al 2007 wraith and or 1999 inter sensor variability is an issue that has been noted in several studies e g bogena et al 2017 cosh et al 2016 rosenbaum et al 2010 seyfried and murdock 2004 however it has been noted that sensor specific calibrations which prior deriving a relationship between the soil water content and the soil dielectric permittivity measurements are first made in media of known dielectric permittivity to determine inter sensor variability rosenbaum et al 2010 large scale field campaigns 502 km2 have been held where surface soil moisture measurements have been collected across a defined domain in an effort to capture the intra and inter field soil moisture variability particularly as it relates to remote sensing applications some of these field campaigns include the southern great plains 1997 sgp97 hydrology experiment mohanty et al 2002 the soil moisture experiments smex in 2002 bindlish et al 2006 2003 bosch et al 2006

recently the smapvex16 field experiment which was conducted in the same general region as the smapvex12 campaign in each of the aforementioned field campaigns transects or grids of soil moisture were manually sampled at varying spatial scales for each field campaign large quantities of soil cores were collected to derive calibration equations cosh et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 in smapvex12 for example over 700 cores were collected over the duration of the six week field campaign rowlandson et al 2013 these cores provide the volumetric water content estimates upon which calibration equations are developed for dielectric soil moisture probes efficiency and accuracy are critical because the smap mission requirement is to estimate surface soil moisture with an unbiased root mean square error rmse of 0 04 m3 m 3 relative to ground measurements chan et al 2016 dielectric probes are an efficient method for estimating soil moisture in the field however careful calibration of the ground sampled soil moisture is essential to ensure that the error in ground sampling measurements is less than this threshold the purpose of the large field campaigns described above is in the estimation of large scale soil moisture estimates for the purpose of remote sensing calibration and validation therefore the basis of the design is to collect statistically accurate soil moisture values for contributing land surfaces within the domain of the study in question efficient sampling is a key factor in this type of sampling as time is of the essence in conducting the sampling over large spatial scales many of these campaigns are held within the same domain separated by several years or months e g smapvex12 and smapvex16 in manitoba smapex 1 through smapex 3 panciera et al 2014 july 2010 december 2010 september 2011 respectively in australia s murrumbidgee catchment understanding if it is possible for transferring calibration equations over the same domain from one year to the next would enable future experimental design to be improved this study evaluates the temporal transferability of calibration equations in an effort to minimize the labor intensity associated with core collection during these types of large field campaigns while retaining low calibration rmses the manufacturer of the hydra probe has indicated that the sensor should not require recalibration due to a lack of temporal drift in sensor measurements due to probe calculations being based on the ratio of the incident and reflected signals k bellingham pers communication however the transferability of the calibration equations needs to be assessed otherwise errors could be needlessly propagated also factors that could impact the temporal transferability of calibration equations from year to year are investigated 2 materials and methods the smapvex 16 soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2016 field campaign was held southwest of winnipeg mb in the same general region as the smapvex 12 2012 pre launch field campaign mcnairn et al 2015 this region is dominated by annual row crops including corn soybeans oats wheat and canola in total 50 fields were sampled for soil and vegetation characteristics of which 21 had previously been sampled in 2012 fig 1 the field sizes within the smapvex 16 domain included in this study range from 55 ha to 88 ha in 2016 the soil moisture sampling transects were relocated in four of the 21 fields and particle size analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the soil textures that were sampled suggesting that the sampled regions were conducted over different portions of the field for this reason in the following analysis these fields are removed from consideration and the study is limited to 17 fields readers are encouraged to refer to mcnairn et al 2015 and rowlandson et al 2013 for a detailed description of the study area unlike the six weeks of continuous measurements in 2012 june 6 july 17 the smapvex 16 field campaign was conducted during two windows the first from june 8 20 and the second july 14 22 in total soil moisture was sampled on 13 days 7 in the first window and 6 in the second on each sampling date soil moisture was collected along two transects consisting of eight sampling points per transect in each field refer to fig 2 rowlandson et al 2013 each transect was 490 m long 8 points per transect each 70 m apart positioned in the same direction as crop seeding the transects were located 100 m from the edges of the fields to ensure that sampling did not occur in regions subjected to compaction from equipment soil moisture was sampled at each point along the transects using a stevens hydra probe pogo portable sensor stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or herein referred to as hydra probe a frequency domain reflectometry sensor operating at a 50 mhz frequency stevens water monitoring systems inc 2007 the hydra probe measures the real and imaginary components of the soil permittivity a voltage is applied to the probe and the reflected voltages are measured the change in impedance between the emitted signal and reflected signal is related to the dielectric permittivity of the material in which the probe is embedded the sensor provides an estimate of the complex soil relative permittivity integrated from 0 to 5 7 cm the real component of the soil permittivity can be related to volumetric soil water content using an appropriate calibration function e g topp et al 1980 seyfried et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 as mentioned previously the measurements of the soil dielectric permittivity can be sensitive to temperature merlin et al 2007 wraith and or 1999 and soil electrical conductivity seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and murdock 2004 two soil cores average core volume was 85 cm3 in both 2012 and 2016 were collected on each of the sampling days for each field on each day a core was extracted at the first point of the transect and an additional core was sampled at one of the remaining 15 sampling locations where the location of the core changed on each sampling date until cores had been collected across the entire field with each core sampled three hydra probe measurements were taken around the core within 10 cm of the core edge the cores were taken to a lab weighed mt dried at 105 c for 24 h and re weighed ms the bulk density ρb of each core was determined from 1 vt is the total volume of the core and the volumetric water content θ was calculated from the product of the θg and ρb 2 the field average ρb was used in the calculation of the volumetric water content to correspond with the methodology used in 2012 rowlandson et al 2013 the sampled cores were the basis for the calibration of the hydra probe measurements 1 ρ b m s v t 2 θ core m t m s m s ρ b for the 17 fields the number of cores extracted ranged from 21 to 27 samples which is nearly twice the number of cores collected per field in 2012 volumetric water content of cores that were outside of two times the standard deviation of all cores were considered outliers and removed from the analysis as recommended in rowlandson et al 2013 due to the disparity in sample sizes a monte carlo simulation was conducted which randomly selected the same number of n samples from the 2016 dataset 10 000 times as were available from the 2012 dataset for each field this random selection of 2016 measurements is used throughout the analysis and is referred to as the 2016 dataset many studies have published relationships between the square root of the hydra probe measured relative permittivity and soil volumetric water content e g seyfried et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 burns et al 2014 ojo et al 2015 and such relationships were used as the basis for the hydra probe calibrations for this study individual calibration equations were developed for each agricultural field as per the rowlandson et al 2013 recommendations based on eq 3 where ɛ is the hydra probe measured relative permittivity or real component of the complex relative dielectric permittivity and m and b are the derived slope and intercept of the regression equation with the core measured volumetric water content for the cores collected in both 2012 and 2016 a leave one out approach was conducted to determine the robustness of the calibration equations 3 θ probe m ε b to test the transferability of the soil calibration equations the field calibration equations m and b eq 4 derived in 2012 for 17 of the same fields that were measured in 2016 were applied to the hydra probe ɛ data collected in 2016 similarly the equations derived from cores and ɛ values obtained in 2016 were applied to the 2012 ɛ data errors were assessed using rmse 4 and bias 5 and were calculated for each field 4 rmse i 1 n θ core θ probe 2 n 5 bias i 1 n θ core θ probe n the core data collected in 2012 and 2016 were merged to create a single dataset for the development of calibration equations for comparison this combined dataset was also confined to the numbers of samples collected in 2012 a monte carlo simulation was conducted to randomly select cores from data collected in both 2012 and 2016 that equaled the number of cores extracted in 2012 this random selection was repeated 10 000 times for each field with each random selection for each field the rmse was calculated with 4 finally field variables that could influence the difference in calibration equations between 2012 and 2016 were examined the coefficient of variation cv 6 was calculated for the core measured bulk density and soil gravimetric water content where σ pb θg is the standard deviation and μ pb θg is the mean for either the bulk density pb or soil gravimetric soil moisture content θg measured values 6 cv σ ρ b θ g μ ρ b θ g 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration comparison between 2012 and 2016 the calibration for 2016 using the random selection of the same n as 2012 indicated that all fields had a calibration mean rmse between the core measured volumetric water content θv and the calibrated hydra probe θv that was 0 04 m3 m 3 fig 2 in all cases the linear regression relationship between the calibrated hydra probe θv and the core θv were significant at the 99 level in 2012 the calibration equation for field 122 was not significant for the majority of the fields sampled the mean rmse in 2016 was lower than those obtained in 2012 15 out of 17 fields a leave one out approach was examined to test the robustness of the calibration equations derived for both 2012 and 2016 the leave one out approached indicated that the calibration equations were robust for all fields both in 2012 and 2016 the leave one out approach for 2012 indicated higher rmse values for the calibrations for all fields likely due to the decrease in the number of samples used for the analysis however a wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that there was no significant difference between the calculated volumetric water content from the hydra probes using all the samples or using the leave one out for any of the fields p 1 for the 2016 data set a random selection was conducted to match the smaller sample size associated with the 2012 leave one out approach 2012 n 1 for each iteration the resulting rmse values were very similar to the 2016 dataset with differences in the mean rmse 0 002 for all fields similarly to the 2012 leave one out results there was no significant difference in the calculated volumetric water content from the hydra probes table 1 which provides a summary statistics for the sampled fields indicates the minimum soil moisture content measured via the core samples for 2012 and 2016 showing that for the majority of the fields the minimum soil moisture was lower in 2012 than that observed in 2016 the maximum soil moisture content measured was similar between the two years fig 2 third bar for each field shows the use of the calibration equations derived in 2012 on the data collected in 2016 resulted in degraded rmses relative to the equations derived in 2016 for all fields with the exception of field 65 which experienced a small decrease in rmse when the 2012 equation was used with the hydra probe data collected in 2016 overall using the 2016 equations resulted in 12 of 2017 having rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 two fields had rmse 0 06 m3 m 3 when applying the equations developed in 2016 to the data collected in 2012 even further degradation in rmse was observed fig 2 the rmse values utilizing the 2016 equations with 2012 data resulted in higher rmses for all fields relative to the 2012 equations with the exception of field 101 in this instance 16 of the 17 fields had rmse values 0 04 m3 m 3 8 of which had rmse 0 06 m3 m 3 and a degradation in the rmse for all fields relative to their field specific 2012 calibration equation fig 3 the bias resulting from using calibration equations developed in the alternative year are presented in fig 4 the biases for using the 2012 equations with 2016 data and vice versa are similar in that the majority of the fields experienced biases within 0 04 m3 m 3 overall 11 of the 17 fields using the 2012 equations on 2016 data resulted in negative biases where this was the case for 10 of the 17 fields using the 2016 equations on 2012 data indicating that in both years the calculated volumetric water content using the calibration equations and hydra probe data overestimated the volumetric water content relative to the sample cores a monte carlo simulation was conducted to determine if combining data from both field campaigns could result in improved calibration equation in the simulation a random selection of the same number of cores from the 2016 dataset as collected in 2012 to account for differences in the number of samples between years was repeated 10 000 times the results from the combined calibration equation indicated that the average rmse from the 10 000 iterations showed an improvement over the 2016 calibration results for only 1 of the 17 fields fig 2 field 14 the overall percent change in the rmse relative to 2012 and 2016 is shown in fig 3 there was an improvement in the rmse for 4 fields relative to the 2012 calibration the standard deviation of the calculated rmses from the monte carlo was 0 004 m3 m 3 for all fields the resulting equations from the monte carlo simulation were not significantly different from the equation derived by combining all data from 2012 and 2016 not taking into consideration the difference in sample sizes 3 2 factors influencing calibrations changes in the soil electrical conductivity or temperature during measurements between the two sampling years could also have an impact on the derived calibration equations seyfried and murdock 2004 noted the sensitivity of the hydra probe to soil electrical conductivity particularly when values exceed 0 142 s m 1 in both 2012 and 2016 the measured average soil electrical conductivity did not exceed 0 10 s m 1 there was also no significant difference between the soil electrical conductivity between the two field campaigns p 153 it is anticipated based on these measurements that the changes in the soil electrical conductivity had a minimal impact on calibrations studies have also indicated that there is an impact of temperature on the measurement of the soil dielectric permittivity e g rosenbaum et al 2011 seyfried and murdock 2004 wraith and or 1999 the majority of the measurements made in both 2012 and 2016 were obtained between 15 and 25 c based on the results of wraith and or 1999 which indicate that there is a minimal change in the measured soil dielectric permittivity when measured between 15 and 25 c across a range of soil moisture contents issues in the measurement of soil dielectric permittivity become more apparent at low 5 c rosenbaum et al 2011 higher temperatures 40 c rosenbaum et al 2011 wraith and or 1999 similar to the soil electrical conductivity it likely that differences in soil temperature between the two campaigns is not a major source of error in the calibrations inter sensor variability is a potential source of error in regards to the temporal transferability of calibration equations coopersmith et al 2016 found that using a triple co location method using data collected at 114 sites across the continental united states the inter sensor variability for the hydra probe was approximately 0 01 m3 m 3 seyfried et al 2005 using ethanol as a proxy for a typical range in dielectric permittivity observed in soil found that the inter sensor variability to be similar to that of coopersmith et al 2016 this inter sensor variability does not account for the large difference in rmse values derived with the temporal transferability of calibration equations particularly when the 2016 equations are applied to the 2012 data if inter sensor variability were a major source of error between the two field campaigns it is anticipated that the rmse values would be similar when the 2012 equations were applied to the 2016 data relative to the 2016 calibrations as they would be for the 2016 calibration equations applied to the 2012 data however for 14 of the 17 fields sampled when based on the calibration equations derived in 2016 on the data collected in 2012 relative to using the calibration equations derived in 2012 the difference in the rmse values exceeds the inter sensor variability this was not the case when the 2012 equations were applied to the 2016 data rmse and relative to the 2016 calibration equations in this scenario only 9 of the 17 fields exhibited differences in rmse values that were larger than the inter sensor variability to eliminate variation in soil properties between the two study years only fields with the same soil textural definition throughout the sample cores were used indicating minimal inter field variability in soil texture and reducing the possibility sample location had an impact on the calibration equations the cv in the bulk densities of the cores were examined for both years a wilcoxon ranks sum test indicated that there was no significant difference in the cv of the bulk densities between 2012 and 2016 this minimizes the effect of inter field variability of soil properties however another possible difference between the 2012 and 2016 calibrations is the inter field variability of soil moisture of the sample cores given that the field average bulk density was used in both years for the calculation of the volumetric water content in an attempt to derive a field scale calibration equation the gravimetric water content was examined it was found that there was a significant difference in the cv of the sampled gravimetric water content between 2012 and 2016 p 001 99 confidence interval wilcoxon rank sum test with much larger cv observed in 2012 as would be expected with a decrease in mean e g famiglietti et al 2008 4 conclusions the smapvex 16 field campaign was held in the same general region as the smapvex 12 there were 17 fields sampled in the 2012 campaign that were re sampled in 2016 allowing an investigation into the temporal transferability of the calibration equations developed in 2012 to the data collected in 2016 and vice versa the results indicated that the field rmse values were lower in 2016 relative to 2012 likely due to the decreased range in soil moisture over which the calibration equations were developed in 2016 this study shows that the temporal transferability of soil calibration equations results in increased error in the estimate of soil moisture due changes in the temporal variability of soil moisture it was shown that the cv in the gravimetric water content significantly differs between the two sampling years indicating that the variability in soil moisture is the main limitation on the transferability of equations this is also evident in the errors associated with the transferability of the calibration equations using the equations developed in 2016 over a smaller and wetter range of soil moisture on the data collected in 2012 the rmse was 0 04 m3 m 3 for the majority of the fields 16 of 17 fields however when the calibration equations derived in 2012 were applied to the 2016 data the instances where the rmse values were 0 04 m3 m 3 was reduced to 12 of the 17 fields suggesting that the transferability is improved when a larger range of soil moisture is incorporated into their development a lack of knowledge a priori on how the variability of soil moisture has changed from one year to another may indicate that calibration of surface soil moisture measurements should be conducted each year if the need to keep ground measurement error below an rmse threshold of 0 04 m3 m 3 is required it has been well documented that errors in soil moisture estimates using probes can be reduced if a sensor specific calibration equation is utilized bogena et al 2017 rosenbaum et al 2010 seyfried et al 2005 and that soil specific calibrations are an improvement to factory derived calibrations huang et al 2004 seyfried and murdock 2004 in this study given that the same sensor was used in each field a sensor and soil specific calibration was conducted it has been shown in this study that the there was no significant difference in the soil electrical conductivity between the two sampling years and values fell below values of concern for calibrations of hydra probes seyfried et al 2005 the range in soil temperature over which the experiments were conducted would indicate a potential change in the measured ε of 0 5 the estimated inter sensor variability of the hydra probe is approximately 1 volumetric soil moisture does not account for the large rmse differences in rmse observed particularly when applying the equations derived in 2016 to the data collected in 2012 however there was a significant difference in the range of soil moisture over which the calibration equations were derived in 2012 and 2016 this suggests that soil moisture calibration equations may not successfully transfer spatially or temporally when the desire is to keep the measurement error

7559,several large scale field campaigns have been conducted over the last 20 years that require accurate measurements of soil moisture conditions these measurements are manually conducted using soil moisture probes which require calibration the calibration process involves the collection of hundreds of soil moisture cores which is extremely labor intensive in 2012 a field campaign was conducted in southern manitoba in which 55 fields were sampled and calibration equations were derived for each field the soil moisture active passive experiment 2016 smapvex16 was conducted in this same region and 21 of the same fields were resampled this study examines the temporal transferability of calibration equations between these two field campaigns it was found that the larger range in soil moisture over which samples were collected in 2012 average range 0 11 0 41 m3 m 3 generally resulted in lower errors when used in 2016 average range 0 24 0 44 m3 m 3 than the equations derived in 2016 when used with data collected in 2012 combining the data collected in 2012 and 2016 did not improve the errors overall these results suggest that the transfer of calibration equations from one year to the next is not recommended keywords soil moisture calibration impedance probes 1 introduction knowledge of soil moisture variability both spatially and temporally at different scales is important for the validation of applications such as land surface models and remote sensing products crow et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2008 western et al 2002 although gravimetric sampling provides the most accurate estimation of soil moisture it is labor intensive and time consuming electromagnetic sensors have been investigated extensively as an alternative for measuring soil moisture numerous studies have been conducted which investigate calibration strategies for soil moisture sensors that relate the measured soil dielectric permittivity to soil water content through e g bogena et al 2017 ojo et al 2015 rosenbaum et al 2010 rowlandson et al 2013 seyfried et al 2005 studies have also examined the variability between different commercially available soil moisture sensors a study by walker et al 2004 found that sensors requiring soil disturbance for installation presented the highest errors in soil moistures retrieval despite calibration efforts cosh et al 2016 using data from a soil moisture sensor testbed found that electromagnetic sensors installed at a depth of 5 cm when scaled to the field had similar root mean square errors all of which were 0 04 m3 m 3 more specifically studies have noted that lower frequency sensors exhibit sensitivity in the measurements of the soil dielectric permittivity resulting from the soil electrical conductivity seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and murdock 2004 and changes in soil temperature merlin et al 2007 wraith and or 1999 inter sensor variability is an issue that has been noted in several studies e g bogena et al 2017 cosh et al 2016 rosenbaum et al 2010 seyfried and murdock 2004 however it has been noted that sensor specific calibrations which prior deriving a relationship between the soil water content and the soil dielectric permittivity measurements are first made in media of known dielectric permittivity to determine inter sensor variability rosenbaum et al 2010 large scale field campaigns 502 km2 have been held where surface soil moisture measurements have been collected across a defined domain in an effort to capture the intra and inter field soil moisture variability particularly as it relates to remote sensing applications some of these field campaigns include the southern great plains 1997 sgp97 hydrology experiment mohanty et al 2002 the soil moisture experiments smex in 2002 bindlish et al 2006 2003 bosch et al 2006 cosh et al 2005 2004 bindlish et al 2008 and 2005 cosh et al 2005 national airborne field experiment 2006 nafe 06 australia merlin et al 2008 australian airborne cal val experiments for smos aaces peischl et al 2012 canadian experiment for soil moisture in 2010 canex sm10 magagi et al 2013 soil moisture active passive smap validation experiment in 2012 smapvex12 mcnairn et al 2015 and most recently the smapvex16 field experiment which was conducted in the same general region as the smapvex12 campaign in each of the aforementioned field campaigns transects or grids of soil moisture were manually sampled at varying spatial scales for each field campaign large quantities of soil cores were collected to derive calibration equations cosh et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 in smapvex12 for example over 700 cores were collected over the duration of the six week field campaign rowlandson et al 2013 these cores provide the volumetric water content estimates upon which calibration equations are developed for dielectric soil moisture probes efficiency and accuracy are critical because the smap mission requirement is to estimate surface soil moisture with an unbiased root mean square error rmse of 0 04 m3 m 3 relative to ground measurements chan et al 2016 dielectric probes are an efficient method for estimating soil moisture in the field however careful calibration of the ground sampled soil moisture is essential to ensure that the error in ground sampling measurements is less than this threshold the purpose of the large field campaigns described above is in the estimation of large scale soil moisture estimates for the purpose of remote sensing calibration and validation therefore the basis of the design is to collect statistically accurate soil moisture values for contributing land surfaces within the domain of the study in question efficient sampling is a key factor in this type of sampling as time is of the essence in conducting the sampling over large spatial scales many of these campaigns are held within the same domain separated by several years or months e g smapvex12 and smapvex16 in manitoba smapex 1 through smapex 3 panciera et al 2014 july 2010 december 2010 september 2011 respectively in australia s murrumbidgee catchment understanding if it is possible for transferring calibration equations over the same domain from one year to the next would enable future experimental design to be improved this study evaluates the temporal transferability of calibration equations in an effort to minimize the labor intensity associated with core collection during these types of large field campaigns while retaining low calibration rmses the manufacturer of the hydra probe has indicated that the sensor should not require recalibration due to a lack of temporal drift in sensor measurements due to probe calculations being based on the ratio of the incident and reflected signals k bellingham pers communication however the transferability of the calibration equations needs to be assessed otherwise errors could be needlessly propagated also factors that could impact the temporal transferability of calibration equations from year to year are investigated 2 materials and methods the smapvex 16 soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2016 field campaign was held southwest of winnipeg mb in the same general region as the smapvex 12 2012 pre launch field campaign mcnairn et al 2015 this region is dominated by annual row crops including corn soybeans oats wheat and canola in total 50 fields were sampled for soil and vegetation characteristics of which 21 had previously been sampled in 2012 fig 1 the field sizes within the smapvex 16 domain included in this study range from 55 ha to 88 ha in 2016 the soil moisture sampling transects were relocated in four of the 21 fields and particle size analysis indicated that there was a significant difference in the soil textures that were sampled suggesting that the sampled regions were conducted over different portions of the field for this reason in the following analysis these fields are removed from consideration and the study is limited to 17 fields readers are encouraged to refer to mcnairn et al 2015 and rowlandson et al 2013 for a detailed description of the study area unlike the six weeks of continuous measurements in 2012 june 6 july 17 the smapvex 16 field campaign was conducted during two windows the first from june 8 20 and the second july 14 22 in total soil moisture was sampled on 13 days 7 in the first window and 6 in the second on each sampling date soil moisture was collected along two transects consisting of eight sampling points per transect in each field refer to fig 2 rowlandson et al 2013 each transect was 490 m long 8 points per transect each 70 m apart positioned in the same direction as crop seeding the transects were located 100 m from the edges of the fields to ensure that sampling did not occur in regions subjected to compaction from equipment soil moisture was sampled at each point along the transects using a stevens hydra probe pogo portable sensor stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or herein referred to as hydra probe a frequency domain reflectometry sensor operating at a 50 mhz frequency stevens water monitoring systems inc 2007 the hydra probe measures the real and imaginary components of the soil permittivity a voltage is applied to the probe and the reflected voltages are measured the change in impedance between the emitted signal and reflected signal is related to the dielectric permittivity of the material in which the probe is embedded the sensor provides an estimate of the complex soil relative permittivity integrated from 0 to 5 7 cm the real component of the soil permittivity can be related to volumetric soil water content using an appropriate calibration function e g topp et al 1980 seyfried et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 as mentioned previously the measurements of the soil dielectric permittivity can be sensitive to temperature merlin et al 2007 wraith and or 1999 and soil electrical conductivity seyfried et al 2005 seyfried and murdock 2004 two soil cores average core volume was 85 cm3 in both 2012 and 2016 were collected on each of the sampling days for each field on each day a core was extracted at the first point of the transect and an additional core was sampled at one of the remaining 15 sampling locations where the location of the core changed on each sampling date until cores had been collected across the entire field with each core sampled three hydra probe measurements were taken around the core within 10 cm of the core edge the cores were taken to a lab weighed mt dried at 105 c for 24 h and re weighed ms the bulk density ρb of each core was determined from 1 vt is the total volume of the core and the volumetric water content θ was calculated from the product of the θg and ρb 2 the field average ρb was used in the calculation of the volumetric water content to correspond with the methodology used in 2012 rowlandson et al 2013 the sampled cores were the basis for the calibration of the hydra probe measurements 1 ρ b m s v t 2 θ core m t m s m s ρ b for the 17 fields the number of cores extracted ranged from 21 to 27 samples which is nearly twice the number of cores collected per field in 2012 volumetric water content of cores that were outside of two times the standard deviation of all cores were considered outliers and removed from the analysis as recommended in rowlandson et al 2013 due to the disparity in sample sizes a monte carlo simulation was conducted which randomly selected the same number of n samples from the 2016 dataset 10 000 times as were available from the 2012 dataset for each field this random selection of 2016 measurements is used throughout the analysis and is referred to as the 2016 dataset many studies have published relationships between the square root of the hydra probe measured relative permittivity and soil volumetric water content e g seyfried et al 2005 rowlandson et al 2013 burns et al 2014 ojo et al 2015 and such relationships were used as the basis for the hydra probe calibrations for this study individual calibration equations were developed for each agricultural field as per the rowlandson et al 2013 recommendations based on eq 3 where ɛ is the hydra probe measured relative permittivity or real component of the complex relative dielectric permittivity and m and b are the derived slope and intercept of the regression equation with the core measured volumetric water content for the cores collected in both 2012 and 2016 a leave one out approach was conducted to determine the robustness of the calibration equations 3 θ probe m ε b to test the transferability of the soil calibration equations the field calibration equations m and b eq 4 derived in 2012 for 17 of the same fields that were measured in 2016 were applied to the hydra probe ɛ data collected in 2016 similarly the equations derived from cores and ɛ values obtained in 2016 were applied to the 2012 ɛ data errors were assessed using rmse 4 and bias 5 and were calculated for each field 4 rmse i 1 n θ core θ probe 2 n 5 bias i 1 n θ core θ probe n the core data collected in 2012 and 2016 were merged to create a single dataset for the development of calibration equations for comparison this combined dataset was also confined to the numbers of samples collected in 2012 a monte carlo simulation was conducted to randomly select cores from data collected in both 2012 and 2016 that equaled the number of cores extracted in 2012 this random selection was repeated 10 000 times for each field with each random selection for each field the rmse was calculated with 4 finally field variables that could influence the difference in calibration equations between 2012 and 2016 were examined the coefficient of variation cv 6 was calculated for the core measured bulk density and soil gravimetric water content where σ pb θg is the standard deviation and μ pb θg is the mean for either the bulk density pb or soil gravimetric soil moisture content θg measured values 6 cv σ ρ b θ g μ ρ b θ g 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration comparison between 2012 and 2016 the calibration for 2016 using the random selection of the same n as 2012 indicated that all fields had a calibration mean rmse between the core measured volumetric water content θv and the calibrated hydra probe θv that was 0 04 m3 m 3 fig 2 in all cases the linear regression relationship between the calibrated hydra probe θv and the core θv were significant at the 99 level in 2012 the calibration equation for field 122 was not significant for the majority of the fields sampled the mean rmse in 2016 was lower than those obtained in 2012 15 out of 17 fields a leave one out approach was examined to test the robustness of the calibration equations derived for both 2012 and 2016 the leave one out approached indicated that the calibration equations were robust for all fields both in 2012 and 2016 the leave one out approach for 2012 indicated higher rmse values for the calibrations for all fields likely due to the decrease in the number of samples used for the analysis however a wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that there was no significant difference between the calculated volumetric water content from the hydra probes using all the samples or using the leave one out for any of the fields p 1 for the 2016 data set a random selection was conducted to match the smaller sample size associated with the 2012 leave one out approach 2012 n 1 for each iteration the resulting rmse values were very similar to the 2016 dataset with differences in the mean rmse 0 002 for all fields similarly to the 2012 leave one out results there was no significant difference in the calculated volumetric water content from the hydra probes table 1 which provides a summary statistics for the sampled fields indicates the minimum soil moisture content measured via the core samples for 2012 and 2016 showing that for the majority of the fields the minimum soil moisture was lower in 2012 than that observed in 2016 the maximum soil moisture content measured was similar between the two years fig 2 third bar for each field shows the use of the calibration equations derived in 2012 on the data collected in 2016 resulted in degraded rmses relative to the equations derived in 2016 for all fields with the exception of field 65 which experienced a small decrease in rmse when the 2012 equation was used with the hydra probe data collected in 2016 overall using the 2016 equations resulted in 12 of 2017 having rmse 0 04 m3 m 3 two fields had rmse 0 06 m3 m 3 when applying the equations developed in 2016 to the data collected in 2012 even further degradation in rmse was observed fig 2 the rmse values utilizing the 2016 equations with 2012 data resulted in higher rmses for all fields relative to the 2012 equations with the exception of field 101 in this instance 16 of the 17 fields had rmse values 0 04 m3 m 3 8 of which had rmse 0 06 m3 m 3 and a degradation in the rmse for all fields relative to their field specific 2012 calibration equation fig 3 the bias resulting from using calibration equations developed in the alternative year are presented in fig 4 the biases for using the 2012 equations with 2016 data and vice versa are similar in that the majority of the fields experienced biases within 0 04 m3 m 3 overall 11 of the 17 fields using the 2012 equations on 2016 data resulted in negative biases where this was the case for 10 of the 17 fields using the 2016 equations on 2012 data indicating that in both years the calculated volumetric water content using the calibration equations and hydra probe data overestimated the volumetric water content relative to the sample cores a monte carlo simulation was conducted to determine if combining data from both field campaigns could result in improved calibration equation in the simulation a random selection of the same number of cores from the 2016 dataset as collected in 2012 to account for differences in the number of samples between years was repeated 10 000 times the results from the combined calibration equation indicated that the average rmse from the 10 000 iterations showed an improvement over the 2016 calibration results for only 1 of the 17 fields fig 2 field 14 the overall percent change in the rmse relative to 2012 and 2016 is shown in fig 3 there was an improvement in the rmse for 4 fields relative to the 2012 calibration the standard deviation of the calculated rmses from the monte carlo was 0 004 m3 m 3 for all fields the resulting equations from the monte carlo simulation were not significantly different from the equation derived by combining all data from 2012 and 2016 not taking into consideration the difference in sample sizes 3 2 factors influencing calibrations changes in the soil electrical conductivity or temperature during measurements between the two sampling years could also have an impact on the derived calibration equations seyfried and murdock 2004 noted the sensitivity of the hydra probe to soil electrical conductivity particularly when values exceed 0 142 s m 1 in both 2012 and 2016 the measured average soil electrical conductivity did not exceed 0 10 s m 1 there was also no significant difference between the soil electrical conductivity between the two field campaigns p 153 it is anticipated based on these measurements that the changes in the soil electrical conductivity had a minimal impact on calibrations studies have also indicated that there is an impact of temperature on the measurement of the soil dielectric permittivity e g rosenbaum et al 2011 seyfried and murdock 2004 wraith and or 1999 the majority of the measurements made in both 2012 and 2016 were obtained between 15 and 25 c based on the results of wraith and or 1999 which indicate that there is a minimal change in the measured soil dielectric permittivity when measured between 15 and 25 c across a range of soil moisture contents issues in the measurement of soil dielectric permittivity become more apparent at low 5 c rosenbaum et al 2011 higher temperatures 40 c rosenbaum et al 2011 wraith and or 1999 similar to the soil electrical conductivity it likely that differences in soil temperature between the two campaigns is not a major source of error in the calibrations inter sensor variability is a potential source of error in regards to the temporal transferability of calibration equations coopersmith et al 2016 found that using a triple co location method using data collected at 114 sites across the continental united states the inter sensor variability for the hydra probe was approximately 0 01 m3 m 3 seyfried et al 2005 using ethanol as a proxy for a typical range in dielectric permittivity observed in soil found that the inter sensor variability to be similar to that of coopersmith et al 2016 this inter sensor variability does not account for the large difference in rmse values derived with the temporal transferability of calibration equations particularly when the 2016 equations are applied to the 2012 data if inter sensor variability were a major source of error between the two field campaigns it is anticipated that the rmse values would be similar when the 2012 equations were applied to the 2016 data relative to the 2016 calibrations as they would be for the 2016 calibration equations applied to the 2012 data however for 14 of the 17 fields sampled when based on the calibration equations derived in 2016 on the data collected in 2012 relative to using the calibration equations derived in 2012 the difference in the rmse values exceeds the inter sensor variability this was not the case when the 2012 equations were applied to the 2016 data rmse and relative to the 2016 calibration equations in this scenario only 9 of the 17 fields exhibited differences in rmse values that were larger than the inter sensor variability to eliminate variation in soil properties between the two study years only fields with the same soil textural definition throughout the sample cores were used indicating minimal inter field variability in soil texture and reducing the possibility sample location had an impact on the calibration equations the cv in the bulk densities of the cores were examined for both years a wilcoxon ranks sum test indicated that there was no significant difference in the cv of the bulk densities between 2012 and 2016 this minimizes the effect of inter field variability of soil properties however another possible difference between the 2012 and 2016 calibrations is the inter field variability of soil moisture of the sample cores given that the field average bulk density was used in both years for the calculation of the volumetric water content in an attempt to derive a field scale calibration equation the gravimetric water content was examined it was found that there was a significant difference in the cv of the sampled gravimetric water content between 2012 and 2016 p 001 99 confidence interval wilcoxon rank sum test with much larger cv observed in 2012 as would be expected with a decrease in mean e g famiglietti et al 2008 4 conclusions the smapvex 16 field campaign was held in the same general region as the smapvex 12 there were 17 fields sampled in the 2012 campaign that were re sampled in 2016 allowing an investigation into the temporal transferability of the calibration equations developed in 2012 to the data collected in 2016 and vice versa the results indicated that the field rmse values were lower in 2016 relative to 2012 likely due to the decreased range in soil moisture over which the calibration equations were developed in 2016 this study shows that the temporal transferability of soil calibration equations results in increased error in the estimate of soil moisture due changes in the temporal variability of soil moisture it was shown that the cv in the gravimetric water content significantly differs between the two sampling years indicating that the variability in soil moisture is the main limitation on the transferability of equations this is also evident in the errors associated with the transferability of
