19680,the determination of organics biodegradability and corresponding biodegradation kinetics provides valuable information on the optimal design and operation of anaerobic biotechnology especially for sulfidogenesis this study proposes a deterministic method i e a biochemical sulfide potential bsp test and compares it to the conventional biochemical methane potential bmp test in terms of their ability to characterize sulfate laden organic waste biodegradability it demonstrated 1 48 times higher degradation of volatile suspended solids vss and 2 60 times more chemical oxygen demand cod conversion in its major metabolites than the bmp test moreover it required only four days to complete compared to the 35 days required by the bmp test through the two substrate first order hydrolysis model it was revealed that the shortened time was attributed to the enhanced degradation rates from both readily eight times and slowly nearly 10 times biodegradable organic substrates in the bsp test compared with the bmp test for the same sulfate laden organic waste the findings highlight the inappropriateness of the bmp test to sulfidogenic applications due to the underestimated predictions of organic waste biodegradability and excessive time requirements furthermore the ability of the bsp test to identify the average elemental composition c x h y o z n a p b s c of substrate biodegradable particulate organics bpo is explored and verified using a casein based validation test using bpo elemental composition as the input variable a bsp biochemical kinetic model is thereby developed to predict bsr performance and possible dynamic process control overall this study demonstrates the applicability and advantages of the bsp test in sulfidogenic applications for characterization of organics biodegradability and identification of bpo average elemental composition furthermore develops a process model utilizing the derived bpo average elemental composition to provide optimized reactor retention time and substrates feed mixture for optimum performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidogenic biotechnology biochemical sulfide potential sulfidogenic biodegradability

marine sediments aquifers and tidal rivers and lakes kaplan et al 1963 schroth et al 2001 fry 1986 sulfur itself is also involved in various natural processes including weathering geothermal volcanic and anthropogenic activities such as mining smelting steel manufacturing and paper making shin et al 1996 lens et al 2002 klok et al 2013 the elevated levels of sulfate in these waters result in the production of sulfide as the main end product when oxygen levels are low 0 5 mg l beauchamp et al 1984 selene and chou 2003 through sulfur conversion biological sulfate sulfite sulfur reduction bsr biotechnology has been extensively applied in the treatment of various types of sulfur associated industrial wastewater including acid mine drainage flue gas scrubbing water and textile wastewater lens and pol 2000 kaufman et al 1997 van der zee et al 2001 furthermore by integrating bsr with sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification new bsr based technologies have been developed to treat emerging brackish saline municipal wastewater resulting from the use of seawater for toilet flushing and cooling as well as sea water intrusion leung et al 2012 van loosdrecht et al 2012 liu et al 2016 these technologies include the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process wang et al 2009 wu et al 2016 denitrifying sulfur cycle associated enhanced

municipal wastewater the biodegradability and biodegradation rate of the organic waste in the presence of sulfate for sulfidogenesis must be accurately determined before bsr technologies can be designed these play crucial roles in controlling the organic loading rate the volume of the reactor and ultimately its treatment efficiency carrère et al 2010 the biochemical methane potential bmp test has been developed and widely adopted to determine the biodegradability of anaerobic organics owen et al 1979 angelidaki et al 2009 however its feasibility with sulfate laden organic waste in bsr processes has not been thoroughly explored what is understood is that the presence of sulfate conversion to sulfide may potentially underestimate the biodegradability of organic waste using the bmp test angelidaki and sanders 2004 these concerns mainly originate in the following possible issues 1 sulfur reducing bacteria srb can out compete methane producing bacteria mpb as they possess a greater affinity for substrates widdel 1988 2 the hydrogen sulfide generated from bsr and the anaerobic oxidation of methane initiated by srb barton and fauque 2009 inhibit mpb bioactivity kroiss and plahl wabnegg 1983 and 3 intrinsic constraints on the methane and co2 collection and measurement accuracy of the bmp test walker et al 2009 to our knowledge an evaluation of the applicability of the bmp test and an exploration method of characterizing the biodegradability of organic waste for bsr processes have not been conducted to date with the above in view this study aims to 1 develop a biochemical sulfide potential bsp test for the bsr treatment of sulfate laden wastewater and waste 2 evaluate the applicability of the bmp test to bsr technologies and the impact of sulfate on it through a direct comparison of the bmp and bsp tests 3 determine the elemental composition of biodegradable particulate organics b p o c x h y o z n a p b s c based on the bsp test results by mass and

anaerobic degradation pathways in the presence of sulfate as described in eqs 1 and 2 poinapen and ekama 2010 details of the stoichiometric reactions derivation are given by ekama et al 2018 1 c x h y

electron donor e is the flux of cod exiting from the reactor as srb and endogenous sludge as a fraction of the flux of biodegradable organics utilized in the reactor per day at a steady state the organics biodegradable potential of bsr is reflected by the accumulated sulfide generated through bsr in accordance with the electron flow of sulfidogenesis while the rate of sulfide production reflects the conversion rate of the organics the above development of the bsp test assumes the following 1 complete sulfidogenesis occurs to inorganic carbon 2 the ph is near 8 such that essentially all inorganic carbon is present as hco3 and 3 no methanogenisis occurs simultaneously which could be ensured using an inhibitor if necessary the bsp test method can be modified from that of the bmp test owen et al 1979 angelidaki et al 2009 and the specific test procedures in this study are outlined as follows the bsp tests were initiated with 250 ml batch serum bottles the settled sulfate containing primary sludge ps was collected from a local saline sewage treatment plant sstp to serve as the substrate source and srb enriched sludge hereafter referred to as srb sludge was collected from a sulfidogenic reactor at the sstp as the inoculum the main characteristics of the ps and srb sludge are shown in table 1 firstly the srb sludge was washed with a 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs solution three times to remove the residual organics before being added to 250 ml serum bottles together with the ps as a substrate secondly set volumes of ps and srb sludge with specific proportions were added to the bottles because an appropriate inoculum to substrate ratio isr is critical to ensure the accuracy of the bsp test a low isr is typically accompanied by substrate overload which is beyond the assimilative capacity of sulfidogenesis and causes volatile fatty acid accumulation neves et al 2004 an isr of 1 gvss substrate per gvss inoculum is generally used in conventional bmp tests for readily biodegradable and non toxic organics while a value of 2 is needed in the case of more recalcitrant waste owen et al 1979 in this study the initial substrate volume was 230 ml and 20 ml inoculum srb was added to retain an isr value of 2 in terms of volatile suspended solids vss i e g vss of srb sludge g vss of ps an equal volume of deionized water was used for blank assays which acted as controls induced by the endogenous metabolism of the srb sludge the theoretical minimum ratio of 0 67 mg cod mg so4 2 of sodium sulfate was fulfilled in the tests to achieve complete substrate degradation each bottle was then purged with nitrogen gas analytical level for 10 min to exclude dissolved oxygen before sealing after purging a thick butyl rubber stopper was inserted while simultaneously removing the n2 gas purging needle to ensure an anaerobic environment the rubber stopper was sealed with an aluminum crimp bottles from the bsp and bmp tests were then incubated under the standard incubation temperature 37 c of the bmp test thereby facilitating the direct comparison of the biodegradability and organics conversion rate all of the assays were conducted in triplicate sampling was performed at regular intervals using a syringe with 20 gauge needles and the bottles were mixed through inversion prior to each sampling event methane was measured at the end of the test to ensure no methanogenic activity occurred during the bsp test the bsp test lasted until the daily sulfide production was less than 1 of the cumulative sulfide production indicating a plateau or the completion of conversion the results of the bsp test are indicated by the quantity of sulfide produced from the substrate the cod conversion is calculated based on the stoichiometric ratio i e cod s ratio equals to 2 as 8 electrons transfer when sulfate is reduced to sulfide compared with 4 electrons when oxygen is an electron acceptor the sulfide production resulting from substrate degradation was determined by subtracting the values obtained from the blank assays statistical analysis of the triplicated bsp test results were carried out on mean values relative standard deviations detection limits dl and repeatability r following iso 5725 1994 for dependent variables data analysis the statistical methods are given in the supporting information si 2 1 2 bmp test the influence of sulfate laden substrate on the standard anaerobic method for biodegradation evaluation the bmp test was explored the substrate was the same as for the bsp test and mpb sludge was sourced from local anaerobic sludge digesters with characteristics as shown in table 1 to maintain the same isr as that of the bsp test 220 ml substrate ps and 30 ml inoculum mpb were added to the bottles and 220 ml of deionized water was used in the blank series operational conditions were kept the same as in the bsp test with procedures following the bmp test protocol angelidaki et al 2009 methane production was monitored on a daily basis over the first week and every 2 3 days thereafter the results of the bmp test are indicated to the quantity of methane produced from a given concentration of substrate as vss and the cod conversion is calculated by dividing the theoretical methane production potential of 380 ml ch4 g cod under 37 c statistical data analysis was also conducted on the bmp test using the same methods as in the bsp test 2 1 3 substrate biodegradation rate in bsp and bmp test hydrolysis is regarded as the rate limiting step for complex substrates such as ps and therefore determines the organics conversion rate batstone et al 2006 myint and nirmalakhandan 2006 sötemann et al 2005 poinapen and ekama 2010 the hydrolysis rate k and biodegradation potential b 0 are key parameters for assessing the substrate digestibility the values of these parameters were estimated by fitting bsp and bmp test results to both a first order one substrate hydrolysis model and a two substrate hydrolysis model rao et al 2000 jensen et al 2011 as described in eqs 5 and 6 the two substrate model segregates the substrate into readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable organics 2 1 3 1 one substrate first

donoso bravo et al 2011 appels et al 2011 the accuracy of the model s fit was evaluated based on the root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 kafle and kim 2013 thomsen et al 2014 2 2 bsp test applications besides the substrate biodegradability and biodegradation rate analysis two additional applications of the bsp test can be derived the bpo average elemental composition can be determined and a bsp biochemical kinetic model can be developed to predict bsr process performance 2 2 1 elemental composition determination of the electron donor equation 1 shows that the aqueous bsr products are dependent on the composition of the substrate hence the ad system performance can be predicted if the composition of the degraded organics is known moreover the average elemental composition of bpo in the form of c x h y o z n a p b s c can provide further insight into the optimization of feed composition and operational adjustment an advantage of the bsp test is that elemental mass and cod balances can be closed with only aqueous phase measurements avoiding the inaccurate gas measurements of the bmp test because the sulfide can be kept in solution in reactors therefore during the bsp test the ph was maintained at 7 6 8 0 and the x y z a b c values in the generalized bpo composition can be derived from the bsp results from the element and electron balance eq 1 assuming zero bsr biomass production e 0 which is reasonable given the very low yield of organisms conducting bsr all op is h2po4 fop 1 and there is no charge on the ps organics ch 0 then eq 1 becomes followed eq 7 7 c x h y o z n a p b s c x y 2 3 a 2 3 b 2 c h 2 o x 2 y 8 z 4 3 a 8 5 b 8 c 4 s o 4 2 x 2 y 8 z 4 5 a 8 3 b 8 5 c 4 h 2 s y 4 z 2 a 4 b 4 c 2 h s x h c o 3 a n h 4 b h 2 p o 4 the bpo composition can be expressed by eq 8 volcke et al 2006 ekama 2009 8 c x h y o z n a p b s c c f c 12 h f h 1 o f o 16 n f n 14 p f p 31 s f s 32 where f c f h f o f n f p f s are the mass ratios g element g compound of each element in the organics and f c f h f o f n f p f s 1 g compound vss equation 7 shows that all constituents of the bpo remain dissolved in the aqueous phase and can be measured there this is because almost all of the c in the bpo is oxidized to hco3 in the reactor which represents the alkalinity increase from the reduction of sulfate a simplification based on complete organics oxidation by sulfidogenesis however the quantity of hco3 generated from most organics is insufficient cod toc 2 67 to balance as alkalinity to supply the required h a condition described as carbon deficiency poinapen and ekama 2010 therefore the sulfide system provides the remaining h requirement through the dissociation of hs as eqs 1 and 7 show hence the bpo decomposed and converted to dissolved aqueous substances and therefore the mass ratios can be determined from the following measurements the total organic carbon can be determined from the carbonate alkalinity h2co3 hco3 co3 2 expressed as h2co3 the total organic nitrogen can be analyzed from the free and saline ammonia fsa measurement as n and the total organic phosphorus can be measured by orthophosphate op tests as p the cod changes were derived from the sulfide concentration difference according to the electron balance δcod 2δsulfide hence f c δh 2 co 3 alkalinity 50 12 δvss f n δfsa δvss f p δop δvss f s δsulfur δvss f cv δcod δvss while f o and f h can be calculated from eqs 9 and 10 the derivation for eqs 7 and 8 and the explanation for the fraction values in front of the mass ratios is given by ekama and brouckaert 2018 9 f o 16 18 1 1 8 f c v 8 12 f c 17 14 f n 26 31 f p 26 32 f s 10 f h 1 9 1 f c v 44 12 f c 10 14 f n 71 31 f p 80 32 f s casein c 1 h 1 02 o 0 15 n 0 06 s 0 04 was applied as a standard substrate for calibration to validate the accuracy of this method in determining bpo composition the error between the derived average elemental composition from the bsp test and the theoretical composition was analyzed based on elemental molar mass error analysis following eq 11 11 e r r o r i 1 n x i m e a s u r e x i t h e o r e t i c a l m i f i t h e o r e t i c a l m s t h e

the theoretical composition fraction of each element from the casein molecular formula m i is the molar mass of each element i f i t h e o r e t i c a l is the theoretical elemental mass ratio and m s t h e o r e t i c a l is the theoretical molar mass of the substrate 2 2 2 implementation of bsp biochemical process model although the first order mathematical bsp model in section 2 1 3 is typically used to describe the degradation rate of organics the biologically associated parameters and processes are not included the kinetic degradation process during a bsp test is controlled by the microbial activity and substrate accessibility which are dependent on the biochemical surroundings jensen et al 2011 this limits the practical applicability of the first order mathematical model and thus a biochemical kinetic bsp model is needed to predict reactor performance the determined bpo composition was adopted as the model input variable enabling the bsp model to be easily implemented the stoichiometry of the bsp biochemical process model is summarized in table s1 of the si including biomass growth biomass endogenous respiration chemical equilibrium dissociation processes ammonia carbonate phosphate acetate weak acid base systems and physical liquid gas transfer h2s linked through henry s law the experimental data from the bsp tests in different series were used for model calibration and validation respectively parameters were estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between the measured data and the model predictions using the secants embedded in aquasim 2 1d reichert 1998 2 3 analytical methods samples collected from the tests were filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 45 μm pore size to analyze of nh4 n alkalinity sulfide sulfate op and soluble cod scod the vss and total cod tcod were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 the nh4 n was analyzed using a lachat quik chem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin alkalinity was examined with an auto titration system using the five point titration method moosbrugger et al 1993 ekama and brouckaert 2018 sulfide level were determined using the methylene blue method apha 2005 while sulfate and op were measured through ion chromatograph ic the concentrations of biogas from the bmp tests were determined using a manometer and gas chromatography gc equipped with a valco gc valve and thermal conductivity detector tait et al 2009 the accumulated volumetric gas production was calculated from the increased pressure in the headspace volume 50 ml and expressed under standard conditions 25 c 1 atm the methane production over time was reported as the volume of produced methane divided by the amount of vss added ml ch4 g vss added 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate biodegradability in bsp and bmp test the products of electron donors that determine substrate biodegradability are sulfide in the bsp test and methane in the bmp test the cumulative total methane daily methane production and cumulative total gas production profiles from the bmp test as well as the cumulative sulfide production profile in the bsp test are depicted in fig 1 a and b respectively the methane and sulfide productivity per gram of vss added cod conversion per gram of vss loaded and vss destruction efficiency are summarized in table 2 fig 1 a shows that the cumulative methane production reached 240 10 3 ml ch4 g vss added on day 35 when the bmp test reached a steady state fig 1 b shows that the net sulfide yield reached 193 3 98 mg s l on day 4 when net production became steady although production continued to increase in the test and blank series due to endogenous turnover no methane gas was detected throughout the whole bsp tests correspondingly the cod conversions were calculated as 0 63 0 027 g cod g vss for the bmp test and 1 64 0 034 g cod g vss for the bsp test while vss reductions were 39 7 1 1 in the bmp test and 58 6 3 8 in the bsp test table 2 this suggests that the bmp test conservatively estimates the biodegradability of sulfate laden municipal primary settled sludge which was 2 6 and 1 48 times lower in the cod and vss destruction compared with the bsp test this means that the biodegradation capacity of a bsr process is underestimated if the biodegradability evaluation of organic waste undergoing sulfidogenesis is based on the bmp test which is therefore limited in its ability to characterize organic waste in bsr processes it is worth noting that in the bmp test sulfide production was 33 1 mg s l which is equivalent to 0 29g cod g vss this accounts for 31 5 in terms of cod conversion with sulfide included despite its significance this proportion is still less than gaseous methane measurement errors that have been reported e g 37 by raposo et al 2011 therefore the bmp test is still underestimated 44 lower in terms of cod conversion even when the produced sulfide is accounted compared with bsp test to secure a benchmarked evaluation and neutral comparison of these two methods the produced sulfide in bmp was not accounted in compliance with the bmp protocol wherein the methane gas towards the collected data however to standardize the protocol of the bsp test interferences such as methane or sulfide should be considered and a pre condition should be set by using specific microbial inhibitors statistical analysis was conducted on both the bmp and bsp test results table s3 in si from which their relative standard deviation and repeatability r were compared for accuracy analysis the detection limit dl results revealed significant production of methane or sulfide with a confidence level of at least 95 the dl threshold was 1 74 ml ch4 g vss for the bmp test and 10 99 mg s l for the bsp test both acceptable based on this analysis the relative standard deviation of the bsp test in both the blank series 3 7 and net production 1 7 as well as its repeatability r 15 9 mg s l were all lower than those of the bmp test 11 2 5 0 and 19 4 ml ch4 g vss respectively demonstrating a higher precision and lower random error in the bsp test than in the bmp test it has long been difficult to precisely measure the produced methane gas in bmp tests due to collection and measurement errors strömberg et al 2014 previous studies observed biogas measurement deviations of 8 wulf et al 2011 and 15 37 raposo et al 2011 despite following the standardized bmp test instructions angelidaki et al 2009 recommended by the international water association anaerobic digestion specialist group in contrast the bsp test simplifies the collection process and improve accuracy by eliminating the impact of gas collection errors since the end products sulfide and bicarbonate remain dissolved at ph values above 8 sutherland stacey et al 2008 the mature and standardized sulfide measurement methods facilitate the bsp test as an easily operated accurate and cost effective deterministic approach the higher cod conversion and vss destruction efficiency in the bsp test may stem from the produced sulfide which facilitates the fracturing of larger sludge flocs thus enhancing substrate degradation whittington jones et al 2002 researchers have shown that sulfide has a positive effect on the particulate substrate hydrolysis process molwantwa et al 2004 whittington jones et al 2006 kim and lee 2009 which may be attributed to the indirect sulfide effect through the disruption of the sludge flocs thereby facilitates contact between the hydrolytic enzymes and their substrates whittington jones 2000 or the direct effect of sulfide which increases the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes whiteley et al 2004 this mechanism is similar to thermal pretreatment in which the applied heat breaks down the sludge floc cohesion and facilitates the solubilization of organic matter carrère et al 2009 other studies have shown that the direct hydrolysis of recalcitrant compounds by srb can create a favorable environment for either chemical or enzymatic degradation which may be related to redox conditions whittington jones et al 2006 however the precise mechanisms of the increased hydrolysis rate remains contested the characterization of substrates has also been studied through time efficient aerobic respirometry for municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater orhon et al 1997 de lucas et al 2007 buendía et al 2008 explored the biodegradability of complex organic waste under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions using bmp and oxygen uptake rate our testing respectively and conclude that the estimated substrate biodegradable fraction from our testing was lower than that from bmp tests combining the results of bsp test and bmp test in this study the biodegradability of organic substrates for sulfidogenesis based on either bmp tests or our tests is underestimated compared to the bsp test cossu and raga 2008 studied the relationship between the respiration index ri4 cumulative oxygen consumption after four days and biogas production index gs21 gas sum measured after 21 days of incubation of landfill waste r 2 0 80 this implies that bsp can be used as a standard value for conventional anaerobic and aerobic systems once the relationships between bsp and both bod5 and bmp are confirmed 3 2 biodegradation rate in bsp and bmp test the hydrolysis rate k and degradation potential b 0 in the bmp and bsp tests were estimated using one substrate and two substrate hydrolysis models 3 2 1 one substrate first order hydrolysis model the simulated biodegradation potential and biodegradation kinetics from bmp and bsp tests are shown in table 3 and the simulated values fit satisfactorily with the measured data r2 0 97 the results show a higher organics biodegradation rate in the bsp test than in the bmp test which is consistent with the comparative test between the two tests in which the bmp test took nearly 35 days whilst the bsp test achieved a steady state by around day 4 fig 1 the faster degradation rate in the bsp test than in the bmp test is consistent with the results obtained by kim 1997 and pareek et al 1998 molwantwa et al 2004 and whittington jones et al 2006 report that both the extent and rate of solubilization of primary sludge was enhanced significantly under sulfidogenic conditions than in methanogenic systems with 2 1 times the solubilization and approximately three times the speed of hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates the difference in hydrolysis rate between the bsp and bmp tests further supports the conclusion that the bmp test has limited indicative value for bsr processes the different degradation rates between these two tests may be attributed to the contribution of sulfide which increase the fracture of the particulate substrates as discussed in section 3 1 thus accelerating the sulfidogenic hydrolysis process the biodegradation rate of sulfate laden ps from the bmp test is 0 045 d in this study much lower than in other bmp studies ranging from 0 11 d to 0 16 d chynoweth et al 1993 lopes et al 2004 this may be on due to the inhibition of mpb by high levels of sulfide as the municipal sewage in hong kong is brackish due to the territory wide use of seawater for toilet flushing this has resulted in a sulfate concentration of approximately 500 mg l and sewage salinity of 0 8 tang et al 2007 leung et al 2012 which may adversely affect methane production 3 2 2 two substrate first order hydrolysis model the biodegradation potential and hydrolysis rate in both the readily biodegradable fraction brapid krapid and the slowly biodegradable fraction bslow kslow were estimated by fitting the two substrate first order hydrolysis model to the experimental data from both the bsp and bmp test with the estimated values shown in table 4 the simulated substrate ultimate biodegradability potential expressed as the cod conversion from the one substrate and two substrate first order models are compared in fig 2 the bsp test showed greater hydrolysis rates and substrate biodegradability potential for both readily and slowly biodegradable organics than the bmp test by contrast in the free nitrous acid fna pretreatment method for hydrolysis enhancement the hydrolysis rate was only enhanced on the readily biodegradable fraction resulting from the biocidal effect of fna while the slowly biodegradable substrate was not significantly affected wang et al 2013 as a rate limiting process in anaerobic organics degradation hydrolysis is normally enhanced by a variety of pre treatment methods including mechanical thermal and chemical pretreatment processes however the majority of these methods are energy intensive and or expensive which have limited their widespread use carrère et al 2010 the bsp test demonstrates that the hydrolysis rates from readily and slowly biodegradable fractions can be simultaneously increased with low energy use and at low cost making sulfidogenic hydrolysis a suitable alternative pretreatment method to enhance the hydrolysis process the increased hydrolysis rate in the bsp test greatly accelerates the measurement of organics biodegradability given the long duration typically 30 60 days of the bmp test which is typically a major inconvenience to substrate assessment batstone et al 2009 the bsp test serve as an alternative less time consuming approach to determine substrate biodegradability in methanogenic reactors but requires further investigation to confirm a relationship between bsp and bmp values 3 3 bsp test applications 3 3 1 average elemental composition determination of bpo with bsp test casein c1h1 02o0 15n0 06s0 04 was applied as a verification standard to verify the credibility of determining bpo average elemental composition using the bsp test the results of the bsp validation test and the computed casein average elemental composition results are shown in table s4 and table s5 si the estimated casein composition on the basis of bsp test results is shown as c1h0 89o0 32n0 21p0 02s0 07 which is close to the theoretical formula error analysis was based on the elemental molar mass proportions according to equation 10 the predicted composition accuracy was shown to be 97 which demonstrates the reliability of this method refer to table s6 si for details differences between the computationally derived result and theoretical composition are most likely due to random error as each element is of relatively similar magnitude based on the credibility of the casein based validation the bpo of ps and inoculum srb sludge composition were estimated from the bsp test results the ph value was shown as 7 8 0 1 in the bsp test given the different elemental fractions and overall changes in cod and vss the form of the bpo composition in ps was derived as c1h3 17o0 65n0 006p0 26s0 39 and the inoculum srb sludge composition as c1h0 99o0 007n0 24p0 031s0 41 respectively these estimated compositions were subsequently used directly for the bsp biochemical kinetic model as initial input variables the bsp test can be confidently used to estimate the bpo composition which facilitates the identification of suitable substrates especially for complex substrates in co digestion processes and the modification of operational strategies in bsr systems additionally bsp tests can contribute to substrate analysis and thus help to maintain system stability by ensuring a suitable c n ratio which in turn affects operational stability and nutrient removal efficiency in terms of the organics average elemental composition analysis elemental analyzers have been widely adopted to determine the empirical formula which can subsequently be used to calculate theoretical methane potential and assess organics biodegradability rather than by using the time consuming bmp test with its associated inaccuracies davidsson et al 2007 raposo et al 2012 bsp tests can more accurately characterize biodegradable organic waste than elemental analyzers which do not differentiate between biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions and thus typically overestimate the former as they also include the latter in their estimations ekama and brouckaert 2018 the bsp test also facilitates the automatic check of the mass balance in the biochemical degradation model moreover the bsp test can be easily used for sulfate free waste by dosing sulfate to create a conventional bsr environment 3 3 2 bsp biochemical process model in this study a bsp biochemical process model was built using the estimated bpo composition as the input variable the simulated sulfide production is shown in fig 3 which demonstrates that sulfide production can be accurately predicted the biodegradation rate derived from this bsp kinetic model was 0 229 d which is half of that from the bsp first order hydrolysis model 0 47 d the lower value is theoretically more precise and reliable as the biological kinetics are not integrated into the first order hydrolysis model as demonstrated in previous studies a reliable substrate initial expression combined with an accurate kinetic model enables the sulfide potential from different types of substrates to be predicted beuvink and kogut 1993 rincon et al 2009 koch and drewes 2014 thus facilitates the prediction of a full scale reactor s response to variations in substrate composition and operational conditions as well as for optimizing the design and operation of bsr systems tomei et al 2008 appels et al 2008 in the bsp biochemical process model the substrate input variable adopts the form of c x h y o z n a p b s c sötemann et al 2005 ekama 2009 ekama et al 2018 instead of a composite input component that includes substances such as soluble and particulate carbohydrates protein lipids and individual volatile fatty acids along with constants and coefficients present in anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 and its extended sulfate reduction model batstone et al 2002 fedorovich et al 2003 the simpler elemental summarized substrate composition and the built bsp model could alleviate difficulties and reduce the substantial calibration required for plant operation and improvement these benefits must be considered in conjunction with the potential benefits of a more thorough substrate composition analysis when dealing with complex and variable waste streams in this study it was observed that the derivation of the waste composition from standard measurements as required for the bsp model is a difficult task that can nevertheless significantly skew the model results if conducted inaccurately a step by step procedure was therefore defined to straightforwardly derive bpo characteristics from a minimal set of bsp test measurements and apply them in a bsp biochemical process model as illustrated in fig 4 3 4 implications this study revealed a new method of evaluating the biodegradability of organic waste in sulfidogenic reactors known as the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test its high efficiency as well as simpler and more accurate measurement in comparison with the bmp test enables it to more reliably determine the biodegradability and organic waste biodegradation rate the bsp test also enables many sulfate reduction associated issues such as inhibition phenomena pre treatment nutrient supplementation operational concerns and model analysis to be investigated furthermore the bsp biochemical kinetic model is a useful engineering tool for the assessment of process performance it can effectively assist in calculating and predicting the theoretical sulfide yield organics removal efficiency and corresponding appropriate retention time thus optimizing reactor operation comprehensive experimental studies are essential to improving bsp tests to enable its widespread use for instance the ultimate sulfide yield is likely to also be dictated by other substrate related factors such as isr particle size homogeneity temperature and product toxicity undissociated h2s inhibition as has been similarly discussed for the bmp test chynoweth et al 1993 the differences in the extent of substrate biodegradation and rate of the sulfidogenic and methanogenic processes using primary settled sludge were significant given the simplicity and improved accuracy of the bsp test further studies should also focus on confirming the general relationship coefficients between bsp and bmp as well as bod5 to extend its applicability in conventional anaerobic and aerobic treatment processes 4 conclusions a deterministic substrate biodegradability test method the bsp test is proposed in this study to determine the extent and rate of organics biodegradation in bsr processes the feasibility of the bsp test and the applicability of the bmp test to sulfate laden organics were investigated through a biodegradability comparison and the accuracy of the results was verified according to iso 5725 furthermore two applications of the bsp test namely to determine bpo composition and a model to simulate substrate degradation were implemented the main conclusions are summarized as follows the bsp test realized 2 6 times the cod conversion and 1 48 times the vss destruction of the bmp test on the same substrate in the presence of sulfate the biodegradation rate in the bsp test was an order of magnitude faster than that in the bmp test as was identified from both the readily and slowly biodegradable organics fractions in the substrate the bsp test is effective and indispensable for measuring the biodegradability of substrates that will undergo a bsr process due to the limitations of the bmp test on these substrates bpo composition in elemental form can be derived from bsp test results with reasonable accuracy which facilitates substrate choice ph prediction and operation assessment the bsp biochemical kinetic model which was built based on the bpo elemental composition provides a valuable tool for predicting bsr process performance and optimizing reactor operation acknowledgements the authors wish to thank hong kong s research grants council for its support grant

19680,the determination of organics biodegradability and corresponding biodegradation kinetics provides valuable information on the optimal design and operation of anaerobic biotechnology especially for sulfidogenesis this study proposes a deterministic method i e a biochemical sulfide potential bsp test and compares it to the conventional biochemical methane potential bmp test in terms of their ability to characterize sulfate laden organic waste biodegradability it demonstrated 1 48 times higher degradation of volatile suspended solids vss and 2 60 times more chemical oxygen demand cod conversion in its major metabolites than the bmp test moreover it required only four days to complete compared to the 35 days required by the bmp test through the two substrate first order hydrolysis model it was revealed that the shortened time was attributed to the enhanced degradation rates from both readily eight times and slowly nearly 10 times biodegradable organic substrates in the bsp test compared with the bmp test for the same sulfate laden organic waste the findings highlight the inappropriateness of the bmp test to sulfidogenic applications due to the underestimated predictions of organic waste biodegradability and excessive time requirements furthermore the ability of the bsp test to identify the average elemental composition c x h y o z n a p b s c of substrate biodegradable particulate organics bpo is explored and verified using a casein based validation test using bpo elemental composition as the input variable a bsp biochemical kinetic model is thereby developed to predict bsr performance and possible dynamic process control overall this study demonstrates the applicability and advantages of the bsp test in sulfidogenic applications for characterization of organics biodegradability and identification of bpo average elemental composition furthermore develops a process model utilizing the derived bpo average elemental composition to provide optimized

and anthropogenic activities such as mining smelting steel manufacturing and paper making shin et al 1996 lens et al 2002 klok et al 2013 the elevated levels of sulfate in these waters result in the

lens and pol 2000 kaufman et al 1997 van der zee et al 2001 furthermore by integrating bsr with sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification new bsr based technologies have been developed to treat emerging brackish saline municipal wastewater resulting from the use of seawater for toilet flushing and cooling as well as sea water intrusion leung et al 2012 van loosdrecht et al 2012 liu et al

municipal wastewater the biodegradability and biodegradation rate of the organic waste in the presence of sulfate for sulfidogenesis must be accurately determined before bsr technologies can be designed these play crucial roles in controlling the organic loading rate the volume of the reactor and ultimately its treatment efficiency carrère et al 2010 the biochemical methane potential bmp test has been developed and widely adopted to determine the biodegradability of anaerobic organics owen et al 1979 angelidaki et al 2009 however its feasibility with sulfate laden organic waste in bsr processes has not been thoroughly explored what is understood is that the presence of sulfate conversion to sulfide may potentially underestimate the biodegradability of organic waste using the bmp test angelidaki and sanders 2004 these concerns mainly originate in the following possible issues 1 sulfur reducing bacteria srb can out compete methane producing bacteria mpb as they possess a greater affinity for substrates widdel 1988 2 the hydrogen sulfide generated from bsr and the anaerobic oxidation of methane initiated by srb barton and fauque 2009 inhibit mpb bioactivity kroiss and plahl wabnegg 1983 and 3 intrinsic constraints on the methane and co2 collection and measurement accuracy of the bmp test walker et al 2009 to our knowledge an evaluation of the applicability of the bmp test and an exploration method of characterizing the biodegradability of organic waste for bsr processes have not been conducted to date with the above in view this study aims to 1 develop a biochemical sulfide potential bsp test for the bsr treatment of sulfate laden wastewater and waste 2 evaluate the applicability of the bmp test to bsr technologies and the impact of sulfate on it

electron donor e is the flux of cod exiting from the reactor as srb and endogenous sludge as a fraction of the flux of biodegradable organics utilized in the reactor per day at a steady state the organics biodegradable potential of bsr is reflected by the accumulated sulfide generated through bsr in accordance with the electron flow of sulfidogenesis while the rate of sulfide production reflects the conversion rate of the organics the above development of the bsp test assumes the following 1 complete sulfidogenesis occurs to inorganic carbon 2 the ph is near 8 such that essentially all inorganic carbon is present as hco3 and 3 no methanogenisis occurs simultaneously which could be ensured using an inhibitor if necessary the bsp test method can be modified from that of the bmp test owen et al 1979 angelidaki et al 2009 and the specific test procedures in this study are outlined as follows the bsp tests were initiated with 250 ml batch serum bottles the settled sulfate containing primary sludge ps was collected from a local saline sewage treatment plant sstp to serve as the substrate source and srb enriched sludge hereafter referred to as srb sludge was collected from a sulfidogenic reactor at the sstp as the inoculum the main characteristics of the ps and srb sludge are shown in table 1 firstly the srb sludge was washed with a 1x phosphate buffered saline pbs solution three times to remove the residual organics before being added to 250 ml serum bottles together with the ps as a substrate secondly set volumes of ps and srb sludge with specific proportions were added to the bottles because an appropriate inoculum to substrate ratio isr is critical to ensure the accuracy of the bsp test a low isr is typically accompanied by substrate overload which is beyond the assimilative capacity of sulfidogenesis and causes volatile fatty acid accumulation neves et al 2004 an isr of 1 gvss substrate per gvss inoculum is generally used in conventional bmp tests for readily biodegradable and non toxic organics while a value of 2 is needed in the case of more recalcitrant waste owen et al 1979 in this study the initial substrate volume was 230 ml and 20 ml inoculum srb was added to retain an isr value of 2 in terms of volatile suspended solids vss i e g vss of srb sludge g vss of ps an equal volume of deionized water was used for blank assays which acted as controls induced by the endogenous metabolism of the srb sludge the theoretical minimum ratio of 0 67 mg cod mg so4 2 of sodium sulfate was fulfilled in the tests to achieve complete substrate degradation each bottle was then purged with nitrogen gas analytical level for 10 min to exclude dissolved oxygen before sealing after purging a thick butyl rubber stopper was inserted while simultaneously removing the n2 gas purging needle to ensure an anaerobic environment the rubber stopper was sealed with an aluminum crimp bottles from the bsp and bmp tests were then incubated under the standard incubation temperature 37 c of the bmp test thereby facilitating the direct comparison of the biodegradability and organics conversion rate all of the assays were conducted in triplicate sampling was performed at regular intervals using a syringe with 20 gauge needles and the bottles were mixed through inversion prior to each sampling event methane was measured at the end of the test to ensure no methanogenic activity occurred during the bsp test the bsp test lasted until the daily sulfide production was less than 1 of the cumulative sulfide production indicating a plateau or the completion of conversion the results of the bsp test are indicated by the quantity of sulfide produced from the substrate the cod conversion is calculated based on the stoichiometric ratio i e cod s ratio equals to 2 as 8 electrons transfer when sulfate is reduced to sulfide compared with 4 electrons when oxygen is an electron acceptor the sulfide production resulting from substrate degradation was determined by subtracting the values obtained from the blank assays statistical analysis of the triplicated bsp test results were carried out on mean values relative standard deviations detection limits dl and repeatability r following iso 5725 1994 for dependent variables data analysis the statistical methods are given in the supporting information si 2 1 2 bmp test the influence of sulfate laden substrate on the standard anaerobic method for biodegradation evaluation the bmp test was explored the substrate was the same as for the bsp test and mpb sludge was sourced from local anaerobic sludge digesters with characteristics as shown in table 1 to maintain the same isr as that of the bsp test 220 ml substrate ps and 30 ml inoculum mpb were added to the bottles and 220 ml of deionized water was used in the blank series operational conditions were kept the same as in the bsp test with procedures following the bmp test protocol angelidaki et al 2009 methane production was monitored on a daily basis over the first week and every 2 3 days thereafter the results of the bmp test are indicated to the quantity of methane produced from a given concentration of substrate as vss and the cod conversion is calculated by dividing the theoretical methane production potential of 380 ml ch4 g cod under 37 c statistical data analysis was also conducted on the bmp test using the same methods as in the bsp test 2 1 3 substrate biodegradation rate in bsp and bmp test hydrolysis is regarded as the rate limiting step for complex substrates such as ps and therefore determines the organics conversion rate batstone et al 2006 myint and nirmalakhandan 2006 sötemann et al 2005 poinapen and ekama 2010 the hydrolysis rate k and biodegradation potential b 0 are key parameters for assessing the substrate digestibility the values of these parameters were estimated by fitting bsp and bmp test results to both a first order one substrate hydrolysis model and a two substrate hydrolysis model rao et al 2000 jensen et al 2011 as described in eqs 5 and 6 the two substrate model segregates the substrate into readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable organics 2 1 3 1 one substrate first

donoso bravo et al 2011 appels et al 2011 the accuracy of the model s fit was evaluated based on the root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 kafle and kim 2013 thomsen et al 2014 2 2 bsp test applications besides the substrate biodegradability and biodegradation rate analysis two additional applications of the bsp test can be derived the bpo average elemental composition can be determined and a bsp biochemical kinetic model can be developed to predict bsr process performance 2 2 1 elemental composition determination of the electron donor equation 1 shows that the aqueous bsr products are dependent on the composition of the substrate hence the ad system performance can be predicted if the composition of the degraded organics is known moreover the average elemental composition of bpo in the form of c x h y o z n a p b s c can provide further insight into the optimization of feed composition and operational adjustment an advantage of the bsp test is that elemental mass and cod balances can be closed with only aqueous phase measurements avoiding the inaccurate gas measurements of the bmp test because the sulfide can be kept in solution in reactors therefore during the bsp test the ph was maintained at 7 6 8 0 and the x y z a b c values in the generalized bpo composition can be derived from the bsp results from the element and electron balance eq 1 assuming zero bsr biomass production e 0 which is reasonable given the very low yield of organisms conducting bsr all op is h2po4 fop 1 and there is no charge on the ps organics ch 0 then eq 1 becomes followed eq 7 7 c x h y o z n a p b s c x y 2 3 a 2 3 b 2 c h 2 o x 2 y 8 z 4 3 a 8 5 b 8 c 4 s o 4 2 x 2 y 8 z 4 5 a 8 3 b 8 5 c 4 h 2 s y 4 z 2 a 4 b 4 c 2 h s x h c o 3 a n h 4 b h 2 p o 4 the bpo composition can be expressed by eq 8 volcke et al 2006 ekama 2009 8 c x h y o z n a p b s c c f c 12 h f h 1 o f o 16 n f n 14 p f p 31 s f s 32 where f c f h f o f n f p f s are the mass ratios g element g compound of each element in the organics and f c f h f o f n f p f s 1 g compound vss equation 7 shows that all constituents of the bpo remain dissolved in the aqueous phase and can be measured there this is because almost all of the c in the bpo is oxidized to hco3 in the reactor which represents the alkalinity increase from the reduction of sulfate a simplification based on complete organics oxidation by sulfidogenesis however the quantity of hco3 generated from most organics is insufficient cod toc 2 67 to balance as alkalinity to supply the required h a condition described as carbon deficiency poinapen and ekama 2010 therefore the sulfide system provides the remaining h requirement through the dissociation of hs as eqs 1 and 7 show hence the bpo decomposed and converted to dissolved aqueous substances and therefore the mass ratios can be determined from the following measurements the total organic carbon can be determined from the carbonate alkalinity h2co3 hco3 co3 2 expressed as h2co3 the total organic nitrogen can be analyzed from the free and saline ammonia fsa measurement as n and the total organic phosphorus can be measured by orthophosphate op tests as p the cod changes were derived from the sulfide concentration difference according to the electron balance δcod 2δsulfide hence f c δh 2 co 3 alkalinity 50 12 δvss f n δfsa δvss f p δop δvss f s δsulfur δvss f cv δcod δvss while f o and f h can be calculated from eqs 9 and 10 the derivation for eqs 7 and 8 and the explanation for the fraction values in front of the mass ratios is given by ekama and brouckaert 2018 9 f o 16 18 1 1 8 f c v 8 12 f c 17 14 f n 26 31 f p 26 32 f s 10 f h 1 9 1 f c v 44 12 f c 10 14 f n 71 31 f p 80 32 f s casein c 1 h 1 02 o 0 15 n 0 06 s 0 04 was applied as a standard substrate for calibration to validate the accuracy of this method in determining bpo composition the error between the derived average elemental composition from the bsp test and the theoretical composition was analyzed based on elemental molar mass error analysis following eq 11 11 e r r o r i 1 n x i m e a s u r e x i t h e o r e t i c a l m i f i t h e o r e t i c a l m s t h e

the theoretical composition fraction of each element from the casein molecular formula m i is the molar mass of each element i f i t h e o r e t i c a l is the theoretical elemental mass ratio and m s t h e o r e t i c a l is the theoretical molar mass of the substrate 2 2 2 implementation of bsp biochemical process model although the first order mathematical bsp model in section 2 1 3 is typically used to describe the degradation rate of organics the biologically associated parameters and processes are not included the kinetic degradation process during a bsp test is controlled by the microbial activity and substrate accessibility which are dependent on the biochemical surroundings jensen et al 2011 this limits the practical applicability of the first order mathematical model and thus a biochemical kinetic bsp model is needed to predict reactor performance the determined bpo composition was adopted as the model input variable enabling the bsp model to be easily implemented the stoichiometry of the bsp biochemical process model is summarized in table s1 of the si including biomass growth biomass endogenous respiration chemical equilibrium dissociation processes ammonia carbonate phosphate acetate weak acid base systems and physical liquid gas transfer h2s linked through henry s law the experimental data from the bsp tests in different series were used for model calibration and validation respectively parameters were estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations between the measured data and the model predictions using the secants embedded in aquasim 2 1d reichert 1998 2 3 analytical methods samples collected from the tests were filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 45 μm pore size to analyze of nh4 n alkalinity sulfide sulfate op and soluble cod scod the vss and total cod tcod were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 the nh4 n was analyzed using a lachat quik chem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin alkalinity was examined with an auto titration system using the five point titration method moosbrugger et al 1993 ekama and brouckaert 2018 sulfide level were determined using the methylene blue method apha 2005 while sulfate and op were measured through ion chromatograph ic the concentrations of biogas from the bmp tests were determined using a manometer and gas chromatography gc equipped with a valco gc valve and thermal conductivity detector tait et al 2009 the accumulated volumetric gas production was calculated from the increased pressure in the headspace volume 50 ml and expressed under standard conditions 25 c 1 atm the methane production over time was reported as the volume of produced methane divided by the amount of vss added ml ch4 g vss added 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate biodegradability in bsp and bmp test the products of electron donors that determine substrate biodegradability are sulfide in the bsp test and methane in the bmp test the cumulative total methane daily methane production and cumulative total gas production profiles from the bmp test as well as the cumulative sulfide production profile in the bsp test are depicted in fig 1 a and b respectively the methane and sulfide productivity per gram of vss added cod conversion per gram of vss loaded and vss destruction efficiency are summarized in table 2 fig 1 a shows that the cumulative methane production reached 240 10 3 ml ch4 g vss added on day 35 when the bmp test reached a steady state fig 1 b shows that the net sulfide yield reached 193 3 98 mg s l on day 4 when net production became steady although production continued to increase in the test and blank series due to endogenous turnover no methane gas was detected throughout the whole bsp tests correspondingly the cod conversions were calculated as 0 63 0 027 g cod g vss for the bmp test and 1 64 0 034 g cod g vss for the bsp test while vss reductions were 39 7 1 1 in the bmp test and 58 6 3 8 in the bsp test table 2 this suggests that the bmp test conservatively estimates the biodegradability of sulfate laden municipal primary settled sludge which was 2 6 and 1 48 times lower in the cod and vss destruction compared with the bsp test this means that the biodegradation capacity of a bsr process is underestimated if the biodegradability evaluation of organic waste undergoing sulfidogenesis is based on the bmp test which is therefore limited in its ability to characterize organic waste in bsr processes it is worth noting that in the bmp test sulfide production was 33 1 mg s l which is equivalent to 0 29g cod g vss this accounts for 31 5 in terms of cod conversion with sulfide included despite its significance this proportion is still less than gaseous methane measurement errors that have been reported e g 37 by raposo et al 2011 therefore the bmp test is still underestimated 44 lower in terms of cod conversion even when the produced sulfide is accounted compared with bsp test to secure a benchmarked evaluation and neutral comparison of these two methods the produced sulfide in bmp was not accounted in compliance with the bmp protocol wherein the methane gas towards the collected data however to standardize the protocol of the bsp test interferences such as methane or sulfide should be considered and a pre condition should be set by using specific microbial inhibitors statistical analysis was conducted on both the bmp and bsp test results table s3 in si from which their relative standard deviation and repeatability r were compared for accuracy analysis the detection limit dl results revealed significant production of methane or sulfide with a confidence level of at least 95 the dl threshold was 1 74 ml ch4 g vss for the bmp test and 10 99 mg s l for the bsp test both acceptable based on this analysis the relative standard deviation of the bsp test in both the blank series 3 7 and net production 1 7 as well as its repeatability r 15 9 mg s l were all lower than those of the bmp test 11 2 5 0 and 19 4 ml ch4 g vss respectively demonstrating a higher precision and lower random error in the bsp test than in the bmp test it has long been difficult to precisely measure the produced methane gas in bmp tests due to collection and measurement errors strömberg et al 2014 previous studies observed biogas measurement deviations of 8 wulf et al 2011 and 15 37 raposo et al 2011 despite following the standardized bmp test instructions angelidaki et al 2009 recommended by the international water association anaerobic digestion specialist group in contrast the bsp test simplifies the collection process and improve accuracy by eliminating the impact of gas collection errors since the end products sulfide and bicarbonate remain dissolved at ph values above 8 sutherland stacey et al 2008 the mature and standardized sulfide measurement methods facilitate the bsp test as an easily operated accurate and cost effective deterministic approach the higher cod conversion and vss destruction efficiency in the bsp test may stem from the produced sulfide which facilitates the fracturing of larger sludge flocs thus enhancing substrate degradation whittington jones et al 2002 researchers have shown that sulfide has a positive effect on the particulate substrate hydrolysis process molwantwa et al 2004 whittington jones et al 2006 kim and lee 2009 which may be attributed to the indirect sulfide effect through the disruption of the sludge flocs thereby facilitates contact between the hydrolytic enzymes and their substrates whittington jones 2000 or the direct effect of sulfide which increases the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes whiteley et al 2004 this mechanism is similar to thermal pretreatment in which the applied heat breaks down the sludge floc cohesion and facilitates the solubilization of organic matter carrère et al 2009 other studies have shown that the direct hydrolysis of recalcitrant compounds by srb can create a favorable environment for either chemical or enzymatic degradation which may be related to redox conditions whittington jones et al 2006 however the precise mechanisms of the increased hydrolysis rate remains contested the characterization of substrates has also been studied through time efficient aerobic respirometry for municipal wastewater and industrial wastewater orhon et al 1997 de lucas et al 2007 buendía et al 2008 explored the biodegradability of complex organic waste under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions using bmp and oxygen uptake rate our testing respectively and conclude that the estimated substrate biodegradable fraction from our testing was lower than that from bmp tests combining the results of bsp test and bmp test in this study the biodegradability of organic substrates for sulfidogenesis based on either bmp tests or our tests is underestimated compared to the bsp test cossu and raga 2008 studied the relationship between the respiration index ri4 cumulative oxygen consumption after four days and biogas production index gs21 gas sum measured after 21 days of incubation of landfill waste r 2 0 80 this implies that bsp can be used as a standard value for conventional anaerobic and aerobic systems once the relationships between bsp and both bod5 and bmp are confirmed 3 2 biodegradation rate in bsp and bmp test the hydrolysis rate k and degradation potential b 0 in the bmp and bsp tests were estimated using one substrate and two substrate hydrolysis models 3 2 1 one substrate first order hydrolysis model the simulated biodegradation potential and biodegradation kinetics from bmp and bsp tests are shown in table 3 and the simulated values fit satisfactorily with the measured data r2 0 97 the results show a higher organics biodegradation rate in the bsp test than in the bmp test which is consistent with the comparative test between the two tests in which the bmp test took nearly 35 days whilst the bsp test achieved a steady state by around day 4 fig 1 the faster degradation rate in the bsp test than in the bmp test is consistent with the results obtained by kim 1997 and pareek et al 1998 molwantwa et al 2004 and whittington jones et al 2006 report that both the extent and rate of solubilization of primary sludge was enhanced significantly under sulfidogenic conditions than in methanogenic systems with 2 1 times the solubilization and approximately three times the speed of hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates the difference in hydrolysis rate between the bsp and bmp tests further supports the conclusion that the bmp test has limited indicative value for bsr processes the different degradation rates between these two tests may be attributed to the contribution of sulfide which increase the fracture of the particulate substrates as discussed in section 3 1 thus accelerating the sulfidogenic hydrolysis process the biodegradation rate of sulfate laden ps from the bmp test is 0 045 d in this study much lower than in other bmp studies ranging from 0 11 d to 0 16 d chynoweth et al 1993 lopes et al 2004 this may be on due to the inhibition of mpb by high levels of sulfide as the municipal sewage in hong kong is brackish due to the territory wide use of seawater for toilet flushing this has resulted in a sulfate concentration of approximately 500 mg l and sewage salinity of 0 8 tang et al 2007 leung et al 2012 which may adversely affect methane production 3 2 2 two substrate first order hydrolysis model the biodegradation potential and hydrolysis rate in both the readily biodegradable fraction brapid krapid and the slowly biodegradable fraction bslow kslow were estimated by fitting the two substrate first order hydrolysis model to the experimental data from both the bsp and bmp test with the estimated values shown in table 4 the simulated substrate ultimate biodegradability potential expressed as the cod conversion from the one substrate and two substrate first order models are compared in fig 2 the bsp test showed greater hydrolysis rates and substrate biodegradability potential for both readily and slowly biodegradable organics than the bmp test by contrast in the free nitrous acid fna pretreatment method for hydrolysis enhancement the hydrolysis rate was only enhanced on the readily biodegradable fraction resulting from the biocidal effect of fna while the slowly biodegradable substrate was not significantly affected wang et al 2013 as a rate limiting process in anaerobic organics degradation hydrolysis is normally enhanced by a variety of pre treatment methods including mechanical thermal and chemical pretreatment processes however the majority of these methods are energy intensive and or expensive which have limited their widespread use carrère et al 2010 the bsp test demonstrates that the hydrolysis rates from readily and slowly biodegradable fractions can be simultaneously increased with low energy use and at low cost making sulfidogenic hydrolysis a suitable alternative pretreatment method to enhance the hydrolysis process the increased hydrolysis rate in the bsp test greatly accelerates the measurement of organics biodegradability given the long duration typically 30 60 days of the bmp test which is typically a major inconvenience to substrate assessment batstone et al 2009 the bsp test serve as an alternative less time consuming approach to determine substrate biodegradability in methanogenic reactors but requires further investigation to confirm a relationship between bsp and bmp values 3 3 bsp test applications 3 3 1 average elemental composition determination of bpo with bsp test casein c1h1 02o0 15n0 06s0 04 was applied as a verification standard to verify the credibility of determining bpo average elemental composition using the bsp test the results of the bsp validation test and the computed casein average elemental composition results are shown in table s4 and table s5 si the estimated casein composition on the basis of bsp test results is shown as c1h0 89o0 32n0 21p0 02s0 07 which is close to the theoretical formula error analysis was based on the elemental molar mass proportions according to equation 10 the predicted composition accuracy was shown to be 97 which demonstrates the reliability of this method refer to table s6 si for details differences between the computationally derived result and theoretical composition are most likely due to random error as each element is of relatively similar magnitude based on the credibility of the casein based validation the bpo of ps and inoculum srb sludge composition were estimated from the bsp test results the ph value was shown as 7 8 0 1 in the bsp test given the different elemental fractions and overall changes in cod and vss the form of the bpo composition in ps was derived as c1h3 17o0 65n0 006p0 26s0 39 and the inoculum srb sludge composition as c1h0 99o0 007n0 24p0 031s0 41 respectively these estimated compositions were subsequently used directly for the bsp biochemical kinetic model as initial input variables the bsp test can be confidently used to estimate the bpo composition which facilitates the identification of suitable substrates especially for complex substrates in co digestion processes and the modification of operational strategies in bsr systems additionally bsp tests can contribute to substrate analysis and thus help to maintain system stability by ensuring a suitable c n ratio which in turn affects operational stability and nutrient removal efficiency in terms of the organics average elemental composition analysis elemental analyzers have been widely adopted to determine the empirical formula which can subsequently be used to calculate theoretical methane potential and assess organics biodegradability rather than by using the time consuming bmp test with its associated inaccuracies davidsson et al 2007 raposo et al 2012 bsp tests can more accurately characterize biodegradable organic waste than elemental analyzers which do not differentiate between biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions and thus typically overestimate the former as they also include the latter in their estimations ekama and brouckaert 2018 the bsp test also facilitates the automatic check of the mass balance in the biochemical degradation model moreover the bsp test can be easily used for sulfate free waste by dosing sulfate to create a conventional bsr environment 3 3 2 bsp biochemical process model in this study a bsp biochemical process model was built using the estimated bpo composition as the input variable the simulated sulfide production is shown in fig 3 which demonstrates that sulfide production can be accurately predicted the biodegradation rate derived from this bsp kinetic model was 0 229 d which is half of that from the bsp first order hydrolysis model 0 47 d the lower value is theoretically more precise and reliable as the biological kinetics are not integrated into the first order hydrolysis model as demonstrated in previous studies a reliable substrate initial expression combined with an accurate kinetic model enables the sulfide potential from different types of substrates to be predicted beuvink and kogut 1993 rincon et al 2009 koch and drewes 2014 thus facilitates the prediction of a full scale reactor s response to variations in substrate composition and operational conditions as well as for optimizing the design and operation of bsr systems tomei et al 2008 appels et al 2008 in the bsp biochemical process model the substrate input variable adopts the form of c x h y o z n a p b s c sötemann et al 2005 ekama 2009 ekama et al 2018 instead of a composite input component that includes substances such as soluble and particulate carbohydrates protein lipids and individual volatile fatty acids along with constants and coefficients present in anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm1 and its extended sulfate reduction model batstone et al 2002 fedorovich et al 2003 the simpler elemental summarized substrate composition and the built bsp model could alleviate difficulties and reduce the substantial calibration required for plant operation and improvement these benefits must be considered in conjunction with the potential benefits of a more thorough substrate composition analysis when dealing with complex and variable waste streams in this study it was observed that the derivation of the waste composition from standard measurements as required for the bsp model is a difficult task that can nevertheless significantly skew the model results if conducted inaccurately a step by step procedure was therefore defined to straightforwardly derive bpo characteristics from a minimal set of bsp test measurements and apply them in a bsp biochemical process model as illustrated in fig 4 3 4 implications this study revealed a new method of evaluating the biodegradability of organic waste in sulfidogenic reactors known as the biochemical sulfide potential bsp test its high efficiency as well as simpler and more accurate measurement in comparison with the bmp test enables it to more reliably determine the biodegradability and organic waste biodegradation rate the bsp test also enables many sulfate reduction associated issues such as inhibition phenomena pre treatment nutrient supplementation operational concerns and model analysis to be investigated furthermore the bsp biochemical kinetic model is a useful engineering tool for the assessment of process performance it can effectively assist in calculating and predicting the theoretical sulfide yield organics removal efficiency and corresponding appropriate retention time thus optimizing reactor operation comprehensive experimental studies are essential to improving bsp tests to enable its widespread use for instance the ultimate sulfide yield is likely to also be dictated by other substrate related factors such as isr particle size homogeneity temperature and product toxicity undissociated h2s inhibition as has been similarly discussed for the bmp test chynoweth et al 1993 the differences in the extent of substrate biodegradation and rate of the sulfidogenic and methanogenic processes using primary settled sludge were significant given the simplicity and improved accuracy of the bsp test further studies should also focus on confirming the general relationship coefficients between bsp and bmp as well as bod5 to extend its applicability in conventional anaerobic and aerobic treatment processes 4 conclusions a deterministic substrate biodegradability test method the bsp test is proposed in this study to determine the extent and rate of organics biodegradation in bsr processes the feasibility of the bsp test and the applicability of the bmp test to sulfate laden organics were investigated through a biodegradability comparison and the accuracy of the results was verified according to iso 5725 furthermore two applications of the bsp test namely to determine bpo composition and a model to simulate substrate degradation were implemented the main conclusions are summarized as follows the bsp test realized 2 6 times the cod conversion and 1 48 times the vss destruction of the bmp test on the same substrate in the presence of sulfate the biodegradation rate in the bsp test was an order of magnitude faster than that in the bmp test as was identified from both the readily and slowly biodegradable organics fractions in the substrate the bsp test is effective and indispensable for measuring the biodegradability of substrates that will undergo a bsr process due to the limitations of the bmp test on these substrates bpo composition in elemental form can be derived from bsp test results with reasonable accuracy which facilitates substrate choice ph prediction and operation assessment the bsp biochemical kinetic model which was built based on the bpo elemental composition provides a valuable tool for predicting bsr process performance and optimizing reactor operation acknowledgements the authors wish to thank hong kong s research grants council for its support grant

19681,sidestream granular activated sludge grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate was bioaugmented and selectively retained to enable high nitrification performance of a 2 5 day aerobic srt non nitrifying flocculent activated sludge system at 12 c sidestream grown granules performed enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and short cut nitrogen removal via nitrite after bioaugmentation ebpr continued in the mainstream but ammonia oxidation was eventually to nitrate low effluent nh3 n concentrations from 0 6 to 1 7 mg l were achieved with nitrification solely by granules thus enabling denitrification and nitrogen removal molecular microbial analyses of flocs and granules also suggested that nitrifying organisms persisted on granules with minimal nitrifier loss to flocs mainstream granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation testing was 1 7 times the amount of sidestream granules added indicating mainstream granular growth nitrite and nitrate availability during the unaerated feeding period encouraged significant growth of ordinary heterotrophs in mainstream granules but nevertheless mainstream nitrification capacity was sustained graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge nitrification centrate reject water enhanced biological phosphorus removal 1 introduction increased nitrification capacity in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs with activated sludge processes may be needed to treat higher influent loads meet lower effluent ammonia nitrogen nh3 n concentration limits and or for conversion to nitrogen removal bioaugmentation with nitrifying biomass produced in sidestream treatment of anaerobic digestion dewatering reject water increases the nitrifier concentration in flocculent activated sludge and intensifies the nitrification capacity without increasing the reactor volume kos 1998 the reject water referred to as centrate when centrifugation is used for dewatering is normally returned to mainstream treatment with nh3 n concentrations in the range of 700 1800 mg l which can be 15 30 of the total nitrogen load to the mainstream secondary treatment process tchobanoglous et al 2014 thus sidestream centrate treatment processes can be used to reduce the return nh3 n load and also add nitrifying bacteria to the mainstream process for nitrification bioaugmentation nitrifier bioaugmentation with flocculent sludge from sidestream treatment has been widely demonstrated in full scale wrrfs using various process configurations bowden et al 2015 parker and wanner 2007 at a full scale facility with aerobic and total solids retention times srts near 5 and 7 days respectively bioaugmentation improved average effluent nh3 n concentration from 15 to 7 mg l at temperatures of 10 16 c krhutková et al 2006 the improvement in mainstream nitrification performance by sidestream bioaugmentation was due to the increase in the mainstream nitrifying bacteria concentration but the performance was still limited by the overall srt of the mainstream flocculent sludge for systems with low or non nitrifying srts and or low temperatures the increase in nitrification capacity from sidestream bioaugmentation may not be sufficient to reduce effluent nh3 n concentrations to meet discharge requirements a more optimal solution to increase the nitrification capacity from sidestream bioaugmentation would be to uncouple the srt of the bioaugmented population from the floc srt which could be accomplished by growing sidestream nitrifiers in a biofilm that can be selectively retained in the mainstream system granular activated sludge is a good candidate for such bioaugmentation because granular biofilms are grown without a carrier material allowing them to be more easily pumped from sidestream to mainstream treatment and within the mainstream process aerobic granules are a type of biofilm structure in which bacteria are grown in dense fast settling biomass typically 1 2 mm in diameter figdore et al 2017 the srt of granular sludge bioaugmented can be decoupled from the lower srt of the flocculent sludge by selective retention due to their larger size and faster settling velocity granule floc separation using hydrocyclones shi et al 2016 and screens liu et al 2014 has been demonstrated longer retention and accumulation of granular biomass is expected to result in a higher volumetric nitrification capacity without building additional tank volume to a mainstream activated sludge system growth of aerobic granules performing nitrification denitrification ndn with phosphorus accumulating organisms paos mediating enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and denitrification has been demonstrated in lab sequencing batch reactors sbrs treating synthetic wastewater bassin et al 2012 and in full scale sbrs at wrrfs treating domestic wastewater pronk et al 2015a a typical operating sequence for these reactors is anaerobic feeding aeration with simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and a short settling time of less than 10 min neither the growth of ndn pao granules in sidestream treatment of anaerobic digestion centrate from wrrfs nor the ability to use them for sustained nitrification bioaugmentation in a low srt flocculent activated sludge system has been reported the ability to grow ndn pao granules under potential adverse impacts of centrate solids and residual dewatering polymer is of interest for developing this novel bioaugmentation scheme centrate contains a relatively high amount of refractory colloidal material which may interfere with granule growth by sorbing to the granule surface and thus interfering with mass transfer and biological growth in granules flocculating polymers such as those used for dewatering may sorb to the granule surface and cause substrate diffusion limitations and result in undesirable granule morphology and poor settleability val del río et al 2012 the objective of this study was to evaluate the bioaugmentation process using ndn pao granules from sidestream centrate treatment with the goal of determining if the added granules and nitrification are sustained after bioaugmentation in a low temperature mainstream flocculent activated sludge system with selective granule retention and a flocculent sludge srt below the theoretical minimum nitrification srt important process information included in this evaluation are changes in granule physical characteristics and nitrification capacity between the sidestream and mainstream reactors and microbial community composition of the sidestream granules mainstream granules and mainstream flocculent sludge the mainstream system was an sbr operated at 12 c with conditions to support ebpr and snd by the bioaugmented ndn pao granules 2 material and methods 2 1 sidestream reactor a 2 0 l sidestream ndn pao granular sludge sbr was fed centrate which provided nh3 n for the growth of nitrifiers and an external carbon source which was necessary for the growth of paos and subsequent alkalinity production with denitrification the sbr had a height to diameter h d ratio of 4 9 and was operated at 18 c with 50 decant fill volume exchange per cycle the high volume exchange ratio was possible due to the low sludge volume index svi and rapid thickening of granules the centrate reactor total nitrogen tn volumetric loading rate goal was between 0 50 and 0 60 g tn l d which was based on estimated oxygen mass transfer limitations with fine bubble aeration in full scale reactors bowden et al 2015 after start up the amount of centrate and tn was gradually increased to this target loading external cod concentration was also manually increased in feed stream batches based on reactor performance to provide at least 80 tn removal while minimizing the external cod dose at the target volumetric nh3 n loading of about 0 50 g nh3 n l d the amount of centrate feed needed per cycle was only about 10 of the reactor volume because of the high centrate nh3 n concentration thus the other portion of the fill volume was provided by dilution water to represent dilution of mesophilic digestion centrate with secondary effluent in full scale application which would also reduce the sidestream reactor temperature wett et al 2011 have suggested that a lower temperature difference between sidestream and mainstream reactors would limit a temperature shock to nitrifying organisms which may improve bioaugmentation efficacy centrate and external cod streams were simultaneously added to the reactor in equal volumes using deionized water external cod sources were sodium acetate and sodium propionate with acetate and propionate contributing 70 and 30 respectively to total external cod additional details on influent composition are in the supplementary information si section s1 1 6 hr cycles consisted of the following steps 3 min anaerobic feeding 42 min anaerobic reaction 270 min aeration 1 17 min settling 2 min pumped effluent discharge 11 83 min idle and a 30 min post anoxic period the settling time resulted in removing particles with less than 10 1 m hr settling velocity in the discharged supernatant the post anoxic period with the remaining 1 0 l reactor liquid volume was used to minimize the nox n concentration prior to the subsequent feed period magnetic stirring at 200 rpm occurred during feeding aeration and the post anoxic period intermittent n2 sparging at 600 cm3 min for 3 s at 20 s intervals was applied during anaerobic and post anoxic periods for additional mixing a dissolved oxygen do controller eutech alphado2000w and galvanic probe atlas scientific were used to control do between 1 8 and 2 2 mg l by on off aeration at 1500 cm3 min corresponding to a superficial gas velocity of 0 5 cm s all gasses were sparged from an aeration stone at the reactor bottom after preliminary granule formation on synthetic wastewater simulating centrate treatment see section s1 1 for media composition the influent feed and nitrogen source was changed to mesophilic anaerobic digestion centrate from three of seattle king county municipal wrrfs processing waste primary and secondary sludge secondary treatment processes at these facilities are described in section s1 1 a high charge cationic polyacrylamide polymer polydyne we 973 is used for dewatering at the wrrfs raw centrate was settled for 10 min and the supernatant was screened with a 53 μm sieve the purpose of pretreatment was 1 to represent effluent from centrate equalization tanks at full scale wrrfs and 2 to ensure that granule growth in centrate treatment was from microbial self aggregation and not biofilm growth on large particles in the raw centrate pretreated centrate was stored at 4 c and replaced biweekly during the 140 d centrate treatment period pretreated centrate characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 mainstream reactor the 2 0 l mainstream sbr with h d ratio of 1 8 was operated at 12 c and a 2 5 d flocculent sludge aerobic srt to suppress nitrification the total srt was 4 0 d including the deoxygenation and anoxic anaerobic time the sbr cycle time was 4 h consisting of 10 min deoxygenation with n2 gas sparging 10 min anaerobic feeding 40 min anaerobic reaction 150 min aerobic reaction 24 min settling 5 min effluent discharge and 1 min idle 1 0 l of complex synthetic wastewater table s1 was fed per cycle containing total cod readily biodegradable cod rbcod nh3 n tn and po4 p concentrations of 210 78 26 5 32 and 32 mg l respectively the influent cod and tn concentrations were set to represent municipal wastewater the influent po4 p concentration was higher than typical municipal wastewaters because of using mono and dibasic phosphate for ph buffering in the synthetic wastewater in view of the fact that for most cases with municipal wastewater treatment ebpr and pao growth are carbon limited the use of a higher po4 p concentration than a typical municipal wastewater concentration of 5 10 mg l would not be expected to affect the p removal or ndn pao granular sludge growth tchobanoglous et al 2014 though the feeding and mixed reactor period was intended to be anaerobic an initial anoxic period occurred due to residual nox n after decanting because of limited snd during the aeration period mixing during deoxygenation feeding and reaction periods was achieved by continuous sparging of n2 at 700 cm3 min and co2 at 5 cm3 min do concentration during the aerobic period was controlled between 1 8 and 2 2 mg l by on off aeration at 1000 cm3 min using equipment specified in section 2 1 gasses were sparged from an aeration stone at the bottom perimeter wall 2 2 1 pre bioaugmentation period prior to sidestream ndn pao granule bioaugmentation the mainstream reactor was operated for 3 days with only flocculent activated sludge to verify lack of nitrification the initial activated sludge was from an earlier experiment and were thus acclimated to the influent synthetic wastewater under anoxic feeding 2 2 2 bioaugmentation period the bioaugmentation period consisted of two phases a 15 d phase with an initial slug addition of the sidestream nitrifying granules followed by a 25 d phase with continuous daily addition of granules beginning on day 15 flocs were defined as particles smaller than 425 μm and their srt was controlled by wasting solids passing a 425 μm sieve the granular solids retained on the sieve were returned to the reactor no intentional wasting of granules was done as the purpose of the study was to determine the ability to sustain granules in the system the initial slug seeding of sidestream granules was added with an estimated nh3 n oxidation capacity sufficient to nitrify the daily amount of nh3 n fed to the mainstream reactor after accounting for assimilatory nh3 n removal the estimate assumed the same specific nh3 n oxidation rate measured in the granular sludge reactor treating centrate with excess nh3 n and similar do concentration and correcting for the lower mainstream temperature using a temperature activity coefficient of 1 072 tchobanoglous et al 2014 after the slug bioaugmentation phase a small dose of granules was added daily during the continuous bioaugmentation phase granule addition was based on the observed sidestream granule yield for treating 25 of the mainstream nitrogen load as centrate nitrogen which is a typical sidestream nitrogen return load to full scale wrrfs section s1 2 provides more details on granule addition in this phase 2 2 3 post bioaugmentation period at the end of the bioaugmentation period granules were removed by sieving the entire reactor contents operation continued with flocculent activated sludge to evaluate the contribution of the flocculent sludge fraction to nitrification and nitrogen removal in the bioaugmented process mlss was then wasted in a conventional manner for srt control without sieving 2 3 ammonia oxidation kinetics granular sludge maximum specific nh3 n oxidation activity was measured at 20 22 c with excess nh3 n and alkalinity and do concentration greater than 7 mg l activities were normalized to 20 c as above the apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration for sidestream granules was measured in a similar test until nh3 n removal was complete data were fitted to a fourth degree polynomial regression with r2 0 999 the apparent half saturation concentration was calculated from the first derivative of the regression equation additional details for these tests are in section s1 3 2 4 analytical methods nh3 n and no3 n were measured by ion sensing electrode probes hach intellical isenh4181 and iseno3181 tn was determined by persulfate digestion and quantification of digestate

stemi sv11 and image analysis using fiji image processing software individual granule sizes were quantified as the equivalent circular diameter of the measured plan view area based on a calibrated scale in units of pixels per mm a minimum sample of 250 granules was used to determine average diameter and granule size distributions 2 5 molecular microbial analyses 2 5 1 isolation and quantification of genomic dna sludge samples were stored at 80 c prior to dna isolation dna was isolated from triplicate 2 ml samples for each granule floc sample type using the ultraclean microbial dna isolation kit mo bio inc with 10 min of thermal pretreatment at 65 c and bead beating at 4 m s for 20 s dna concentration was measured using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher 2 5 2 high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons dna samples were normalized to equal concentrations 22 5 ng μl using nuclease free water and submitted to a service facility www mrdnalab com for sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons using the miseq system illumina inc bacterial 16s rrna gene primers 341f and 805r were used in a single step pcr due to their low bias compared to other primer pairs hugerth et al 2014 additional details are provided in section s1 5 2 5 3 bioinformatics the uparse method edgar 2013 was used for amplicon sequence processing and operational taxonomic unit otu

relatedness of otus while bray curtis does not 2 5 4 quantitative pcr qpcr gene copies of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and candidatus nitrotoga hereafter nitrotoga nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in sidestream granules and mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation were measured by qpcr using amoa 1f amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 and ntg200f ntg840r alawi et al 2007 primers respectively aob in mainstream flocs were also measured at different points of bioaugmentation results were normalized to template dna mass additional details and pcr conditions are in section s1 6 3 results 3 1 sidestream centrate treatment growth of ndn pao granules was achieved in the centrate treatment reactor with consistent production of excess granules to support bioaugmentation the average net influent concentrations from the centrate dilution water feed are shown table 2 along with average treatment performance for operating days 60 140 daily performance data for this period are shown in fig s1 the 40 d bioaugmentation period corresponded to sidestream centrate treatment days 86 126 effluent tn removal averaged 88 at a loading rate of 0 54 g tn l d nitrogen removal occurred primarily via nitritation denitritation in the aerobic period as indicated by the high effluent no2 n concentration average feed external cod tn removed ratio and lack of granule nitrite oxidation activity in batch tests see section s1 4 for methods the average feed external cod tn removed ratio was 3 3 including values as low as 3 0 during optimal performance periods in comparison the cod n requirement for denitrification of no3 n is approximately 5 0 tchobanoglous et al 2014 due to its higher oxidation state occasional effluent scod measurements at biweekly intervals were within 20 of the diluted influent centrate scod concentration which suggests that centrate cod was primarily non biodegradable and not a significant contributor to denitrification granule nitrite oxidation activity was nearly zero in batch tests fig s2 anaerobic po4 p release averaged 0 58 mol p mol c indicating that granules were enriched with paos oehmen et al 2005 cycle profiles figs s3 and s4 showed high degrees of snd and ebpr the average diameter of sidestream granules fig 1 a was 1 3 mm 0 6 mm standard deviation according to the granular definition in this study of solids retained on a 425 μm sieve manual wasting of mlss accounted for 57 of the average daily solids production about 95 of the reactor mlss mass and 15 of effluent tss could be retained on a 425 μm sieve the maximum specific nh3 n oxidation activity of sidestream granules was 10 0 mg n g vss hr and their apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration was 2 3 mg l fig s5 3 2 mainstream treatment mainstream effluent inorganic nitrogen species concentrations were measured prior to bioaugmentation during bioaugmentation and after granule removal fig 2 nh3 n removal beyond assimilation for cell synthesis was minimal before bioaugmentation and nitrification was immediately intensified after the initial charge of granules effluent ph and alkalinity during bioaugmentation were at non inhibitory levels for nitrification and averaged 7 6 and 330 mg l as caco3 respectively effluent nh3 n concentrations between 0 6 and 1 7 mg l were sustained during the continuous bioaugmentation period with lower values in the last 15 days the rate of nh3 n removal decreased at the end of the aeration period as nh3 n concentration approached 2 mg l which was consistent with the apparent half saturation concentration of sidestream granules section 3 1 effluent nh3 n rapidly increased to pre bioaugmentation concentrations when the reactor granules were removed fig 2 the dominant nh3 n oxidation product shifted from no2 n to no3 n over time the effluent nox n concentration increased from 8 7 to 14 2 mg l during bioaugmentation and most of the nox n removal occurred during the feed react period a cycle profile of inorganic nitrogen species on the final day of bioaugmentation fig s6 indicated rapid and nearly complete denitrification by the end of influent feeding the slightly lower effluent tin concentration during the first 20 days of bioaugmentation fig 2 suggests that some snd occurred until the no2 n to no3 n conversion efficiency increased the bioaugmented granules continued ebpr in mainstream treatment the average po4 p concentrations standard deviations were 43 1 2 6 mg l at the end of the anaerobic react time and decreased to 27 5 1 1 mg l in the aeration period accounting for estimated denitrification cod demand the observed po4 p release was 0 19 mol p mol c as detailed in section s2 1 this indicates that some ebpr activity was sustained but it was much lower than that of sidestream granules po4 p removal averaged 4 7 mg l but the extent of anaerobic p release and p removal decreased over the bioaugmentation period fig s7 as the effluent no3 n concentration increased toward the end of the bioaugmentation period the 14 mg l of no3 n remaining from the previous cycle would require 70 mg l of influent cod for denitrification at a cod n ratio of 5 which is about equal to the influent feed rbcod a mixture of flocs and granules were maintained in the mainstream reactor fig 1b d and fig s8 and the sieving protocol for selective wasting of flocculent sludge during bioaugmentation provided good separation of flocs and granules fig s9 mainstream reactor settled sludge bed was stratified with granules and flocs located at the bottom and top respectively fig s10 flocculent sludge mlss and effluent tss concentrations during bioaugmentation averaged 900 and 8 mg l respectively fig s11 the granular sludge mlss concentration increased from an initial concentration of 3400 mg l to 5800 mg l at the end of the bioaugmentation period thus the fraction of granular sludge increased from about 0 79 to 0 87 the average mainstream granule size decreased from 1 3 mm to 0 8 mm 0 2 mm standard deviation at the end of the bioaugmentation test the particle size distribution was also different from the sidestream reactor granules fig s12 granule like particles of less than 425 μm were observed at the end of bioaugmentation fig 1d which were not present at the start of bioaugmentation fig 1b the total granule mass added to the mainstream was 6 8 g tss with 5 9 g added in the initial slug seeding and 0 9 g added during the continuous bioaugmentation phase the mainstream reactor granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation was 11 6 g tss indicating granule growth in the mainstream system at an average rate of 0 192 g day if this mass was wasted daily the granular sludge srt would be about 35 days 3 3 molecular analysis of microbial populations a decreasing trend in normalized amoa gene copy concentration was observed for the sidestream granules mainstream granules and mainstream flocs normalized amoa gene copy concentration in sidestream granules was of 2 3 104 0 3 104 copies ng template dna values were successively about one order of magnitude lower in mainstream granules 3 1 103 0 3 103 copies ng and flocs at the end of bioaugmentation flocculent sludge amoa copies increased marginally during bioaugmentation from 2 5 102 0 2 102 copies ng to 4 1 102 0 2 102 copies ng normalized nitrotoga gene copy concentrations in sidestream and mainstream granules had an opposite trend than those of aob nitrotoga gene copy concentration in sidestream granules was only 6 9 102 1 1 102 copies ng and hence 1 5 orders of magnitude less than aob nitrotoga increased to 6 9 103 0 5 103 copies ng in mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation which was slightly greater than aob taxonomy assignments for otus present at greater than 2 relative abundance in any sample are summarized in fig 3 for all sludge types taxa are presented in order of descending abundance in sidestream granules the sole nitrifying aob and nob were associated with nitrosomonas and nitrotoga respectively in sidestream granules average abundance of nitrotoga was 0 5 and much lower than that of nitrosomonas 3 2 the ratio of nitrotoga to nitrosomonas abundance was low in sidestream granules 0 16 and higher in mainstream granules 2 0 and flocs 6 5 which agrees with mainstream reactor performance where nitrification proceeded primarily to no2 n in the sidestream reactor section 3 1 and to no3 n in the mainstream reactor by the end of bioaugmentation testing fig 2 qpcr measurements and the sequencing based relative abundances of aob and nob showed similar trends between sidestream granules and mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation fig 3 shows that distinct heterotrophic populations were associated with each sample sidestream granules were dominated by haliscomenobacter desulfobulbaceae ca accumulibacter hereafter accumulibacter cytophaga and ca competibacter hereafter competibacter at similar abundances between 11 and 15 flavobacterium was the dominant genera in bioaugmented mainstream sludge and comprised 20 and 32 of mainstream granules and flocs respectively flavobacterium was also present at 10 abundance in mainstream flocs before bioaugmentation and 4 abundance in sidestream granules the abundances of all leading sidestream granule taxa were lower in mainstream granules and even lower in final mainstream flocs except for accumulibacter which had similar abundance near 4 in both mainstream granules and flocs other taxa including dechloromonas sphaerotilus halaingium and cryseobacterium were present at relatively similar abundances between about 2 and 5 in mainstream granules and flocs the most significant changes in taxa abundance for flocs before and after bioaugmentation were a decrease in mangroviflexus from 13 2 to 0 1 and an increase in flavobacterium from 10 to 32 as noted above beta diversity within and between granule floc types were compared for sidestream granules and mainstream granules and flocs at the end of bioaugmentation average beta diversity distances between granule floc types are shown in fig 4 distances for comparisons between granule floc types were significantly higher than control comparisons within granule floc types and weighted unifrac distances were consistently less than bray curtis distances for all comparisons beta diversity distances between sidestream and mainstream granules were greater than distances between mainstream granules and flocs all differences in beta diversity distances for comparisons against controls comparisons between granule floc types using the same beta diversity metric and comparisons between different beta diversity metrics for the same granule floc type were statistically significant at an alpha level of 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 granule growth in mainstream treatment the increase in mainstream granule mass during bioaugmentation indicates that granules added were sustained and that granular growth occurred selection pressures claimed for growth of ndn pao granules van loosdrecht et al 2005 are 1 a short settling time to favor capture of fast settling biomass granules 2 a high food mass f m ratio of readily biodegradable substrate in an anaerobic contact period to drive diffusion into the granular biofilm and intracellular substrate storage and 3 sufficient shear to form smooth and compact granular biofilms with little outgrowth similar selection pressures are used for growth of granules dominated by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos but with anoxic or aerobic feeding and higher aeration intensity required to provide sufficient oxygen and shear to form granular biofilms with the faster growing ohos considering these granular sludge selective pressures aspects of mainstream reactor operation included elements favorable for new granule growth in lieu of a short settling time selection granular particles was by sieving which has been previously shown to be effective for granule selection in absence of settling pressure liu et al 2014 the short 10 min unaerated feed period in this study provided high f m feeding conditions to encourage substrate uptake by ohos and storage by paos to some extent substrate uptake by ohos would be favored during feeding with residual nox n available from the preceding cycle while uptake by paos or possibly glycogen accumulating organisms gaos would occur for substrate remaining in the anaerobic time after nox n was removed the total gas sparging rate with n2 and air on was slightly higher than in the sidestream reactor 1700 versus 1500 cm3 min thus mainstream gas sparging may have provided sufficient shear to promote granule biofilm formation and discourage unwanted outgrowth the granules added were sustained in mainstream treatment but with a lower average size decreasing by 38 from 1 3 to 0 8 mm the smaller size is most likely related to a longer liquid solids settling time and a lower amount of rbcod available for uptake by paos under anaerobic conditions the settling time for the added granules was increased from 1 2 min in the sidestream reactor to 24 min in the mainstream reactor adav et al 2009 reported an average granule size of 2 2 mm with 5 min settling but only 1 1 mm with 10 min settling the smaller size granules with slower settling times can be maintained with a longer settling period the smaller granule size after settling was still large enough to be retained in the system by sieving the waste sludge the unaerated feeding and contact time was similar for the sidestream and mainstream reactors but much less cod was available for pao granule uptake in the mainstream during the unaerated feed and contact for the mainstream the feed cod concentration was 210 mg l compared to 648 mg l to the sidestream and the amount available for paos in granules was lowered due to much more nox n was available for rbcod uptake by flocs during the unaerated feeding the lower rbcod likely reduced the substrate diffusion gradient and depth resulting in starvation in the inner core of the larger granules figdore et al 2017 and fragmentation pronk et al 2015b verawaty et al 2013 therefore granule growth could have occurred on smaller granular particles after fragmentation of larger granules granulation from flocs is also a possibility due to the operating conditions discussed above differences in the microbial composition between the sidestream and mainstream granules figs 3 and 4 supports the contention of new granule growth with primarily ohos as affected by the operating conditions in the mainstream reactor 4 2 nitrification performance mainstream effluent nh3 n concentration during the final 20 days of bioaugmentation averaged 1 1 mg l which is significantly lower than that achieved in full scale systems with flocculent sludge bioaugmentation krhutková et al 2006 parker and wanner 2007 salem et al 2004 and longer srts a cycle profile on the final day of bioaugmentation fig s6 showed that nitrification occurred throughout the aerobic period with nitrification rate slowing as the granule apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration was approached at the end of the cycle methods to provide lower effluent nh3 n concentration include aeration at higher do concentration and using a longer aeration time it is also possible that with continued operation and addition of sidestream granules more nitrifying biomass could accumulate in mainstream treatment allowing lower effluent nh3 n concentrations although granular mass increased granule size decreased in mainstream treatment a smaller granule allows a higher aerobic surface area for nitrifier growth and thus a greater nitrification rate if the granules have the same fraction of nitrifiers for a given bulk liquid do concentration for a given bulk liquid do concentration the smaller granule will also result in a decreased anoxic volume fraction to reduce the denitrification capacity of internal paos winkler et al 2015 increased nh3 n oxidation capacity with mainstream granule growth was seen after the initial slug bioaugmentation and prior to continuous bioaugmentation with effluent nh3 n concentrations decreasing from 3 3 to 2 4 mg l over days 1 14 without further granule addition however the mainstream nitrification capacity did not appear to increase proportionately to the granule mass increase otherwise effluent nh3 n concentrations would have been lower heterotrophs were the primary contributor to mainstream granule growth as indicated by sequencing and qpcr results showing lower aob abundance in mainstream granules than sidestream granules the higher mainstream feed cod n and availability of nox n during unaerated feeding likely allowed growth of heterotrophs on top of nitrifiers in the granule outer aerobic layer which would reduce the granule specific nitrification rate and total nitrification capacity however the effluent nh3 n concentration decreased and completeness of nitrification increased with time and daily addition of sidestream granules indicating increasing rather than decreasing nitrification capacity therefore outer heterotrophic growth on bioaugmented granules was not high enough to critically impact nitrification bioaugmentation effectiveness another possibility is that sidestream granules or fragments thereof largely maintained their biofilm composition with nitrifiers on the outer layer and that newly grown granules were formed primarily from flocs and had a different microbial community composition and spatial distribution with higher heterotrophic abundance particularly in the outer aerobic layer nh3 n oxidation in sidestream granules was primarily limited to nitritation with little no2 n oxidation to no3 n which facilitated short cut nitrogen removal sidestream treatment conditions favoring aob and hence out competition of nob for space on the outer aerobic layer of sidestream granules may have included 1 free ammonia inhibition of nob due to elevated ph and nh3 n concentrations from slug feeding of centrate and 2 high nh3 n and alkalinity concentrations to maintain maximum aob growth rates tchobanoglous et al 2014 the fact that no2 n was the predominant nox n species in mainstream effluent at the start of bioaugmentation further showed that sidestream granules had little nob activity however nitrification in mainstream treatment shifted towards full nitrification and hence to the accumulation of no3 n over time reduced free ammonia inhibition and greater aerobic surface area from new granule growth and smaller granules in mainstream treatment likely allowed greater nob activity and a transition to complete nitrification 4 3 ebpr and denitrification performance the sidestream reactor showed high levels of concurrent ebpr and snd figs s3 and s4 implicating enrichment of denitrifying paos dpaos the acetate rbcod feed and anaerobic contact time was favorable for pao growth the stored carbon during anaerobic uptake was available for no3 no2 reduction in the inner anoxic core of the granules during aeration as seen by other investigators figdore et al 2017 in contrast the mainstream reactor performance was characterized by modest ebpr and little snd main differences between the sidestream and mainstream reactors that could contribute to these differences in ebpr and snd are 1 different feed characteristics 2 the presence of denitrifying flocculent sludge and no3 n during the anaerobic feeding period and 3 a smaller granule size in the mainstream reactor leading to a smaller or no available anoxic volume fraction the rbcod content of the sidestream feed was 100 whereas it was only 40 for the mainstream rapid denitrification during feeding fig s6 suggests ohos possibly in the flocculent sludge instead of paos in the granules were consuming influent rbcod to remove the no3 n remaining from the prior cycle based on a cod n ratio of 6 1 for no3 n reduction all the feed rbcod of 78 mg l could have been consumed for denitrification thus only slowly biodegradable cod may have been available for conversion to acetate or propionate for uptake by the paos during the anaerobic feeding thus it is likely that substrate limitation during the anaerobic feeding limited carbon storage and thus ebpr and subsequently snd a similar do concentration was used in the mainstream as for the sidestream reactor and the granule size was smaller to suggest that do could penetrate further in the granule to also limit the anoxic volume available for snd although mainstream growth conditions resulted in lower ebpr and snd activity compared to sidestream treatment it has to be emphasized that nitrification capacity was sustained and granules largely remained intact during bioaugmentation suggesting that the granule structure formed during dpao activity could persist in mainstream treatment and serve as a carrier for nitrifying organisms even if mainstream conditions are not favorable for dpao activity however a greater amount of granule mediated ebpr and snd would be preferred to enhance nutrient removal performance a post anoxic period after effluent withdrawal as used for the centrate granule growth reactor may have decreased anoxic heterotrophic growth after feeding to allow better substrate uptake by dpaos and possibly improved snd during the aerobic period 4 4 sidestream cod addition for growth of ndn pao granules centrate has only about 50 of the alkalinity needed for full nitrification the need for chemical addition for full nitrification during sidestream treatment for bioaugmentation is the same for this granular activated sludge process as shown by bowden et al 2015 for the growth of flocculent nitrifying biomass for sidestream bioaugmentation either carbon must be added to support denitrification which provides alkalinity or alkalinity must be added directly in chemical form such as naoh for the ndn pao granules in this study alkalinity was provided during snd in the aerated phase the results showed that the aerobic snd operation with granules resulted in minimal carbon requirements for alkalinity production the average cod tkn ratio for biological nitrogen removal was only 3 3 which is about 70 of the cod n ratio required for no3 n reduction this suggest that most of the n removal was by short cut nitrogen removal via no2 n reduction which requires 67 of the cod for no3 n reduction as shown in tchobanoglous et al 2014 instead of purchasing an external cod source such as acetic acid alternative cod sources may be available onsite by primary sludge fermentation or from an industrial waste source such as food and beverage processing applications primary sludge fermentation has been used to enhance mainstream ebpr by the addition of vfa rich fermentate to the anaerobic contact step this approach for growth of sidestream ndn pao granules depends on site specific conditions but appears feasible assuming typical values of raw wastewater vss concentration of 200 mg l 60 vss removal in primary treatment 20 conversion of vss in fermentation and the return centrate nh3 n at 25 of the tkn fed to the secondary system tchobanoglous et al 2014 the calculated cod produced to sidestream n is 4 1 which is greater than the 3 3 ratio for cod consumption per sidestream n removed in this study 4 5 microbial characterization of the different reactor mixed liquors the beta diversity distance results fig 4 showed that the microbial community composition of the sidestream bioaugmenting granules changed and became more similar to the mainstream floc microbial composition the change to dominance of flavobacterium and similar abundances of several other heterotrophic taxa in mainstream granules and flocs fig 3 account for the change in the granular and floc compositions significant characteristics of sidestream and mainstream microbial populations are discussed below 4 5 1 nitrifying organisms aob gene copies and relative abundance in flocs were much lower than in granules additionally near complete loss of nitrification occurred after removing granules from the mainstream reactor together these results suggest that granules were the dominant contributor to nitrification in mainstream treatment and that granule nitrifiers were maintained during operation of the bioaugmented process the contribution of ammonia oxidizing archaea was not likely since the reactor conditions were not favorable as investigated in previous research winkler et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 a notable aspect of the microbial composition of all sludge samples was finding that nitrotoga was the only nob instead of the more commonly reported nitrospira or nitrobacter nitrotoga has been identified since 2007 alawi et al 2007 and has been detected at significant abundance compared to other nob in full scale wrrfs at process temperatures less than 16 c lucker et al 2015 its substrate affinity coefficient was higher than nitrospira and within the range of nitrobacter nowka et al 2015 therefore transient no2 n concentrations near 10 mg l were favorable for maintaining a small nitrotoga population in the sidestream biomass which led to their growth in the 12 c bioaugmented mainstream reactor 4 5 2 sidestream biomass because acetate was the main carbon source accumulibacter paos and possibly competibacter gaos were expected to be the major genera in sidestream granules but other heterotrophs were present at similar or higher abundance haliscomenobacter associated organisms were the most abundant one species within haliscomenobacter is h hydrossis which has a filaments structure and produces extracellular saccharolytic enzymes which may support a growth niche on cellular decay products kragelund et al 2008 such substrate could have been provided from slowly biodegradable centrate cod and or endogenous decay within granules however microscopic observations did not support the possible presence of the filamentous morphology of h hydrossis sulfate reducing bacteria srb associated with the family desulfobulbaceae were second most abundant in sidestream granules the presence of 13 mg so4 s l from influent mgso4 addition could have provided an electron acceptor for desulfobulbaceae which were likely active in anaerobic digestion and present in the digester centrate sulfur cycle associated ebpr with no3 n as electron acceptor has been demonstrated in an anaerobic anoxic reactor where known paos were not detected and srb comprised 21 of the microbial community based on 16s rrna gene sequencing wu et al 2014 ebpr activity in the reactor in absence of known paos and in the presence of a significant srb population raised the possibility that srb may possess the pao phenotype therefore desulfobulbaceae related bacteria in sidestream granules may have been mediating denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr absence of sulfur oxidizing partners such as thiobacillus in sidestream granules further points to this possibility the high abundance of desulfobulbaceae related bacteria was determined after the sidestream reactor was shut down so it was not possible to evaluate denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr activity and therefore its potential relevance in sidestream ndn pao granule growth remains to be investigated 4 5 3 mainstream biomass comparison of the physiological capabilities for strains of flavobacterium and the mainstream reactor operating conditions support the observed dominance of organisms associating with this genus in the mainstream flocs and granules these capabilities include a nitrate reduction b degradation of glucose gelatin casein and starch c ability to grow anaerobically by fermentation of carbohydrates or yeast extract bernardet and bowman 2006 all of these substrates were present in the mainstream feed table s1 additionally genome sequencing of flavobacterium johnsoniae mcbride et al 2009 revealed genes encoding for glycogen synthase uniprotkb accession no a5fg96 and dechloromonas possesses similar carbon storage capability indicating that additional bacteria might have expressed the pao kong et al 2007 or gao ahn et al 2007 phenotypes 5 conclusions sidestream nitrifying denitrifying phosphorus accumulating granules can be grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate with a high nitrogen loading rate to promote short cut nitrogen removal and granule wasting to support bioaugmentation bioaugmentation with granular sludge as opposed to flocs has a much greater impact on nitrification intensification and performance due to the ability to decouple the granular sludge srt from the lower flocculent sludge srt bioaugmentation with granules can achieve low effluent nh3 n concentrations in a system with low temperature and non nitrifying flocculent sludge srt after bioaugmentation granules remained primarily responsible for mainstream nitrification and little loss of ammonia oxidizing bacteria from the bioaugmenting granules in mainstream treatment occurred residual nox n present during feeding in the mainstream system resulted in a decrease in pao activity from the sidestream seed sludge and limited the dpao driven denitrification capacity acknowledgements funding this work was supported by the king county seattle

19681,sidestream granular activated sludge grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate was bioaugmented and selectively retained to enable high nitrification performance of a 2 5 day aerobic srt non nitrifying flocculent activated sludge system at 12 c sidestream grown granules performed enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and short cut nitrogen removal via nitrite after bioaugmentation ebpr continued in the mainstream but ammonia oxidation was eventually to nitrate low effluent nh3 n concentrations from 0 6 to 1 7 mg l were achieved with nitrification solely by granules thus enabling denitrification and nitrogen removal molecular microbial analyses of flocs and granules also suggested that nitrifying organisms persisted on granules with minimal nitrifier loss to flocs mainstream granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation testing was 1 7 times the amount of sidestream granules added indicating mainstream granular growth nitrite and nitrate availability during the unaerated feeding period encouraged significant growth of ordinary heterotrophs in mainstream granules but nevertheless mainstream nitrification capacity was sustained graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge nitrification centrate reject water enhanced biological phosphorus removal 1 introduction increased nitrification capacity in water resource recovery facilities wrrfs with activated sludge processes may be needed to treat higher influent loads meet lower effluent ammonia nitrogen nh3 n concentration limits and or for conversion to nitrogen removal bioaugmentation with nitrifying biomass produced in sidestream treatment of anaerobic digestion dewatering reject water increases the nitrifier concentration in flocculent activated sludge and intensifies the nitrification capacity without increasing the reactor volume kos 1998 the reject water referred to as centrate when centrifugation is used for dewatering is normally returned to mainstream treatment with nh3 n concentrations in the range of 700 1800 mg l which can be 15 30 of the total nitrogen load to the mainstream secondary treatment process tchobanoglous et al 2014 thus sidestream centrate treatment processes can be used to reduce the return nh3 n load and also add nitrifying bacteria to the mainstream process for nitrification bioaugmentation nitrifier bioaugmentation with flocculent sludge from sidestream treatment has been widely demonstrated in full scale wrrfs using various process configurations bowden et al 2015 parker and wanner 2007 at a full scale facility with aerobic and total solids retention times srts near 5 and 7 days respectively bioaugmentation improved average effluent nh3 n concentration from 15 to 7 mg l at temperatures of 10 16 c krhutková et al 2006 the improvement in mainstream nitrification performance by sidestream bioaugmentation was due to the increase in the mainstream nitrifying bacteria concentration but the performance was still limited by the overall srt of the mainstream flocculent sludge for systems with low or non nitrifying srts and or low temperatures the increase in nitrification capacity from sidestream bioaugmentation may not be sufficient to reduce effluent nh3 n concentrations to meet discharge requirements a more optimal solution to increase the nitrification capacity from sidestream bioaugmentation would be to uncouple the srt of the bioaugmented population from the floc srt which could be accomplished by growing sidestream nitrifiers in a biofilm that can be selectively retained in the mainstream system granular activated sludge is a good candidate for such bioaugmentation because granular biofilms are grown without a carrier material allowing them to be more easily pumped from sidestream to mainstream treatment and within the mainstream process aerobic granules are a type of biofilm structure in which bacteria are grown in dense fast settling biomass typically 1 2 mm in diameter figdore et al 2017 the srt of granular sludge bioaugmented can be decoupled from the lower srt of the flocculent sludge by selective retention due to their larger size and faster settling velocity granule floc separation using hydrocyclones shi et al 2016 and screens liu et al 2014 has been demonstrated longer retention and accumulation of granular biomass is expected to result in a higher volumetric nitrification capacity without building additional tank volume to a mainstream activated sludge system growth of aerobic granules performing nitrification denitrification ndn with phosphorus accumulating organisms paos mediating enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and denitrification has been demonstrated in lab sequencing batch reactors sbrs treating synthetic wastewater bassin et al 2012 and in full scale sbrs at wrrfs treating domestic wastewater pronk et al 2015a a typical operating sequence for these reactors is anaerobic feeding aeration with simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd and a short settling time of less than 10 min neither the growth of ndn pao granules in sidestream treatment of anaerobic digestion centrate from wrrfs nor the ability to use them for sustained nitrification bioaugmentation in a low srt flocculent activated sludge system has been reported the ability to grow ndn pao granules under potential adverse impacts of centrate solids and residual dewatering polymer is of interest for developing this novel bioaugmentation scheme centrate contains a relatively high amount of refractory colloidal material which may interfere with granule growth by sorbing to the granule surface and thus interfering with mass transfer and biological growth in granules flocculating polymers such as those used for dewatering may sorb to the granule surface and cause substrate diffusion limitations and result in undesirable granule morphology and poor settleability val del río et al 2012 the objective of this study was to evaluate the bioaugmentation process using ndn pao granules from sidestream centrate treatment with the goal of determining if the added granules and nitrification are sustained after bioaugmentation in a low temperature mainstream flocculent activated sludge system with selective granule retention and a flocculent sludge srt below the theoretical minimum nitrification srt important process information included in this evaluation are changes in granule physical characteristics and nitrification capacity between the sidestream and mainstream reactors and microbial community composition of the sidestream granules mainstream granules and mainstream flocculent sludge the mainstream system was an sbr operated at 12 c with conditions to support ebpr and snd by the bioaugmented ndn pao granules 2 material and methods 2 1 sidestream reactor a 2 0 l sidestream ndn pao granular sludge sbr was fed centrate which provided nh3 n for the growth of nitrifiers and an external carbon source which was necessary for the growth of paos and subsequent alkalinity production with denitrification the sbr had a height to diameter h d ratio of 4 9 and was operated at 18 c with 50 decant fill volume exchange per cycle the high volume exchange ratio was possible due to the low sludge volume index svi and rapid thickening of granules the centrate reactor total nitrogen tn volumetric loading rate goal was between 0 50 and 0 60 g tn l d which was based on estimated oxygen mass transfer limitations with fine bubble aeration in full scale reactors bowden et al 2015 after start up the amount of centrate and tn was gradually increased to this target loading external cod concentration was also manually increased in feed stream batches based on reactor performance to provide at least 80 tn removal while minimizing the external cod dose at the target volumetric nh3 n loading of about 0 50 g nh3 n l d the amount of centrate feed needed per cycle was only about 10 of the reactor volume because of the high centrate nh3 n concentration thus the other portion of the fill volume was provided by dilution water to represent dilution of mesophilic digestion centrate with secondary effluent in full scale application which would also reduce the sidestream reactor temperature wett et al 2011 have suggested that a lower temperature difference between sidestream and mainstream reactors would limit a temperature shock to nitrifying organisms which may improve bioaugmentation efficacy centrate and external cod streams were simultaneously added to the reactor in equal volumes using deionized water external cod sources were sodium acetate and sodium propionate with acetate and propionate contributing 70 and 30 respectively to total external cod additional details on influent composition are in the supplementary information si section s1 1 6 hr cycles consisted of the following steps 3 min anaerobic feeding 42 min anaerobic reaction 270 min aeration 1 17 min settling 2 min pumped effluent discharge 11 83 min idle and a 30 min post anoxic period the settling time resulted in removing particles with less than 10 1 m hr settling velocity in the discharged supernatant the post anoxic period with the remaining 1 0 l reactor liquid volume was used to minimize the nox n concentration prior to the subsequent feed period magnetic stirring at 200 rpm occurred during feeding aeration and the post anoxic period intermittent n2 sparging at 600 cm3 min for 3 s at 20 s intervals was applied during anaerobic and post anoxic periods for additional mixing a dissolved oxygen do controller eutech alphado2000w and galvanic probe atlas scientific were used to control do between 1 8 and 2 2 mg l by on off aeration at 1500 cm3 min corresponding to a superficial gas velocity of 0 5 cm s all gasses were sparged from an aeration stone at the reactor bottom after preliminary granule formation on synthetic wastewater simulating centrate treatment see section s1 1 for media composition the influent feed and nitrogen source was changed to mesophilic anaerobic digestion centrate from three of seattle king county municipal wrrfs processing waste primary and secondary sludge secondary treatment processes at these facilities are described in section s1 1 a high charge cationic polyacrylamide polymer polydyne we 973 is used for dewatering at the wrrfs raw centrate was settled for 10 min and the supernatant was screened with a 53 μm sieve the purpose of pretreatment was 1 to represent effluent from centrate equalization tanks at full scale wrrfs and 2 to ensure that granule growth in centrate treatment was from microbial self aggregation and not biofilm growth on large particles in the raw centrate pretreated centrate was stored at 4 c and replaced biweekly during the 140 d centrate treatment period pretreated centrate characteristics are shown in table 1 2 2 mainstream reactor the 2 0 l mainstream sbr with h d ratio of 1 8 was operated at 12 c and a 2 5 d flocculent sludge aerobic srt to suppress nitrification the total srt was 4 0 d including the deoxygenation and anoxic anaerobic time the sbr cycle time was 4 h consisting of 10 min deoxygenation with n2 gas sparging 10 min anaerobic feeding 40 min anaerobic reaction 150 min aerobic reaction 24 min settling 5 min effluent discharge and 1 min idle 1 0 l of complex synthetic wastewater table s1 was fed per cycle containing total cod readily biodegradable cod rbcod nh3 n tn and po4 p concentrations of 210 78 26 5 32 and 32 mg l respectively the influent cod and tn concentrations were set to represent municipal wastewater the influent po4 p concentration was higher than typical municipal wastewaters because of using mono and dibasic phosphate for ph buffering in the synthetic wastewater in view of the fact that for most cases with municipal wastewater treatment ebpr and pao growth are carbon limited the use of a higher po4 p concentration than a typical municipal wastewater concentration of 5 10 mg l would not be expected to affect the p removal or ndn pao granular sludge growth tchobanoglous et al 2014 though the feeding and mixed reactor period was intended to be anaerobic an initial anoxic period occurred due to residual nox n after decanting because of limited snd during the aeration period mixing during deoxygenation feeding and reaction periods was achieved by continuous sparging of n2 at 700 cm3 min and co2 at 5 cm3 min do concentration during the aerobic period was controlled between 1 8 and 2 2 mg l by on off aeration at 1000 cm3 min using equipment specified in section 2 1 gasses were sparged from an aeration stone at the bottom perimeter wall 2 2 1 pre bioaugmentation period prior to sidestream ndn pao granule bioaugmentation the mainstream reactor was operated for 3 days with only flocculent activated sludge to verify lack of nitrification the initial activated sludge was from an earlier experiment and were thus acclimated to the influent synthetic wastewater under anoxic feeding 2 2 2 bioaugmentation period the bioaugmentation period consisted of two phases a 15 d phase with an initial slug addition of the sidestream nitrifying granules followed by a 25 d phase with continuous daily addition of granules beginning on day 15 flocs were defined as particles smaller than 425 μm and their srt was controlled by wasting solids passing a 425 μm sieve the granular solids retained on the sieve were returned to the reactor no intentional wasting of granules was done as the purpose of the study was to determine the ability to sustain granules in the system the initial slug seeding of sidestream granules was added with an estimated nh3 n oxidation capacity sufficient to nitrify the daily amount of nh3 n fed to the mainstream reactor after accounting for assimilatory nh3 n removal the estimate assumed the same specific nh3 n oxidation rate measured in the granular sludge reactor treating centrate with excess nh3 n and similar do concentration and correcting for the lower mainstream temperature using a temperature activity coefficient of 1 072 tchobanoglous et al 2014 after the slug bioaugmentation phase a small dose of granules was added daily during the continuous bioaugmentation phase granule addition was based on the observed sidestream granule yield for treating 25 of the mainstream nitrogen load as centrate nitrogen which is a typical sidestream nitrogen return load to full scale wrrfs section s1 2 provides more details on granule addition in this phase 2 2 3 post bioaugmentation period at the end of the bioaugmentation period granules were removed by sieving the entire reactor contents operation continued with flocculent activated sludge to evaluate the contribution of the flocculent sludge fraction to nitrification and nitrogen removal in the bioaugmented process mlss was then wasted in a conventional manner for srt control without sieving 2 3 ammonia oxidation kinetics granular sludge maximum specific nh3 n oxidation activity was measured at 20 22 c with excess nh3 n and alkalinity and do concentration greater than 7 mg l activities were normalized to 20 c as above the apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration for sidestream granules was measured in a similar test until nh3 n removal was complete data were fitted to a fourth degree polynomial regression with r2 0 999 the apparent half saturation concentration was calculated from the first derivative of the regression equation additional details for these tests are in section s1

sidestream granules and mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation were measured by qpcr using amoa 1f amoa 2r rotthauwe et al 1997 and ntg200f ntg840r alawi et al 2007 primers respectively aob in mainstream flocs were also measured at different points of bioaugmentation results were normalized to template dna mass additional details and pcr conditions are in section s1 6 3 results 3 1 sidestream centrate treatment growth of ndn pao granules was achieved in the centrate treatment reactor with consistent production of excess granules to support bioaugmentation the average net influent concentrations from the centrate dilution water feed are shown table 2 along with average treatment performance for operating days 60 140 daily performance data for this period are shown in fig s1 the 40 d bioaugmentation period corresponded to sidestream centrate treatment days 86 126 effluent tn removal averaged 88 at a loading rate of 0 54 g tn l d nitrogen removal occurred primarily via nitritation denitritation in the aerobic period as indicated by the high effluent no2 n concentration average feed external cod tn removed ratio and lack of granule nitrite oxidation activity in batch tests see section s1 4 for methods the average feed external cod tn removed ratio was 3 3 including values as low as 3 0 during optimal performance periods in comparison the cod n requirement for denitrification of no3 n is approximately 5 0 tchobanoglous et al 2014 due to its higher oxidation state occasional effluent scod measurements at biweekly intervals were within 20 of the diluted influent centrate scod concentration which suggests that centrate cod was primarily non biodegradable and not a significant contributor to denitrification granule nitrite oxidation activity was nearly zero in batch tests fig s2 anaerobic po4 p release averaged 0 58 mol p mol c indicating that granules were enriched with paos oehmen et al 2005 cycle profiles figs s3 and s4 showed high degrees of snd and ebpr the average diameter of sidestream granules fig 1 a was 1 3 mm 0 6 mm standard deviation according to the granular definition in this study of solids retained on a 425 μm sieve manual wasting of mlss accounted for 57 of the average daily solids production about 95 of the reactor mlss mass and 15 of effluent tss could be retained on a 425 μm sieve the maximum specific nh3 n oxidation activity of sidestream granules was 10 0 mg n g vss hr and their apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration was 2 3 mg l fig s5 3 2 mainstream treatment mainstream effluent inorganic nitrogen species concentrations were measured prior to bioaugmentation during bioaugmentation and after granule removal fig 2 nh3 n removal beyond assimilation for cell synthesis was minimal before bioaugmentation and nitrification was immediately intensified after the initial charge of granules effluent ph and alkalinity during bioaugmentation were at non inhibitory levels for nitrification and averaged 7 6 and 330 mg l as caco3 respectively effluent nh3 n concentrations between 0 6 and 1 7 mg l were sustained during the continuous bioaugmentation period with lower values in the last 15 days the rate of nh3 n removal decreased at the end of the aeration period as nh3 n concentration approached 2 mg l which was consistent with the apparent half saturation concentration of sidestream granules section 3 1 effluent nh3 n rapidly increased to pre bioaugmentation concentrations when the reactor granules were removed fig 2 the dominant nh3 n oxidation product shifted from no2 n to no3 n over time the effluent nox n concentration increased from 8 7 to 14 2 mg l during bioaugmentation and most of the nox n removal occurred during the feed react period a cycle profile of inorganic nitrogen species on the final day of bioaugmentation fig s6 indicated rapid and nearly complete denitrification by the end of influent feeding the slightly lower effluent tin concentration during the first 20 days of bioaugmentation fig 2 suggests that some snd occurred until the no2 n to no3 n conversion efficiency increased the bioaugmented granules continued ebpr in mainstream treatment the average po4 p concentrations standard deviations were 43 1 2 6 mg l at the end of the anaerobic react time and decreased to 27 5 1 1 mg l in the aeration period accounting for estimated denitrification cod demand the observed po4 p release was 0 19 mol p mol c as detailed in section s2 1 this indicates that some ebpr activity was sustained but it was much lower than that of sidestream granules po4 p removal averaged 4 7 mg l but the extent of anaerobic p release and p removal decreased over the bioaugmentation period fig s7 as the effluent no3 n concentration increased toward the end of the bioaugmentation period the 14 mg l of no3 n remaining from the previous cycle would require 70 mg l of influent cod for denitrification at a cod n ratio of 5 which is about equal to the influent feed rbcod a mixture of flocs and granules were maintained in the mainstream reactor fig 1b d and fig s8 and the sieving protocol for selective wasting of flocculent sludge during bioaugmentation provided good separation of flocs and granules fig s9 mainstream reactor settled sludge bed was stratified with granules and flocs located at the bottom and top respectively fig s10 flocculent sludge mlss and effluent tss concentrations during bioaugmentation averaged 900 and 8 mg l respectively fig s11 the granular sludge mlss concentration increased from an initial concentration of 3400 mg l to 5800 mg l at the end of the bioaugmentation period thus the fraction of granular sludge increased from about 0 79 to 0 87 the average mainstream granule size decreased from 1 3 mm to 0 8 mm 0 2 mm standard deviation at the end of the bioaugmentation test the particle size distribution was also different from the sidestream reactor granules fig s12 granule like particles of less than 425 μm were observed at the end of bioaugmentation fig 1d which were not present at the start of bioaugmentation fig 1b the total granule mass added to the mainstream was 6 8 g tss with 5 9 g added in the initial slug seeding and 0 9 g added during the continuous bioaugmentation phase the mainstream reactor granule mass at the end of bioaugmentation was 11 6 g tss indicating granule growth in the mainstream system at an average rate of 0 192 g day if this mass was wasted daily the granular sludge srt would be about 35 days 3 3 molecular analysis of microbial populations a decreasing trend in normalized amoa gene copy concentration was observed for the sidestream granules mainstream granules and mainstream flocs normalized amoa gene copy concentration in sidestream granules was of 2 3 104 0 3 104 copies ng template dna values were successively about one order of magnitude lower in mainstream granules 3 1 103 0 3 103 copies ng and flocs at the end of bioaugmentation flocculent sludge amoa copies increased marginally during bioaugmentation from 2 5 102 0 2 102 copies ng to 4 1 102 0 2 102 copies ng normalized nitrotoga gene copy concentrations in sidestream and mainstream granules had an opposite trend than those of aob nitrotoga gene copy concentration in sidestream granules was only 6 9 102 1 1 102 copies ng and hence 1 5 orders of magnitude less than aob nitrotoga increased to 6 9 103 0 5 103 copies ng in mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation which was slightly greater than aob taxonomy assignments for otus present at greater than 2 relative abundance in any sample are summarized in fig 3 for all sludge types taxa are presented in order of descending abundance in sidestream granules the sole nitrifying aob and nob were associated with nitrosomonas and nitrotoga respectively in sidestream granules average abundance of nitrotoga was 0 5 and much lower than that of nitrosomonas 3 2 the ratio of nitrotoga to nitrosomonas abundance was low in sidestream granules 0 16 and higher in mainstream granules 2 0 and flocs 6 5 which agrees with mainstream reactor performance where nitrification proceeded primarily to no2 n in the sidestream reactor section 3 1 and to no3 n in the mainstream reactor by the end of bioaugmentation testing fig 2 qpcr measurements and the sequencing based relative abundances of aob and nob showed similar trends between sidestream granules and mainstream granules at the end of bioaugmentation fig 3 shows that distinct heterotrophic populations were associated with each sample sidestream granules were dominated by haliscomenobacter desulfobulbaceae ca accumulibacter hereafter accumulibacter cytophaga and ca competibacter hereafter competibacter at similar abundances between 11 and 15 flavobacterium was the dominant genera in bioaugmented mainstream sludge and comprised 20 and 32 of mainstream granules and flocs respectively flavobacterium was also present at 10 abundance in mainstream flocs before bioaugmentation and 4 abundance in sidestream granules the abundances of all leading sidestream granule taxa were lower in mainstream granules and even lower in final mainstream flocs except for accumulibacter which had similar abundance near 4 in both mainstream granules and flocs other taxa including dechloromonas sphaerotilus halaingium and cryseobacterium were present at relatively similar abundances between about 2 and 5 in mainstream granules and flocs the most significant changes in taxa abundance for flocs before and after bioaugmentation were a decrease in mangroviflexus from 13 2 to 0 1 and an increase in flavobacterium from 10 to 32 as noted above beta diversity within and between granule floc types were compared for sidestream granules and mainstream granules and flocs at the end of bioaugmentation average beta diversity distances between granule floc types are shown in fig 4 distances for comparisons between granule floc types were significantly higher than control comparisons within granule floc types and weighted unifrac distances were consistently less than bray curtis distances for all comparisons beta diversity distances between sidestream and mainstream granules were greater than distances between mainstream granules and flocs all differences in beta diversity distances for comparisons against controls comparisons between granule floc types using the same beta diversity metric and comparisons between different beta diversity metrics for the same granule floc type were statistically significant at an alpha level of 0 01 4 discussion 4 1 granule growth in mainstream treatment the increase in mainstream granule mass during bioaugmentation indicates that granules added were sustained and that granular growth occurred selection pressures claimed for growth of ndn pao granules van loosdrecht et al 2005 are 1 a short settling time to favor capture of fast settling biomass granules 2 a high food mass f m ratio of readily biodegradable substrate in an anaerobic contact period to drive diffusion into the granular biofilm and intracellular substrate storage and 3 sufficient shear to form smooth and compact granular biofilms with little outgrowth similar selection pressures are used for growth of granules dominated by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos but with anoxic or aerobic feeding and higher aeration intensity required to provide sufficient oxygen and shear to form granular biofilms with the faster growing ohos considering these granular sludge selective pressures aspects of mainstream reactor operation included elements favorable for new granule growth in lieu of a short settling time selection granular particles was by sieving which has been previously shown to be effective for granule selection in absence of settling pressure liu et al 2014 the short 10 min unaerated feed period in this study provided high f m feeding conditions to encourage substrate uptake by ohos and storage by paos to some extent substrate uptake by ohos would be favored during feeding with residual nox n available from the preceding cycle while uptake by paos or possibly glycogen accumulating organisms gaos would occur for substrate remaining in the anaerobic time after nox n was removed the total gas sparging rate with n2 and air on was slightly higher than in the sidestream reactor 1700 versus 1500 cm3 min thus mainstream gas sparging may have provided sufficient shear to promote granule biofilm formation and discourage unwanted outgrowth the granules added were sustained in mainstream treatment but with a lower average size decreasing by 38 from 1 3 to 0 8 mm the smaller size is most likely related to a longer liquid solids settling time and a lower amount of rbcod available for uptake by paos under anaerobic conditions the settling time for the added granules was increased from 1 2 min in the sidestream reactor to 24 min in the mainstream reactor adav et al 2009 reported an average granule size of 2 2 mm with 5 min settling but only 1 1 mm with 10 min settling the smaller size granules with slower settling times can be maintained with a longer settling period the smaller granule size after settling was still large enough to be retained in the system by sieving the waste sludge the unaerated feeding and contact time was similar for the sidestream and mainstream reactors but much less cod was available for pao granule uptake in the mainstream during the unaerated feed and contact for the mainstream the feed cod concentration was 210 mg l compared to 648 mg l to the sidestream and the amount available for paos in granules was lowered due to much more nox n was available for rbcod uptake by flocs during the unaerated feeding the lower rbcod likely reduced the substrate diffusion gradient and depth resulting in starvation in the inner core of the larger granules figdore et al 2017 and fragmentation pronk et al 2015b verawaty et al 2013 therefore granule growth could have occurred on smaller granular particles after fragmentation of larger granules granulation from flocs is also a possibility due to the operating conditions discussed above differences in the microbial composition between the sidestream and mainstream granules figs 3 and 4 supports the contention of new granule growth with primarily ohos as affected by the operating conditions in the mainstream reactor 4 2 nitrification performance mainstream effluent nh3 n concentration during the final 20 days of bioaugmentation averaged 1 1 mg l which is significantly lower than that achieved in full scale systems with flocculent sludge bioaugmentation krhutková et al 2006 parker and wanner 2007 salem et al 2004 and longer srts a cycle profile on the final day of bioaugmentation fig s6 showed that nitrification occurred throughout the aerobic period with nitrification rate slowing as the granule apparent nh3 n half saturation concentration was approached at the end of the cycle methods to provide lower effluent nh3 n concentration include aeration at higher do concentration and using a longer aeration time it is also possible that with continued operation and addition of sidestream granules more nitrifying biomass could accumulate in mainstream treatment allowing lower effluent nh3 n concentrations although granular mass increased granule size decreased in mainstream treatment a smaller granule allows a higher aerobic surface area for nitrifier growth and thus a greater nitrification rate if the granules have the same fraction of nitrifiers for a given bulk liquid do concentration for a given bulk liquid do concentration the smaller granule will also result in a decreased anoxic volume fraction to reduce the denitrification capacity of internal paos winkler et al 2015 increased nh3 n oxidation capacity with mainstream granule growth was seen after the initial slug bioaugmentation and prior to continuous bioaugmentation with effluent nh3 n concentrations decreasing from 3 3 to 2 4 mg l over days 1 14 without further granule addition however the mainstream nitrification capacity did not appear to increase proportionately to the granule mass increase otherwise effluent nh3 n concentrations would have been lower heterotrophs were the primary contributor to mainstream granule growth as indicated by sequencing and qpcr results showing lower aob abundance in mainstream granules than sidestream granules the higher mainstream feed cod n and availability of nox n during unaerated feeding likely allowed growth of heterotrophs on top of nitrifiers in the granule outer aerobic layer which would reduce the granule specific nitrification rate and total nitrification capacity however the effluent nh3 n concentration decreased and completeness of nitrification increased with time and daily addition of sidestream granules indicating increasing rather than decreasing nitrification capacity therefore outer heterotrophic growth on bioaugmented granules was not high enough to critically impact nitrification bioaugmentation effectiveness another possibility is that sidestream granules or fragments thereof largely maintained their biofilm composition with nitrifiers on the outer layer and that newly grown granules were formed primarily from flocs and had a different microbial community composition and spatial distribution with higher heterotrophic abundance particularly in the outer aerobic layer nh3 n oxidation in sidestream granules was primarily limited to nitritation with little no2 n oxidation to no3 n which facilitated short cut nitrogen removal sidestream treatment conditions favoring aob and hence out competition of nob for space on the outer aerobic layer of sidestream granules may have included 1 free ammonia inhibition of nob due to elevated ph and nh3 n concentrations from slug feeding of centrate and 2 high nh3 n and alkalinity concentrations to maintain maximum aob growth rates tchobanoglous et al 2014 the fact that no2 n was the predominant nox n species in mainstream effluent at the start of bioaugmentation further showed that sidestream granules had little nob activity however nitrification in mainstream treatment shifted towards full nitrification and hence to the accumulation of no3 n over time reduced free ammonia inhibition and greater aerobic surface area from new granule growth and smaller granules in mainstream treatment likely allowed greater nob activity and a transition to complete nitrification 4 3 ebpr and denitrification performance the sidestream reactor showed high levels of concurrent ebpr and snd figs s3 and s4 implicating enrichment of denitrifying paos dpaos the acetate rbcod feed and anaerobic contact time was favorable for pao growth the stored carbon during anaerobic uptake was available for no3 no2 reduction in the inner anoxic core of the granules during aeration as seen by other investigators figdore et al 2017 in contrast the mainstream reactor performance was characterized by modest ebpr and little snd main differences between the sidestream and mainstream reactors that could contribute to these differences in ebpr and snd are 1 different feed characteristics 2 the presence of denitrifying flocculent sludge and no3 n during the anaerobic feeding period and 3 a smaller granule size in the mainstream reactor leading to a smaller or no available anoxic volume fraction the rbcod content of the sidestream feed was 100 whereas it was only 40 for the mainstream rapid denitrification during feeding fig s6 suggests ohos possibly in the flocculent sludge instead of paos in the granules were consuming influent rbcod to remove the no3 n remaining from the prior cycle based on a cod n ratio of 6 1 for no3 n reduction all the feed rbcod of 78 mg l could have been consumed for denitrification thus only slowly biodegradable cod may have been available for conversion to acetate or propionate for uptake by the paos during the anaerobic feeding thus it is likely that substrate limitation during the anaerobic feeding limited carbon storage and thus ebpr and subsequently snd a similar do concentration was used in the mainstream as for the sidestream reactor and the granule size was smaller to suggest that do could penetrate further in the granule to also limit the anoxic volume available for snd although mainstream growth conditions resulted in lower ebpr and snd activity compared to sidestream treatment it has to be emphasized that nitrification capacity was sustained and granules largely remained intact during bioaugmentation suggesting that the granule structure formed during dpao activity could persist in mainstream treatment and serve as a carrier for nitrifying organisms even if mainstream conditions are not favorable for dpao activity however a greater amount of granule mediated ebpr and snd would be preferred to enhance nutrient removal performance a post anoxic period after effluent withdrawal as used for the centrate granule growth reactor may have decreased anoxic heterotrophic growth after feeding to allow better substrate uptake by dpaos and possibly improved snd during the aerobic period 4 4 sidestream cod addition for growth of ndn pao granules centrate has only about 50 of the alkalinity needed for full nitrification the need for chemical addition for full nitrification during sidestream treatment for bioaugmentation is the same for this granular activated sludge process as shown by bowden et al 2015 for the growth of flocculent nitrifying biomass for sidestream bioaugmentation either carbon must be added to support denitrification which provides alkalinity or alkalinity must be added directly in chemical form such as naoh for the ndn pao granules in this study alkalinity was provided during snd in the aerated phase the results showed that the aerobic snd operation with granules resulted in minimal carbon requirements for alkalinity production the average cod tkn ratio for biological nitrogen removal was only 3 3 which is about 70 of the cod n ratio required for no3 n reduction this suggest that most of the n removal was by short cut nitrogen removal via no2 n reduction which requires 67 of the cod for no3 n reduction as shown in tchobanoglous et al 2014 instead of purchasing an external cod source such as acetic acid alternative cod sources may be available onsite by primary sludge fermentation or from an industrial waste source such as food and beverage processing applications primary sludge fermentation has been used to enhance mainstream ebpr by the addition of vfa rich fermentate to the anaerobic contact step this approach for growth of sidestream ndn pao granules depends on site specific conditions but appears feasible assuming typical values of raw wastewater vss concentration of 200 mg l 60 vss removal in primary treatment 20 conversion of vss in fermentation and the return centrate nh3 n at 25 of the tkn fed to the secondary system tchobanoglous et al 2014 the calculated cod produced to sidestream n is 4 1 which is greater than the 3 3 ratio for cod consumption per sidestream n removed in this study 4 5 microbial characterization of the different reactor mixed liquors the beta diversity distance results fig 4 showed that the microbial community composition of the sidestream bioaugmenting granules changed and became more similar to the mainstream floc microbial composition the change to dominance of flavobacterium and similar abundances of several other heterotrophic taxa in mainstream granules and flocs fig 3 account for the change in the granular and floc compositions significant characteristics of sidestream and mainstream microbial populations are discussed below 4 5 1 nitrifying organisms aob gene copies and relative abundance in flocs were much lower than in granules additionally near complete loss of nitrification occurred after removing granules from the mainstream reactor together these results suggest that granules were the dominant contributor to nitrification in mainstream treatment and that granule nitrifiers were maintained during operation of the bioaugmented process the contribution of ammonia oxidizing archaea was not likely since the reactor conditions were not favorable as investigated in previous research winkler et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 a notable aspect of the microbial composition of all sludge samples was finding that nitrotoga was the only nob instead of the more commonly reported nitrospira or nitrobacter nitrotoga has been identified since 2007 alawi et al 2007 and has been detected at significant abundance compared to other nob in full scale wrrfs at process temperatures less than 16 c lucker et al 2015 its substrate affinity coefficient was higher than nitrospira and within the range of nitrobacter nowka et al 2015 therefore transient no2 n concentrations near 10 mg l were favorable for maintaining a small nitrotoga population in the sidestream biomass which led to their growth in the 12 c bioaugmented mainstream reactor 4 5 2 sidestream biomass because acetate was the main carbon source accumulibacter paos and possibly competibacter gaos were expected to be the major genera in sidestream granules but other heterotrophs were present at similar or higher abundance haliscomenobacter associated organisms were the most abundant one species within haliscomenobacter is h hydrossis which has a filaments structure and produces extracellular saccharolytic enzymes which may support a growth niche on cellular decay products kragelund et al 2008 such substrate could have been provided from slowly biodegradable centrate cod and or endogenous decay within granules however microscopic observations did not support the possible presence of the filamentous morphology of h hydrossis sulfate reducing bacteria srb associated with the family desulfobulbaceae were second most abundant in sidestream granules the presence of 13 mg so4 s l from influent mgso4 addition could have provided an electron acceptor for desulfobulbaceae which were likely active in anaerobic digestion and present in the digester centrate sulfur cycle associated ebpr with no3 n as electron acceptor has been demonstrated in an anaerobic anoxic reactor where known paos were not detected and srb comprised 21 of the microbial community based on 16s rrna gene sequencing wu et al 2014 ebpr activity in the reactor in absence of known paos and in the presence of a significant srb population raised the possibility that srb may possess the pao phenotype therefore desulfobulbaceae related bacteria in sidestream granules may have been mediating denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr absence of sulfur oxidizing partners such as thiobacillus in sidestream granules further points to this possibility the high abundance of desulfobulbaceae related bacteria was determined after the sidestream reactor was shut down so it was not possible to evaluate denitrifying sulfur cycle associated ebpr activity and therefore its potential relevance in sidestream ndn pao granule growth remains to be investigated 4 5 3 mainstream biomass comparison of the physiological capabilities for strains of flavobacterium and the mainstream reactor operating conditions support the observed dominance of organisms associating with this genus in the mainstream flocs and granules these capabilities include a nitrate reduction b degradation of glucose gelatin casein and starch c ability to grow anaerobically by fermentation of carbohydrates or yeast extract bernardet and bowman 2006 all of these substrates were present in the mainstream feed table s1 additionally genome sequencing of flavobacterium johnsoniae mcbride et al 2009 revealed genes encoding for glycogen synthase uniprotkb accession no a5fg96 and dechloromonas possesses similar carbon storage capability indicating that additional bacteria might have expressed the pao kong et al 2007 or gao ahn et al 2007 phenotypes 5 conclusions sidestream nitrifying denitrifying phosphorus accumulating granules can be grown on anaerobic digester dewatering centrate with a high nitrogen loading rate to promote short cut nitrogen removal and granule wasting to support bioaugmentation bioaugmentation with granular sludge as opposed to flocs has a much greater impact on nitrification intensification and performance due to the ability to decouple the granular sludge srt from the lower flocculent sludge srt bioaugmentation with granules can achieve low effluent nh3 n concentrations in a system with low temperature and non nitrifying flocculent sludge srt after bioaugmentation granules remained primarily responsible for mainstream nitrification and little loss of ammonia oxidizing bacteria from the bioaugmenting granules in mainstream treatment occurred residual nox n present during feeding in the mainstream system resulted in a decrease in pao activity from the sidestream seed sludge and limited the dpao driven denitrification capacity acknowledgements funding this work was supported by the king county seattle

bacteria srb to produce hydrogen sulfide h2s which is toxic to methanogens lens and kuenen 2001 alternatively biological sulfate reduction bsr process can be implemented for the treatment of sulfate laden wastewaters lens and kuenen 2001 lu et al 2012 a few years ago we developed a novel sulfur cycle based bioprocess called sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani for simultaneous removal of organics and nitrogen in the treatment of saline sewage resulting from the use of seawater for toilet flushing lu et al 2012 in a recent large scale trial this novel bsr driven process demonstrated reductions in space of 30 40 and in biological sludge production of 60 70 compared with existing biological sewage treatment plants in hong kong wu et al 2016 the upflow sludge bed usb reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and their modifications are promising technologies for anaerobic anoxic processes such as methanogenesis seghezzo et al 1998 denitrification franco et al 2006 and bsr lens and kuenen 2001 due to its high loading rate and removal efficiency and low cost and energy demand however the usb technologies commonly face a critical operational issue sludge flotation campos et al 2017 this issue causes usb reactors to fail campos et al 2017 and is hindering the widespread adoption of the usb technologies and is usually due to a decrease in sludge density when gas is entrapped in the sludge de beer et al 1996 campos et al 2017 the gas entrapment can occur when substrate is overloaded franco et al 2006 cao et al 2016 oil and grease are present in large amounts jeganathan et al 2007 ph or temperature changes suddenly blaszczyk et al 1994 filamentous bacteria grow excessively li et al 2008 or reactor mixing is insufficient franco et al 2006 chen et al 2014 whereas the methanogenic usb reactor uses biogas for internal mixing the sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed srusb reactors i e a key component of the sani system in our previous studies recirculated 50 300 of the effluent because very little gas was generated wu et al 2016 hao et al 2015 however our recent studies have revealed that such hydraulic mixing negatively changed i structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps to have a high ratio of outer layer loosely bound lb eps to inner layer tightly bound tb eps as a double layer eps structure model defined in nielsen and jahn 1999 ii chemical composition of eps to have a high ratio of proteins pn to polysaccharides ps and iii sludge surface properties to have a high hydrophobicity high viscosity and low negative surface charge these alterations are in turn responsible for the low external mass transfer and high sludge flotation potential in srusb tsui et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hence it is necessary to further investigate the causes and control strategies of sludge flotation and find ways of improving external mass transfer so that the srusb reactor can stay robust and the sani system can remain stable during long term operation the present study therefore examines in depth the application of continuous gas recirculation cgr in srusb to minimize sludge flotation a method proposed in wang et al 2017 we investigated the correlation between the cgr and changes in reactor hydrodynamics in five 45 day tests with different mixing intensities to determine the optimal mixing intensity then under the optimal mixing intensity we evaluated the organics removal solid liquid separation and sludge granulation in srusb through a 150 day reactor test and examined the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of the sludge to find out how cgr ameliorates flotation in the reactor the findings of this study help resolve the long standing operational problem of sludge flotation in usb type anaerobic bioreactors 2 materials and methods x2028 2 1 reactor setup and operation a 2 4 l laboratory scale srusb reactor with a height of 85 cm and an internal diameter of 6 cm and equipped with a cgr system was operated in this study see fig s1 in supplementary information si 1 the cgr system comprised i a gas liquid solid gls separator installed at a height of 70 cm for collecting most of the rising gas bubbles and ii a peristaltic pump connected to the opening at the top of the gls separator for recirculating the gas to the bottom of the reactor the gas flow rate ranged from 0 33 to 8 35 ml min corresponding to different superficial gas velocities and mixing intensities as shown in table 1 the gas bubbles entered at the bottom of the reactor and rose up to the gls separator to continuously provide a mixing force to the sludge bed hence the intensity of the mixing force could be manipulated by adjusting the gas recirculating rate due to the low gas production of the sulfate reduction reaction 20 ml of air were pumped into the cgr system per day to supplement the gas lost the effect of the oxygen content in the supplementary air was negligible the synthetic saline sewage was produced by combining seawater tap water and stock solution and contained sulfate chemical oxygen demand cod composed of the mixture of acetate and glucose with the cod ratio of 1 1 and ammonia nitrogen at concentrations of 500 mg so4 2 mg l i e 166 mg s l 260 mg cod l and 24 mg n l respectively detailed information is provided in si 2 the sewage was fed to the reactors using a peristaltic pump at a constant flow rate of 1 2 l h corresponding to a reactor hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h the influent ph was adjusted to approximately 7 2 and its temperature was kept constant at 21 1 c the solid retention time srt was calculated as approximately 13 days initially the cgr srusb was operated for five 45 day periods with different mixing intensities table 1 from day 1 to day 225 to determine the optimum operating condition phase i hydrodynamic study in short term operation in each 45 day lab scale test denoted as t1 t5 the reactor was newly inoculated with the same mass of seeding sludge 20 g taken from the large scale srusb reactor at shatin hong kong wu et al 2016 the reactor was then operated at the corresponding mixing intensity from day 1 to day 30 for sludge acclimation because 30 days would suffice for an anaerobic sludge to adapt to a new mixing condition according to the literature jiang et al 2016 after the acclimation three sets of triplicate measurements were conducted on the 35th 40th and 45th day to evaluate the reactor performance an identical srusb with hydraulic mixing by effluent recirculation was operated in parallel as a control reactor fig s1 it should note that these two reactors were used in our previous study to investigate the influence of mixing on the sludge characteristics in short term experiments wang et al 2017 while in the present study these two reactors were emptied and re inoculated for new studies on investigating the reactor hydrodynamics and energy efficiency after the five phase i tests were completed at day 225 the cgr srusb was emptied reinoculated with the same mass of seed sludge and operated under the optimal mixing intensity at the optimal average shear rate from day 226 to day 375 to examine the long term performance and sludge granulation phase ii long term operation the parameters of cgr srusb measured and analyzed in phase i include a the hydrodynamics with respect to the mixing regime fraction of short circuiting flow and fraction of dead zone b power consumption for mixing and c reactor performance i e cod removal sulfate reduction and sulfide production the energy efficiencies of h srusb and cgr srusb were compared by calculating their power consumption for achieving a similar sludge bed expansion θ percentage of sludge bed expansion was calculated as the stabilized sludge bed height under a certain mixing intensity reactor water depth 100 the sludge bed expansion was controlled by adjusting the average shear rate υ the determination of the average shear rates in cgr srusb and h srusb is described in si 3 in addition to the short term 45 day effects measured in phase i further changes in sludge characteristics under long term cgr operation were analyzed in phase ii including changes in d solid liquid separation capacity with the sludge volume index svi and sludge flotation potential

granules via micro sensor analysis 2 2 hydrodynamics and power consumption the hydrodynamics in the cgr srusb reactor including mixing regime fraction of dead zone and fraction of short circuiting flow was investigated via tracer tests five sets of tracer tests were conducted during phase i for the five mixing intensities in order to eliminate the possible influence of the tracer on reactor performance or sludge properties the tracer tests were conducted on the last day of each of the 45 day tests the tracer test is described in si 4 the energy efficiency of reactor mixing is an important criterion for reactor design and operation the energy efficiencies of conventional hydraulic mixing and cgr mixing in srusb reactors are compared by calculating the power consumption of the liquid gas recirculation pumps at the five mixing intensities details of the calculation methods for h cgr srusbs are provided in si 5 2 3 analytical methods in this study to protect cod measurements from the effects of chloride and sulfide in the saline wastewater cod was determined by multiplying the measured value of toc shimadzu toc l by the theoretical toc cod conversion factor 1 g of toc is equivalent to 2 67 g of cod henze et al 2008 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and the sludge volume indexes after 5 min and 30 min svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and other major ions in liquid were determined by ion chromatography shimadzu corporation hic 20a super the sfp was measured through an ex situ gas flotation test originated from de beer et al 1996 and halalsheh et al 2005 as described in wang et al 2017 the size distribution of sludge particles was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer horiba la 950v2 the sludge particle growth rate used to evaluate the sludge granulation performance was determined as the change in mean sludge particle size per day over two successive sampling days wu et al 2009 sludge surface charge was measured as zeta potential with a zeta potential analyser brookhaven zetaplus sludge hydrophobicity was measured from the adherence of the sludge to a liquid hydrocarbon p xylene merck rosenberg et al 1980 viscosity was measured with a rotational viscosity meter lichen ndj 5s the eps analysis was conducted by using the methods described in li and yang 2007 and wang et al 2017 two types of eps were identified lb eps and tb eps both lb eps and tb eps were found to be composed of pn ps and humic like substances hs during phase ii different sludge samples were taken from cgr srusb at the first seeding sludge the 25th floc sludge and the 145th day granular sludge equivalent to days 226 250 and 370 of the investigation period the morphology of granular sludge was examined with an inverted microscope olympus cx41 and a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3030 fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were used to visualize the distribution of srb in cgr srusb sludge the detail is explained in si 6 sulfide concentration profiles in sludge granules were measured using a commercially available microsensor system consisting of a sulfide microsensor and a microsensor multimeter unisense aarhus denmark calibration and measurement were conducted according to the manual of the unisense microsensor multimeter unisense 2017 in order to quantify the role of cgr mixing in enhancing the long term performance of the srusb based on experimental data from long term operation phase ii a statistical analysis based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s li and yang 2007 was used to evaluate the correlations between the performance of the cgr srusb including sludge granule growth rate biomass specific organic loading rate sfp svi5 and svi5 svi30 ratio and the sludge physicochemical characteristics including lb eps tb eps lb eps tb eps ratio pn ps pn ps ratio zeta potential hydrophobicity viscosity detail information of the statistical analysis is provided in si7 3 results 3 1 effects of cgr mixing 3 1 1 hydrodynamic study the hydrodynamics in an upflow type bioreactor including mixing regime fraction of short circuiting flow and fraction of dead zone contributes importantly to the treatment efficiency and operational stability of the reactor lu et al 2012 tracer tests with retention time distribution rtd curve analysis as shown in fig 1 a were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamics in the cgr srusb reactor at the five specified mixing intensities table 1 comparing the rtd curves obtained in the cgr srusb at the five average shear rates fig 1a with the theoretical rtd curves levenspiel 1998 singh et al 2006 the results suggest that the mixing regime in the reactor changes from a plug flow at low average shear rates below 1 5 s 1 to an intermediate mixing regime at an average shear rate of approximately 2 7 s 1 and further to a more complete mixed flow regime at higher mixing intensities 4 2 7 2 s 1 this result is consistent with the phenomenon in methanogenic usb heertjes et al 1982 when gas mixing is provided the mixing regime in an usb type bioreactor tends to change from plug flow to mixed flow and the reactor mixing and influent distribution are further improved at higher gas flow rates due to the resulting stronger turbulence below the gls separator the fractions of short circuiting flow and dead zone are important in describing the hydrodynamic performance of an upflow bioreactor bolle et al 1986 the combination of a lower short circuiting flow and a smaller dead zone suggests a more efficient influent distribution and a more effective reaction volume in the reactor heertjes et al 1982 we have previously reported that intensifying mixing by increasing hydraulic recirculation can reduce the dead zone but concomitantly exacerbates the short circuiting problem lu et al 2012 for cgr srusb when the average shear rate increased from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 short circuiting and dead zone reduced from 13 1 0 8 to 1 3 0 1 and 9 5 0 3 to 0 2 0 01 respectively fig 1b however when the average shear rate increased to 7 2 s 1 in t5 the sludge bed expanded to 80 over the gls separator as a result the effluent total suspended solids tss of t5 was approximately 183 21 mg l which was much higher than the effluent tss of t1 t4 in the range of 40 80 mg l hence sludge washout occurred in t5 a satisfactory hydrodynamic performance could thus be achieved at the average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 in t4 without sludge washout 3 1 2 correlation of hydrodynamics with performance and power consumption the effects of cgr mixing on organics removal and sulfate reduction were investigated in phase i fig 2 when the mixing intensity increased from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 in t1 t5 in phase i the carbonaceous cod removal efficiency increased from 23 to 94 notably a cod removal efficiency of 90 was achieved in both t4 and t5 fig 2a concomitantly the sulfate reduction δso4 s increased from 13 mg s l t1 in t4 to 110 122 mg s l in t5 fig 2b moreover comparing the δcod δso4 s ratio fig 2b with its theoretical value of 2 g δcod g δso4 s poinapen et al 2009 reveals that the ratio was approximately 3 g δcod g δso4 s at a low average shear rate of 0 9 s 1 t1 this indicates that the sulfate reduction reaction consumed just over half of the removed cod a δcod δso4 s ratio of 1 8 2 1 was achieved at higher mixing intensities of 4 2 7 2 s 1 t4 and t5 this indicates that a higher srb activity was achieved in t4 and t5 and that most of the cod was removed through the sulfate reduction reaction in the cgr srusb power consumption is another critical concern for the design of reactor mixing the power consumptions of the cgr mixing system and conventional effluent recirculation hydraulic mixing at similar percentages of sludge bed expansion were estimated and compared in the two identical reactors i e cgr srusb and h srusb as shown in fig 3 when the sludge bed expansion was 30 cgr mixing consumed slightly more power than hydraulic mixing to achieve a sludge bed expansion 63 cgr mixing consumed considerably less power than hydraulic mixing in particular when the sludge bed was purposely adjusted to a higher expansion ratio of 73 82 with higher mixing intensities 4 2 7 2 s 1 to achieve a high cod removal efficiency over 90 cgr mixing consumed much less energy than hydraulic mixing this outcome suggests that cgr mixing is more energy efficient than hydraulic mixing and can enable the srusb reactor to perform satisfactorily this is due to the rising gas bubbles in cgr mixing offering a stronger and multidimensional turbulence than hydraulic mixing can heertjes et al 1982 as a result the short circuiting flow and dead zone can be more effectively controlled by gas mixing over 90 of organics could be removed in cgr srusb at 4 2 s 1 and 7 2 s 1 but the energy required to achieve 7 2 s 1 was approximately 2 5 times that required for 4 2 s 1 fig 3 also sludge loss with the effluent led to a significant biomass loss when the cgr srusb was operated at 7 2 s 1 therefore we propose that the average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 is the optimal mixing intensity and can achieve a high organics removal at low energy consumption in the cgr srusb 3 1 3 long term operation in order to evaluate the long term stability of cgr srusb at the optimal mixing intensity of 4 2 s 1 determined through the phase i study the reactor was restarted with new seeding sludge and continuously operated for 150 days phase ii days 226 375 as shown in fig 2a during the first 28 days of phase ii from day 226 to day 253 the start up period the cod removal efficiency increased from 28 to 98 and then stayed close to 90 in the following 122 days from day 253 to day 375 the stable operation period moreover high sulfate reduction 110 mg s l and a stable δcod δso4 s ratio 1 7 2 3 were maintained during the stable operation period the results indicate that the cgr srusb can achieve a stable and satisfactory organics removal through sulfate reduction reactions in long term operation the mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss ratio remained stable at 7 8 0 6 g mlss l 5 1 0 4 g mlvss l and 65 1 2 respectively during the stable operation period correspondingly the biomass activity of the cgr srusb reactor during stable operation was determined as the mlvss specific organic loading rate of 0 62 0 05 g cod g mlvss day fig 5g notably this specific rate is higher than those observed in the h srusb reactors of 0 3 0 4 g cod g mlvss day wu et al 2016 hao et al 2015 and in a h srusb reactor equipped with intermittent gas sparging tsui et al 2016 possible reasons for this higher biomass specific activity with cgr mixing are discussed in section 4 2 below the solid liquid separation characteristics of the sludge can affect the stability of anaerobic reactor technologies mahmoud et al 2003 svi is commonly used to indicate sludge settleability in phase ii svi30 decreased from 57 5 0 5 ml g at the reinoculated 1st day day 226 to below 25 0 3 5 ml g at the 45th day day 270 and remained stable in the range of 20 5 22 5 ml g in the remaining days of phase ii fig 4 a this svi30 is much lower than the critical value 100 ml g of an activated sludge that settled well henze et al 2008 sfp which quantifies the tendency of sludge to float is also an important parameter for assessing the solid liquid separation characteristics of the sludge in usb bioreactors de beer et al 1996 as shown in fig 4b sfp of the cgr srusb decreased from 78 5 to 15 2 during the start up period of phase ii and remained below the critical safe value of 20 halalsheh et al 2005 for the rest of the investigation period this outcome suggests that sludge flotation which is common in hydraulic mixing sulfidogenic upflow reactors can be controlled in cgr mixing reactors a similar method for sludge flotation remediation has also been verified in denitrifying upflow reactors cao et al 2016 3 2 sludge granulation in cgr srusb 3 2 1 formation of granular sludge in phase ii the mean particle size of the seeding sludge day 226 was 42 8 μm fig 5a corresponding to fine sludge flocs as shown in fig 5b thereafter larger sludge particles 306 38 μm developed within 65 days day 290 fig 5d and the sludge particle size remained constant in the range of 300 350 μm fig 5a and e until day 375 during the start up period the granules grew in size at a gradually decreasing growth rate fig 5f days 226 290 after day 290 the granules stayed approximately the same size on the other hand svi5 decreased from 130 2 ml g to below 30 ml g in the first 65 days days 226 290 and then remained stable at 20 30 ml g for the rest of phase ii fig 4a notably the stable svi5 is lower than the critical value 40 60 ml g of typical granular sludge as documented in henze et al 2008 moreover the ratio of svi5 svi30 decreased from 2 3 0 1 day 226 to 1 2 0 1 day 270 and then remained in the range of 1 1 1 3 in the rest of phase ii fig 4a the stable sludge particle size and low svi5 svi30 ratio indicate the formation of micro granules in cgr srusb schwarzenbeck et al 2005 3 2 2 characterization of granular sludge the distribution of the total bacteria denoted as eub and srb in the cgr srusb sludge was investigated using fish clsm as illustrated in fig 6 the fluorescence signals from the cells hybridized with eub338 and srb385 probes became more intense for the sludge sampled at the 1st the 25th and the 145th day of phase ii days 226 250 and 370 of investigation the results indicate that both eub and srb originally from full scale srusb were significantly enriched in the cgr srusb analyzing the fluorescing intensities of srb and eub in the fish images reveals that the percentage of srb in eub increased from 2 at the 1st day to 65 at the 145th day of phase ii srb existed in higher abundance in the cgr srusb granular sludge than in the h srusb granular sludge which was reported to be approximately 44 in hao et al 2015 moreover fig 6f shows that srb dominated in both the outer and inner layers of the granules indicating that the granules developed in cgr srusb were homogeneous in structure furthermore in order to investigate the srb activity and mass transfer inside the cgr srusb granules the sulfide concentration profile in a cgr srusb micro granule 300 μm day 370 was compared with that in a large sized 1600 μm and a medium sized 700 μm h srusb sludge granule these two h srusb granules were originally taken from the full scale srusb reactor and acclimated in the control reactor h srusb for more than 100 days before microsensor analysis as shown in fig 7 the sulfide concentration increased rapidly from 20 25 mg s l at the granules surface to 35 40 mg s l at 200 400 μm depth into the granules at the rate of 0 05 0 075 mg s l 1 μm 1 for the medium sized granules fig 7a and the rate of 0 025 0 055 mg s l 1 μm 1 for large sized granules fig 7b then the sulfide concentration remained approximately constant or even decreased at a deeper depth into the two granules in contrast the sulfide concentration in the micro granule developed in cgr srusb only increased slightly from the granule s surface to its core fig 7c this outcome suggests that the medium and large sized granules possessed a layered structure in the large granules the srb activity was high from the granule s surface to a depth of 200 400 μm but low at the location closer to the core of the granules where was probably occupied by methanogens cavities or dead cells overmeire et al 1994 guiot et al 1992 the micro granules of the cgr srusb reactor did not exhibit such a layered strucutre as the srb acitivity was high throughout the granule moreover a positive correlation between granule particle size and the sulfide concentration gradient i e δsulfide sulfide max sulfide min in a granule can be observed in fig 7 the sulfide concentration gradients were 20 10 and 5 mg s l in the 1600 700 and 300 μm granules respectively hence the homogeneous srb activity and low sulfide concentration gradient in the micro granules may suggest a low mass transfer resistance and deep sulfate and cod penetration in the cgr srusb micro granules the amounts of lb eps and tb eps and the ratio of lb eps to tb eps of the cgr srusb sludge in phase ii are shown in fig 4c the sum of lb eps and tb eps increased from 45 3 to 80 4 mg toc g mlvss in the first 65 days of phase ii and then remained stable at 70 90 mg toc g mlvss thereafter the lb eps decreased from 17 1 to 6 2 mg toc g mlvss while the tb eps increased from 28 3 to 71 2 mg toc g mlvss these changes led to a considerable decrease in the lb eps tb eps ratio from 0 6 0 13 to 0 08 0 03 in the first 65 days which nevertheless remained stable afterwards in the range of 0 06 0 1 fig 4d presents the chemical compositions of the sludge eps in the first 65 days of phase ii ps increased from 13 2 to 27 3 mg g mlvss and subsequently remained stable in the range of 27 29 mg g mlvss however pn remained constant at approximately 90 7 mg g mlvss throughout the entire phase ii thus the pn ps ratio decreased from 6 8 0 7 to 3 0 0 1 in the first 65 days of phase ii but thereafter remained stable in the range of 2 5 3 5 in the cgr srusb micro granules changes in the eps structure and chemical composition can significantly affect the sludge surface properties such as surface charge hydrophobicity and viscosity liao et al 2001 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in this study corresponding to decreases in the pn ps and lb eps tb eps ratios fig 4c and d the surface properties decreased during the granule formation period days 1 65 of phase ii but then remained stable at a more negative zeta potential 23 2 mv fig 4e a lower hydrophobicity 37 3 fig 4f and a lower sludge viscosity 0 7 0 1 mpa s fig 4g after the 65th day of phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cgr mixing on sludge granulation small and homogeneous sludge granules were developed in the cgr srusb which were unlike the large and heterogeneous granules developed in egsb reactors guiot et al 1992 the sludge granulation process is known to be highly influenced by sludge eps liu et al 2010 in which lb eps and tb eps both play important yet different roles i lb eps contributes to the attractive force among sludge cells to facilitate the formation of large granular sludge and ii tb eps plays a role in supporting the structure of biofilm granular sludge liao et al 2001 xu et al 2016 in this study micro granular sludge with a low lb eps tb eps ratio 0 06 0 1 was maintained during stable operation in phase ii notably the level of the lb eps tb eps ratio is higher than that of flocculent aerobic sludge 0 009 0 013 as reported in yu et al 2009 similar to that of granular anammox sludge 0 08 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 and lower than that of granular methanogenic sludge 0 4 liu et al 2010 the results are consistent with the findings of feng et al 2016 the strong shear stress introduced by the cgr mixing has more significant influence on the outer layer lb eps than that of the inner layer tb eps statistical analysis revealed that the spearman rank correlation coefficients r s between the growth rate of sludge granules and the level of lb eps on one hand and the level of tb eps on the other were 0 64 and 0 21 respectively p 0 05 table s2 these results suggest that lb eps has a positive effect and tb eps a weak negative effect on sludge granulation therefore cgr mixing likely affects sludge granulation through the influence of the eps structure cgr mixing mostly facilitated rapid adhesion among sludge particles in the start up period of phase ii days 226 290 when the lb eps content was high and provided attractive forces however cgr mixing limits granule size by decreasing the cell cell adhesion with low lb eps through providing a continuously shearing effect on the granule surface the changes in sludge properties fig 4e g also provide important information to understand the role of cgr mixing in forming and maintaining the micro granules through statistical analysis of the data from long term operation the positive effects of zeta potential r s 0 76 p 0 05 hydrophobicity r s 0 71 p 0 05 and viscosity r s 0 48 p 0 05 on the growth rate of sludge granules were identified table s2 these results suggest that the sludge with weakly negatively charged hydrophobic and viscous sticky surface properties favored rapid aggregation during the start up period of phase ii days 226 290 later the formation of sludge granules slowed down and eventually stopped as the sludge became strongly negatively charged hydrophilic and less viscous these findings are also consistent with the explanation in the literature i a high negative surface charge can increase the repulsive force liao et al 2001 halalsheh et al 2005 ii a low hydrophobicity can reduce the hydrophobic attraction force liao et al 2001 zita and hermansson 1997 and iii a low viscosity can weaken the bridging effect dentel et al 2000 among sludge aggregates thus reducing the rate of sludge granulation 4 2 effect of cgr mixing on improving organics removal capacity mass transfer of substrates generally involves two steps i a rapid and even distribution of the substrates from the influent pipe outlet to the vicinity of biomass liu and tay 2002 and ii a quick diffusion of the substrates from the vicinity of biomass through the outer eps layer a mass transfer resistance layer to make contact with bacterial cells inside the sludge granules nogueira et al 2015 in this study cgr mixing created favorable hydrodynamics in the srusb reactor including a mixed flow regime and minimized short circuiting flow and dead zone as described in section 3 1 1 which strongly facilitated a rapid and even distribution of the substrate in the bulk liquid the diffusion coefficient of eps is lower than that of water sheng et al 2010 the level of eps especially the outer lb eps therefore has a negative effect on the import of nutrients into and the export of metabolic products from granular sludge mu and yu 2006 from statistical analysis we identified a negative correlation r s 0 77 p 0 05 table s2 between the level of lb eps and the biomass specific organic loading rate the low level of lb eps maintained by cgr mixing is likely beneficial for reducing the thickness of the mass transfer resistance layer at the surface of granular sludge thus the diffusion of the substrate was rapid when it was penetrating the surface eps layer as the micro sensor results suggest the small granule size 300 350 μm maintained by cgr mixing allowed substrates to penetrate deep into the micro granules likewise nogueira et al 2015 suggests that effective mixing can enhance the mass transfer into the biofilm these favorable conditions can strongly facilitate substrate transport from the bulk liquid to the core of the cgr srusb micro granules resulting in the formation of granules with a homogeneous structure see figs 6f and 7c and a high biomass specific activity 0 62 0 05 g cod g mlvss day see fig 5g therefore a high organics removal capacity was maintained in the cgr srusb reactor 4 3 effect of cgr mixing on sludge flotation control wang et al 2017 demonstrated that cgr mixing can prevent sludge flotation which is confirmed in this investigation even for long term operation flotation is controlled in two ways i preventing gas accumulation inside granules and ii keeping the potential for gas to attach to the surface of granules low as reported in usb type bioreactors campos et al 2017 empty space and methanogens which produce much more gas than srb are commonly observed in the core of large sludge granules 1 mm which is the main reason for gas entrapment and the subsequent sludge flotation in contrast the small and active granules grown in the cgr srusb were dominated by low gas producing srb with neither observable empty space nor detectable methanogens in their core see figs 6f and 7c notably sulfate penetration into the core of the granules reduces opportunities for methanogen growth overmeire et al 1994 the risk of biogas accumulation inside the granules is therefore also reduced campos et al 2017 studied the mechanism of sludge flotation in methanogenic denitrification and anammox processes and suggested that sludge granules smaller than 400 μm in diameter do not float because efficient gas release can be maintained sludge flotation can also be caused by gas bubbles attaching themselves to the surface of granular sludge the potential for gas bubble attachment is highly influenced by the sludge surface properties three mechanisms help control sludge flotation in the cgr srusb i reduced hydrophobic attractive forces at the gas cell interface de beer et al 1996 ii intensified repulsive electrostatic forces yang et al 2003 and iii the fact that gas bubbles do not become trapped easily in less viscous sludge jenkins et al 2003 which is discussed in detail in wang et al 2017 in this study these correlations between the sludge surface properties and sfp were further confirmed during long term operation in phase ii by statistical analysis r s values are provided in table s2 these results demonstrate that cgr mixing kept sfp in srusb low during long term operation by maintaining a low hydrophobicity a strongly negative surface charge and a low viscosity of sludge so that the potential for gas attachment to the granule surface also stayed low 5 conclusion hydrodynamic study and long term evaluation of a novel continuous gas recirculation cgr based srusb was conducted for the first time through comparing the reactor hydrodynamics organic removal performance and energy efficiency of the cgr srusb reactor at five levels of mixing intensity from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 in five short term tests an average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 was recommended as an optimal mixing intensity for long term operation of the cgr srusb by which a satisfactory hydrodynamic condition including a mixed flow regime minimized short circuiting flow 1 3 0 1 and dead zone 0 2 0 01 and over 90 organic removal can be achieved at a relatively low energy consumption 0 0007 w which is nearly one third of the h srusb 0 002 w in a following 150 day long term operation of the cgr srusb at the optimal mixing intensity of 4 2 s 1 comparing with the traditional hydraulic mixing srusb i sludge granules

problems were well controlled through stably maintaining a low sludge flotation potential 20 and a high settleability svi5 svi30 1 3 further attempt was taken to understand the possible working mechanism of the cgr mixing on enhancing srusb performance it was found the cgr mixing limited further sludge granulation after the granules grown to 300 350 μm through maintaining a low level of the adhesive lb eps layer lb eps tb eps ratio of 0 06 0 1 and sustaining lowly adhesive surface properties i e high negative charge 23 2 mv low hydrophobicity 37 3 and low viscosity 0 7 0 1 mpa s of the sludge on the other hand the low adhesive micro granules have lower potential to entrap gas bubbles thus beneficial to prevent sludge flotation additionally cgr mixing enhanced mass transfer through i accelerating substrate distribution by improving reactor hydrodynamics ii facilitating substrate penetration from bulk liquid into granules by maintaining a low level of lb eps a mass transfer resistance layer and iii allowing a homogeneous distribution of substrate through the whole granules by sustaining the small granule size the information of this study provided a new operational strategy for the srusb reactor to improve its long term efficiency and stability furthermore this study may be useful to better understand and remediate the long standing operation issue of unexpected

recirculation sludge granulation sludge properties sludge flotation minimization 1 introduction sulfate laden wastewater can be produced from various industrial processes such as mining pulp and paper making and flue gas desulfurization hao et al 2014 and also generated from using seawater as an alternative water resource for desalination and or toilet flushing van loosdrecht et al 2012 the treatment of sulfate laden wastewater has to face critical challenges in particular in the methanogenic anaerobic treatment because the presence of sulfate can encourage the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria srb to produce hydrogen sulfide h2s which is toxic to methanogens lens and kuenen 2001 alternatively biological sulfate reduction bsr process can be implemented for the treatment of sulfate laden wastewaters lens and kuenen 2001 lu et al 2012 a few years ago we developed a novel sulfur cycle based bioprocess called sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani for simultaneous removal of organics and nitrogen in the treatment of saline sewage resulting from the use of seawater for toilet flushing lu et al 2012 in a recent large scale trial this novel bsr driven process demonstrated reductions in space of 30 40 and in biological sludge production of 60 70 compared with existing biological sewage treatment plants in hong kong wu et al 2016 the upflow sludge bed usb reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge bed uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and their modifications are promising technologies for anaerobic anoxic processes such as methanogenesis seghezzo et al 1998 denitrification franco et al 2006 and bsr lens and kuenen 2001 due to its high loading rate and removal efficiency and low cost and energy demand however the usb technologies commonly face a critical operational issue sludge flotation campos et al 2017 this issue causes usb reactors to fail campos et al 2017 and is hindering the widespread adoption of the usb technologies and is usually due to a decrease in sludge density when gas is entrapped in the sludge de beer et al 1996 campos et al 2017 the gas entrapment can occur when substrate is overloaded franco et al 2006 cao et al 2016 oil and grease are present in large amounts jeganathan et al 2007 ph or temperature changes suddenly blaszczyk et al 1994 filamentous bacteria grow excessively li et al 2008 or reactor mixing is insufficient franco et al 2006 chen et al 2014 whereas the methanogenic usb reactor uses biogas for internal mixing the sulfate reducing upflow sludge bed srusb reactors i e a key component of the sani system in our previous studies recirculated 50 300 of the effluent because very little gas was generated wu et al 2016 hao et al 2015 however our recent studies have revealed that such hydraulic mixing negatively changed i structure of extracellular polymeric substances eps to have a high ratio of outer layer loosely bound lb eps to inner layer tightly bound tb eps as a double layer eps structure model defined in nielsen and jahn 1999 ii chemical composition of eps to have a high ratio of proteins pn to polysaccharides ps and iii sludge surface properties to have a high hydrophobicity high viscosity and low negative surface charge these alterations are in turn responsible for the low external mass transfer and high sludge flotation potential in srusb tsui et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hence it is necessary to further investigate the causes and control strategies of sludge flotation and find ways of improving external mass transfer so that the srusb reactor can stay robust and the sani system can remain stable during long term operation the present study therefore examines in depth the application of continuous gas recirculation cgr in srusb to minimize sludge flotation a method proposed in wang et al 2017 we investigated the correlation between the cgr and changes in reactor hydrodynamics in five 45 day tests with different mixing intensities to determine the optimal mixing intensity then under the optimal mixing intensity we evaluated the organics removal solid liquid separation and sludge granulation in srusb through a 150 day reactor test and examined the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of the sludge to find out how cgr ameliorates flotation in the reactor the findings of this study help resolve the long standing operational problem of sludge flotation in usb type anaerobic bioreactors 2 materials and methods x2028 2 1 reactor setup and operation a 2 4 l laboratory scale srusb reactor with a height of 85 cm and an internal diameter of 6 cm and equipped with a cgr system was operated in this study see fig s1 in supplementary information si 1 the cgr system comprised i a gas liquid solid gls separator installed at a height of 70 cm for collecting most of the rising gas bubbles and ii a peristaltic pump connected to the opening at the top of the gls separator for recirculating the gas to the bottom of the reactor the gas flow rate ranged from 0 33 to 8 35 ml min corresponding to different superficial gas velocities and mixing intensities as shown in table 1 the gas bubbles entered at the bottom of the reactor and rose up to the gls separator to continuously provide a mixing force to the sludge bed hence the intensity of the mixing force could be manipulated by adjusting the gas recirculating rate due to the low gas production of the sulfate reduction reaction 20 ml of air were pumped into the cgr system per day to supplement the gas lost the effect of the oxygen content in the supplementary air was negligible the synthetic saline sewage was produced by combining seawater tap water and stock solution and contained sulfate chemical oxygen demand cod composed of the mixture of acetate and glucose with the cod ratio of 1 1 and ammonia nitrogen at concentrations of 500 mg so4 2 mg l i e 166 mg s l 260 mg cod l and 24 mg n l respectively detailed information is provided in si 2 the sewage was fed to the reactors using a peristaltic pump at a constant flow rate of 1 2 l h corresponding to a reactor hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 h the influent ph was adjusted to approximately 7 2 and its temperature was kept constant at 21 1 c the solid retention time srt was calculated as approximately 13 days initially the cgr srusb was operated for five 45 day periods with different mixing intensities table 1 from day 1 to day 225 to determine the optimum operating condition phase i hydrodynamic study in short term operation in each 45 day lab scale test denoted as t1 t5 the reactor was newly inoculated with the same mass of seeding sludge 20 g taken from the large scale srusb reactor at shatin hong kong wu et al 2016 the reactor was then operated at the corresponding mixing intensity from day 1 to day 30 for sludge acclimation because 30 days would suffice for an anaerobic sludge to adapt to a new mixing condition according to the literature jiang et al 2016 after the acclimation three sets of triplicate measurements were conducted on the 35th 40th and 45th day to evaluate the reactor performance an identical srusb with hydraulic mixing by effluent recirculation was operated in parallel as a control reactor fig s1 it should note that these two reactors were used in our previous study to investigate the influence of mixing on the sludge characteristics in short term experiments wang et al 2017 while in the present study these two reactors were emptied and re inoculated for new studies on investigating the reactor hydrodynamics and energy efficiency after the five phase i tests were completed at day 225 the cgr srusb was emptied reinoculated with the same mass of seed sludge and operated under the optimal mixing intensity at the optimal average shear rate from day 226 to day 375 to examine the long term performance and sludge granulation phase ii long term operation the parameters of cgr srusb measured and analyzed in phase i include a the hydrodynamics with respect to the mixing regime fraction of short circuiting flow and fraction of dead zone b power consumption for mixing and c reactor performance i e cod removal sulfate reduction and sulfide production the energy efficiencies of h srusb and cgr srusb were compared by calculating their power consumption for achieving a similar sludge bed expansion θ percentage of sludge bed expansion was calculated as the stabilized sludge bed height under a certain mixing intensity reactor water depth 100 the sludge bed expansion was controlled by adjusting the average shear rate υ the determination of the average shear rates in cgr srusb and h srusb is described in si 3 in addition to the short term 45 day effects measured in phase i further changes in sludge characteristics under long term cgr operation were analyzed in phase ii including changes in d solid liquid separation capacity with the sludge volume index svi and sludge flotation potential

granules via micro sensor analysis 2 2 hydrodynamics and power consumption the hydrodynamics in the cgr srusb reactor including mixing regime fraction of dead zone and fraction of short circuiting flow was investigated via tracer tests five sets of tracer tests were conducted during phase i for the five mixing intensities in order to eliminate the possible influence of the tracer on reactor performance or sludge properties the tracer tests were conducted on the last day of each of the 45 day tests the tracer test is described in si 4 the energy efficiency of reactor mixing is an important criterion for reactor design and operation the energy efficiencies of conventional hydraulic mixing and cgr mixing in srusb reactors are compared by calculating the power consumption of the liquid gas recirculation pumps at the five mixing intensities details of the calculation methods for h cgr srusbs are provided in si 5 2 3 analytical methods in this study to protect cod measurements from the effects of chloride and sulfide in the saline wastewater cod was determined by multiplying the measured value of toc shimadzu toc l by the theoretical toc cod conversion factor 1 g of toc is equivalent to 2 67 g of cod henze et al 2008 mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and the sludge volume indexes after 5 min and 30 min svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods apha 2005 dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 sulfate and other major ions in liquid were determined by ion chromatography shimadzu corporation hic 20a super the sfp was measured through an ex situ gas flotation test originated from de beer et al 1996 and halalsheh et al 2005 as described in wang et al 2017 the size distribution of sludge particles was determined with a laser diffraction particle size analyzer horiba la 950v2 the sludge particle growth rate used to evaluate the sludge granulation performance was determined as the change in mean sludge particle size per day over two successive sampling days wu et al 2009 sludge surface charge was measured as zeta potential with a zeta potential analyser brookhaven zetaplus sludge hydrophobicity was measured from the adherence of the sludge to a liquid hydrocarbon p xylene merck rosenberg et al 1980 viscosity was measured with a rotational viscosity meter lichen ndj 5s the eps analysis was conducted by using the methods described in li and yang 2007 and wang et al 2017 two types of eps were identified lb eps and tb eps both lb eps and tb eps were found to be composed of pn ps and humic like substances hs during phase ii different sludge samples were taken from cgr srusb at the first seeding sludge the 25th floc sludge and the 145th day granular sludge equivalent to days 226 250 and 370 of the investigation period the morphology of granular sludge was examined with an inverted microscope olympus cx41 and a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm3030 fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were used to visualize the distribution of srb in cgr srusb sludge the detail is explained in si 6 sulfide concentration profiles in sludge granules were measured using a commercially available microsensor system consisting of a sulfide microsensor and a microsensor multimeter unisense aarhus denmark calibration and measurement were conducted according to the manual of the unisense microsensor multimeter unisense 2017 in order to quantify the role of cgr mixing in enhancing the long term performance of the srusb based on experimental data from long term operation phase ii a statistical analysis based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s li and yang 2007 was used to evaluate the correlations between the performance of the cgr srusb including sludge granule growth rate biomass specific organic loading rate sfp svi5 and svi5 svi30 ratio and the sludge physicochemical characteristics including lb eps tb eps lb eps tb eps ratio pn ps pn ps ratio zeta potential hydrophobicity viscosity detail information of the statistical analysis is provided in si7 3 results 3 1 effects of cgr mixing 3 1 1 hydrodynamic study the hydrodynamics in an upflow type bioreactor including mixing regime fraction of short circuiting flow and fraction of dead zone contributes importantly to the treatment efficiency and operational stability of the reactor lu et al 2012 tracer tests with retention time distribution rtd curve analysis as shown in fig 1 a were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamics in the cgr srusb reactor at the five specified mixing intensities table 1 comparing the rtd curves obtained in the cgr srusb at the five average shear rates fig 1a with the theoretical rtd curves levenspiel 1998 singh et al 2006 the results suggest that the mixing regime in the reactor changes from a plug flow at low average shear rates below 1 5 s 1 to an intermediate mixing regime at an average shear rate of approximately 2 7 s 1 and further to a more complete mixed flow regime at higher mixing intensities 4 2 7 2 s 1 this result is consistent with the phenomenon in methanogenic usb heertjes et al 1982 when gas mixing is provided the mixing regime in an usb type bioreactor tends to change from plug flow to mixed flow and the reactor mixing and influent distribution are further improved at higher gas flow rates due to the resulting stronger turbulence below the gls separator the fractions of short circuiting flow and dead zone are important in describing the hydrodynamic performance of an upflow bioreactor bolle et al 1986 the combination of a lower short circuiting flow and a smaller dead zone suggests a more efficient influent distribution and a more effective reaction volume in the reactor heertjes et al 1982 we have previously reported that intensifying mixing by increasing hydraulic recirculation can reduce the dead zone but concomitantly exacerbates the short circuiting problem lu et al 2012 for cgr srusb when the average shear rate increased from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 short circuiting and dead zone reduced from 13 1 0 8 to 1 3 0 1 and 9 5 0 3 to 0 2 0 01 respectively fig 1b however when the average shear rate increased to 7 2 s 1 in t5 the sludge bed expanded to 80 over the gls separator as a result the effluent total suspended solids tss of t5 was approximately 183 21 mg l which was much higher than the effluent tss of t1 t4 in the range of 40 80 mg l hence sludge washout occurred in t5 a satisfactory hydrodynamic performance could thus be achieved at the average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 in t4 without sludge washout 3 1 2 correlation of hydrodynamics with performance and power consumption the effects of cgr mixing on organics removal and sulfate reduction were investigated in phase i fig 2 when the mixing intensity increased from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 in t1 t5 in phase i the carbonaceous cod removal efficiency increased from 23 to 94 notably a cod removal efficiency of 90 was achieved in both t4 and t5 fig 2a concomitantly the sulfate reduction δso4 s increased from 13 mg s l t1 in t4 to 110 122 mg s l in t5 fig 2b moreover comparing the δcod δso4 s ratio fig 2b with its theoretical value of 2 g δcod g δso4 s poinapen et al 2009 reveals that the ratio was approximately 3 g δcod g δso4 s at a low average shear rate of 0 9 s 1 t1 this indicates that the sulfate reduction reaction consumed just over half of the removed cod a δcod δso4 s ratio of 1 8 2 1 was achieved at higher mixing intensities of 4 2 7 2 s 1 t4 and t5 this indicates that a higher srb activity was achieved in t4 and t5 and that most of the cod was removed through the sulfate reduction reaction in the cgr srusb power consumption is another critical concern for the design of reactor mixing the power consumptions of the cgr mixing system and conventional effluent recirculation hydraulic mixing at similar percentages of sludge bed expansion were estimated and compared in the two identical reactors i e cgr srusb and h srusb as shown in fig 3 when the sludge bed expansion was 30 cgr mixing consumed slightly more power than hydraulic mixing to achieve a sludge bed expansion 63 cgr mixing consumed considerably less power than hydraulic mixing in particular when the sludge bed was purposely adjusted to a higher expansion ratio of 73 82 with higher mixing intensities 4 2 7 2 s 1 to achieve a high cod removal efficiency over 90 cgr mixing consumed much less energy than hydraulic mixing this outcome suggests that cgr mixing is more energy efficient than hydraulic mixing and can enable the srusb reactor to perform satisfactorily this is due to the rising gas bubbles in cgr mixing offering a stronger and multidimensional turbulence than hydraulic mixing can heertjes et al 1982 as a result the short circuiting flow and dead zone can be more effectively controlled by gas mixing over 90 of organics could be removed in cgr srusb at 4 2 s 1 and 7 2 s 1 but the energy required to achieve 7 2 s 1 was approximately 2 5 times that required for 4 2 s 1 fig 3 also sludge loss with the effluent led to a significant biomass loss when the cgr srusb was operated at 7 2 s 1 therefore we propose that the average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 is the optimal mixing intensity and can achieve a high organics removal at low energy consumption in the cgr srusb 3 1 3 long term operation in order to evaluate the long term stability of cgr srusb at the optimal mixing intensity of 4 2 s 1 determined through the phase i study the reactor was restarted with new seeding sludge and continuously operated for 150 days phase ii days 226 375 as shown in fig 2a during the first 28 days of phase ii from day 226 to day 253 the start up period the cod removal efficiency increased from 28 to 98 and then stayed close to 90 in the following 122 days from day 253 to day 375 the stable operation period moreover high sulfate reduction 110 mg s l and a stable δcod δso4 s ratio 1 7 2 3 were maintained during the stable operation period the results indicate that the cgr srusb can achieve a stable and satisfactory organics removal through sulfate reduction reactions in long term operation the mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss ratio remained stable at 7 8 0 6 g mlss l 5 1 0 4 g mlvss l and 65 1 2 respectively during the stable operation period correspondingly the biomass activity of the cgr srusb reactor during stable operation was determined as the mlvss specific organic loading rate of 0 62 0 05 g cod g mlvss day fig 5g notably this specific rate is higher than those observed in the h srusb reactors of 0 3 0 4 g cod g mlvss day wu et al 2016 hao et al 2015 and in a h srusb reactor equipped with intermittent gas sparging tsui et al 2016 possible reasons for this higher biomass specific activity with cgr mixing are discussed in section 4 2 below the solid liquid separation characteristics of the sludge can affect the stability of anaerobic reactor technologies mahmoud et al 2003 svi is commonly used to indicate sludge settleability in phase ii svi30 decreased from 57 5 0 5 ml g at the reinoculated 1st day day 226 to below 25 0 3 5 ml g at the 45th day day 270 and remained stable in the range of 20 5 22 5 ml g in the remaining days of phase ii fig 4 a this svi30 is much lower than the critical value 100 ml g of an activated sludge that settled well henze et al 2008 sfp which quantifies the tendency of sludge to float is also an important parameter for assessing the solid liquid separation characteristics of the sludge in usb bioreactors de beer et al 1996 as shown in fig 4b sfp of the cgr srusb decreased from 78 5 to 15 2 during the start up period of phase ii and remained below the critical safe value of 20 halalsheh et al 2005 for the rest of the investigation period this outcome suggests that sludge flotation which is common in hydraulic mixing sulfidogenic upflow reactors can be controlled in cgr mixing reactors a similar method for sludge flotation remediation has also been verified in denitrifying upflow reactors cao et al 2016 3 2 sludge granulation in cgr srusb 3 2 1 formation of granular sludge in phase ii the mean particle size of the seeding sludge day 226 was 42 8 μm fig 5a corresponding to fine sludge flocs as shown in fig 5b thereafter larger sludge particles 306 38 μm developed within 65 days day 290 fig 5d and the sludge particle size remained constant in the range of 300 350 μm fig 5a and e until day 375 during the start up period the granules grew in size at a gradually decreasing growth rate fig 5f days 226 290 after day 290 the granules stayed approximately the same size on the other hand svi5 decreased from 130 2 ml g to below 30 ml g in the first 65 days days 226 290 and then remained stable at 20 30 ml g for the rest of phase ii fig 4a notably the stable svi5 is lower than the critical value 40 60 ml g of typical granular sludge as documented in henze et al 2008 moreover the ratio of svi5 svi30 decreased from 2 3 0 1 day 226 to 1 2 0 1 day 270 and then remained in the range of 1 1 1 3 in the rest of phase ii fig 4a the stable sludge particle size and low svi5 svi30 ratio indicate the formation of micro granules in cgr srusb schwarzenbeck et al 2005 3 2 2 characterization of granular sludge the distribution of the total bacteria denoted as eub and srb in the cgr srusb sludge was investigated using fish clsm as illustrated in fig 6 the fluorescence signals from the cells hybridized with eub338 and srb385 probes became more intense for the sludge sampled at the 1st the 25th and the 145th day of phase ii days 226 250 and 370 of investigation the results indicate that both eub and srb originally from full scale srusb were significantly enriched in the cgr srusb analyzing the fluorescing intensities of srb and eub in the fish images reveals that the percentage of srb in eub increased from 2 at the 1st day to 65 at the 145th day of phase ii srb existed in higher abundance in the cgr srusb granular sludge than in the h srusb granular sludge which was reported to be approximately 44 in hao et al 2015 moreover fig 6f shows that srb dominated in both the outer and inner layers of the granules indicating that the granules developed in cgr srusb were homogeneous in structure furthermore in order to investigate the srb activity and mass transfer inside the cgr srusb granules the sulfide concentration profile in a cgr srusb micro granule 300 μm day 370 was compared with that in a large sized 1600 μm and a medium sized 700 μm h srusb sludge granule these two h srusb granules were originally taken from the full scale srusb reactor and acclimated in the control reactor h srusb for more than 100 days before microsensor analysis as shown in fig 7 the sulfide concentration increased rapidly from 20 25 mg s l at the granules surface to 35 40 mg s l at 200 400 μm depth into the granules at the rate of 0 05 0 075 mg s l 1 μm 1 for the medium sized granules fig 7a and the rate of 0 025 0 055 mg s l 1 μm 1 for large sized granules fig 7b then the sulfide concentration remained approximately constant or even decreased at a deeper depth into the two granules in contrast the sulfide concentration in the micro granule developed in cgr srusb only increased slightly from the granule s surface to its core fig 7c this outcome suggests that the medium and large sized granules possessed a layered structure in the large granules the srb activity was high from the granule s surface to a depth of 200 400 μm but low at the location closer to the core of the granules where was probably occupied by methanogens cavities or dead cells overmeire et al 1994 guiot et al 1992 the micro granules of the cgr srusb reactor did not exhibit such a layered strucutre as the srb acitivity was high throughout the granule moreover a positive correlation between granule particle size and the sulfide concentration gradient i e δsulfide sulfide max sulfide min in a granule can be observed in fig 7 the sulfide concentration gradients were 20 10 and 5 mg s l in the 1600 700 and 300 μm granules respectively hence the homogeneous srb activity and low sulfide concentration gradient in the micro granules may suggest a low mass transfer resistance and deep sulfate and cod penetration in the cgr srusb micro granules the amounts of lb eps and tb eps and the ratio of lb eps to tb eps of the cgr srusb sludge in phase ii are shown in fig 4c the sum of lb eps and tb eps increased from 45 3 to 80 4 mg toc g mlvss in the first 65 days of phase ii and then remained stable at 70 90 mg toc g mlvss thereafter the lb eps decreased from 17 1 to 6 2 mg toc g mlvss while the tb eps increased from 28 3 to 71 2 mg toc g mlvss these changes led to a considerable decrease in the lb eps tb eps ratio from 0 6 0 13 to 0 08 0 03 in the first 65 days which nevertheless remained stable afterwards in the range of 0 06 0 1 fig 4d presents the chemical compositions of the sludge eps in the first 65 days of phase ii ps increased from 13 2 to 27 3 mg g mlvss and subsequently remained stable in the range of 27 29 mg g mlvss however pn remained constant at approximately 90 7 mg g mlvss throughout the entire phase ii thus the pn ps ratio decreased from 6 8 0 7 to 3 0 0 1 in the first 65 days of phase ii but thereafter remained stable in the range of 2 5 3 5 in the cgr srusb micro granules changes in the eps structure and chemical composition can significantly affect the sludge surface properties such as surface charge hydrophobicity and viscosity liao et al 2001 liu et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in this study corresponding to decreases in the pn ps and lb eps tb eps ratios fig 4c and d the surface properties decreased during the granule formation period days 1 65 of phase ii but then remained stable at a more negative zeta potential 23 2 mv fig 4e a lower hydrophobicity 37 3 fig 4f and a lower sludge viscosity 0 7 0 1 mpa s fig 4g after the 65th day of phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 effect of cgr mixing on sludge granulation small and homogeneous sludge granules were developed in the cgr srusb which were unlike the large and heterogeneous granules developed in egsb reactors guiot et al 1992 the sludge granulation process is known to be highly influenced by sludge eps liu et al 2010 in which lb eps and tb eps both play important yet different roles i lb eps contributes to the attractive force among sludge cells to facilitate the formation of large granular sludge and ii tb eps plays a role in supporting the structure of biofilm granular sludge liao et al 2001 xu et al 2016 in this study micro granular sludge with a low lb eps tb eps ratio 0 06 0 1 was maintained during stable operation in phase ii notably the level of the lb eps tb eps ratio is higher than that of flocculent aerobic sludge 0 009 0 013 as reported in yu et al 2009 similar to that of granular anammox sludge 0 08 pellicer nàcher et al 2013 and lower than that of granular methanogenic sludge 0 4 liu et al 2010 the results are consistent with the findings of feng et al 2016 the strong shear stress introduced by the cgr mixing has more significant influence on the outer layer lb eps than that of the inner layer tb eps statistical analysis revealed that the spearman rank correlation coefficients r s between the growth rate of sludge granules and the level of lb eps on one hand and the level of tb eps on the other were 0 64 and 0 21 respectively p 0 05 table s2 these results suggest that lb eps has a positive effect and tb eps a weak negative effect on sludge granulation therefore cgr mixing likely affects sludge granulation through the influence of the eps structure cgr mixing mostly facilitated rapid adhesion among sludge particles in the start up period of phase ii days 226 290 when the lb eps content was high and provided attractive forces however cgr mixing limits granule size by decreasing the cell cell adhesion with low lb eps through providing a continuously shearing effect on the granule surface the changes in sludge properties fig 4e g also provide important information to understand the role of cgr mixing in forming and maintaining the micro granules through statistical analysis of the data from long term operation the positive effects of zeta potential r s 0 76 p 0 05 hydrophobicity r s 0 71 p 0 05 and viscosity r s 0 48 p 0 05 on the growth rate of sludge granules were identified table s2 these results suggest that the sludge with weakly negatively charged hydrophobic and viscous sticky surface properties favored rapid aggregation during the start up period of phase ii days 226 290 later the formation of sludge granules slowed down and eventually stopped as the sludge became strongly negatively charged hydrophilic and less viscous these findings are also consistent with the explanation in the literature i a high negative surface charge can increase the repulsive force liao et al 2001 halalsheh et al 2005 ii a low hydrophobicity can reduce the hydrophobic attraction force liao et al 2001 zita and hermansson 1997 and iii a low viscosity can weaken the bridging effect dentel et al 2000 among sludge aggregates thus reducing the rate of sludge granulation 4 2 effect of cgr mixing on improving organics removal capacity mass transfer of substrates generally involves two steps i a rapid and even distribution of the substrates from the influent pipe outlet to the vicinity of biomass liu and tay 2002 and ii a quick diffusion of the substrates from the vicinity of biomass through the outer eps layer a mass transfer resistance layer to make contact with bacterial cells inside the sludge granules nogueira et al 2015 in this study cgr mixing created favorable hydrodynamics in the srusb reactor including a mixed flow regime and minimized short circuiting flow and dead zone as described in section 3 1 1 which strongly facilitated a rapid and even distribution of the substrate in the bulk liquid the diffusion coefficient of eps is lower than that of water sheng et al 2010 the level of eps especially the outer lb eps therefore has a negative effect on the import of nutrients into and the export of metabolic products from granular sludge mu and yu 2006 from statistical analysis we identified a negative correlation r s 0 77 p 0 05 table s2 between the level of lb eps and the biomass specific organic loading rate the low level of lb eps maintained by cgr mixing is likely beneficial for reducing the thickness of the mass transfer resistance layer at the surface of granular sludge thus the diffusion of the substrate was rapid when it was penetrating the surface eps layer as the micro sensor results suggest the small granule size 300 350 μm maintained by cgr mixing allowed substrates to penetrate deep into the micro granules likewise nogueira et al 2015 suggests that effective mixing can enhance the mass transfer into the biofilm these favorable conditions can strongly facilitate substrate transport from the bulk liquid to the core of the cgr srusb micro granules resulting in the formation of granules with a homogeneous structure see figs 6f and 7c and a high biomass specific activity 0 62 0 05 g cod g mlvss day see fig 5g therefore a high organics removal capacity was maintained in the cgr srusb reactor 4 3 effect of cgr mixing on sludge flotation control wang et al 2017 demonstrated that cgr mixing can prevent sludge flotation which is confirmed in this investigation even for long term operation flotation is controlled in two ways i preventing gas accumulation inside granules and ii keeping the potential for gas to attach to the surface of granules low as reported in usb type bioreactors campos et al 2017 empty space and methanogens which produce much more gas than srb are commonly observed in the core of large sludge granules 1 mm which is the main reason for gas entrapment and the subsequent sludge flotation in contrast the small and active granules grown in the cgr srusb were dominated by low gas producing srb with neither observable empty space nor detectable methanogens in their core see figs 6f and 7c notably sulfate penetration into the core of the granules reduces opportunities for methanogen growth overmeire et al 1994 the risk of biogas accumulation inside the granules is therefore also reduced campos et al 2017 studied the mechanism of sludge flotation in methanogenic denitrification and anammox processes and suggested that sludge granules smaller than 400 μm in diameter do not float because efficient gas release can be maintained sludge flotation can also be caused by gas bubbles attaching themselves to the surface of granular sludge the potential for gas bubble attachment is highly influenced by the sludge surface properties three mechanisms help control sludge flotation in the cgr srusb i reduced hydrophobic attractive forces at the gas cell interface de beer et al 1996 ii intensified repulsive electrostatic forces yang et al 2003 and iii the fact that gas bubbles do not become trapped easily in less viscous sludge jenkins et al 2003 which is discussed in detail in wang et al 2017 in this study these correlations between the sludge surface properties and sfp were further confirmed during long term operation in phase ii by statistical analysis r s values are provided in table s2 these results demonstrate that cgr mixing kept sfp in srusb low during long term operation by maintaining a low hydrophobicity a strongly negative surface charge and a low viscosity of sludge so that the potential for gas attachment to the granule surface also stayed low 5 conclusion hydrodynamic study and long term evaluation of a novel continuous gas recirculation cgr based srusb was conducted for the first time through comparing the reactor hydrodynamics organic removal performance and energy efficiency of the cgr srusb reactor at five levels of mixing intensity from 0 9 to 7 2 s 1 in five short term tests an average shear rate of 4 2 s 1 was recommended as an optimal mixing intensity for long term operation of the cgr srusb by which a satisfactory hydrodynamic condition including a mixed flow regime minimized short circuiting flow 1 3 0 1 and dead zone 0 2 0 01 and over 90 organic removal can be achieved at a relatively low energy consumption 0 0007 w which is nearly one third of the h srusb 0 002 w in a following 150 day long term operation of the cgr srusb at the optimal mixing intensity of 4 2 s 1 comparing with the traditional hydraulic mixing srusb i sludge granules with smaller size 300 350 μm and higher srb activity 0 62 0 05 g cod g mlvss day were achieved ii an over 90 of organic removal efficiency was stably maintained and iii solid liquid separation problems were well controlled through stably maintaining a low sludge flotation potential 20 and a high settleability svi5 svi30 1 3 further attempt was taken to understand the possible working mechanism of the cgr mixing on enhancing srusb performance it was found the cgr mixing limited further sludge granulation after the granules grown to 300 350 μm through maintaining a low level of the adhesive lb eps layer lb eps tb eps ratio of 0 06 0 1 and sustaining lowly adhesive surface properties i e high negative charge 23 2 mv low hydrophobicity 37 3 and low viscosity 0 7 0 1 mpa s of the sludge on the other hand the low adhesive micro granules have lower potential to entrap gas bubbles thus beneficial to prevent sludge flotation additionally cgr mixing enhanced mass transfer through i accelerating substrate distribution by improving reactor hydrodynamics ii facilitating substrate penetration from bulk liquid into granules by maintaining a low level of lb eps a mass transfer resistance layer and iii allowing a homogeneous distribution of substrate through the whole granules by sustaining the small granule size the information of this study provided a new operational strategy for the srusb reactor to improve its long term efficiency and stability furthermore this study may be useful to better understand and remediate the long standing operation issue of unexpected

19683,emerging pollutants including pharmaceutical compounds are producing water pollution problems around the world some pharmaceutical pollutants which mainly reach ecosystems within wastewater discharges are persistent in the water cycle and can also reach the food chain this work addresses this issue accounting the grey component of the water footprint gwfp for four of the most common pharmaceutical compounds carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx in addition the gwfc for the main conventional pollutants is also accounted nitrate phosphates and organic matter the case study is the murcia region of southeastern spain where wastewater treatment plants wwtps purify 99 1 of the wastewater discharges and there is an important direct reuse of the treated wastewater in irrigation thus the influence of wwtps and reuse on the gwf is analysed the results reveal that gwfp only taking into account pharmaceutical pollutants has a value of 301 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 considering only conventional pollutants gwfc this value increases to 4718 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 so the difference between these values is such that in other areas with consumption habits similar to those of the murcia region and without wastewater purification conventional pollutants may well establish the value of the gwf on average the wwtps reduce the gwfc by 90 and the gwfp by 26 these different reductions of the pollutant concentrations in the treated effluents show that the gwf is not only due to conventional pollutants and other contaminants can became critical such as the pharmaceutical pollutants the reuse further reduces the value of the gwf for the murcia region by around 43 6 however the reuse of treated wastewater is controversial considering the pharmaceutical contaminants and their possible consequences in the food chain in these cases the gwf of pharmaceutical pollutants can be used to provide a first approximation of the dilution that should be applied to the treated wastewater discharges when they are reused for another economic activity that imposes quality restrictions for the case of agriculture in the murcia region the dilution required is 2

pharmaceutical products applied by consumers that produce pollution of the aquatic environment kümmerer 2011 examples of emerging pollutants are surfactants flame retardants personal care products gasoline additives biocides polar pesticides and their degradation products microplastics various pollutants tested for or suspected of endocrine disruption and pharmaceutical compounds petrie et al 2015 they can be found in surface and ground waters since the recalcitrant behaviour of some of these pollutants means that they are not easily degraded petrie et al 2015 wang et al 2016 although they are usually found in low concentrations μg l 1 their effects on the environment in the short or long term are not completely understood mandaric et al 2015 currently some of these pollutants are already included in monitoring plans as in the case of the prioritisation of emerging pollutants initiatives norman 2017 moreover a broad range of pollutants are controlled by the legislation outlined by the european commission ec 2000 2008 2013 traditionally these have been chemicals of agricultural or industrial origin nevertheless legislation is expected to include a greater number of derived chemicals following the recent incorporation of the pharmaceutical compounds 17β estradiol e2 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and diclofenac as priority emerging pollutants in the observation list ec 2015 as mentioned before this list of emerging pollutants includes pharmaceutical compounds that are widely used in human and veterinary medicine in some cases the damage to ecosystems is well known for example the severe injury of nepalese and himalayan vultures due to the veterinary use of diclofenac cuthbert et al 2011 since 2006 diclofenac has been banned to prevent further declines in vulture populations and a partial recovery has been observed in nepal paudel et al 2016 carbamazepine another pharmaceutical compound is known to accelerate fish embryonic development thus disturbing larval behaviour qiang et al 2016 although the effects of many other pharmaceutical residues are not known there is a strong concern as some studies have revealed that large amounts of pharmaceutical compounds are not necessary to provoke considerable damage in the biosphere qiang et al 2016 not only do they pose a risk to the environment they can also enter the food chain and affect humans prosser and sibley 2015 this issue cannot be considered as negligible in areas with scarce water resources where wastewater is often reused even sometimes directly in irrigation without any treatment satterthwaite 2016 the growing concern about the existence of pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment has led to widespread measurements of these pollutants but there are hardly any sets of homogeneous indicators that allow the comparison of the pollution issues across different geographic areas jiao et al 2013 the grey water footprint gwf is one of these indicators the gwf is part of the water footprint which is composed of the colours green blue and grey the green water footprint is the volume of rainwater consumed during the production process agricultural and forestry products the blue water footprint is the consumption of water resources surface and groundwater or their diversion to another geographic area transfers the gwf is defined as the volume of fresh water that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 so the gwf assesses the impacts produced by the pollution load on the aquatic environment in terms of the volume of fresh water in addition the gwf can be applied according to a producer or consumer approach differentiating pollution generated by economic activities from that of domestic consumption habits hoekstra et al 2011 in recent years numerous studies have assessed the gwf for conventional pollutants such as nitrate phosphates and organic matter liu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 cazcarro et al 2016 gil et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 quinteiro et al 2018 nevertheless scarce information is available about the emerging pollutants especially regarding the gwf produced by the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater releases into aquatic ecosystems since they are the main sources of these pollutants so this issue is less important in areas where wwtps eliminate part of these pollutants thus reducing the gwf although these facilities are not planned to completely eliminate pharmaceutical pollutants for some of them they are able to lower the concentration found in the influent by almost 90 arriaga et al 2016 fernández lópez et al 2016 rozas et al 2016 wang et al 2016 díaz garduño et al 2017 martínez alcalá et al 2017 in particular when the wwtps have tertiary treatments zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 díaz garduño et al 2017 unfortunately the residual water is usually not purified by a wwtp in many geographic areas for example less than 1 of wastewater is treated on the african continent http www wri org our work project eutrophication and hypoxia sources eutrophication therefore some of the wastewaters along with their pollutants finally end up in the environment or are reused without any treatment for other activities such as irrigation in both kinds of area with or without wwtps the gwf can assess the pollution from pharmaceuticals in terms of the volume of fresh water consumption helping water boards in two ways on the one hand once the gwf is assessed this value can be used to analyse the sustainability of the pollution problems for example when the flows in receiving water bodies exceed the gwfs the water bodies can withstand the pollution loads that they receive hoekstra et al 2011 but when the flows are lower than the gwfs the pollution cannot be supported and the gwf must be reduced pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016a on the other hand as gwf values quantify the volumes of fresh water that are necessary to reduce the pollutants of an effluent to certain levels they can show the order of magnitude of the volume with which it would be necessary to mix this effluent so as to be able to reuse it for other economic activities this work has as its main and novel target the accounting of the gwf of pharmaceutical pollutants gwfp following their consumption focusing on the discharge of these substances into the aquatic environment in the wastewater of several municipalities the four pharmaceuticals studied are carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx these compounds are the most common pharmaceutical pollutants according to their consumption in several european countries their behaviour during wastewater treatment and the frequency with which they are detected in wwtps camacho muñoz et al 2009 additionally gwfs were also accounted considering conventional pollutants gwfc such as nitrate phosphates and organic matter this study was conducted in the murcia region in the southeast of spain this geographic area has a very productive irrigated agriculture and given the scarcity of water a large number of wwtps have been built in order to increase the availability of good quality water to be reused in this economic activity ródenas and albacete 2014 so the effects of water treatment and reuse on the gwf are analysed for all pollutants pharmaceutical and conventional finally the implications of pharmacological pollutants with respect to the management of water resources and in particular the reuse of wastewater in irrigation are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the murcia region is located in southeastern spain iberian peninsula it has an extension of 11 313 km2 and is entirely within the segura river basin grindlay et al 2011 the climate of this region is semi arid mediterranean with an average annual temperature of 18 c and scarce annual rainfall around 300 mm aparicio et al 2017 despite the scarce natural water resources there is strong use of water for urban including tourism along the coast industrial and irrigation purposes chs 2016 in fact the consumption has increased in recent years exceeding the limits of natural resources and resulting in a structural water deficit with an unsustainable tendency as highlighted in hydrological planning chs 2016 due to the almost constant shortage important water management measures have been taken in order to match growing requirements and water availability this scarcity has been addressed through two strategies modernisation of supply facilities which has enabled the attainment of higher levels of profitability and the use of non conventional resources regarding the latter there are important transfers from the tagus river basin kroll et al 2013 very extensive use of groundwater martínez paz and perni 2011 desalination plants along the coast lapuente 2012 and significant direct reuse of treated wastewater effluents in irrigation fig 1 the irrigated crops in murcia region have a millennial tradition due to the combination of a benign climate with very favourable land for agriculture gil olcina 2009 under these circumstances irrigated agriculture has expanded and modernised in recent decades becoming one of the most profitable agricultural businesses worldwide martínez paz et al 2016 in this regard the irrigated area is currently about 188 534 ha representing 17 of this geographic area in addition in terms of economic agricultural exports vegetables and fruits this region is ranked third in spain despite its small size ine 2017 achieving these milestones with such scarce resources has been possible due to a complex and rational system of exploitation of water resources that connects the main irrigated areas with several sources of water so in the case of a lack of water from one source it is possible to resort to another among these wastewater has become a basic source because it is practically constant over time in fact 99 1 of wastewater is treated 105 115 hm3 year 1 during the period 2011 15 esamur 2017 representing 10 of the natural water resources per year chs 2016 despite the high quality of the treated wastewater it is possible to further improve some of its physical chemical parameters due to connections in the complex system of exploitation that allow the mixing of water from different sources for example the salinity of wastewater from coastal municipalities is reduced using water from the transfer and the quality of desalinated water is improved by mixing it with treated wastewater these physical chemical parameters are usually conditioned by the type of land that receives the water or by the type of crop as is the case of citrus with boron in desalinated water güler et al 2015 as a whole the 12 wwtps studied here purify 70 of the region s wastewater thus adequately representing the murcia region fig 1 the main treatments are conventional activated sludges extended aeration activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors all of them include tertiary treatment as the end point of the purification process of the treated wastewater 34 4 is reused directly for irrigation 60 2 is reused indirectly 1 60 by percolation into aquifers while 58 6 is discharged into rivers later being reused in wells or in derivations downstream and 7 40 is discharged into the mediterranean sea chs 2016 2 2 grey water footprint accounting the gwf is calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016b 1 gwf j max k q j ceff j k cmax k cnat k gwf j 0 k cmax k cnat k eq 1 provides the gwf for an effluent j contaminated by several pollutants k for a reference time interval this equation is applied for each pollutant k considered and the maximum volume of fresh water required by one pollutant is the value of the gwf of this effluent since it can dilute the rest of the pollutants such that they become harmless hoekstra et al 2011 wang and wu 2014 in eq 1 qj is the flow of effluent j ceffj k are the concentrations of the k pollutants considered in the effluent j cmaxk is the maximum concentration permitted in the receiving water body for each pollutant k and cnatk is the natural concentration of the same pollutants k in the receiving water body which must be zero in the case of non natural compounds hoekstra et al 2011 the gwf definition applies to discharges into water bodies such as direct wastewater releases or discharges from wwtps into natural streams morera et al 2016 it is also applied to determine the gwf generated by the sweeping along of pollutants by surface runoff or by infiltration in aquifers as in the case of excess fertiliser application to crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 therefore if a return from a water use is reused in another economic activity preventing pollutants from reaching water bodies or reducing considerably the load of pollutants it does not generate a gwf for example the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation without adding industrial fertilisers would be like another treatment step as the green filters prevent the nutrients from reaching wet areas or aquifers fowdar et al 2017 this is possible because the pollutant load of nutrients from treated wastewater is usually less than the needs of the crops so a gwf is generated only when industrial fertilisers are added and their excess ends up in a body of water not when treated wastewater is used alone in this case study the reference time interval is the year 2015 qj are data from the previously mentioned 12 wwtps esamur 2017 and it is assumed that the inflows and effluents for each wwtp are the same ceffj k are the concentrations of the pharmaceutical pollutants cbz cbz ktp and npx obtained from fernández lópez et al 2016 conventional pollutants nitrate phosphates and organic matter are measured as the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and bod5 respectively esamur 2017 regarding cmaxk there is neither legal restriction nor a unanimously recognized criterion for pharmaceutical pollutants therefore the predicted no effects concentrations pnec criterion of these products in waters for living organisms is proposed this criterion refers to the concentration of a chemical below which no adverse effects of exposure in an ecosystem are measured in addition this criterion is quite variable depending on the organism analysed algae invertebrate and fish and the toxic critical effects studied growth inhibition reproduction inhibition half maximal effective concentration lethal concentration for 50 of the population or lowest effect concentration also it is important to consider the possibility of the presence of several pharmaceutical compounds at the same time establishing phenomena of synergism or antagonism in the organism toxicity trombini et al 2016 for example cbz can be toxic from 0 1 or 100 mg l 1 and dcf from 0 0005 or 186 mg l 1 tran et al 2014 although pnec are weak with regard to reflecting the toxicity of several pharmaceutical compounds present at the same time these values are also considered very conservative so the pnec criterion is selected to assess the gwf considering the values found in gheorghe et al 2016 for the no observed effect concentration in daphnia magna whereas for the conventional pollutants the maximum values have been taken as those allowed by the spanish legislation on water management boe 2008 boe 2015 for cnatk it is considered that all wastewater ends up in a surface water body consequently cnatk is zero for pharmaceutical pollutants but setting a value for conventional pollutants is more complicated due to a lack of information liu et al 2012 described a method linking natural concentrations to the population density of the study area to this end it was assumed that river basins with population densities equal to or less than 1 inhabitant per 10 km2 are unaltered no numerical modelling is needed in this study as there are already measurements of the concentrations in the unaltered water bodies in the murcia region where the population density is lower the measurements made in these unaltered surface water bodies showed that most tn tp and bod5 concentrations were around zero chs 2017 which allowed the establishment of null values for the natural concentrations cnatk of all three pollutants in the calculation of the gwf discharges into the sea have also been considered and the cnatk considered are the same as those of the fresh water bodies thereby discharges into the sea with large pollutant loads are not excluded from this analysis and the option of changing a discharge s destination instead of a river directly into the sea cannot be proposed in order to reduce the value of the gwf the data for the effluents qj and ceffj k are summarised in table 1 and the cmaxk values are presented in table 2 3 results the situation described in the murcia region i present inmany other territories an area with scarce water resources in which wastewater is reused for irrigation but unlike many other areas the extensive network of existing treatment plants many of them directly connected to irrigation communities allows us to pose three scenarios in which different possible gwfs can be discussed depending on if the wastewater is treated and or reused first gwfs are obtained with the concentrations in the wastewater before it reaches the treatment plants influents whose values would be analogous to those in areas where wastewater is not treated second gwfs are assessed using the concentrations in the effluents of the wwtps which are representative of those territories where wastewater is treated but is not directly reused third gwfs are accounted for considering also a direct reuse this is conducted considering the particular characteristics of the murcia region these results provide an idea or an order of magnitude of what the reuse of treated wastewater means for the gwf since reuse diminishes the dispersion into the aquatic environment therefore following these steps the gwf results for pharmaceutical gwfp and conventional gwfc contaminants calculated separately are presented and compared first the values of the gwfp and gwfc are shown for the influents to the wwtps second the values for the effluents are given evaluating the effect of the removal of pollutants by the wwtps on the gwfp and gwfc finally the gwfp and gwfc values of the effluents are presented considering their direct reuse in irrigation 3 1 grey water footprint generated by the main municipalities in murcia region wwtps influents in this section the gwfp and gwfc of the wwtps influents are presented these represent the values that would be generated by the populations in 12 municipalities if there were no purification processes fig 2 a in this case the gwfp has a significant value of 263 106 m3 year 1 the municipalities that contribute most to this value are murcia este 66 5 106 m3 year 1 alcantarilla 58 0 106 m3 year 1 and la hoya 46 2 106 m3 year 1 the results indicate that the critical contaminant is not the same for all municipalities overall cbz is responsible for 65 of the gwfp while dcf and npx have less weight in this global value 25 and 10 respectively meanwhile ktp is not the critical pollutant in any municipality since the volume of fresh water required to dilute this pollutant in each influent is not capable of diluting the other pollutants to their established water quality standards it should be noted that four of the studied municipalities do not generate a gwfp due to the low concentrations of these pharmaceutical pollutants in the analysed wastewaters three are below the detection limits established by the methodology employed in fernández lópez et al 2016 the maximum value of the gwfp per inhabitant is for alcantarilla 1322 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 followed by cieza 1041 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 and san pedro 980 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 with a wide range of variation fig 2b so although murcia este is the municipality that contributes most to the gwfp for the whole area its inhabitants do not contribute the most individually ranking fifth on average each inhabitant generates a gwfp of 301 m3 year 1 comparing the gwfp values with those obtained for conventional pollutants gwfc it can be observed that the former are lower in all the influents studied so the volume of fresh water needed to dilute the conventional pollutants is also able to dilute the pharmaceutical ones and the gwfc would be the gwf generated by these municipalities the gwfc reaches a value of 4124 106 m3 year 1 as a whole for all the municipalities studied organic matter bod5 being the critical conventional pollutant the municipalities that contribute most to the gwpc are murcia este 1063 2 106 m3 year 1 molina norte 696 2 106 m3 year 1 and cabezo beaza 528 5 106 m3 year 1 which are also the ones with the greatest populations fig 3 a and table 1 the analysis by inhabitants indicates that the gwfc varies between 10 642 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in molina norte and 2171 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in calasparra on average each inhabitant generates a gwfc of about 4718 m3 year 1 fig 3b 3 2 grey water footprint of treated effluents wwtps effluents in this section we present the gwf values of the effluents from the wwtps of the 12 municipalities studied as in the previous section the results for the pharmaceutical pollutants are shown first followed by those of the conventional ones subsequently the results are compared and analysed together in this scenario the gwfp diminishes to 194 106 m3 year 1 a 26 decrease due to the action of the wwtps the analysis by municipalities indicates that the murcia este effluent has the highest gwfp 87 2 106 m3 year 1 followed by la hoya 26 8 106 m3 year 1 and alcantarilla 24 3 106 m3 year 1 the removal rates of each pharmaceutical pollutant are different in each wwtp and the pollutant that provides the value of the gwfp in each wwtp effluent has changed now cbz is the only critical pollutant fig 4 a it is noteworthy that although the gwfp decreases as a whole in some municipalities it rises slightly as is the case of murcia este calasparra caravaca de la cruz puerto lumbreras san javier and yecla this increase is due to the fact that some pharmaceuticals are not detectable in wwtps influents due to encapsulation in faeces transformation into other compounds and retransformation after the treatment in the mother substance but they are detected in effluents this is why a low value of gwfp appears now for three municipalities caravaca de cruz san javier and yecla that previously had no value and that together only account for 8 of the gwfp in this scenario when the gwfp is expressed per inhabitant its value and dispersion with respect to untreated wastewater are appreciably reduced the maximum value found in san pedro is 823 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in average terms a general decrease exists from 301 to 222 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 4b in the case of the conventional pollutants the gwfc decreases by 90 which demonstrates the effectiveness of the wwtps in eliminating this kind of pollutant the value of the gwfc for all wwtps as a whole is reduced to 411 106 m3 year 1 murcia este continues to contribute the most to this value of gwfc being responsible for more than half 52 the reduction of the gwfc was greatest for molina norte 98 and smallest for san pedro 83 fig 5 a in the effluents bod5 ceases to be the critical pollutant now tp is responsible for 80 of the gwfc and tn for 20 per inhabitant the values vary between 164 m3 year 1 caravaca de la cruz and 839 m3 year 1 alcantarilla the average being 470 m3 year 1 fig 5b although the global value of the gwfc is double that of the gwfp 411 106 m3 year 1 versus 194 106 m3 year 1 there are three wwtps where the value of the gwfp is greater than that of the gwfc san pedro puerto lumbreras and calasparra this is because cbz appears or its concentration increases in the effluents of these wwtps exacerbating the value of the gwfp while the gwfc values are significantly reduced so the fresh water volume required to dilute the cbz in these three wwtps is capable of diluting all the pollutants analysed in this treated wastewater dcf npx ktp tp tn and bod5 even the conventional pollutants therefore the final value of the gwf of the treated effluents is due to both conventional tp and tn and pharmaceutical pollutants cbz see fig 6 a reaching the value of 420 106 m3 year 1 a little higher than the 411 106 m3 year 1 obtained with only conventional pollutants similarly the value per capita rises slightly to 480 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 6b 3 3 grey water footprint in the murcia region in the murcia region as has been pointed out previously almost all the wastewaters are treated these treated volumes are discharged into natural streams infiltrate into aquifers are sent into the sea or are directly reused for the latter case there are legal concessions for the reuse by irrigation communities chs 2016 among the 12 wwtps studied nine send their effluents to direct reuse in irrigation preventing the majority of their pollutants from reaching water bodies assuming that their degradation accumulation in soil or accumulation in crops do not generate a gwf for that reason as the pollutant load that would reach the water bodies is small these nine effluents were not considered for the calculation of the gwf of the murcia region and only the effluents of the three wwtps that discharge directly into a water body including the one that releases into the sea were taken into account calasparra murcia este and san pedro consequently evaluating the gwf jointly for pharmaceutical and conventional pollutants the three treatment plants that discharge into the environment generate a gwf of 237 106 m3 year 1 this supposes a reduction of 43 6 with respect to the value previously obtained after wastewater treatment 420 106 m3 year 1 the critical pollutant in calasparra and san pedro is cbz representing 10 of the total gwf while in murcia este it is tp fig 6a representing the remaining 90 if the gwf taking into account the wwtps and reuse 237 106 m3 year 1 is extrapolated to the entire murcia region the gwf increases to 339 106 m3 year 1 gwfp and gwfc which represents a value of 271 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 4 discussion regarding the three scenarios evaluated the first reveals how in areas where no purification processes are employed the gwf can reach values of around 4718 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 3b due to conventional pollutants organic matter this value indicates the fresh water per capita that would be necessary to reduce the pollutants in the wastewater effluents to acceptable levels so in areas with water stress falkenmark et al 1989 in which the fresh water available is less than 1000 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 it would not be possible to dilute these pollutants this indicates that in these territories there is no practical option other than to reuse wastewater directly with the consequent health problems that this can involve the second scenario representative of areas where treated wastewaters are not directly reused demonstrates that the wwtps are very effective at eliminating conventional pollutants especially organic matter reducing the gwfc by around 90 the pharmaceuticals are removed partially reducing the gwfp to a lesser extent around 26 therefore in this case it is likely that the gwf no longer depends on just the organic matter since the wwtps are very efficient at removing this contaminant other partially eliminated pollutants would become critical for example nitrate phosphates and some emerging pollutants could also be critical such as cbz consequently part of the gwf of an area with wwtps may be due to non conventional pollutants such as pharmaceuticals despite the significant reduction of the gwf effected by the wwtps the treated wastewater discharged into natural streams continues to generate an important gwf that reaches values around 480 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 6b although this is not as serious as in areas without wwtps above all in areas with plentiful water resources it is not a negligible value for example and as a comparison the united nations un 2010 proposes a value between 50 and 100 l of fresh water per inhabitant and day for domestic use to ensure that basic needs are met and health is assured this represents 18 3 36 5 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 so domestic pollution even if there is an efficient system of purification requires a much greater volume of fresh water to ensure the assimilation of the rest of the pollutants by the environment than domestic water consumption itself the third scenario reveals that in territories with wwtps the option of reusing their effluents can reduce the gwf significantly although this reduction depends on the reuse rates of each territory for the case of the present study it implies a decrease from 480 to 271 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 on average this example value while still high could be inferior if the wwtp technology improved or the direct reuse ratio increased focusing now on direct reuse it has been indicated previously that the treated effluents do not generate a gwf if they are used directly in irrigation the conventional pollutants studied organic matter nitrate and phosphates would not generate an impact on the water environment since they are degraded in the soil or consumed by the crops in fact nitrate and phosphates are necessary for crops so if their concentrations in the soil are lower than the needs of the crops as is usual fertilisers are added to increase them similarly pharmaceutical pollutants in treated wastewaters tend to accumulate in soil and crops carter et al 2014 preventing many of them from reaching the aquatic environment however even if we assume that no pharmaceuticals reach any body of water they may have negative impacts on crops in this sense the accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in edible agricultural products has been confirmed prosser and sibley 2015 carter et al 2014 so regarding reuse pharmaceutical pollutants are more harmful than conventional ones therefore the concept of the gwf can be adapted or extrapolated to the field of reuse in general in this sense and in irrigation reuse the gwf can be used to determine the volume of water with which it is necessary to dilute a certain effluent so that it can be used safely but it is important to highlight that previous to this maximum concentrations for certain types of crops must be established for each pollutant due to the possibility of bioaccumulation or effects on crop survival for this case assuming that the maximum concentrations employed for the pnec criterion were similar to those that could be established in future legislation the gwf due to pharmaceutical contaminants gwfp in wwtp effluents that are reused in irrigation would not be zero consequently the gwf could be composed of two different values one would be due to treated wastewater that goes to natural streamflows 3 wwtps 237 106 m3 year 1 and another would arise when treated wastewater is reused in irrigation due to pharmaceutical pollutants 9 wwtps 82 4 106 m3 year 1 so in this scenario the gwf would increase slightly from 237 106 m3 year 1 to 319 106 m3 year 1 extrapolating these values to the murcia region produces a change from 338 106 m3 year 1 to 456 106 m3 year 1 an increase of 118 106 m3 year 1 due to the pharmaceutical pollutants in the treated wastewater that is reused although this increase is not very high and the concept of the gwf is being slightly altered it shows the order of magnitude of the quantity of uncontaminated fresh water with which it is necessary to mix the pollutant load to reduce its concentration to the quality standards established so if the treated wastewater has a volume of 38 6 106 m3 year 1 to achieve the designated dilution it is necessary to mix this volume with an additional volume of fresh water of 79 4 106 m3 year 1 to reach the indicated volume of 118 106 m3 year 1 so for this particular case and according to the previously established criteria it would be necessary on average to mix one volume of treated wastewater with two volumes of fresh water from another source without pharmaceutical pollutants transfer underground surface or desalinised water although the load of contaminants is not eliminated the dilution at least reduces their concentrations and thus the risk and concern related to the use of this water for irrigation regarding the case of the murcia region the levels of dilution that are currently being used are higher than those indicated here being of the order of two or 10 fresh water to one treated wastewater therefore according to this study the pharmaceutical compounds studied here should not pose a risk in the food chain when the treated wastewater is used in this way in irrigation 5 conclusions in this work gwf accounting for pharmaceutical pollutants gwfp was carried out in the murcia region in the influents of the wwtps among the four pharmaceutical compounds studied cbz dcf and npx were the critical pollutants whereas ktp was not found to be responsible for the gwfp nevertheless the gwfp was low when compared to the gwf produced by conventional pollutants gwfc the great differences between the gwfp and gwfc suggest that although water quality standards can vary between different legislations conventional pollutants will also be critical in other geographic areas without wwtps the wwtps have been shown to be very efficient for the conventional pollutants while the pharmaceuticals are removed partially the effect of the removal of the contaminants is transferred directly to both values gwfp and gwfc nevertheless the results indicate that achieving a gwfp or gwfc equal to zero is not a simple task since all the wwtps studied have tertiary treatment to do this the purification rates of the wwtps should be increased to values close to 100 a fourth treatment step such as osmosis activated carbon or ozone filtration being necessary however this aim could be achieved through reuse thus saving important economic resources and encouraging a circular economy the only drawback is that the pollutant concentrations of the effluents must be decreased to acceptable ranges for this secondary use otherwise as can be observed in the example presented here pharmaceutical pollutants could be a limiting factor in these cases an alternative that avoids increasing the purification costs and allows water reuse to continue is the mixture of waters from different origins this is a habitual practice in zones of water scarcity but with connectivity of waters to this end the gwf concept is an indicator that can be used to determine the volume of fresh water that needs to be added to an effluent to reduce its levels of pollutants to a specific concentration so the gwf in addition to raising awareness of the effects of pollution on the environment also shows the dilution of treated wastewater that is necessary to allow its safe reuse in another economic activity acknowledgements this work

19683,emerging pollutants including pharmaceutical compounds are producing water pollution problems around the world some pharmaceutical pollutants which mainly reach ecosystems within wastewater discharges are persistent in the water cycle and can also reach the food chain this work addresses this issue accounting the grey component of the water footprint gwfp for four of the most common pharmaceutical compounds carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx in addition the gwfc for the main conventional pollutants is also accounted nitrate phosphates and organic matter the case study is the murcia region of southeastern spain where wastewater treatment plants wwtps purify 99 1 of the wastewater discharges and there is an important direct reuse of the treated wastewater in irrigation thus the influence of wwtps and reuse on the gwf is analysed the results reveal that gwfp only taking into account pharmaceutical pollutants has a value of 301 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 considering only conventional pollutants gwfc this value increases to 4718 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 so the difference between these values is such that in other areas with consumption habits similar to those of the murcia region and without wastewater purification conventional pollutants may well establish the value of the gwf on average the wwtps reduce the gwfc by 90 and the gwfp by 26 these different reductions of the pollutant concentrations in the treated effluents show that the gwf is not only due to conventional pollutants and other contaminants can became critical such as the pharmaceutical pollutants the reuse further reduces the value of the gwf for the murcia region by around 43 6 however the reuse of treated wastewater is controversial considering the pharmaceutical contaminants and their possible consequences in the food chain in these cases the gwf of pharmaceutical pollutants can be used to provide a first approximation of the dilution that should be applied to the treated wastewater discharges when they are reused for another economic activity that imposes quality restrictions for the case of agriculture in the murcia region the dilution required is 2

pharmaceutical products applied by consumers that produce pollution of the aquatic environment kümmerer 2011 examples of emerging pollutants are surfactants flame retardants personal care products gasoline additives biocides polar pesticides and their degradation products microplastics various pollutants tested for or suspected of endocrine disruption and pharmaceutical compounds petrie et al 2015 they can be found in surface and ground waters since the recalcitrant behaviour of some of these pollutants means that they are not easily degraded petrie et al 2015 wang et al 2016 although they are usually found in low concentrations μg l 1 their effects on the environment in the short or long term are not completely understood mandaric et al 2015 currently some of these pollutants are already included in monitoring plans as in the case of the prioritisation of emerging pollutants initiatives norman 2017 moreover a broad range of pollutants are controlled by the legislation outlined by the european commission ec 2000 2008 2013 traditionally these have been chemicals of agricultural or industrial origin nevertheless legislation is expected to include a greater number of derived chemicals following the recent incorporation of the pharmaceutical compounds 17β estradiol e2 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and diclofenac as priority emerging pollutants in the observation list ec 2015 as mentioned before this list of emerging pollutants includes pharmaceutical compounds that are widely used in human and veterinary medicine in some cases the damage to ecosystems is well known for example the severe injury of nepalese and himalayan vultures due to the veterinary use of diclofenac cuthbert et al 2011 since 2006 diclofenac has been banned to prevent further declines in vulture populations and a partial recovery has been observed in nepal paudel et al 2016 carbamazepine another pharmaceutical compound is known to accelerate fish embryonic development thus disturbing larval behaviour qiang et al 2016 although the effects of many other pharmaceutical residues are not known there is a strong concern as some studies have revealed that large amounts of pharmaceutical compounds are not necessary to provoke considerable damage in the biosphere qiang et al 2016 not only do they pose a risk to the environment they can also enter the food chain and affect humans prosser and sibley 2015 this issue cannot be considered as negligible in areas with scarce water resources where wastewater is often reused even sometimes directly in irrigation without any treatment satterthwaite 2016 the growing concern about the existence of pharmaceutical compounds in the aquatic environment has led to widespread measurements of these pollutants but there are hardly any sets of homogeneous indicators that allow the comparison of the pollution issues across different geographic areas jiao et al 2013 the grey water footprint gwf is one of these indicators the gwf is part of the water footprint which is composed of the colours green blue and grey the green water footprint is the volume of rainwater consumed during the production process agricultural and forestry products the blue water footprint is the consumption of water resources surface and groundwater or their diversion to another geographic area transfers the gwf is defined as the volume of fresh water that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 so the gwf assesses the impacts produced by the pollution load on the aquatic environment in terms of the volume of fresh water in addition the gwf can be applied according to a producer or consumer approach differentiating pollution generated by economic activities from that of domestic consumption habits hoekstra et al 2011 in recent years numerous studies have assessed the gwf for conventional pollutants such as nitrate phosphates and organic matter liu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 cazcarro et al 2016 gil et al 2017 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 quinteiro et al 2018 nevertheless scarce information is available about the emerging pollutants especially regarding the gwf produced by the presence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater releases into aquatic ecosystems since they are the main sources of these pollutants so this issue is less important in areas where wwtps eliminate part of these pollutants thus reducing the gwf although these facilities are not planned to completely eliminate pharmaceutical pollutants for some of them they are able to lower the concentration found in the influent by almost 90 arriaga et al 2016 fernández lópez et al 2016 rozas et al 2016 wang et al 2016 díaz garduño et al 2017 martínez alcalá et al 2017 in particular when the wwtps have tertiary treatments zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 díaz garduño et al 2017 unfortunately the residual water is usually not purified by a wwtp in many geographic areas for example less than 1 of wastewater is treated on the african continent http www wri org our work project eutrophication and hypoxia sources eutrophication therefore some of the wastewaters along with their pollutants finally end up in the environment or are reused without any treatment for other activities such as irrigation in both kinds of area with or without wwtps the gwf can assess the pollution from pharmaceuticals in terms of the volume of fresh water consumption helping water boards in two ways on the one hand once the gwf is assessed this value can be used to analyse the sustainability of the pollution problems for example when the flows in receiving water bodies exceed the gwfs the water bodies can withstand the pollution loads that they receive hoekstra et al 2011 but when the flows are lower than the gwfs the pollution cannot be supported and the gwf must be reduced pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016a on the other hand as gwf values quantify the volumes of fresh water that are necessary to reduce the pollutants of an effluent to certain levels they can show the order of magnitude of the volume with which it would be necessary to mix this effluent so as to be able to reuse it for other economic activities this work has as its main and novel target the accounting of the gwf of pharmaceutical pollutants gwfp following their consumption focusing on the discharge of these substances into the aquatic environment in the wastewater of several municipalities the four pharmaceuticals studied are carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx these compounds are the most common pharmaceutical pollutants according to their consumption in several european countries their behaviour during wastewater treatment and the frequency with which they are detected in wwtps camacho muñoz et al 2009 additionally gwfs were also accounted considering conventional pollutants gwfc such as nitrate phosphates and organic matter this study was conducted in the murcia region in the southeast of spain this geographic area has a very productive irrigated agriculture and given the scarcity of water a large number of wwtps have been built in order to increase the availability of good quality water to be reused in this economic activity ródenas and albacete 2014 so the effects of water treatment and reuse on the gwf are analysed for all pollutants pharmaceutical and conventional finally the implications of pharmacological pollutants with respect to the management of water resources and in particular the reuse of wastewater in irrigation are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the murcia region is located in southeastern spain iberian peninsula it has an extension of 11 313 km2 and is entirely within the segura river basin grindlay et al 2011 the climate of this region is semi arid mediterranean with an average annual temperature of 18 c and scarce annual rainfall around 300 mm aparicio et al 2017 despite the scarce natural water resources there is strong use of water for urban including tourism along the coast industrial and irrigation purposes chs 2016 in fact the consumption has increased in recent years exceeding the limits of natural resources and resulting in a structural water deficit with an unsustainable tendency as highlighted in hydrological planning chs 2016 due to the almost constant shortage important water management measures have been taken in order to match growing requirements and water availability this scarcity has been addressed through two strategies modernisation of supply facilities which has enabled the attainment of higher levels of profitability and the use of non conventional resources regarding the latter there are important transfers from the tagus river basin kroll et al 2013 very extensive use of groundwater martínez paz and perni 2011 desalination plants along the coast lapuente 2012 and significant direct reuse of treated wastewater effluents in irrigation fig 1 the irrigated crops in murcia region have a millennial tradition due to the combination of a benign climate with very favourable land for agriculture gil olcina 2009 under these circumstances irrigated agriculture has expanded and modernised in recent decades becoming one of the most profitable agricultural businesses worldwide martínez paz et al 2016 in this regard the irrigated area is currently about 188 534 ha representing 17 of this geographic area in addition in terms of economic agricultural exports vegetables and fruits this region is ranked third in spain despite its small size ine 2017 achieving these milestones with such scarce resources has been possible due to a complex and rational system of exploitation of water resources that connects the main irrigated areas with several sources of water so in the case of a lack of water from one source it is possible to resort to another among these wastewater has become a basic source because it is practically constant over time in fact 99 1 of wastewater is treated 105 115 hm3 year 1 during the period 2011 15 esamur 2017 representing 10 of the natural water resources per year chs 2016 despite the high quality of the treated wastewater it is possible to further improve some of its physical chemical parameters due to connections in the complex system of exploitation that allow the mixing of water from different sources for example the salinity of wastewater from coastal municipalities is reduced using water from the transfer and the quality of desalinated water is improved by mixing it with treated wastewater these physical chemical parameters are usually conditioned by the type of land that receives the water or by the type of crop as is the case of citrus with boron in desalinated water güler et al 2015 as a whole the 12 wwtps studied here purify 70 of the region s wastewater thus adequately representing the murcia region fig 1 the main treatments are conventional activated sludges extended aeration activated sludge processes and membrane bioreactors all of them include tertiary treatment as the end point of the purification process of the treated wastewater 34 4 is reused directly for irrigation 60 2 is reused indirectly 1 60 by percolation into aquifers while 58 6 is discharged into rivers later being reused in wells or in derivations downstream and 7 40 is discharged into the mediterranean sea chs 2016 2 2 grey water footprint accounting the gwf is calculated as follows hoekstra et al 2011 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2016b 1 gwf j max k q j ceff j k cmax k cnat k gwf j 0 k cmax k cnat k eq 1 provides the gwf for an effluent j contaminated by several pollutants k for a reference time interval this equation is applied for each pollutant k considered and the maximum volume of fresh water required by one pollutant is the value of the gwf of this effluent since it can dilute the rest of the pollutants such that they become harmless hoekstra et al 2011 wang and wu 2014 in eq 1 qj is the flow of effluent j ceffj k are the concentrations of the k pollutants considered in the effluent j cmaxk is the maximum concentration permitted in the receiving water body for each pollutant k and cnatk is the natural concentration of the same pollutants k in the receiving water body which must be zero in the case of non natural compounds hoekstra et al 2011 the gwf definition applies to discharges into water bodies such as direct wastewater releases or discharges from wwtps into natural streams morera et al 2016 it is also applied to determine the gwf generated by the sweeping along of pollutants by surface runoff or by infiltration in aquifers as in the case of excess fertiliser application to crops mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 therefore if a return from a water use is reused in another economic activity preventing pollutants from reaching water bodies or reducing considerably the load of pollutants it does not generate a gwf for example the reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation without adding industrial fertilisers would be like another treatment step as the green filters prevent the nutrients from reaching wet areas or aquifers fowdar et al 2017 this is possible because the pollutant load of nutrients from treated wastewater is usually less than the needs of the crops so a gwf is generated only when industrial fertilisers are added and their excess ends up in a body of water not when treated wastewater is used alone in this case study the reference time interval is the year 2015 qj are data from the previously mentioned 12 wwtps esamur 2017 and it is assumed that the inflows and effluents for each wwtp are the same ceffj k are the concentrations of the pharmaceutical pollutants cbz cbz ktp and npx obtained from fernández lópez et al 2016 conventional pollutants nitrate phosphates and organic matter are measured as the total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and bod5 respectively esamur 2017 regarding cmaxk there is neither legal restriction nor a unanimously recognized criterion for pharmaceutical pollutants therefore the predicted no effects concentrations pnec criterion of these products in waters for living organisms is proposed this criterion refers to the concentration of a chemical below which no adverse effects of exposure in an ecosystem are measured in addition this criterion is quite variable depending on the organism analysed algae invertebrate and fish and the toxic critical effects studied growth inhibition reproduction inhibition half maximal effective concentration lethal concentration for 50 of the population or lowest effect concentration also it is important to consider the possibility of the presence of several pharmaceutical compounds at the same time establishing phenomena of synergism or antagonism in the organism toxicity trombini et al 2016 for example cbz can be toxic from 0 1 or 100 mg l 1 and dcf from 0 0005 or 186 mg l 1 tran et al 2014 although pnec are weak with regard to reflecting the toxicity of several pharmaceutical compounds present at the same time these values are also considered very conservative so the pnec criterion is selected to assess the gwf considering the values found in gheorghe et al 2016 for the no observed effect concentration in daphnia magna whereas for the conventional pollutants the maximum values have been taken as those allowed by the spanish legislation on water management boe 2008 boe 2015 for cnatk it is considered that all wastewater ends up in a surface water body consequently cnatk is zero for pharmaceutical pollutants but setting a value for conventional pollutants is more complicated due to a lack of information liu et al 2012 described a method linking natural concentrations to the population density of the study area to this end it was assumed that river basins with population densities equal to or less than 1 inhabitant per 10 km2 are unaltered no numerical modelling is needed in this study as there are already measurements of the concentrations in the unaltered water bodies in the murcia region where the population density is lower the measurements made in these unaltered surface water bodies showed that most tn tp and bod5 concentrations were around zero chs 2017 which allowed the establishment of null values for the natural concentrations cnatk of all three pollutants in the calculation of the gwf discharges into the sea have also been considered and the cnatk considered are the same as those of the fresh water bodies thereby discharges into the sea with large pollutant loads are not excluded from this analysis and the option of changing a discharge s destination instead of a river directly into the sea cannot be proposed in order to reduce the value of the gwf the data for the effluents qj and ceffj k are summarised in table 1 and the cmaxk values are presented in table 2 3 results the situation described in the murcia region i present inmany other territories an area with scarce water resources in which wastewater is reused for irrigation but unlike many other areas the extensive network of existing treatment plants many of them directly connected to irrigation communities allows us to pose three scenarios in which different possible gwfs can be discussed depending on if the wastewater is treated and or reused first gwfs are obtained with the concentrations in the wastewater before it reaches the treatment plants influents whose values would be analogous to those in areas where wastewater is not treated second gwfs are assessed using the concentrations in the effluents of the wwtps which are representative of those territories where wastewater is treated but is not directly reused third gwfs are accounted for considering also a direct reuse this is conducted considering the particular characteristics of the murcia region these results provide an idea or an order of magnitude of what the reuse of treated wastewater means for the gwf since reuse diminishes the dispersion into the aquatic environment therefore following these steps the gwf results for pharmaceutical gwfp and conventional gwfc contaminants calculated separately are presented and compared first the values of the gwfp and gwfc are shown for the influents to the wwtps second the values for the effluents are given evaluating the effect of the removal of pollutants by the wwtps on the gwfp and gwfc finally the gwfp and gwfc values of the effluents are presented considering their direct reuse in irrigation 3 1 grey water footprint generated by the main municipalities in murcia region wwtps influents in this section the gwfp and gwfc of the wwtps influents are presented these represent the values that would be generated by the populations in 12 municipalities if there were no purification processes fig 2 a in this case the gwfp has a significant value of 263 106 m3 year 1 the municipalities that contribute most to this value are murcia este 66 5 106 m3 year 1 alcantarilla 58 0 106 m3 year 1 and la hoya 46 2 106 m3 year 1 the results indicate that the critical contaminant is not the same for all municipalities overall cbz is responsible for 65 of the gwfp while dcf and npx have less weight in this global value 25 and 10 respectively meanwhile ktp is not the critical pollutant in any municipality since the volume of fresh water required to dilute this pollutant in each influent is not capable of diluting the other pollutants to their established water quality standards it should be noted that four of the studied municipalities do not generate a gwfp due to the low concentrations of these pharmaceutical pollutants in the analysed wastewaters three are below the detection limits established by the methodology employed in fernández lópez et al 2016 the maximum value of the gwfp per inhabitant is for alcantarilla 1322 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 followed by cieza 1041 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 and san pedro 980 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 with a wide range of variation fig 2b so although murcia este is the municipality that contributes most to the gwfp for the whole area its inhabitants do not contribute the most individually ranking fifth on average each inhabitant generates a gwfp of 301 m3 year 1 comparing the gwfp values with those obtained for conventional pollutants gwfc it can be observed that the former are lower in all the influents studied so the volume of fresh water needed to dilute the conventional pollutants is also able to dilute the pharmaceutical ones and the gwfc would be the gwf generated by these municipalities the gwfc reaches a value of 4124 106 m3 year 1 as a whole for all the municipalities studied organic matter bod5 being the critical conventional pollutant the municipalities that contribute most to the gwpc are murcia este 1063 2 106 m3 year 1 molina norte 696 2 106 m3 year 1 and cabezo beaza 528 5 106 m3 year 1 which are also the ones with the greatest populations fig 3 a and table 1 the analysis by inhabitants indicates that the gwfc varies between 10 642 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in molina norte and 2171 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in calasparra on average each inhabitant generates a gwfc of about 4718 m3 year 1 fig 3b 3 2 grey water footprint of treated effluents wwtps effluents in this section we present the gwf values of the effluents from the wwtps of the 12 municipalities studied as in the previous section the results for the pharmaceutical pollutants are shown first followed by those of the conventional ones subsequently the results are compared and analysed together in this scenario the gwfp diminishes to 194 106 m3 year 1 a 26 decrease due to the action of the wwtps the analysis by municipalities indicates that the murcia este effluent has the highest gwfp 87 2 106 m3 year 1 followed by la hoya 26 8 106 m3 year 1 and alcantarilla 24 3 106 m3 year 1 the removal rates of each pharmaceutical pollutant are different in each wwtp and the pollutant that provides the value of the gwfp in each wwtp effluent has changed now cbz is the only critical pollutant fig 4 a it is noteworthy that although the gwfp decreases as a whole in some municipalities it rises slightly as is the case of murcia este calasparra caravaca de la cruz puerto lumbreras san javier and yecla this increase is due to the fact that some pharmaceuticals are not detectable in wwtps influents due to encapsulation in faeces transformation into other compounds and retransformation after the treatment in the mother substance but they are detected in effluents this is why a low value of gwfp appears now for three municipalities caravaca de cruz san javier and yecla that previously had no value and that together only account for 8 of the gwfp in this scenario when the gwfp is expressed per inhabitant its value and dispersion with respect to untreated wastewater are appreciably reduced the maximum value found in san pedro is 823 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 in average terms a general decrease exists from 301 to 222 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 4b in the case of the conventional pollutants the gwfc decreases by 90 which demonstrates the effectiveness of the wwtps in eliminating this kind of pollutant the value of the gwfc for all wwtps as a whole is reduced to 411 106 m3 year 1 murcia este continues to contribute the most to this value of gwfc being responsible for more than half 52 the reduction of the gwfc was greatest for molina norte 98 and smallest for san pedro 83 fig 5 a in the effluents bod5 ceases to be the critical pollutant now tp is responsible for 80 of the gwfc and tn for 20 per inhabitant the values vary between 164 m3 year 1 caravaca de la cruz and 839 m3 year 1 alcantarilla the average being 470 m3 year 1 fig 5b although the global value of the gwfc is double that of the gwfp 411 106 m3 year 1 versus 194 106 m3 year 1 there are three wwtps where the value of the gwfp is greater than that of the gwfc san pedro puerto lumbreras and calasparra this is because cbz appears or its concentration increases in the effluents of these wwtps exacerbating the value of the gwfp while the gwfc values are significantly reduced so the fresh water volume required to dilute the cbz in these three wwtps is capable of diluting all the pollutants analysed in this treated wastewater dcf npx ktp tp tn and bod5 even the conventional pollutants therefore the final value of the gwf of the treated effluents is due to both conventional tp and tn and pharmaceutical pollutants cbz see fig 6 a reaching the value of 420 106 m3 year 1 a little higher than the 411 106 m3 year 1 obtained with only conventional pollutants similarly the value per capita rises slightly to 480 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 6b 3 3 grey water footprint in the murcia region in the murcia region as has been pointed out previously almost all the wastewaters are treated these treated volumes are discharged into natural streams infiltrate into aquifers are sent into the sea or are directly reused for the latter case there are legal concessions for the reuse by irrigation communities chs 2016 among the 12 wwtps studied nine send their effluents to direct reuse in irrigation preventing the majority of their pollutants from reaching water bodies assuming that their degradation accumulation in soil or accumulation in crops do not generate a gwf for that reason as the pollutant load that would reach the water bodies is small these nine effluents were not considered for the calculation of the gwf of the murcia region and only the effluents of the three wwtps that discharge directly into a water body including the one that releases into the sea were taken into account calasparra murcia este and san pedro consequently evaluating the gwf jointly for pharmaceutical and conventional pollutants the three treatment plants that discharge into the environment generate a gwf of 237 106 m3 year 1 this supposes a reduction of 43 6 with respect to the value previously obtained after wastewater treatment 420 106 m3 year 1 the critical pollutant in calasparra and san pedro is cbz representing 10 of the total gwf while in murcia este it is tp fig 6a representing the remaining 90 if the gwf taking into account the wwtps and reuse 237 106 m3 year 1 is extrapolated to the entire murcia region the gwf increases to 339 106 m3 year 1 gwfp and gwfc which represents a value of 271 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 4 discussion regarding the three scenarios evaluated the first reveals how in areas where no purification processes are employed the gwf can reach values of around 4718 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 3b due to conventional pollutants organic matter this value indicates the fresh water per capita that would be necessary to reduce the pollutants in the wastewater effluents to acceptable levels so in areas with water stress falkenmark et al 1989 in which the fresh water available is less than 1000 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 it would not be possible to dilute these pollutants this indicates that in these territories there is no practical option other than to reuse wastewater directly with the consequent health problems that this can involve the second scenario representative of areas where treated wastewaters are not directly reused demonstrates that the wwtps are very effective at eliminating conventional pollutants especially organic matter reducing the gwfc by around 90 the pharmaceuticals are removed partially reducing the gwfp to a lesser extent around 26 therefore in this case it is likely that the gwf no longer depends on just the organic matter since the wwtps are very efficient at removing this contaminant other partially eliminated pollutants would become critical for example nitrate phosphates and some emerging pollutants could also be critical such as cbz consequently part of the gwf of an area with wwtps may be due to non conventional pollutants such as pharmaceuticals despite the significant reduction of the gwf effected by the wwtps the treated wastewater discharged into natural streams continues to generate an important gwf that reaches values around 480 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 fig 6b although this is not as serious as in areas without wwtps above all in areas with plentiful water resources it is not a negligible value for example and as a comparison the united nations un 2010 proposes a value between 50 and 100 l of fresh water per inhabitant and day for domestic use to ensure that basic needs are met and health is assured this represents 18 3 36 5 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 so domestic pollution even if there is an efficient system of purification requires a much greater volume of fresh water to ensure the assimilation of the rest of the pollutants by the environment than domestic water consumption itself the third scenario reveals that in territories with wwtps the option of reusing their effluents can reduce the gwf significantly although this reduction depends on the reuse rates of each territory for the case of the present study it implies a decrease from 480 to 271 m3 inhabitant 1 year 1 on average this example value while still high could be inferior if the wwtp technology improved or the direct reuse ratio increased focusing now on direct reuse it has been indicated previously that the treated effluents do not generate a gwf if they are used directly in irrigation the conventional pollutants studied organic matter nitrate and phosphates would not generate an impact on the water environment since they are degraded in the soil or consumed by the crops in fact nitrate and phosphates are necessary for crops so if their concentrations in the soil are lower than the needs of the crops as is usual fertilisers are added to increase them similarly pharmaceutical pollutants in treated wastewaters tend to accumulate in soil and crops carter et al 2014 preventing many of them from reaching the aquatic environment however even if we assume that no pharmaceuticals reach any body of water they may have negative impacts on crops in this sense the accumulation of pharmaceutical compounds in edible agricultural products has been confirmed prosser and sibley 2015 carter et al 2014 so regarding reuse pharmaceutical pollutants are more harmful than conventional ones therefore the concept of the gwf can be adapted or extrapolated to the field of reuse in general in this sense and in irrigation reuse the gwf can be used to determine the volume of water with which it is necessary to dilute a certain effluent so that it can be used safely but it is important to highlight that previous to this maximum concentrations for certain types of crops must be established for each pollutant due to the possibility of bioaccumulation or effects on crop survival for this case assuming that the maximum concentrations employed for the pnec criterion were similar to those that could be established in future legislation the gwf due to pharmaceutical contaminants gwfp in wwtp effluents that are reused in irrigation would not be zero consequently the gwf could be composed of two different values one would be due to treated wastewater that goes to natural streamflows 3 wwtps 237 106 m3 year 1 and another would arise when treated wastewater is reused in irrigation due to pharmaceutical pollutants 9 wwtps 82 4 106 m3 year 1 so in this scenario the gwf would increase slightly from 237 106 m3 year 1 to 319 106 m3 year 1 extrapolating these values to the murcia region produces a change from 338 106 m3 year 1 to 456 106 m3 year 1 an increase of 118 106 m3 year 1 due to the pharmaceutical pollutants in the treated wastewater that is reused although this increase is not very high and the concept of the gwf is being slightly altered it shows the order of magnitude of the quantity of uncontaminated fresh water with which it is necessary to mix the pollutant load to reduce its concentration to the quality standards established so if the treated wastewater has a volume of 38 6 106 m3 year 1 to achieve the designated dilution it is necessary to mix this volume with an additional volume of fresh water of 79 4 106 m3 year 1 to reach the indicated volume of 118 106 m3 year 1 so for this particular case and according to the previously established criteria it would be necessary on average to mix one volume of treated wastewater with two volumes of fresh water from another source without pharmaceutical pollutants transfer underground surface or desalinised water although the load of contaminants is not eliminated the dilution at least reduces their concentrations and thus the risk and concern related to the use of this water for irrigation regarding the case of the murcia region the levels of dilution that are currently being used are higher than those indicated here being of the order of two or 10 fresh water to one treated wastewater therefore according to this study the pharmaceutical compounds studied here should not pose a risk in the food chain when the treated wastewater is used in this way in irrigation 5 conclusions in this work gwf accounting for pharmaceutical pollutants gwfp was carried out in the murcia region in the influents of the wwtps among the four pharmaceutical compounds studied cbz dcf and npx were the critical pollutants whereas ktp was not found to be responsible for the gwfp nevertheless the gwfp was low when compared to the gwf produced by conventional pollutants gwfc the great differences between the gwfp and gwfc suggest that although water quality standards can vary between different legislations conventional pollutants will also be critical in other geographic areas without wwtps the wwtps have been shown to be very efficient for the conventional pollutants while the pharmaceuticals are removed partially the effect of the removal of the contaminants is transferred directly to both values gwfp and gwfc nevertheless the results indicate that achieving a gwfp or gwfc equal to zero is not a simple task since all the wwtps studied have tertiary treatment to do this the purification rates of the wwtps should be increased to values close to 100 a fourth treatment step such as osmosis activated carbon or ozone filtration being necessary however this aim could be achieved through reuse thus saving important economic resources and encouraging a circular economy the only drawback is that the pollutant concentrations of the effluents must be decreased to acceptable ranges for this secondary use otherwise as can be observed in the example presented here pharmaceutical pollutants could be a limiting factor in these cases an alternative that avoids increasing the purification costs and allows water reuse to continue is the mixture of waters from different origins this is a habitual practice in zones of water scarcity but with connectivity of waters to this end the gwf concept is an indicator that can be used to determine the volume of fresh water that needs to be added to an effluent to reduce its levels of pollutants to a specific concentration so the gwf in addition to raising awareness of the effects of pollution on the environment also shows the dilution of treated wastewater that is necessary to allow its safe reuse in another economic activity acknowledgements this work

19684,the performance of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater under different cross flow velocities cfv was investigated effects of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss colloid total organic carbon toc and cfv on membrane fouling rate r mf were also explored in this paper throughout 341 days of experiment the average total removal rate of n n dimethylformamide dmf was 98 5 which hardly affected by the variation of cfv and the compliance rate of dmf was 92 according to the chinese standard 25 mg l however the relevant high total removal rate of m cresol mc was achieved as 97 5 the content of effluent failed to meet the national level emission standard 0 1 mg l the biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually with the increase of cfv and the average methane content were over 70 there were four kinds of methanogens in anmbr methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community with an area of 45 70 of the archae there was a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf at different mlss concentrations then a universal mathematical model for the changes of r mf with influence factors was established the result showed that model well fitted the laboratory data it is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and manage the membrane fouling of anmbr treating antibiotic solvent wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords n n dimethylformamide dmf m cresol mc biogas yield methanogenic community membrane fouling rate r mf mathematical model 1 introduction in the last few decades the pharmaceutical industry greatly developed due to enormous demands of life saving drugs most of the drugs are manufactured through chemical synthesis techniques that involve a series of complex chemical reactions the chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents chen et al 2008 ng et al 2015 therefore pharmaceutical wastewater emissions continue to increase with the rapid development it is estimated that approximately half of the pharmaceutical wastewaters produced worldwide are discharged without specific treatment lang et al 2005 enick and moore 2007 gadipelly et al 2014 antibiotics solvent wastewater is one of the most representative pharmaceutical wastewater and has become a serious source of water pollution kaya et al 2017 in antibiotics solvent wastewater there are some difficult treated chemical reagents such as n n dimethylformamide dmf and m cresol mc dmf is a widely used organic solvent in chemical pharmaceutical and textile industries grosjean et al 2010 cheng et al 2015 dmf is also known to have adverse impacts on the environment and the health yan et al 2002 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 it will cause liver toxicities alcohol intolerance possible embryo toxicity and teratogenicity kumar et al 2012 in addition several mc are used as dyestuffs in pharmaceutical products as chemical reagents and elsewhere kim and sang 2011 mc has toxic effects on the central nervous system chen et al 2016a b and has a strong stimulating and corrosive effect on the skin mucous membrane causing multiple organ damage wherefore if inhaled contacted or ingested these compounds are toxic to human beings and animals even at low concentrations some pharmaceutical active compounds have been added to the priority pollutant list of the european union water framework directive in 2014 therefore there is a great significance to effectively remove the dmf and mc in antibiotic wastewater and achieve emission standards and it is an urgent environmental problem karthikeyan et al 2012 in recent years some literature showed that anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has received considerable attention because of the advantages of improving the biodegradability of organic pollutants in wastewater meeting the discharge standards of high concentration organic wastewater and low energy consumption chelliapan et al 2011 ramos et al 2014 pretel et al 2015 in the study of how yong ng group ng et al 2015 they investigated thoroughly about the performance and microbial communities of an anmbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater whereas without the operating parameter of membrane such as cross flow velocity cfv the high shear is a significant operating parameter for membrane fouling and anmbr reactor padmasiri 2007 the shear is defined as cfv m s in this study which is equal to the flow rate m3 s on the surface of membrane assembly divided by the membrane cross sectional area m2 although rong wang et al studied membrane fouling under different cfvs arkhangelsky et al 2012 but the interaction of mlss cfv and colloid toc were not studied vickichen et al did some model studies on membrane filtration performance and the influence of cross flow velocity on cross flow sampler modified fouling index ultrafiltration sim et al 2011 wu et al 2008 to investigate membrane fouling mechanisms but with no actual wastewater treatment process especially the pharmaceutical wastewater therefore in order to have more practical engineering significance antibiotic solvent wastewater was treated by a pilot scale anmbr process system which was a combination of membrane separation and anaerobic processes in our earlier paper the cod and volatile fatty acids mlss mlvss and etc have been reported in anmbr treating antibiotic solvent wastewaterunder high cfv hu et al 2017 a high average of total cod removal as 96 5 was obtained in order to further analysis the dmf and mc removal the variation of biogas yield and methane content methanogenic community the effect of mlss cfv and colloid toc on membrane fouling rate r mf were investigated and a universal mathematical model for the variation of r mf with influence factors was established and verificated in this paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus of anmbr a schematic diagram of the pilot scale anaerobic process was designed by ourselves in this work as shown in fig 1 the system was consisted of internal circulation ic and membrane module two parts the detailed parameters of the ic system in this work were as height 2 5 m internal diameter 1 5 m and providing a working volume of approximately 4 4 m3 respectively the membrane module was hollow fiber curtain membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with membrane area of 20 m2 with 0 9 mm inner diameter and 1 5 mm outer diameter and a pore size of 0 22 μm the mwco was 67000 da and new pure water membrane flux was 50 l m2 h the outline dimension s 1 5 m 0 65 m 0 759 m2 the maximum operating temperature of this membrane module was 40 c the range of ph was 2 10 and the designed membrane flux critical flux was 20 l m2 h the critical flux was determined by using flux step method during the operation and monitoring the corresponding tmp changes ognier et al 2002 mahmoud and liao 2017 tmp increased linearly when the applied permeate flux was below the critical flux value the upper limit of the critical flux was considered as the point at which the flux tmp relationship became non linear above the critical flux value the linear relationship was no longer applicable due to particle deposition and cake layer the lower limit of the critical flux was taken as the flux in the previous step critical flux was obtained by averaging two permeate flux values the lower and upper limits each critical flux measurement was conducted three times the influent was sucked from a tank to heat exchanger by a pump than connected to ic reactor by a flow meter ic system provided a three phase separator for separating biological gas wastewater and sludge the biological gas entered the gas cabinet from the top of the reactor the sludge settled down to the bottom of the reactor under gravity finally the treated wastewater flowed from the membrane module completing the whole process in addition ph and temperature of the ic reactor were detected by an online control system 2 2 wastewater sources and acclimation of anaerobic sludge in this study the experimental wastewater was artificially formulated to simulate antibiotic solvent wastewater which contained characteristic pollutants dmf and mc dmf is an organic compound with the formula ch3 2nc o h the molar mass is 73 10 g mol with a cas number 68 12 2 it is a derivative of formamide the amide of formic acid dmf is a polar hydrophilic aprotic solvent with a high boiling point this colourless liquid is miscible with water and the majority of organic liquids mc is an organic compound with the formula ch3c6h4 oh the molar mass is 108 14 g mol with a cas number 108 39 4 it is a derivative of phenol and is an isomer of p cresol and o cresol also it is a colourless viscous liquid that is used as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals this material is slightly soluble in water and can be soluble in ethanol ether sodium hydroxide solution appropriate amount of glucose buffer nutrient and trace elements were added in the wastewater forming the glucose and antibiotic solvent mixed wastewater in this experiment the anaerobic sludge cultivation of anmbr reactor was carried out by simultaneous method the specific water quality indicators were shown in table 1 as the experiment progresses the concentration of glucose was reduced gradually meanwhile adding the appropriate concentration of antibiotic solvent with the microbial culture and induction so that the wastewater to be treated could meet the quality of microorganisms to grow and develop and then improved the sludge activity up to a certain concentration of sludge and achieve the domestication of anaerobic sludge according to lettinga s experience vallero et al 2005 the inoculation amount of the medium temperature anaerobic reactor is 12 15 kgmlvss m3 which was more favorable for the initial start of anmbr the concentration of inoculum sludge in this experiment was 16 5 g mlss l 12 4 g mlvss l mlvss mlss was 75 2 the detailed characteristics of inoculum anaerobic sludge were shown in table s1 2 3 operating conditions the start up of anmbr according to the characteristics of antibiotic dissolvent wastewater this experiment started with constant hrt and gradually increased cod concentration the operational conditions of the start up in anmbr were shown in table s2 the anmbr was operated continuously throughout 341 days the cfv gradient were set as 0 7 0 1 m s day 1 91 normal operation stage 1 5 0 1 m s day 96 186 rate increasing stage 2 1 0 1 m s day 191 281 deterioration stage and 1 5 0 1 m s day 286 341 recovery stage four stages which were the stages for researching the performance of anmbr reactor in order to separate the influences of the cfv variation on anmbr system performance from other influences factors hydraulic retention time hrt temperature ph and tmp transmembrane pressure were controlled at approximately constant the optimum influent dmf and mc concentration optimum hrt and other specific parameters were set up in table 2 2 4 analysis techniques in this study mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss was

2003 to allow coverage of the majority of the known groups of methanogens and to target individual groups of methanogens 3 results and discussion 3 1 dmf removal it could be seen from fig 2 and table 3 that the influent dmf concentration was between 657 mg l and 1981 mg l the average dmf physical removal rates were 10 7 3 7 10 7 3 7 10 1 2 6 and 8 5 1 7 and the average dmf biological removal rates were 87 6 3 8 87 6 3 7 88 6 2 5 and 90 3 1 6 during four stages respectively fig 2c the permeate dmf and total dmf removal rate were 20 6 m l and 98 5 respectively although the total removal rate was similar the difference between biological treatment and physical treatment indicated that most of the pollutants could be degraded in the anaerobic reactor probably due to the low molecular weight and hydrophilicity of dmf which increased biodegradation and reduced the adsorption of the sludge on membrane surface chen et al 2015 there were also some studies on dmf removal by bioremediation xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 besides it could be said that dmf removal rate was little affected by the variation of cfv regardless of the value of cfv 0 7 2 1 m s in addition the supernatant dmf fluctuated obviously with an average value of 159 8 mg l during four stages and it was slightly higher than the permeate dmf fig 2b which indicated that the interception of the membrane was fundamental to ensure the permeate quality in shu fen cheng s study the trace amounts of antibiotics could be removed effectively by a membrane biological reactor system treatment process cheng et al 2015 during the operation the volume loading rate vlr of dmf changed little corresponding the average vlr of dmf was 0 71 kgdmf m3 d however with the variation of cfv the average sludge loading rate slr of dmf had a little fluctuated and the average slr was 0 024 kgdmf kgmlvss d fig 2d 3 2 mc removal it could be seen from fig 3 and table 3 that the influent in four stages were characterized by highly varying mc concentrations 225 1307 mg l average 781 6 mg l corresponded to high vlr of mc 0 11 0 65 kg m3 d average 0 39 kg m3 d the average permeate mc concentrations in four stages were 16 mg l 17 1 mg l 18 1 mg l 17 mg l it was worth noting that the average supernatant mc was 87 6 more than the permeate mc during four stages the mc biological removal rates were 89 3 2 0 82 6 3 2 69 1 7 9 and 83 4 4 4 respectively the changes of mc biological removal rate under different cfvs indicated that the microbial activity was affected by cfv which was mentioned in previous research cho and fane 2002 and the increase of cfv contributed to the reduction of mc biological removal rate interestingly mc physical removal rate increased with the increase of cfv the average mc physical removal rate was 8 8 2 2 15 2 3 2 27 1 6 7 and 14 4 4 5 respectively fig 3c some articles pointed out that high cfv had a positive effect on fouling reduction dreszer et al 2014 turning into the reason of improving physical removal rate at elevated cfv as a result the average total removal rate of mc had been maintained at a high level with 98 1 97 8 96 3 and 97 8 at each stage fig 3d through the analysis of the removal rate of dmf and mc it could be found that the overall biological removal rate of dmf was greater than mc while the physical removal rate of mc was larger than dmf this phenomenon probably happened due to the hydrophilic of dmf and hydrophobic of mc making the octanol water partition coefficient of mc was larger and easier to be adsorbed rather than being biodegradable there was a reference indicating that the octanol water partition coefficient of dmf was 1 01 which cannot be transferred to sediments or biota xiao et al 2016 meaning that it was difficult to adsorb on the membrane surface as a result the average physical removal rate of mc was 16 6 a little greater than 10 1 of dmf beides anaerobic reactor preferentially start hydrosis reaction first shi et al 2017 mc needs to be hydrolyzed in an anaerobic reactor before being acidified because it has large molecular weights and contain more carbon atoms compared with dmf instead of the direct acidification dmf which is one of the reasons leading to higher rates of biological removal of dmf there are many factors that affect the result in the actual wastewater treatment process and more research is needed to explain it 3 3 evaluation of anmbr performance it is a difficult challenge to make the removal of characteristic pollutants in antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater reach the discharge standard all the time as many influencing factors changes of operation conditions fluctuation of water and failure operation of equipment will result in instability of the system corresponding that the characteristics of pollutant concentration fluctuated irregularly therefore the performance of anmbr treating antibiotic wastewater is not only through the removal of pollutants but also could investigate the stability of the reactor operation the compliance rates level below discharge and value below discharge standard were introduced to assess the performance of a comprehensive reactor run the compliance rate value below discharge standard and level below discharge standard were defined as follows 1 compliance rate d com d tot 2 value below discharge standard c odserved c standard 3 level below discharge standard c observed c standard c standard 100 where d com represents the dates which the meet the discharge standard d tot is the total dates which worked c observed represents the observed pollutant concentration c standard represents the discharge standard the united states had identified that dmf as a possible carcinogen for human the former soviet union stipulated that the highest allowable mass concentration of dmf in sewage was 10 mg l and the recommended maximum allowable mass concentration of surface water was 25 mg l in china lei and zhu 2012 as shown in fig 4 during the operation of experiment the compliance rate of dmf was 92 according to the dmf standard 25 mg l in chain which demonstrated that in the most of time the permeate qualitiy could meet the standard and the anmbr had well system stability the average values below discharge standard of dmf at four stages were 11 1 22 3 15 2 and 23 9 mg dmf l 1 average levels below discharge standard of dmf were 2 8 5 6 3 8 and 6 respectively fig 4b the results illuminated that the running of anmbr system was the most stable when cfv 1 5 0 1 m s and the probability of permeate quality which higher than the emission standard was maximum it could be seen as fig 5 a the average concentration of permeate mc was 17 1 mg l throughout 341 days the value below average permeate and the level below average permeate were 0 09 mg mc l 1 and 0 54 respectively according to the national level emission standard gb 19918 2002 mc 0 1 mg l showed that the concentrations of permeate mc was far from to meet the strict standard although according to the influent mc the high removal rate of mc was obtained under high cfv in anmbr system other methods for further treatment must be needed to achieve the emission standards 3 4 biogas yield and methane content the ratio biogas yield in this study was calculated by two methods one was that the ratio biogas yield l g codaera was calculated according to cod removal and another was that the ratio biogas yield l gmlvss d was calculated according to mlvss it could be seen from fig 6 that little changes of ratio biogas yield based on cod and ratio biogas yield based on mlvss were occurred under different cfv conditions indicating that these indicators were less affected by cfv during the four stages the ratio of biogas yield based on cod were 0 17 0 20 0 22 and 0 18 l gcodaera respectively the ratio of biogas yield based on mlvss were 0 033 0 023 0 023 and 0 021 l gmlvss d muller muller et al 2007 also found that the higher shear velocity in laboratory scale and productive scale anaerobic reactors had no effect on ratio of biogas yield in the system one major factor that made anaerobic treatment preferable to aerobic treatment was methane gas production ng et al 2015 however with the increase of cfv the biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually the average of biogas yield under the cfv 0 7 0 1 m s 1 5 0 1 m s 2 1 0 1 m s 1 5 0 1 m s were 73 5 67 1 76 1 and 65 6 l d corresponding that the average of methane content in the biogas were 73 2 3 76 8 1 9 79 4 1 9 and 74 3 1 6 respectively the highest biogas yield was obtainted as 176 9 l d on day 266 and the highest methane content of the biogas was 82 8 on day 221 this was attributed to the greater availability of organic matter to the relevant microorganisms for gas production with the increasing of cfv ng ng et al 2015 reported that the biogas and methane content increased with the increased of pharmaceutical wastewater influent in anmbr for treating pharmaceutical wastewater however cetecioglu cetecioglu et al 2015 reported a different result a lower methane content as 64 2 4 7 moreover the methane content of biogas was stable during the study according to the experience the methane content in biogas generally accounts for 50 70 of the total volume the biogas yield rate of high concentration organic wastewater would be closed to the theoretical value in the actual anaerobic digestion process in this work the average methane content in biogas were over 70 indicating that the digestive reaction in the anmbr system was carried out thoroughly the similar results also were reported by other researchers for example karim karim et al 2005 showed that the mixed reactors could produce more biogas ng et al 2015 showed that nearly 60 70 of methane was present in the biogas produced during the steady state condition in both anmbr 3 5 methanogenic community fig 7 illustrated the methanogenic groups to explain the different performances of characteristic pollutants dmf and mc removal and biogas production observed in the anmbr as shown in fig 7 there were four kinds of methanogens in anmbr namely methanosaetaceae acetic acid as substrate and grow in low acetic acid concentration methanosarcinaceae acetic acid hydrogen and organic matter as substrate and grow in high acetic acid concentration methanobacteriales hydrogen as substrate methanomicrobiales hydrogen as substrate according to the anaerobic basic principle methanogenic bacteria could only use some simple organic matter formic acid methanol methylamine acetic acid h2 co2 etc as substrate since both dmf and mc were compounds of more than two carbons they could only be converted to simple organics before utilized by methanogens dmf and mc firstly went through the hydrolysis acidification stage and were transformed into transformed into vfa alcohols co2 and h2 ammonium acetate methylamine nh3 and so on this agreeed with previous studies that the ncho bond in dmf was decomposed to form formic acid and dimethylamine which would be further oxidized grosjean et al 2010 al duri et al 2008 then formic acid propionic acid butyric acid ect vfa were converted into acetic acid and h2 co2 finally methanogenic bacteria utilize acetic acid and h2 and co2 to produce ch4 it was generally believed that about 70 of the ch4 produced during anaerobic biological treatment was produced from the decomposition of acetic acid and the rest from h2 and co2 chen et al 2016a b mccarty and smith 1986 anaerobic microbiological studies had shown that methanogenic bacteria was a very special group of archaebacteria methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community with an area of 45 70 of the archaea and other populations were less than 20 during most operation time of the anmbr reactor patel and sprott 1990 explained that the cells of methanosaeta were obligately anaerobic gram negative and non spore forming rod with flat ends and required acetic acid as the sole source of energy with the production of equimolar amounts of ch4 and co2 as the metabolic end products the methanosaeta was the most dominating archaea in the anaerobic process as well as reported by chelliapan and li et al chelliapan et al 2011 li et al 2015 with the increase of cfv the population dynamics were affected by short term and methanosaeta spp decreased methanosarcinales spp increased with the increase of cfv and acetic acid concentration and decreased gradually after cfv and acetic acid concentration decreasing during the period of stage 1 the number of methanosarcina spp was relatively less the average relative abundance was 13 which was due to the lower concentration of acetate methanosarcina was the well known methanogen which could use more than one substrate acetate h2 co2 methanol methylamines and co to produce methane yu et al 2014 on the contrary methanosaeta spp could grow in lower acetate concentration and had a higher affinity for lower acetic acid therefore it had a large amount of growth ng et al reported the relative abundance of methanosaeta was 43 4 and identified as the dominant methanogens in the c anmbr reactor for treating pharmaceutical wastewater ng et al 2015 with the increase of cfv and acetic acid concentration stage 2 and stage 3 the number of methanosarcina spp increased gradually the relative abundance was 36 1 and the methanosaeta spp decreased gradually 31 9 which was due to the higher acetate concentration and both of them were the dominant methanogens in anmbr reactor during the stage 4 with the decrease of cfv and acetic acid concentration the number of methanosaeta spp increased gradually and became the dominant methanogens while the number of methanosarcina spp decreased gradually this result confirmed that the high cfv condition was beneficial for methanosarcina spp to grow from stage 1 to stage 4 the two kinds of methanogens which used hydrogen as substrate methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales maintained a lower concentration in the anmbr which might be due to the recalcitrant and toxic compounds in the pharmaceutical wastewater in summary the results showed that changes in the methanogenic community varied with cfv and acetic acid concentration changes according to the degradation process of dmf and mc it was reasonable to correspond to the conclusion that the biogas yield was large and the methane content was more than 70 in this study with the gradual increase of cfv the methanogenic activity in anmbr also increased which made dmf and mc well degraded 3 6 effect of mlss cfv and colloid toc on membrane fouling rate it could be seen in fig 8 a the concentration of mlss had a great influence on r mf when cfv 0 1 m s when mlss was 40 g l the r mf was almost 3 7 times that of mlss 15 g l the mlss had been identified that could affect the fouling process strongly defrance et al 2000 wu et al 2006 h haradastudied the anmbr and found that the reactors operated with four different concentrations of activated sludge at 1 5 10 and 20 g l respectively the same result was obtained which accelerated the r mf with the sludge concentration increased harada et al 1994 when cfv 0 7 m s the r mf increased slightly with the increase of mlss concentration but the increase rate was not significant when cfv 1 5 m s the r mf under different mlss was almost unchanged indicating that mlss had little effect with r mf under this cfv condition when cfv 2 1 m s the r mf decreased with the increase of mlss the above variations showed that under the condition of higher cfv mlss was no longer the main factor affecting membrane fouling mlss were generally much larger than the membrane pores and therefore cannot enter the pores resulting in the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface the cake layer was usually loosely bound so it could be rinsed off easily wu et al 2008 yang yang et al 2011 studied the effect of pulse shear stress for anmbr fouling control and showed that increasing cfv was an effective strategy to control membrane fouling the effect of cfv on r mf was shown in fig 8b when the cfv was from 0 1 m s to 0 7 m s the r mf descreased obviously under different mlss and colloid toc conditions and mlss had a great effect on r mf the higher the concentration of mlss was the more obvious decrease of r mf was obtained with the increase of cfv 0 7 m s the effect of mlss on membrane fouling becomed no longer important and colloid toc becomed the main pollutant to limit the r mf besides ho et al ho and sung 2009 reported that increasing cfv would break the sludge flocs produce smaller flocs particle size and had a negative impact on membrane fouling whereas lower cfv was not conducive to slowing membrane fouling and not sufficient to prevent the long term accumulation of particles on the membrane surface dereli et al 2015 in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding the different mechanisms of pollution mentioned above this study further investigated the influence of colloid toc cfv conditions and their relative relationship on membrane fouling as can be seen from fig 8 c f there was a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf at different mlss concentrations generally the higher mlss concentration and colloid toc were the higher r mf was the reason was that the residual particles were retained by diffusion convection when the cfv was 0 1 m s the colloidal material interacts with the sludge particles to greatly stimulate the r mf colloids were fine particles in an approximate size range of 1 1000 nm in aqueous solutions natural organic matter usually bonded together to form colloidal aggregates of tens or hundreds of nanometers in size lin et al 2014 lin researched the mechanism of organic colloid on membrane fouling the conclusion was that organic colloid attached to the surface of the membrane caused membrane fouling which was consistent with our view in the process of the cake formation the colloidal material would enter the filter cake pore plug the pore size or be adsorbed into the membrane pore size which would lead to a reduction of the pore size of the membrane and form a sludge filter cake with lower porosity the greater concentration of colloidal particles was the greater cake resistance was as shown in fig 8 c e the r mf increased with the increase of colloid toc under the condition which cfv was 0 1 1 5 m s and the same mlss conditions was used such as cfv 0 1 m s when mlss was 40 g l and 15 g l the r mf varied with colloid toc and the slope k was 9 13 and 0 18 respectively which increased about 50 7 times this result showed a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf however when cfv 2 1 m s the r mf increased with the increasing of colloid toc but different mlss no longer affected the slope of its increase fig 8f a much higher effect of mlss on r mf occurred under conditions of greater mlss concentration and or less colloid toc in contrast the fouling concentration was high for example when cfv 0 7 m s mlss 30 0 g l as shown in fig 8d the minor effect of colloid toc on r mf seemed contradictory to the result mentioned above which suggested that the colloids exerted a strong influence on r mf this could be explained by the fact that the influence of colloid toc on r mf was mainly caused by the interactions between colloid toc and mlss particles fan 2006 3 7 a universal mathematical model for the changes of membrane fouling rate with influence factors the mathematical model of membrane fouling rate with colloid toc under different mlss and cfv could be obtained through the linear regression of data in fig 8 c f the relationships between r mf and colloid toc c toc

5335 0 5581 in this study two regressions were conducted when cfv was 0 1 m s 0 7 m s 1 5 m s and 2 1 m s the first regression of the coefficients k 1 and k 2 was carried out the exponential equation and the quadratic polynomial were chosen respectively as shown in figs 9 and 10 therefore the following 4 equations were obtained 10 r m f τ m s v 0 1 m s 0 010 e 0 15 c s l u g e c t o c 0 18 c s l u

orthogonal test was done further according to the above values of mlss cfv and colloid toc the validated values of mlss were18 26 and 34 g l cfv were 0 4 1 1 and 1 7 m s colloid toc were 15 45 and 75 mg l respectively the specific orthogonal test design was shown as table 4 as shown in fig 11 the predicted r mf and the actual r mf by experimentally measured were obtained from the 9 orthogonal tests by equation 11 the r mf of the seventh experiment was higher fig 11 a the reason was that the concentration of sludge mlss and colloid toc were higher in the orthogonal test this result was consistent with the higher mlss concentration and colloid toc was and higher r mf was it could be seen from fig 11b there were few differences between the residual of perdicted and actual membrane fouling rate the relatively higher residuals were obtained at the second third and seventh experiments in virtue of the unavoidable operational errors and uncontrollable conditions in the experiment the above two results all confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the general mathematical model of the relationship between r mf and mlss cfv and colloid toc 4 conclusions a long term study examined the effects of cfv on performance and membrane fouling rate of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater the conclusions were summarized as follows the cfv had a significant influence on the operation efficiency of anmbr with the increase of cfv the total removal rate of dmf and mc maintained a high level with little change while the physical removal rate of mc decreased with the increase of cfv and the tendency of biological removal rate was opposite the octanol water partition coefficient of mc was larger and easier to be adsorbed rather than being biodegradable compared with dmf due to the hydrophilic of dmf and hydrophobic of mc the compliance rate of dmf was 92 after treatment which well meets the emission standards but mc needed a further treatment with the increase of cfv the biogas yield and the methane content increased gradually methanosarcina spp and methanosaeta spp were the dominant methanogens in anmbr which played an important role of biogas yield and the degradation of dmf and mc mlss cfv and colloid toc had a great effect on r mf mlss was the main factor of r mf when cfv was 0 1 m s and colloid toc was the main factor of r mf when cfv was above 0 7 m s totally r mf decreased with the increase of cfv the high order non linear mathematical model of the general relationship between the membrane fouling rate and mlss cfv and colloid toc was obtained as r mf 0 033τmsv 0 0054 exp 0 056τmsv 0 16 c sluge c toc 0 08c sluge 2 0 3c sluge 5 6 it is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and

19684,the performance of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater under different cross flow velocities cfv was investigated effects of mixed liquid suspended solids mlss colloid total organic carbon toc and cfv on membrane fouling rate r mf were also explored in this paper throughout 341 days of experiment the average total removal rate of n n dimethylformamide dmf was 98 5 which hardly affected by the variation of cfv and the compliance rate of dmf was 92 according to the chinese standard 25 mg l however the relevant high total removal rate of m cresol mc was achieved as 97 5 the content of effluent failed to meet the national level emission standard 0 1 mg l the biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually with the increase of cfv and the average methane content were over 70 there were four kinds of methanogens in anmbr methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community with an area of 45 70 of the archae there was a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf at different mlss concentrations then a universal mathematical model for the changes of r mf with influence factors was established the result showed that model well fitted the laboratory data it is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and manage the membrane fouling of anmbr treating antibiotic solvent wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords n n dimethylformamide dmf m cresol mc biogas yield methanogenic community membrane fouling rate r mf mathematical model 1 introduction in the last few decades the pharmaceutical industry greatly developed due to enormous demands of life saving drugs most of the drugs are manufactured through chemical synthesis techniques that involve a series of complex chemical reactions the chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater contain a variety of organic and inorganic constituents chen et al 2008 ng et al 2015 therefore pharmaceutical wastewater emissions continue to increase with the rapid development it is estimated that approximately half of the pharmaceutical wastewaters produced worldwide are discharged without specific treatment lang et al 2005 enick and moore 2007 gadipelly et al 2014 antibiotics solvent wastewater is one of the most representative pharmaceutical wastewater and has become a serious source of water pollution kaya et al 2017 in antibiotics solvent wastewater there are some difficult treated chemical reagents such as n n dimethylformamide dmf and m cresol mc dmf is a widely used organic solvent in chemical pharmaceutical and textile industries grosjean et al 2010 cheng et al 2015 dmf is also known to have adverse impacts on the environment and the health yan et al 2002 sanjeevkumar et al 2013 it will cause liver toxicities alcohol intolerance possible embryo toxicity and teratogenicity kumar et al 2012 in addition several mc are used as dyestuffs in pharmaceutical products as chemical reagents and elsewhere kim and sang 2011 mc has toxic effects on the central nervous system chen et al 2016a b and has a strong stimulating and corrosive effect on the skin mucous membrane causing multiple organ damage wherefore if inhaled contacted or ingested these compounds are toxic to human beings and animals even at low concentrations some pharmaceutical active compounds have been added to the priority pollutant list of the european union water framework directive in 2014 therefore there is a great significance to effectively remove the dmf and mc in antibiotic wastewater and achieve emission standards and it is an urgent environmental problem karthikeyan et al 2012 in recent years some literature showed that anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr has received considerable attention because of the advantages of improving the biodegradability of organic pollutants in wastewater meeting the discharge standards of high concentration organic wastewater and low energy consumption chelliapan et al 2011 ramos et al 2014 pretel et al 2015 in the study of how yong ng group ng et al 2015 they investigated thoroughly about the performance and microbial communities of an anmbr treating pharmaceutical wastewater whereas without the operating parameter of membrane such as cross flow velocity cfv the high shear is a significant operating parameter for membrane fouling and anmbr reactor padmasiri 2007 the shear is defined as cfv m s in this study which is equal to the flow rate m3 s on the surface of membrane assembly divided by the membrane cross sectional area m2 although rong wang et al studied membrane fouling under different cfvs arkhangelsky et al 2012 but the interaction of mlss cfv and colloid toc were not studied vickichen et al did some model studies on membrane filtration performance and the influence of cross flow velocity on cross flow sampler modified fouling index ultrafiltration sim et al 2011 wu et al 2008 to investigate membrane fouling mechanisms but with no actual wastewater treatment process especially the pharmaceutical wastewater therefore in order to have more practical engineering significance antibiotic solvent wastewater was treated by a pilot scale anmbr process system which was a combination of membrane separation and anaerobic processes in our earlier paper the cod and volatile fatty acids mlss mlvss and etc have been reported in anmbr treating antibiotic solvent wastewaterunder high cfv hu et al 2017 a high average of total cod removal as 96 5 was obtained in order to further analysis the dmf and mc removal the variation of biogas yield and methane content methanogenic community the effect of mlss cfv and colloid toc on membrane fouling rate r mf were investigated and a universal mathematical model for the variation of r mf with influence factors was established and verificated in this paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus of anmbr a schematic diagram of the pilot scale anaerobic process was designed by ourselves in this work as shown in fig 1 the system was consisted of internal circulation ic and membrane module two parts the detailed parameters of the ic system in this work were as height 2 5 m internal diameter 1 5 m and providing a working volume of approximately 4 4 m3 respectively the membrane module was hollow fiber curtain membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with membrane area of 20 m2 with 0 9 mm inner diameter and 1 5 mm outer diameter and a pore size of 0 22 μm the mwco was 67000 da and new pure water membrane flux was 50 l m2 h the outline dimension s 1 5 m 0 65 m 0 759 m2 the maximum operating temperature of this membrane module was 40 c the range of ph was 2 10 and the designed membrane flux critical flux was 20 l m2 h the critical flux was determined by using flux step method during the operation and monitoring the corresponding tmp changes ognier et al 2002 mahmoud and liao 2017 tmp increased linearly when the applied permeate flux was below the critical flux value the upper limit of the critical flux was considered as the point at which the flux tmp relationship became non linear above the critical flux value the linear relationship was no longer applicable due to particle deposition and cake layer the lower limit of the critical flux was taken as the flux in the previous step critical flux was obtained by averaging two permeate flux values the lower and upper limits each critical flux measurement was conducted three times the influent was sucked from a tank to heat exchanger by a pump than connected to ic reactor by a flow meter ic system provided a three phase separator for separating biological gas wastewater and sludge the biological gas entered the gas cabinet from the top of the reactor the sludge settled down to the bottom of the reactor under gravity finally the treated wastewater flowed from the membrane module completing the whole process in addition ph and temperature of the ic reactor were detected by an online control system 2 2 wastewater sources and acclimation of anaerobic sludge in this study the experimental wastewater was artificially formulated to simulate antibiotic solvent wastewater which contained characteristic pollutants dmf and mc dmf is an organic compound with the formula ch3 2nc o h the molar mass is 73 10 g mol with a cas number 68 12 2 it is a derivative of formamide the amide of formic acid dmf is a polar hydrophilic aprotic solvent with a high boiling point this colourless liquid is miscible with water and the majority of organic liquids mc is an organic compound with the formula ch3c6h4 oh the molar mass is 108 14 g mol with a cas number 108 39 4 it is a derivative of phenol and is an isomer of p cresol and o cresol also it is a colourless viscous liquid that is used as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals this material is slightly soluble in water and can be soluble in ethanol ether sodium hydroxide solution appropriate amount of glucose buffer nutrient and trace elements were added in the wastewater forming the glucose and antibiotic solvent mixed wastewater in this experiment the anaerobic sludge cultivation of anmbr reactor was carried out by simultaneous method the specific water quality indicators were shown in table 1 as the experiment progresses the concentration of glucose was reduced gradually meanwhile adding the appropriate concentration of antibiotic solvent with the microbial culture and induction so that the wastewater to be treated could meet the quality of microorganisms to grow and develop and then improved the sludge activity up to a certain concentration of sludge and achieve the domestication of anaerobic sludge according to lettinga s experience vallero et al 2005 the inoculation amount of the medium temperature anaerobic reactor is 12 15 kgmlvss m3 which was more favorable for the initial start of anmbr the concentration of inoculum sludge in this experiment

2003 to allow coverage of the majority of the known groups of methanogens and to target individual groups of methanogens 3 results and discussion 3 1 dmf removal it could be seen from fig 2 and table 3 that the influent dmf concentration was between 657 mg l and 1981 mg l the average dmf physical removal rates were 10 7 3 7 10 7 3 7 10 1 2 6 and 8 5 1 7 and the average dmf biological removal rates were 87 6 3 8 87 6 3 7 88 6 2 5 and 90 3 1 6 during four stages respectively fig 2c the permeate dmf and total dmf removal rate were 20 6 m l and 98 5 respectively although the total removal rate was similar the difference between biological treatment and physical treatment indicated that most of the pollutants could be degraded in the anaerobic reactor probably due to the low molecular weight and hydrophilicity of dmf which increased biodegradation and reduced the adsorption of the sludge on membrane surface chen et al 2015 there were also some studies on dmf removal by bioremediation xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 besides it could be said that dmf removal rate was little affected by the variation of cfv regardless of the value of cfv 0 7 2 1 m s in addition the supernatant dmf fluctuated obviously with an average value of 159 8 mg l during four stages and it was slightly higher than the permeate dmf fig 2b which indicated that the interception of the membrane was fundamental to ensure the permeate quality in shu fen cheng s study the trace amounts of antibiotics could be removed effectively by a membrane biological reactor system treatment process cheng et al 2015 during the operation the volume loading rate vlr of dmf changed little corresponding the average vlr of dmf was 0 71 kgdmf m3 d however with the variation of cfv the average sludge loading rate slr of dmf had a little fluctuated and the average slr was 0 024 kgdmf kgmlvss d fig 2d 3 2 mc removal it could be seen from fig 3 and table 3 that the influent in four stages were characterized by highly varying mc concentrations 225 1307 mg l average 781 6 mg l corresponded to high vlr of mc 0 11 0 65 kg m3 d average 0 39 kg m3 d the average permeate mc concentrations in four stages were 16 mg l 17 1 mg l 18 1 mg l 17 mg l it was worth noting that the average supernatant mc was 87 6 more than the permeate mc during four stages the mc biological removal rates were 89 3 2 0 82 6 3 2 69 1 7 9 and 83 4 4 4 respectively the changes of mc biological removal rate under different cfvs indicated that the microbial activity was affected by cfv which was mentioned in previous research cho and fane 2002 and the increase of cfv contributed to the reduction of mc biological removal rate interestingly mc physical removal rate increased with the increase of cfv the average mc physical removal rate was 8 8 2 2 15 2 3 2 27 1 6 7 and 14 4 4 5 respectively fig 3c some articles pointed out that high cfv had a positive effect on fouling reduction dreszer et al 2014 turning into the reason of improving physical removal rate at elevated cfv as a result the average total removal rate of mc had been maintained at a high level with 98 1 97 8 96 3 and 97 8 at each stage fig 3d through the analysis of the removal rate of dmf and mc it could be found that the overall biological removal rate of dmf was greater than mc while the physical removal rate of mc was larger than dmf this phenomenon probably happened due to the hydrophilic of dmf and hydrophobic of mc making the octanol water partition coefficient of mc was larger and easier to be adsorbed rather than being biodegradable there was a reference indicating that the octanol water partition coefficient of dmf was 1 01 which cannot be transferred to sediments or biota xiao et al 2016 meaning that it was difficult to adsorb on the membrane surface as a result the average physical removal rate of mc was 16 6 a little greater than 10 1 of dmf beides anaerobic reactor preferentially start hydrosis reaction first shi et al 2017 mc needs to be hydrolyzed in an anaerobic reactor before being acidified because it has large molecular weights and contain more carbon atoms compared with dmf instead of the direct acidification dmf which is one of the reasons leading to higher rates of biological removal of dmf there are many factors that affect the result in the actual wastewater treatment process and more research is needed to explain it 3 3 evaluation of anmbr performance it is a difficult challenge to make the removal of characteristic pollutants in antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater reach the discharge standard all the time as many influencing factors changes of operation conditions fluctuation of water and failure operation of equipment will result in instability of the system corresponding that the characteristics of pollutant concentration fluctuated irregularly therefore the performance of anmbr treating antibiotic wastewater is not only through the removal of pollutants but also could investigate the stability of the reactor operation the compliance rates level below discharge and value below discharge standard were introduced to assess the performance of a comprehensive reactor run the compliance rate value below discharge standard and level below discharge standard were defined as follows 1 compliance rate d com d tot 2 value below discharge standard c odserved c standard 3 level below discharge standard c observed c standard c standard 100 where d com represents the dates which the meet the discharge standard d tot is the total dates which worked c observed represents the observed pollutant concentration c standard represents the discharge standard the united states had identified that dmf as a possible carcinogen for human the former soviet union stipulated that the highest allowable mass concentration of dmf in sewage was 10 mg l and the recommended maximum allowable mass concentration of surface water was 25 mg l in china lei and zhu 2012 as shown in fig 4 during the operation of experiment the compliance rate of dmf was 92 according to the dmf standard 25 mg l in chain which demonstrated that in the most of time the permeate qualitiy could meet the standard and the anmbr had well system stability the average values below discharge standard of dmf at four stages were 11 1 22 3 15 2 and 23 9 mg dmf l 1 average levels below discharge standard of dmf were 2 8 5 6 3 8 and 6 respectively fig 4b the results illuminated that the running of anmbr system was the most stable when cfv 1 5 0 1 m s and the probability of permeate quality which higher than the emission standard was maximum it could be seen as fig 5 a the average concentration of permeate mc was 17 1 mg l throughout 341 days the value below average permeate and the level below average permeate were 0 09 mg mc l 1 and 0 54 respectively according to the national level emission standard gb 19918 2002 mc 0 1 mg l showed that the concentrations of permeate mc was far from to meet the strict standard although according to the influent mc the high removal rate of mc was obtained under high cfv in anmbr system other methods for further treatment must be needed to achieve the emission standards 3 4 biogas yield and methane content the ratio biogas yield in this study was calculated by two methods one was that the ratio biogas yield l g codaera was calculated according to cod removal and another was that the ratio biogas yield l gmlvss d was calculated according to mlvss it could be seen from fig 6 that little changes of ratio biogas yield based on cod and ratio biogas yield based on mlvss were occurred under different cfv conditions indicating that these indicators were less affected by cfv during the four stages the ratio of biogas yield based on cod were 0 17 0 20 0 22 and 0 18 l gcodaera respectively the ratio of biogas yield based on mlvss were 0 033 0 023 0 023 and 0 021 l gmlvss d muller muller et al 2007 also found that the higher shear velocity in laboratory scale and productive scale anaerobic reactors had no effect on ratio of biogas yield in the system one major factor that made anaerobic treatment preferable to aerobic treatment was methane gas production ng et al 2015 however with the increase of cfv the biogas yield and the methane content of the biogas increased gradually the average of biogas yield under the cfv 0 7 0 1 m s 1 5 0 1 m s 2 1 0 1 m s 1 5 0 1 m s were 73 5 67 1 76 1 and 65 6 l d corresponding that the average of methane content in the biogas were 73 2 3 76 8 1 9 79 4 1 9 and 74 3 1 6 respectively the highest biogas yield was obtainted as 176 9 l d on day 266 and the highest methane content of the biogas was 82 8 on day 221 this was attributed to the greater availability of organic matter to the relevant microorganisms for gas production with the increasing of cfv ng ng et al 2015 reported that the biogas and methane content increased with the increased of pharmaceutical wastewater influent in anmbr for treating pharmaceutical wastewater however cetecioglu cetecioglu et al 2015 reported a different result a lower methane content as 64 2 4 7 moreover the methane content of biogas was stable during the study according to the experience the methane content in biogas generally accounts for 50 70 of the total volume the biogas yield rate of high concentration organic wastewater would be closed to the theoretical value in the actual anaerobic digestion process in this work the average methane content in biogas were over 70 indicating that the digestive reaction in the anmbr system was carried out thoroughly the similar results also were reported by other researchers for example karim karim et al 2005 showed that the mixed reactors could produce more biogas ng et al 2015 showed that nearly 60 70 of methane was present in the biogas produced during the steady state condition in both anmbr 3 5 methanogenic community fig 7 illustrated the methanogenic groups to explain the different performances of characteristic pollutants dmf and mc removal and biogas production observed in the anmbr as shown in fig 7 there were four kinds of methanogens in anmbr namely methanosaetaceae acetic acid as substrate and grow in low acetic acid concentration methanosarcinaceae acetic acid hydrogen and organic matter as substrate and grow in high acetic acid concentration methanobacteriales hydrogen as substrate methanomicrobiales hydrogen as substrate according to the anaerobic basic principle methanogenic bacteria could only use some simple organic matter formic acid methanol methylamine acetic acid h2 co2 etc as substrate since both dmf and mc were compounds of more than two carbons they could only be converted to simple organics before utilized by methanogens dmf and mc firstly went through the hydrolysis acidification stage and were transformed into transformed into vfa alcohols co2 and h2 ammonium acetate methylamine nh3 and so on this agreeed with previous studies that the ncho bond in dmf was decomposed to form formic acid and dimethylamine which would be further oxidized grosjean et al 2010 al duri et al 2008 then formic acid propionic acid butyric acid ect vfa were converted into acetic acid and h2 co2 finally methanogenic bacteria utilize acetic acid and h2 and co2 to produce ch4 it was generally believed that about 70 of the ch4 produced during anaerobic biological treatment was produced from the decomposition of acetic acid and the rest from h2 and co2 chen et al 2016a b mccarty and smith 1986 anaerobic microbiological studies had shown that methanogenic bacteria was a very special group of archaebacteria methanosaeta spp was the largest methanogenic community with an area of 45 70 of the archaea and other populations were less than 20 during most operation time of the anmbr reactor patel and sprott 1990 explained that the cells of methanosaeta were obligately anaerobic gram negative and non spore forming rod with flat ends and required acetic acid as the sole source of energy with the production of equimolar amounts of ch4 and co2 as the metabolic end products the methanosaeta was the most dominating archaea in the anaerobic process as well as reported by chelliapan and li et al chelliapan et al 2011 li et al 2015 with the increase of cfv the population dynamics were affected by short term and methanosaeta spp decreased methanosarcinales spp increased with the increase of cfv and acetic acid concentration and decreased gradually after cfv and acetic acid concentration decreasing during the period of stage 1 the number of methanosarcina spp was relatively less the average relative abundance was 13 which was due to the lower concentration of acetate methanosarcina was the well known methanogen which could use more than one substrate acetate h2 co2 methanol methylamines and co to produce methane yu et al 2014 on the contrary methanosaeta spp could grow in lower acetate concentration and had a higher affinity for lower acetic acid therefore it had a large amount of growth ng et al reported the relative abundance of methanosaeta was 43 4 and identified as the dominant methanogens in the c anmbr reactor for treating pharmaceutical wastewater ng et al 2015 with the increase of cfv and acetic acid concentration stage 2 and stage 3 the number of methanosarcina spp increased gradually the relative abundance was 36 1 and the methanosaeta spp decreased gradually 31 9 which was due to the higher acetate concentration and both of them were the dominant methanogens in anmbr reactor during the stage 4 with the decrease of cfv and acetic acid concentration the number of methanosaeta spp increased gradually and became the dominant methanogens while the number of methanosarcina spp decreased gradually this result confirmed that the high cfv condition was beneficial for methanosarcina spp to grow from stage 1 to stage 4 the two kinds of methanogens which used hydrogen as substrate methanobacteriales and methanomicrobiales maintained a lower concentration in the anmbr which might be due to the recalcitrant and toxic compounds in the pharmaceutical wastewater in summary the results showed that changes in the methanogenic community varied with cfv and acetic acid concentration changes according to the degradation process of dmf and mc it was reasonable to correspond to the conclusion that the biogas yield was large and the methane content was more than 70 in this study with the gradual increase of cfv the methanogenic activity in anmbr also increased which made dmf and mc well degraded 3 6 effect of mlss cfv and colloid toc on membrane fouling rate it could be seen in fig 8 a the concentration of mlss had a great influence on r mf when cfv 0 1 m s when mlss was 40 g l the r mf was almost 3 7 times that of mlss 15 g l the mlss had been identified that could affect the fouling process strongly defrance et al 2000 wu et al 2006 h haradastudied the anmbr and found that the reactors operated with four different concentrations of activated sludge at 1 5 10 and 20 g l respectively the same result was obtained which accelerated the r mf with the sludge concentration increased harada et al 1994 when cfv 0 7 m s the r mf increased slightly with the increase of mlss concentration but the increase rate was not significant when cfv 1 5 m s the r mf under different mlss was almost unchanged indicating that mlss had little effect with r mf under this cfv condition when cfv 2 1 m s the r mf decreased with the increase of mlss the above variations showed that under the condition of higher cfv mlss was no longer the main factor affecting membrane fouling mlss were generally much larger than the membrane pores and therefore cannot enter the pores resulting in the formation of a cake layer on the membrane surface the cake layer was usually loosely bound so it could be rinsed off easily wu et al 2008 yang yang et al 2011 studied the effect of pulse shear stress for anmbr fouling control and showed that increasing cfv was an effective strategy to control membrane fouling the effect of cfv on r mf was shown in fig 8b when the cfv was from 0 1 m s to 0 7 m s the r mf descreased obviously under different mlss and colloid toc conditions and mlss had a great effect on r mf the higher the concentration of mlss was the more obvious decrease of r mf was obtained with the increase of cfv 0 7 m s the effect of mlss on membrane fouling becomed no longer important and colloid toc becomed the main pollutant to limit the r mf besides ho et al ho and sung 2009 reported that increasing cfv would break the sludge flocs produce smaller flocs particle size and had a negative impact on membrane fouling whereas lower cfv was not conducive to slowing membrane fouling and not sufficient to prevent the long term accumulation of particles on the membrane surface dereli et al 2015 in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding the different mechanisms of pollution mentioned above this study further investigated the influence of colloid toc cfv conditions and their relative relationship on membrane fouling as can be seen from fig 8 c f there was a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf at different mlss concentrations generally the higher mlss concentration and colloid toc were the higher r mf was the reason was that the residual particles were retained by diffusion convection when the cfv was 0 1 m s the colloidal material interacts with the sludge particles to greatly stimulate the r mf colloids were fine particles in an approximate size range of 1 1000 nm in aqueous solutions natural organic matter usually bonded together to form colloidal aggregates of tens or hundreds of nanometers in size lin et al 2014 lin researched the mechanism of organic colloid on membrane fouling the conclusion was that organic colloid attached to the surface of the membrane caused membrane fouling which was consistent with our view in the process of the cake formation the colloidal material would enter the filter cake pore plug the pore size or be adsorbed into the membrane pore size which would lead to a reduction of the pore size of the membrane and form a sludge filter cake with lower porosity the greater concentration of colloidal particles was the greater cake resistance was as shown in fig 8 c e the r mf increased with the increase of colloid toc under the condition which cfv was 0 1 1 5 m s and the same mlss conditions was used such as cfv 0 1 m s when mlss was 40 g l and 15 g l the r mf varied with colloid toc and the slope k was 9 13 and 0 18 respectively which increased about 50 7 times this result showed a linear relationship between colloid toc and r mf however when cfv 2 1 m s the r mf increased with the increasing of colloid toc but different mlss no longer affected the slope of its increase fig 8f a much higher effect of mlss on r mf occurred under conditions of greater mlss concentration and or less colloid toc in contrast the fouling concentration was high for example when cfv 0 7 m s mlss 30 0 g l as shown in fig 8d the minor effect of colloid toc on r mf seemed contradictory to the result mentioned above which suggested that the colloids exerted a strong influence on r mf this could be explained by the fact that the influence of colloid toc on r mf was mainly caused by the interactions between colloid toc and mlss particles fan 2006 3 7 a universal mathematical model for the changes of membrane fouling rate with influence factors the mathematical model of membrane fouling rate with colloid toc under different mlss and cfv could be obtained through the linear regression of data in fig 8 c f the relationships between r mf and colloid toc c toc

orthogonal test was done further according to the above values of mlss cfv and colloid toc the validated values of mlss were18 26 and 34 g l cfv were 0 4 1 1 and 1 7 m s colloid toc were 15 45 and 75 mg l respectively the specific orthogonal test design was shown as table 4 as shown in fig 11 the predicted r mf and the actual r mf by experimentally measured were obtained from the 9 orthogonal tests by equation 11 the r mf of the seventh experiment was higher fig 11 a the reason was that the concentration of sludge mlss and colloid toc were higher in the orthogonal test this result was consistent with the higher mlss concentration and colloid toc was and higher r mf was it could be seen from fig 11b there were few differences between the residual of perdicted and actual membrane fouling rate the relatively higher residuals were obtained at the second third and seventh experiments in virtue of the unavoidable operational errors and uncontrollable conditions in the experiment the above two results all confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the general mathematical model of the relationship between r mf and mlss cfv and colloid toc 4 conclusions a long term study examined the effects of cfv on performance and membrane fouling rate of a pilot scale anaerobic membrane bioreactor for treating antibiotic solvent wastewater the conclusions were summarized as follows the cfv had a significant influence on the operation efficiency of anmbr with the increase of cfv the total removal rate of dmf and mc maintained a high level with little change while the physical removal rate of mc decreased with the increase of cfv and the tendency of biological removal rate was opposite the octanol water partition coefficient of mc was larger and easier to be adsorbed rather than being biodegradable compared with dmf due to the hydrophilic of dmf and hydrophobic of mc the compliance rate of dmf was 92 after treatment which well meets the emission standards but mc needed a further treatment with the increase of cfv the biogas yield and the methane content increased gradually methanosarcina spp and methanosaeta spp were the dominant methanogens in anmbr which played an important role of biogas yield and the degradation of dmf and mc mlss cfv and colloid toc had a great effect on r mf mlss was the main factor of r mf when cfv was 0 1 m s and colloid toc was the main factor of r mf when cfv was above 0 7 m s totally r mf decreased with the increase of cfv the high order non linear mathematical model of the general relationship between the membrane fouling rate and mlss cfv and colloid toc was obtained as r mf 0 033τmsv 0 0054 exp 0 056τmsv 0 16 c sluge c toc 0 08c sluge 2 0 3c sluge 5 6 it is suggested that the model proposed could reflect and manage the membrane fouling of anmbr treating antibiotic solvent wastewater and provide technical support for practical engineering application of anmbr under different conditions acknowledgements
