21970,in the field of offshore engineering the control rod is a common passive device to suppress the vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures some key parameters of control rods diameter ratio spacing distance coverage rate and attack angle have a great influence on the viv fatigue life of the cylinder this paper aims to investigate the fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder with multiple control rods caused by viv based on rainflow counting and a standard s n curve with the final purpose of studying the effectiveness of multiple control rods in different configurations around the cylinder in improving the structural fatigue life the results show that control rods can suppress the viv response of the cylindrical structure and reduce its fatigue damage effectively the reduction effect of the control rods is very sensitive to the spatial arrangement the reduction effect of the 3 control rods is the best at the attack angle of 40 while that of the 4 control rods is the best at the attack angle of 30 the fatigue damage of the flexible cylinder can be reduced to a lower level with 4 control rods in addition mode transition a specific feature of viv in uniform flow is found in the experiment and has a strong influence on fatigue life keywords flexible cylinder control rods viv reduction fatigue damage miner palmgren hypothesis 1 introduction in recent decades with the rapid development of marine mining technology the exploitation of offshore oil and gas resources has gradually developed into the deep sea field and long flexible cylindrical structures have been widely used in ocean engineering typical examples include risers cables tendons mooring lines and pipeline spans due to their structural characteristics these flexible cylindrical structures are susceptible to vortex induced vibration viv when exposed to the oncoming flow resulting in large vibration of the structure huera huarte and bearman 2009a b gao et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the structures are subjected to extended service in the harsh deep sea environment and cannot be maintained regularly and the fatigue problems are particularly serious these issues have been thoroughly studied by scholars worldwide in recent decades zou et al 2019 gao et al 2020 ma et al 2020 it is shown that viv is one of the important reasons for the fatigue failure of offshore cylindrical structures mukundan et al 2009 thorsen et al 2015 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2018a b in practical engineering situation the viv suppression methodology is usually adopted to improve the service life of flexible cylindrical structures there are two kinds of common measures to suppress viv active and passive control choi et al 2008 zhu et al 2020 the former uses sensors to conduct real time monitoring of the flow field and structure and the shedding of karman vortex street is altered by computer automatic control such as an acoustic excitation system fujisawa et al 2004 suction and electromagnetic forcing kim and lee 2000 this method has not been widely used except for some important projects because of its complicated operation and high cost the passive method changes the flow field around the cylinder by changing the shape of the cylinder surface or attaching other devices to change the frequency the mode of vibration and the development process of the vortex shedding to suppress the viv examples include flexible shrouding kumar et al 2018 helical strakes quen et al 2018 and splitter plates assi et al 2014 the passive method has been widely adopted in practical engineering because of its low cost good effect and simple operation the control rod small diameter secondary cylinder is a simple and efficient viv control method which has attracted the attention of scholars in recent years previous research suggested that the viv suppression effectiveness of the control rods is insensitive to the inclination angle of the main cylinder and that the suppression effect is excellent xu et al 2018c these findings indicate that control rods have good potential application prospects in engineering application there are many parameters that affect the effectiveness of the control rod such as number of control rods diameter ratio spacing distance coverage rate and attack angle wu et al 2011 2012 zhu and yao 2015 zhu and gao 2018 xu et al 2019 the experimental investigation by lou et al 2017 showed that viv was significantly reduced indicating that the control rods effectively suppressed viv of marine riser it was found that 4 control rods suppressed viv of crossflow up to 90 more effectively than 3 control rods recent work by song et al 2017 showed through numerical investigation that the attack angle and rod to cylinder gap ratio had a very large impact on the hydrodynamics and vibration responses of the main cylinder with 3 control rods the suppression effect on the vibration of the main cylinder by small control rods is sensitive to the attack angle and number of control rods actually the distribution of ocean flow profile has a certain regularity in a specific sea area the reasonable arrangement of the control rod can improve its reduction effect of viv response based on the hydrological statistics the reasonable arrangement of the control rod can significantly improve the service life of the cylindrical structure it is necessary for the control rod to be further studied because of the complexity of viv the limitation of existing research and the lack of actual engineering data our previous experiment showed the dynamic response characteristic of a long flexible cylinder with 3 or 4 control rods undergoing vortex shedding lu et al 2019 in fact both the viv suppression of the vibration response and the improvement of the structure life merit attention in this paper the suppression effect of control rods is studied from the perspective of fatigue damage the rest of paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a method to calculate the fatigue damage value of the cylinder model and the experimental related information section 3 shows the results of the strain amplitude the fatigue damage value and the fatigue damage distribution of cylinder models with 3 and 4 control rods respectively some conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 calculation methods and experimental setup due to the alternating shedding of vortices the cylindrical structure in the viv state is subjected to the action of alternating stress for a long time and fatigue cracks gradually form in its interior and continue to expand eventually leading to the fatigue failure of the cylinder for cylindrical structures the magnitude and frequency of the alternating stress are the main parameters to determine the fatigue damage in order to further study the influence of control rods on the fatigue life of the flexible cylinder the miner palmgren hypothesis wang et al 2015 which is widely used at present is adopted to calculate the fatigue damage of the cylinder the miner palmgren hypothesis and viv response data of the cylinder model are used to calculate the fatigue damage which mainly includes the following steps 1 preprocess the data to obtain the pure bending strain time history caused by viv 2 obtain the number of stress cycles from the strain time history curve by the rainflow counting rfc method amzallag et al 1994 3 apply the s n curve and miner theory to calculate the fatigue damage 2 1 data preprocess and rfc procedure the strain response of the cross flow cf or in line il flow is measured with two strain gauges in the x and y directions to eliminate the effect of drag force a bandpass filter is used to eliminate the low vibration frequency caused by the towing carriage and the high frequency noise the pure bending strain time curve at 7 measuring points of the cylinder caused by viv can be obtained by 1 ε viv t ε 1 t ε 2 t 2 the modal method is used to reconstruct the displacement by the preprocessed strain data and the displacement of the whole cylinder model is reconstructed by the strain data of 7 measuring points on the flexible cylinder model chaplin et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 mukundan et al 2009 han et al 2017 the rfc procedure is a cycle counting method which is mainly used for fatigue life prediction and simulation testing the rfc procedure consists of the following steps step 1 preprocess the strain time curve for the implementation of computer programming it is necessary to preprocess the strain time curve which consist of discretization extraction of extreme value and quantification of value into class the sampling method is used to discretize the strain time curve to obtain a digital sequence that can be recognized by the computer and then the extreme values are extracted from the digital sequence quantification of value into class in order to store the results and the speed of calculation step 2 extract all the cycle as shown in fig 1 the method of extracting the cycle is by using 4 consecutive extremum points if δ s 2 δ s 1 and δ s 2 δ s 3 then a the cycle of s2 s3 s2 is recorded in form of amplitude and mean b the process of s1 s4 can be regarded as a single loading process otherwise the points s2 s3 s4 and newpoint are selected to the same test in this way all the cycles are recorded finally the remaining residue is used and treated all the remaining residues are arranged and combined in order to obtain a new sequence repeat step 2 to extract all cycles of the load spectrum 2 2 s n curve and miner palmgren hypothesis based on the material characteristics of copper the b 1 s n curve from dnvgl rp c203 2016 is adopted the related parameter values are listed in table 1 and the formula is as follows 2 log n log a m log δ σ and under the specific stress δ σ i the number of cycles to fatigue for the material can be expressed as 3 n i 10 log a m log δ σ i m a δ σ i m the damage caused by each cycle of stress δ σ i can be expressed as 4 d i 1 n i δ σ i m a the miner palmgren linear fatigue damage accumulation rule is widely employed in many practical situations in the process of using this rule we assume that the alternating stresses applied to marine engineering structures are stable and random and that the damage can be accumulated linearly without considering the influence of the load order based on the miner palmgren linear damage theory the fatigue damage of the cylinder can be obtained by the following formula 5 d t o t a l i 1 k n i n i where d total n i and n i denote the total damage the maximum cycle times of the ith alternating stress δ σ i and the actual cycle times of the ith alternating stress δ σ i respectively 2 3 experimental description the tests were performed in the towing tank of the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university china as shown in fig 2 a the flexible cylinder model is a long copper tube covered with a smooth silicone tube the length of the main cylinder model is 5 60 m the outer diameter of the copper tube is 8 0 mm the wall thickness is 1 0 mm and the aspect ratio l d is 350 the outside diameter of the silicone tube is 16 mm and its main function to provide a waterproof and insulative coating the cylinder model is connected to the steel frame by universal joints an initial axial pretension 450 n is applied at one end of the model to preserve the stiffness and eigenfrequency of the model the steel frame is fixed on the carriage through bolts the uniform flow is simulated by dragging the steel frame with the carriage the moving speed range of the carriage in the experiment is from 0 05 m s to 1 00 m s with interval of 0 05 m s the reduced velocity is expressed by v r u f 1 d where f 1 is the fundamental frequency of the smooth cylinder in still water the control rods are fixed around the main cylinder model with 9 supporting devices and the distance from the surface of the control rods to the surface of the main cylinder is a certain value g d 0 25 see fig 2 a the control rod is 4 mm in diameter and is made of silicone the mass ratio of the control rod is approximately 1 0 the mass per unit length is 0 01257 kg m the supporting device consists of two semi circular fixtures and is made of polythene with thin thickness to reduce the effective gravity that means the control rods and supporting devices does not change the mass ratio of the cylinder model and have very little effect on its bending stiffness the strain gauges are arranged at 7 measuring points g1 g7 of the main cylinder model see fig 2 c at each measuring point 4 strain gauges are installed on the surface of the copper tube to measure the vibration information of the cylinder model in the cf and il directions see fig 2 b the sampling time of the strain gauge is 50 s and the sampling frequency is 100 hz the number of control rods and the spatial arrangement can greatly affect the suppression effect in the experiment the 3 or 4 control rods are arranged around the cylinder model with different spatial angles the layouts of the control rods are shown in fig 3 for more information about the experimental apparatus and the detailed procedures of the modal method please refer to han et al 2017 the pure bending strain time curves of all points on the cylinder model can be obtained by the above method of preprocessing data fig 4 shows the strain time curve of the main cylinder model at the middle measurement point after the displacement reconstruction the fatigue damage value of the main cylinder model is calculated by rfc method and miner palmgren hypothesis some of the results are shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion the lift force fluctuation is the main factor causing the viv the existence of small control rods around the main cylinder changes the phase difference between the alternate vortex shedding from the opposite sides of the cylinder the separate point of the vortex the distance between two neighboring vortices and the size of wake vortex this condition changes the pressure difference on opposite sides of the main cylinder and the flow pattern behind it the fluctuation of the lift coefficient is reduced the results of a previous study showed that the lift coefficient first decreases and then increases with increasing attack angle lu et al 2014 there is a critical angle at the turning point a similar phenomenon was observed in the study of song et al 2017 therefore there is an optimal layout angle that can suppress viv to the greatest extent 3 1 main flexible cylinder with 3 control rods 3 1 1 strain response the amplitude and the frequency of strain are the key parameters to determine the fatigue damage to understand the suppression effect of control rods the strain time curves of the main cylinder model are analyzed and the maximum strain rms values are obtained fig 6 shows the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain curves of the main flexible cylinder with 3 control rods versus the reduced velocity the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain is significantly reduced by the use of 3 control rods arranged in space under various velocities at high flow velocities the control rod has a superior suppression effect on the main cylinder model it can also be observed that the attack angle has a great influence on the reduction effect on the rms amplitude of the cf strain according to the analysis of the paper already published by the author the amplitude and the main frequency of the strain of the main cylinder model under the action of 3 control rods are significantly suppressed the maximum rms amplitude reductions are approximately 43 60 76 and 63 for θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 and θ 60 respectively the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain can be reduced to the greatest extent when θ 40 3 1 2 rms value of the fatigue damage fig 7 shows the relationship between the rms value of fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder and the reduced velocity under the action of 3 control rods the rms value of the fatigue damage represents the average fatigue damage level of the whole cylinder model for convenient comparison with the main cylinder without control rods the results of the smooth cylinder are also presented in this figure for the smooth cylinder the fatigue damage increases as the reduced velocity increases by orders of magnitude and the average fatigue damage reaches the maximum value when v r 25 05 under the action of 3 control rods the fatigue damage of the main cylinder model decreases by orders of magnitude some data may be increased at low flow velocities due to filtering and other factors on the whole the fatigue damage value shows a trend of increasing stepwise which is different from the continuous increase trend of smooth cylinder this indicates that the presence of the control rod delays the increase in fatigue damage values by comparing the average damage of the main cylinder model under the various arrangements of the 3 control rods it can be found that the damage can be reduced to the lowest level when θ 40 in addition in all four cases the control rods show a better reduction effect at high reduced velocity to more accurately describe the reduction effect of control rods on the fatigue damage caused by the viv the reduction efficiency is defined as follows 6 η f l f c f l 100 where f l and f c denote the annual damage of the smooth cylinder and the annual damage of the cylinder with control rods respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 8 note that the modal approach cannot distinguish the real vibration signal of the cylinder and the noise in the low modes and the noise severely affects the accuracy of the measurement results at low reduced velocity while the results with higher dominant mode are less influenced therefore we show only the calculation results of v r 5 01 in this paper the 3 control rods have a very good reduction effect on the fatigue damage of the cylinder model see fig 8 the reduction efficiencies of the fatigue damage exceed 60 when 5 01 v r 8 77 the reduction efficiency of the 3 control rods can exceed 90 when v r 8 77 at high reduced velocities control rods can exert a better reduction efficiency when the attack angle is θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 and θ 60 the maximum reduction efficiencies can reach 99 18 99 49 99 92 and 99 86 respectively in general the reduction effect of 3 control rods on viv is very efficient and stable and less affected by the change of velocity among them the performance at θ 40 is the most superior 3 1 3 fatigue damage distribution the distribution of fatigue damage along the cylindrical structure is another important factor leading to fatigue failure of the cylindrical structure based on the position coordinates and reduced velocity figs 9 and 10 present the cf fatigue damage distribution of the smooth cylinder and cylinder with 3 control rods in the form of a colored nephogram respectively in order to clearly show the fatigue distribution rule of the cylinder model different labels are adopted in each figure fig 9 shows that the fatigue damage distribution of the smooth cylinder model changes regularly as the velocity increases to describe this rule more clearly the peak area of fatigue damage is defined as the danger area by using the concept of the dangerous section of structural mechanics for the smooth cylinder the danger area first appears in a certain area of the model at a low reduced velocity 5 01 v r 7 52 this phenomenon may be caused by the difference between the fixed modes of the left and right sides of the cylinder model as the reduced velocity increases the range of danger areas on the cylinder model gradually expands and the fatigue damage value increases rapidly eventually multiple danger areas appear on the main cylinder model as the reduced velocity increases from 15 03 to 25 05 the number of danger areas changes from 3 to 4 and the fatigue damage value increases by orders of magnitude the main reason for this change is the increase in the dominant mode of the cylinder and the damage value at the vibration peak point of the main cylinder model is always higher than that elsewhere in addition the danger area is symmetrical and evenly distributed over the whole cylinder which has important practical significance for us to strengthen the marine cylindrical structure locally the damage distribution of the cylinder model under the action of 3 control rods is similar to that of the smooth cylinder the first danger area appears on the left side of the cylinder at a low flow velocity as the flow velocity increases the danger area gradually extends and is evenly distributed along the main cylinder the whole transition process is exhibited clearly in comparison with the results of the smooth cylinder the maximum fatigue damage value and the fatigue damage of the full length range are significantly reduced and the extension of the danger area is delayed as shown in fig 10 a b and d when θ 0 and 20 there are at most three danger areas on the model and four danger areas arise in the model when θ 60 the case of θ 40 represents a transitional state see fig 10 c and the fatigue damage along the whole main cylinder model is also significantly lower than that of other arrangements from the perspective of the fatigue damage distribution the 3 control rod works best when the angle of attack θ 40 based on the above analysis the spatial arrangement of θ 40 is the best choice to improve the fatigue life of the main flexible cylinder in the cf direction by using 3 control rods 3 2 main flexible cylinder with 4 control rods 3 2 1 strain response fig 11 shows in detail the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain signals of the main flexible cylinder with 4 control rods the 4 control rods have an excellent suppression effect on the maximum rms amplitude in comparison with the results for 3 control rods the suppression effect is further improved and the maximum reduction in the cf strain appears at the highest flow velocity reaching approximately 60 77 78 and 88 for θ 0 15 30 and 45 respectively in addition the phenomenon of a higher flow velocity leading to a higher suppression efficiency occurs again in the case of 4 control rods 3 2 2 rms value of the fatigue damage fig 12 shows the relationship between the rms value of the fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder and the reduced velocity under the action of 4 control rods the general trend is that the fatigue damage value of the smooth cylinder increases sharply with increasing velocity while the fatigue damage value of the cylinder with control rods increases in a hierarchical manner and the fatigue damage of the main cylinder decreases by orders of magnitude under the action of the 4 control rods considering all cases of the attack angles the 4 control rods have a very good reduction effect at both high and low reduced velocities when θ 30 fig 12 d shows that the fatigue damage of the cylinder model tends to increase when reduced velocity v r increased from 5 01 to 20 04 and when v r 20 04 the damage value suddenly decreases this phenomenon is discussed in detail in the next section the reduction efficiency is calculated according to eq 6 and the results are shown in fig 13 the reduction efficiency increases gradually versus the reduced velocity increases the reduction efficiency of the 4 control rods can reach approximately 90 on average and exceed 99 at high reduced velocity when the attack angle θ 0 θ 15 θ 30 and θ 45 the maximum reduction efficiencies can reach 99 78 99 97 99 98 and 100 respectively in general the reduction effect of 4 control rods on viv is more effective and stable than that of 3 control rods among them the performance at θ 30 is the most superior fig 14 show that the fatigue damage of the main cylinder with 3 or 4 control rods it can be observed that the 3 and 4 control rods have the same inhibitory effect on viv it can be observed that the reduction on viv by using 3 or 4 control rods is almost the same when 5 01 v r 12 52 and the fatigue damage value of the main cylinder with 4 control rods decreases to a lower level at 12 52 v r 25 05 when v r 20 04 it is clear that the fatigue damage value of the cylinder with 4 control rods is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the cylinder with 3 control rods overall the reduction effect of 4 control rods on viv is better than that of 3 control rods the similar conclusion was found in the study of zhu and yao 2015 the fatigue damage value of the main flexible cylinder with control rods by different attack angles varies greatly it s worth noting that the reduction effect is the worst when θ 0 regardless of whether there are 3 or 4 control rods see fig 14 the common ground between the two cases is that the control rods are positioned on the upstream y axis the results of the study showed that the regular karman vortex street appears behind the main cylinder with only one control rod upstream song et al 2017 the control rod has little interference to the wake mode of the main cylinder and little inhibition to the lift force 3 2 3 fatigue damage distribution fig 15 shows the damage nephogram of the main cylinder model at different reduced velocities under the action of 4 control rods the damage distribution of the cylinder model under the action of 4 control rods is similar to that of the smooth cylinder with the increase of the reduced velocity the fatigue damage value of the whole model increases and the range and number of danger areas increase there are at most three danger areas on the model when θ 0 when θ 15 and 30 four danger areas begin to appear on the cylinder in the specific case of θ 45 the number of danger areas suddenly changes from 3 to 7 when v r 20 04 the fatigue damage value of the full range of the cylinder also diminishes abruptly by several orders of magnitude as mentioned in the previous section the rms value of fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder suddenly decreases when v r 20 04 the main reason for this phenomenon is the mode transition caused by the competition of different modes the whole process of the mode transition is shown in fig 15 under different dominant modes the fatigue damage distribution of the main cylinder is quite different the fatigue damage distribution of the main cylinder varies greatly with different dominant modes based on the above analysis the strain the fatigue damage value and the damage distribution are comprehensively considered the case of θ 30 is the best choice for improving the fatigue life of the main flexible cylinder in the cf direction by using 4 control rods note that the 4 control rods can more effectively reduce the fatigue damage value in the full range of the main cylinder model and further delay the extension of the danger area in comparison with the results for 3 control rods the main reason is that the more control rods there are the greater the interference of the shedding vortex behind the control rod to the wake pattern behind the main cylinder resulting in the further decrease of lift force moreover the possible varying attack angle in the symmetrical arrangement of 4 control rods is limited in 45 which is smaller than that of the case with 3 rods 60 this result is critical for control rods that are extremely sensitive to the attack angle the research by lu et al 2014 showed that the lift coefficient of the main cylinder under the action of 4 control rods is significantly lower than the case of 3 control rods the case of 3 control rods is more sensitive to attack angles than that of 4 control rods therefore it is recommended to use 4 control rods symmetrically without considering the economic factors 4 conclusions based on the miner palmgren fatigue damage theory the fatigue damage value of the flexible cylinder model is calculated by using experimental data measured in the laboratory on this basis the fatigue life of the main cylinder model with 3 or 4 control rods at different angles of attack is studied the main conclusions are as follows 1 the use of 3 or 4 control rods can effectively reduce the cf fatigue damage of flexible cylindrical structures from the above analysis it is known that the control rod can effectively reduce the fatigue damage value in the full length range of the cylinder model the reduction effect of 3 or 4 control rods on viv is very efficient and stable and less affected by the change of velocity the reduction efficiency can reach more than 90 when v r 8 77 in addition the 3 or 4 control rods can affect the distribution of fatigue damage on the flexible cylinder structure which delay the expansion of danger areas and reduce the number of danger areas the existence of the control rod will greatly improve the fatigue life of the flexible cylinder structure 2 the attack angle has a great influence on the strain the fatigue damage value and the damage distribution of the flexible cylinder model there is an optimal attack angle for each case of the different numbers of control rods in this study the three results of the strain the fatigue damage and the damage distribution are comprehensively considered and in all four cases of θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 θ 60 the 3 control rods worked best at θ 40 in all four cases of θ 0 θ 15 θ 30 θ 45 the 4 control rods worked best at θ 30 due to the limitation of experiment only the attack angle and the number of control rods are considered in this paper and this study needs to consider the more spatial arrangements of the control rod 3 the damage reduction effect of 4 control rods is better than that of 3 control rods overall there is no significant difference in the reduction effect on viv of 3 or 4 control rods when 5 01 v r 12 52 the 4 control rods show an excellent reduction effect on viv when 12 52 v r 25 05 especially v r 20 04 in practical engineering there are a lot of statistics about sea conditions in a particular ocean area it can greatly improve the service life of flexible cylindrical structure by reasonably selecting the number and arrangement of control rods author contribution yan lu calculated the viv fatigue of the flexible cylinder yangyang liao analyzed the

2005 lie and kaasen 2006 mukundan et al 2009 han et al 2017 the rfc procedure is a cycle counting method which is mainly used for fatigue life prediction and simulation testing the rfc procedure consists of the following steps step 1 preprocess the strain time curve for the implementation of computer programming it is necessary to preprocess the strain time curve which consist of discretization extraction of extreme value and quantification of value into class the sampling method is used to discretize the strain time curve to obtain a digital sequence that can be recognized by the computer and then the extreme values are extracted from the digital sequence quantification of value into class in order to store the results and the speed of calculation step 2 extract all the cycle as shown in fig 1 the method of extracting the cycle is by using 4 consecutive extremum points if δ s 2 δ s 1 and δ s 2 δ s 3 then a the cycle of s2 s3 s2 is recorded in form of amplitude and mean b the process of s1 s4 can be regarded as a single loading process otherwise the points s2 s3 s4 and newpoint are selected to the same test in this way all the cycles are recorded finally the remaining residue is used and treated all the remaining residues are arranged and combined in order to obtain a new sequence repeat step 2 to extract all cycles of the load spectrum 2 2 s n curve and miner palmgren hypothesis based on the material characteristics of copper the b 1 s n curve from dnvgl rp c203 2016 is adopted the related parameter values are listed in table 1 and the formula is as follows 2 log n log a m log δ σ and under the specific stress δ σ i the number of cycles to fatigue for the material can be expressed as 3 n i 10 log a m log δ σ i m a δ σ i m the damage caused by each cycle of stress δ σ i can be expressed as 4 d i 1 n i δ σ i m a the miner palmgren linear fatigue damage accumulation rule is widely employed in many practical situations in the process of using this rule we assume that the alternating stresses applied to marine engineering structures are stable and random and that the damage can be accumulated linearly without considering the influence of the load order based on the miner palmgren linear damage theory the fatigue damage of the cylinder can be obtained by the following formula 5 d t o t a l i 1 k n i n i where d total n i and n i denote the total damage the maximum cycle times of the ith alternating stress δ σ i and the actual cycle times of the ith alternating stress δ σ i respectively 2 3 experimental description the tests were performed in the towing tank of the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university china as shown in fig 2 a the flexible cylinder model is a long copper tube covered with a smooth silicone tube the length of the main cylinder model is 5 60 m the outer diameter of the copper tube is 8 0 mm the wall thickness is 1 0 mm and the aspect ratio l d is 350 the outside diameter of the silicone tube is 16 mm and its main function to provide a waterproof and insulative coating the cylinder model is connected to the steel frame by universal joints an initial axial pretension 450 n is applied at one end of the model to preserve the stiffness and eigenfrequency of the model the steel frame is fixed on the carriage through bolts the uniform flow is simulated by dragging the steel frame with the carriage the moving speed range of the carriage in the experiment is from 0 05 m s to 1 00 m s with interval of 0 05 m s the reduced velocity is expressed by v r u f 1 d where f 1 is the fundamental frequency of the smooth cylinder in still water the control rods are fixed around the main cylinder model with 9 supporting devices and the distance from the surface of the control rods to the surface of the main cylinder is a certain value g d 0 25 see fig 2 a the control rod is 4 mm in diameter and is made of silicone the mass ratio of the control rod is approximately 1 0 the mass per unit length is 0 01257 kg m the supporting device consists of two semi circular fixtures and is made of polythene with thin thickness to reduce the effective gravity that means the control rods and supporting devices does not change the mass ratio of the cylinder model and have very little effect on its bending stiffness the strain gauges are arranged at 7 measuring points g1 g7 of the main cylinder model see fig 2 c at each measuring point 4 strain gauges are installed on the surface of the copper tube to measure the vibration information of the cylinder model in the cf and il directions see fig 2 b the sampling time of the strain gauge is 50 s and the sampling frequency is 100 hz the number of control rods and the spatial arrangement can greatly affect the suppression effect in the experiment the 3 or 4 control rods are arranged around the cylinder model with different spatial angles the layouts of the control rods are shown in fig 3 for more information about the experimental apparatus and the detailed procedures of the modal method please refer to han et al 2017 the pure bending strain time curves of all points on the cylinder model can be obtained by the above method of preprocessing data fig 4 shows the strain time curve of the main cylinder model at the middle measurement point after the displacement reconstruction the fatigue damage value of the main cylinder model is calculated by rfc method and miner palmgren hypothesis some of the results are shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion the lift force fluctuation is the main factor causing the viv the existence of small control rods around the main cylinder changes the phase difference between the alternate vortex shedding from the opposite sides of the cylinder the separate point of the vortex the distance between two neighboring vortices and the size of wake vortex this condition changes the pressure difference on opposite sides of the main cylinder and the flow pattern behind it the fluctuation of the lift coefficient is reduced the results of a previous study showed that the lift coefficient first decreases and then increases with increasing attack angle lu et al 2014 there is a critical angle at the turning point a similar phenomenon was observed in the study of song et al 2017 therefore there is an optimal layout angle that can suppress viv to the greatest extent 3 1 main flexible cylinder with 3 control rods 3 1 1 strain response the amplitude and the frequency of strain are the key parameters to determine the fatigue damage to understand the suppression effect of control rods the strain time curves of the main cylinder model are analyzed and the maximum strain rms values are obtained fig 6 shows the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain curves of the main flexible cylinder with 3 control rods versus the reduced velocity the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain is significantly reduced by the use of 3 control rods arranged in space under various velocities at high flow velocities the control rod has a superior suppression effect on the main cylinder model it can also be observed that the attack angle has a great influence on the reduction effect on the rms amplitude of the cf strain according to the analysis of the paper already published by the author the amplitude and the main frequency of the strain of the main cylinder model under the action of 3 control rods are significantly suppressed the maximum rms amplitude reductions are approximately 43 60 76 and 63 for θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 and θ 60 respectively the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain can be reduced to the greatest extent when θ 40 3 1 2 rms value of the fatigue damage fig 7 shows the relationship between the rms value of fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder and the reduced velocity under the action of 3 control rods the rms value of the fatigue damage represents the average fatigue damage level of the whole cylinder model for convenient comparison with the main cylinder without control rods the results of the smooth cylinder are also presented in this figure for the smooth cylinder the fatigue damage increases as the reduced velocity increases by orders of magnitude and the average fatigue damage reaches the maximum value when v r 25 05 under the action of 3 control rods the fatigue damage of the main cylinder model decreases by orders of magnitude some data may be increased at low flow velocities due to filtering and other factors on the whole the fatigue damage value shows a trend of increasing stepwise which is different from the continuous increase trend of smooth cylinder this indicates that the presence of the control rod delays the increase in fatigue damage values by comparing the average damage of the main cylinder model under the various arrangements of the 3 control rods it can be found that the damage can be reduced to the lowest level when θ 40 in addition in all four cases the control rods show a better reduction effect at high reduced velocity to more accurately describe the reduction effect of control rods on the fatigue damage caused by the viv the reduction efficiency is defined as follows 6 η f l f c f l 100 where f l and f c denote the annual damage of the smooth cylinder and the annual damage of the cylinder with control rods respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 8 note that the modal approach cannot distinguish the real vibration signal of the cylinder and the noise in the low modes and the noise severely affects the accuracy of the measurement results at low reduced velocity while the results with higher dominant mode are less influenced therefore we show only the calculation results of v r 5 01 in this paper the 3 control rods have a very good reduction effect on the fatigue damage of the cylinder model see fig 8 the reduction efficiencies of the fatigue damage exceed 60 when 5 01 v r 8 77 the reduction efficiency of the 3 control rods can exceed 90 when v r 8 77 at high reduced velocities control rods can exert a better reduction efficiency when the attack angle is θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 and θ 60 the maximum reduction efficiencies can reach 99 18 99 49 99 92 and 99 86 respectively in general the reduction effect of 3 control rods on viv is very efficient and stable and less affected by the change of velocity among them the performance at θ 40 is the most superior 3 1 3 fatigue damage distribution the distribution of fatigue damage along the cylindrical structure is another important factor leading to fatigue failure of the cylindrical structure based on the position coordinates and reduced velocity figs 9 and 10 present the cf fatigue damage distribution of the smooth cylinder and cylinder with 3 control rods in the form of a colored nephogram respectively in order to clearly show the fatigue distribution rule of the cylinder model different labels are adopted in each figure fig 9 shows that the fatigue damage distribution of the smooth cylinder model changes regularly as the velocity increases to describe this rule more clearly the peak area of fatigue damage is defined as the danger area by using the concept of the dangerous section of structural mechanics for the smooth cylinder the danger area first appears in a certain area of the model at a low reduced velocity 5 01 v r 7 52 this phenomenon may be caused by the difference between the fixed modes of the left and right sides of the cylinder model as the reduced velocity increases the range of danger areas on the cylinder model gradually expands and the fatigue damage value increases rapidly eventually multiple danger areas appear on the main cylinder model as the reduced velocity increases from 15 03 to 25 05 the number of danger areas changes from 3 to 4 and the fatigue damage value increases by orders of magnitude the main reason for this change is the increase in the dominant mode of the cylinder and the damage value at the vibration peak point of the main cylinder model is always higher than that elsewhere in addition the danger area is symmetrical and evenly distributed over the whole cylinder which has important practical significance for us to strengthen the marine cylindrical structure locally the damage distribution of the cylinder model under the action of 3 control rods is similar to that of the smooth cylinder the first danger area appears on the left side of the cylinder at a low flow velocity as the flow velocity increases the danger area gradually extends and is evenly distributed along the main cylinder the whole transition process is exhibited clearly in comparison with the results of the smooth cylinder the maximum fatigue damage value and the fatigue damage of the full length range are significantly reduced and the extension of the danger area is delayed as shown in fig 10 a b and d when θ 0 and 20 there are at most three danger areas on the model and four danger areas arise in the model when θ 60 the case of θ 40 represents a transitional state see fig 10 c and the fatigue damage along the whole main cylinder model is also significantly lower than that of other arrangements from the perspective of the fatigue damage distribution the 3 control rod works best when the angle of attack θ 40 based on the above analysis the spatial arrangement of θ 40 is the best choice to improve the fatigue life of the main flexible cylinder in the cf direction by using 3 control rods 3 2 main flexible cylinder with 4 control rods 3 2 1 strain response fig 11 shows in detail the maximum rms amplitude of the cf strain signals of the main flexible cylinder with 4 control rods the 4 control rods have an excellent suppression effect on the maximum rms amplitude in comparison with the results for 3 control rods the suppression effect is further improved and the maximum reduction in the cf strain appears at the highest flow velocity reaching approximately 60 77 78 and 88 for θ 0 15 30 and 45 respectively in addition the phenomenon of a higher flow velocity leading to a higher suppression efficiency occurs again in the case of 4 control rods 3 2 2 rms value of the fatigue damage fig 12 shows the relationship between the rms value of the fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder and the reduced velocity under the action of 4 control rods the general trend is that the fatigue damage value of the smooth cylinder increases sharply with increasing velocity while the fatigue damage value of the cylinder with control rods increases in a hierarchical manner and the fatigue damage of the main cylinder decreases by orders of magnitude under the action of the 4 control rods considering all cases of the attack angles the 4 control rods have a very good reduction effect at both high and low reduced velocities when θ 30 fig 12 d shows that the fatigue damage of the cylinder model tends to increase when reduced velocity v r increased from 5 01 to 20 04 and when v r 20 04 the damage value suddenly decreases this phenomenon is discussed in detail in the next section the reduction efficiency is calculated according to eq 6 and the results are shown in fig 13 the reduction efficiency increases gradually versus the reduced velocity increases the reduction efficiency of the 4 control rods can reach approximately 90 on average and exceed 99 at high reduced velocity when the attack angle θ 0 θ 15 θ 30 and θ 45 the maximum reduction efficiencies can reach 99 78 99 97 99 98 and 100 respectively in general the reduction effect of 4 control rods on viv is more effective and stable than that of 3 control rods among them the performance at θ 30 is the most superior fig 14 show that the fatigue damage of the main cylinder with 3 or 4 control rods it can be observed that the 3 and 4 control rods have the same inhibitory effect on viv it can be observed that the reduction on viv by using 3 or 4 control rods is almost the same when 5 01 v r 12 52 and the fatigue damage value of the main cylinder with 4 control rods decreases to a lower level at 12 52 v r 25 05 when v r 20 04 it is clear that the fatigue damage value of the cylinder with 4 control rods is several orders of magnitude lower than that of the cylinder with 3 control rods overall the reduction effect of 4 control rods on viv is better than that of 3 control rods the similar conclusion was found in the study of zhu and yao 2015 the fatigue damage value of the main flexible cylinder with control rods by different attack angles varies greatly it s worth noting that the reduction effect is the worst when θ 0 regardless of whether there are 3 or 4 control rods see fig 14 the common ground between the two cases is that the control rods are positioned on the upstream y axis the results of the study showed that the regular karman vortex street appears behind the main cylinder with only one control rod upstream song et al 2017 the control rod has little interference to the wake mode of the main cylinder and little inhibition to the lift force 3 2 3 fatigue damage distribution fig 15 shows the damage nephogram of the main cylinder model at different reduced velocities under the action of 4 control rods the damage distribution of the cylinder model under the action of 4 control rods is similar to that of the smooth cylinder with the increase of the reduced velocity the fatigue damage value of the whole model increases and the range and number of danger areas increase there are at most three danger areas on the model when θ 0 when θ 15 and 30 four danger areas begin to appear on the cylinder in the specific case of θ 45 the number of danger areas suddenly changes from 3 to 7 when v r 20 04 the fatigue damage value of the full range of the cylinder also diminishes abruptly by several orders of magnitude as mentioned in the previous section the rms value of fatigue damage of the main flexible cylinder suddenly decreases when v r 20 04 the main reason for this phenomenon is the mode transition caused by the competition of different modes the whole process of the mode transition is shown in fig 15 under different dominant modes the fatigue damage distribution of the main cylinder is quite different the fatigue damage distribution of the main cylinder varies greatly with different dominant modes based on the above analysis the strain the fatigue damage value and the damage distribution are comprehensively considered the case of θ 30 is the best choice for improving the fatigue life of the main flexible cylinder in the cf direction by using 4 control rods note that the 4 control rods can more effectively reduce the fatigue damage value in the full range of the main cylinder model and further delay the extension of the danger area in comparison with the results for 3 control rods the main reason is that the more control rods there are the greater the interference of the shedding vortex behind the control rod to the wake pattern behind the main cylinder resulting in the further decrease of lift force moreover the possible varying attack angle in the symmetrical arrangement of 4 control rods is limited in 45 which is smaller than that of the case with 3 rods 60 this result is critical for control rods that are extremely sensitive to the attack angle the research by lu et al 2014 showed that the lift coefficient of the main cylinder under the action of 4 control rods is significantly lower than the case of 3 control rods the case of 3 control rods is more sensitive to attack angles than that of 4 control rods therefore it is recommended to use 4 control rods symmetrically without considering the economic factors 4 conclusions based on the miner palmgren fatigue damage theory the fatigue damage value of the flexible cylinder model is calculated by using experimental data measured in the laboratory on this basis the fatigue life of the main cylinder model with 3 or 4 control rods at different angles of attack is studied the main conclusions are as follows 1 the use of 3 or 4 control rods can effectively reduce the cf fatigue damage of flexible cylindrical structures from the above analysis it is known that the control rod can effectively reduce the fatigue damage value in the full length range of the cylinder model the reduction effect of 3 or 4 control rods on viv is very efficient and stable and less affected by the change of velocity the reduction efficiency can reach more than 90 when v r 8 77 in addition the 3 or 4 control rods can affect the distribution of fatigue damage on the flexible cylinder structure which delay the expansion of danger areas and reduce the number of danger areas the existence of the control rod will greatly improve the fatigue life of the flexible cylinder structure 2 the attack angle has a great influence on the strain the fatigue damage value and the damage distribution of the flexible cylinder model there is an optimal attack angle for each case of the different numbers of control rods in this study the three results of the strain the fatigue damage and the damage distribution are comprehensively considered and in all four cases of θ 0 θ 20 θ 40 θ 60 the 3 control rods worked best at θ 40 in all four cases of θ 0 θ 15 θ 30 θ 45 the 4 control rods worked best at θ 30 due to the limitation of experiment only the attack angle and the number of control rods are considered in this paper and this study needs to consider the more spatial arrangements of the control rod 3 the damage reduction effect of 4 control rods is better than that of 3 control rods overall there is no significant difference in the reduction effect on viv of 3 or 4 control rods when 5 01 v r 12 52 the 4 control rods show an excellent reduction effect on viv when 12 52 v r 25 05 especially v r 20 04 in practical engineering there are a lot of statistics about sea conditions in a particular ocean area it can greatly improve the service life of flexible cylindrical structure by reasonably selecting the number and arrangement of control rods author contribution yan lu calculated the viv fatigue of the flexible cylinder yangyang liao analyzed the

21971,impact waves caused by landslides rock blocks and avalanches in lakes and dam reservoirs have provoked several disasters since the dawn of time further they have caused considerable number of deaths and property loss understanding the behavior and characteristics of these waves principally their height propagation velocity and energy are key for determining engineering parameters and therefore developing alert systems and evacuation plans several studies have investigated impact waves using experimental mathematical and numerical models however few have used artificial neural networks considering the learning and prediction characteristics of neural networks this work explores their application in the prediction of impact waves the main objective is to verify the capability of a fuzzy artmap neural network in predicting the evolution of the maximum wave height one of the main parameters of impact waves the experimental data used in this paper are from the work developed by huber 1980 when studying the impact waves generated by dropping deformable material granular in a channel this study uses different forms of normalization as well as different training parameters the fuzzy artmap neural network predicts adequately the evolution of the maximum wave heights becoming useful for this kind of application keywords impact waves fuzzy artmap intelligent systems 1 introduction water waves generated by landslides or rockfalls in reservoirs of dams can lead to partial or complete destruction of their margins leading to catastrophic consequences in valleys downstream this is a problem affecting the society and is of particular concern to hydraulic engineers as well as electrical energy suppliers risk factors in regions where there is a high probability of seismic or sliding activity particularly in regions with unfavorable geological conditions must be investigated during construction planning the processes of impact wave generation and propagation that lead to the collapse of a dam can occur in a very short period not giving time for an efficient evacuation procedure thus a construction project must consider the most unfavorable hypothesis with respect to accidents rockfalls into reservoir dam failure and evaluate the wave generation and propagation processes and consequent actions on the dam and adjacent structures besides predicting the high risk zones several studies in the literature have investigated such hazards where a significant number of victims were reported including the landslides that occurred in goldau in 1806 thuro and hatem 2010 in davos lake in 1923 huber 1980 lituya bay in 1958 huber 1980 pontesi reservoir in 1959 ponziani and gardoni 2017 vajont dam in 1963 slingerland and voight 1979 and furnas reservoir brazil in 1975 souza 2007 recently some efforts have been made to mitigate or prevent the impacts of hazards these efforts were made based on physical models scaled models of the dam and reservoir or by considering non deforming materials studied by souza 2007 kamphuis and bowering 1970 and de freitas maciel and do nascimento 2002 besides granular materials sliding on inclined planes into wave channels studied by huber 1980 and fritz et al 2003 several analytical or semi empirical solutions have been proposed based on dimensional analyses providing information on the height of waves and the energy dissipated by the impact including the classical works of kamphuis and bowering 1970 noda 1974 slingerland and voight 1979 and huber 1980 fritz et al fritz et al 2003 examined these physical phenomena with a focus on the impact zone using an artificial sliding material composed of barium sulfate and poly propylene and particle image velocimetry measurement techniques other studies such as de freitas maciel and do nascimento 2002 raney and butler 1976 heinrich 1992 zweifel et al 2007 serrano pacheco et al 2009 cremonesi et al 2011 tinti et al 2011 bosa and petti 2013 shi et al 2016 have described the drag effect caused by the solid material plunging into the reservoir using numerical and mathematical models moreover authors have also investigated the evolution of numerical techniques used to solve the impulse wave problem such as the finite difference method the finite element method the finite volume with free surface tracking technique vof and more recently the lagrangian method vasco et al 2011 mathematical numerical and experimental models have been traditionally used to solve these particular problems however new approaches based on big data sets are available and are considered to be an important tool to predict impact waves as for example the studies developed by santos et al 2016 and panizzo et al 2005 intelligent systems and artificial neural networks ann can analyze learn memorize and predict solutions to several problems there are several studies in the literature concerning solitary waves wei et al 2010 using back propagation coastal waves agrawal and deo 2004 using back propagation santos et al 2016 using fuzzy artmap sea waves sánchez et al 2018 using back propagation kumar et al 2016 using sequential learning neural network prahlada and deka 2015 using wavelet decomposed neural network tsunamis romano et al 2009 using multilayer perceptron and back propagation and impact waves panizzo et al 2005 using multilayer perceptron among others fuzzy artmap neural networks are used in several research fields the following examples show some of their applications mokhtar and howe 2013 applied such a network to the management of energy demand in buildings pourpanah et al pourpanah et al 2016 used a hybrid model with fuzzy artmap neural network and a genetic algorithm to classify data and extract rules marchiori et al marchiori et al 2011 used euclidian artmap for electrical energy systems barros et al barros et al 2015 used modified euclidian artmap with continuous training for detecting and classifying voltage disturbances in electrical energy systems the use of the adaptive resonance theory art family of neural networks to predict impact waves is an unexplored field however there are several works using numerical methods validated with experimental tests including one with multi layer perceptron neural networks haykin 1998 sections 2 to 2 1 2 present a fuzzy artmap neural network to predict impact waves the huber s data huber 1980 processing the nondimensional parameter calculus and the filtering processing of the data set sections 2 2 to 2 3 describe the training phase of fuzzy artmap

normalizations applied sections 3 3 to 3 3 4 present the results of the best and worst prediction obtained in each situation studied sections 3 4 to 3 4 5 present the studies on how the different normalizations can modify the results of the impact wave predictions at last section four presents the conclusions and appendix a presents the fuzzy artmap algorithm 2 fuzzy artmap neural network applied to predict impact waves this work proposes to apply a fuzzy artmap neural network to predict impact waves according to the following steps data pre processing fuzzy artmap neural network training diagnosis phase and methodology evaluation as shown in fig 1 the application method is divided into the steps shown in fig 1 and the following sections describe them with details including information about the data set used there are two phases involved the first one is the training phase and the second one is the diagnosis phase the flowchart shown in fig 3 and the algorithm presented in appendix a describe the two phases of this ann matlab 2015a version 64 bit is used as the simulation environment to implement the ann 2 1 data set treatment from huber a 1980 this work uses the adaptive resonance theory art family of neural networks carpenter et al 1992a to predict impact waves based on the experimental study realized by huber 1980 of zurich university his studies contain experiences with impact waves performed on a masonry horizontal channel dimensions 30 33 m 0 50 m and 0 5 m with a variable declivity ramp 280 to 600 upstream and a wave damping beach declivity of 1 12 to 1 0 downstream allowing the dissipation of the generated waves fig 2 the sliding material used on the test was from granular nature mass of 5 15 30 and 50 kg that by impact have produced waves on the channel the tests generated waves presenting oscillatory pattern until bores waves measured by capacitive sensors along the channel positions x h 5 10 15 and 20 the depths tested on the channel were of 12 18 27 and 36 cm the total quantity of tests executed in huber 1980 were 704 consisting of four sliding masses six declivity ramps four impact velocities four damping shore declivities and four channel depths impact waves are modeled by several independent parameters such as the nondimensional slide volume m nondimensional impact velocity ve of the sliding material or froude impact number f plan inclination sliding slope α propagation relative distance x h where h is the still water depth in the channel downstream inclination β wave propagation direction γ and relative density i

parameters ϕi m f α x h β 0 for a channel and classified waves according to an oscillatory pattern such as sinusoidal cnoidal solitary and bore waves this work uses data referred to huber 1980 considering the depth to be h 0 12 m with nondimensional h h varying from 0 023 to 0 76 and considering 158 experiences these selected data require pre processing this is divided into two steps pre calculation of nondimensional parameters m and f and data filtering 2 1 1 pre calculation the nondimensional parameters m and f are calculated according to equations 1 and 2 before inserting the data

typical behavior without explanation even after an analysis was performed therefore they were excluded from the data set this non typical behavior is graphically verified in this paper and includes a general analysis of all parameters the excluded data contain no information about the relative height or the length period with the filtering process the data set with 158 experiences was reduced to 74 experiences 50 of it 37 experiences is used for training and the other 50 37 experiences for prediction for tests considering the influence of normalization on the modified parameters as given in table 6 80 of data 59 experiences is used for training and 20 15 experiences for prediction 2 2 fuzzy artmap neural network training phase a fuzzy artmap neural network is used to predict the maximum wave height the architecture of this network can be adapted to several problems and applications therefore despite the high complexity of the present problem this ann can interpret the parameters referred to as impact wave characteristics and provide an adequate analysis the input data for training 37 experiences are randomly selected from the 74 experiences for this step the lines of the matrix were numbered and the numerical order was randomly changed furthermore this work intends to investigate the robustness of this neural network 2 2 1 fuzzy artmap neural network this network is supervised it is composed of two art modules called arta and artb connected by an inter art module based on fuzzy logic carpenter and grossberg 1992 and the principal characteristics of fuzzy artmap are plasticity stability and malleability according to lopes 2005 the plasticity is the capacity to continue learning when including new patterns without losing the memory in relation to the previous patterns while the stability is the capacity to learn by adjusting the weights these two characteristics provide to the neural network a stable learning and a fast convergence furthermore the malleability or flexibility is the capacity of the neural network to be applicable in every area of knowledge lopes 2005 2 2 2 definition of input and output vectors the input data of the neural

parameters which were used for all experiences except for the cases investigating the influence of normalization appendix a contains the variations on the training parameters in table 1 α is the chosen parameter of the neural network α 0 this value can be close to zero providing little variation for the vigilance test according to lopes 2005 β is the training rate 0 1 ρ a ρ b ρ ab and ρ d are the vigilance parameters of modules arta artb interart and prediction respectively pertaining to the interval 0 1 these values when close to 1 force the neural network to be more demanding leading to lose some categories and a low generalization meanwhile values close to zero group similar categories that are not necessarily equal according to lopes 2005 ε is the increment of the vigilance parameter the parameters presented in table 1 were obtained after several tests with the ann such as the least values provide good results allowing more malleability instead of increasing the exigency grade according to what is shown in section 3 4 2 3 diagnostic phase of the fuzzy artmap neural network after the training phase where the neural network groups the input patterns in categories representing by updated weight matrix the diagnosis phase begins during this step new input data are presented and evaluated by the neural network classifying them according to the adapted weight matrix obtained on the training phase the diagnosis phase is conducted according to item ix of the algorithm presented in appendix a at this step the ann can predict the maximum relative height of the impact waves and the results are evaluated in the following section 3 results and discussion comparisons were made between the data of huber 1980 and the predictions obtained by the fuzzy artmap ann the results are presented in tables 2 13 and figs 5 13 the values presented refer to the minimum and maximum mean absolute percentage error mape of the best prediction selected according to a certain criterion from 500 tests the best medium mape is presented on the analysis executed in sections 3 3 to 3 4 5 the values of rmse root mean square error presented in tables 2 13 are referred to the maximum and minimum mapes the rmse measures the behavior of the data furthermore a less value of rmse is not at all associated to a less value of mape it only means that the prediction curve is similar to the experimental data the tests realized do not measure overestimation or under estimation of the predictions however observing figs 5 13 is possible to visualize the overestimations and under estimations 3 1 criterion for evaluation of methodology to evaluate the methodology 500 random tests are conducted on the ann this is done to analyze the robustness of the ann the difference with each one of the 500 tests is due to the input position of each line of the matrix once the data are randomized the evaluation criterion is set according to the following procedure for each execution additional steps a calculation of mape and rmse root mean square error in each experience 7 m a p e n d i 1 m s s r i s p i s r i m s 100 8 r m s e n d i 1 m s s r i s p i 2 m s 1 2 where nd

the forward test using the value obtained according to equation 11 as comparison criterion at the first test as there is no previous one the best result is considered and from this one the comparison begins 11 best prediction min m a p e m e d i u m min r m s e m e d i u m the comparison criterion is chosen after executing tests with the ann using other criteria of selecting the best prediction at first time the minimum mape with each test is used as the criterion however it was not a good criterion once it presents only a very low mape at second time the minimum medium mape is used nevertheless even with a low medium mape the graphical behavior not always matches the experimental data at third time the minimum rmse is used however it only indicates that the curves have a similar behavior which not necessarily was associated to low mapes neither a good prediction at fourth time the medium rmse is used nevertheless the same situation presented when using the minimum rmse was observed at last the option was to join the medium mape and the medium rmse and verify if they were enough to indicate the best prediction within the 500 tests this is confirmed with the chosen criterion presented according to equation 11 fig 4 shows the previous steps observing that the steps described in fig 4 occur after the conclusion of the diagnosis 3 2 normalization the present work also analyzes the influence of the normalization process for the input and output matrices of the ann besides normalization according to mokhtar and howe 2013 the following normalizations were used maximum value of each column equation 12 maximum of the matrix equation 13 summation of each column sum equation 14 and maximum of each row 15 a normalization by the maximum value of each column 12 i i max i j b normalization by the maximum of the matrix 13 i i max i c normalization by summation of each column 14 i i σj i j d normalization by the maximum of each row 15 i i max i i where i input or output matrix i number of rows of matrix i j number of columns of matrix i an increase of 20 above the maximum values for the standardized data is considered this procedure allows the ann to analyze situations with values higher than the maximum presented in the training data set 3 3 prediction of the maximum relative height for h 0 12 m 3 3 1 results for fuzzy artmap ann without data filtering sf this test executes 158 experiences instead of 74 experiences chosen after filtering where 50 of data are for training and 50 are for prediction the parameters of the ann are according to table 1 and the input matrix is given in equation 3 table 2 presents the results of the minimum and maximum mapes of the best prediction result of the ann among 500 tests although the ann could predict part of the data there were some inconsistencies this is due to the presence of non typical data it is expected that the maximum heights exhibit a descending trend fig 5 a i e as the impact wave evolves and is attenuated on the channel the waves tend to decrease unlike what is shown in fig 5 b for the experimental results the maximum mape is 36 7 the minimum is 0 329 and the medium is 6 55 indicating the need to filter the input data an analysis of the rmse shows that the best prediction has an rmse value close to zero indicating that the ann could predict the trend of the data nicely however when its predictions become inconsistent the rmse value is close to 0 13 according to table 2 3 3 2 fuzzy artmap ann with data filtering fi further tests were conducted after filtering the data with 74 experiences 50 of which were used for training and 50 for prediction the training parameters and the matrices were unchanged table 3 presents the results of the minimum and maximum mapes an analysis of the results of this test and those of the previous one shows a reduction in the maximum mape from 36 75 to 20 59 the minimum mape is maintained in 0 32 and a reduction in the medium mape from 6 55 to 5 39 this reduction in the medium mape indicates that more data are close to the expected values than in the previous case an analysis of the rmse shows that predictions are in close agreement to the trends in experimental data as shown in fig 6 a and 6 b 3 3 3 results of fuzzy artmap ann with filtering and without the input of water depth h sh this test also uses 74 experiences out of which 50 data are used for training and 50 are used for prediction however the input matrix given in equation 3 is modified by eliminating the column referred to as h therefore the simulation executes for f m α β without the still water depth input h this parameter is removed to verify the parameters that have a greater influence on the predictions and to demonstrate the behavior of the ann table 4 presents the results referring to the minimum and maximum mapes little improvement is observed in the prediction results in comparison with the previous analysis considering a maximum mape of 16 0 a minimum mape of 0 60 and a medium mape of 5 29 according to fig 6 the behavior improves as the rmse is closer to zero with respect to the minimum mape fig 7 a and close to 0 05 with respect to the maximum mape fig 7 b based on this information the parameter h presents no significant influence on the prediction other tests were also conducted by eliminating parameters related to the inclined slope and downstream area these results also show no significant influence on the predictions and therefore were considered not important for analysis 3 3 4 results of the fuzzy artmap ann with filtering and only the nondimensional slide volume m am this test is realized only with the nondimensional slide volume m as a last search for the nondimensional parameter that is useful for prediction the input matrix is modified to one with 74 rows and single column the percentages of data used for training and prediction and the ann parameters remain unchanged the minimum and maximum mapes are presented in table 5 the ann exhibits a maximum mape of 16 2 minimum of 0 249 and medium of 5 12 showing little improvement when compared with the previous tests considering the behavior of the curves the rmses are close to zero and 0 05 as seen in fig 8 a and 8 b respectively these results are similar to those of the previous analysis the influence of froude number f on the ann behavior in predicting the maximum height was also verified although the ann could predict the data the maximum mape was 24 94 the minimum mape was 0 06 and the medium mape was 8 48 these results demonstrate that this parameter on its own is not enough to obtain a satisfactory prediction when compared to the results obtained using only the nondimensional slide volume m particularly in the case of impact waves generated by the fall of granular material considering both the analyses it is observed that information on the nondimensional slide volume m was enough to undertake the predictions which confirms the conclusion drawn by huber 1980 who stated that the maximum height of a wave could be predicted only using this parameter 3 4 influence of normalization on the determination of maximum heights the influence of normalizing the input and output matrices of the ann was investigated the matrices were normalized according to the five forms described in section 3 2 by assuming that the input and output matrices must be normalized using the same form the analyses were conducted with filtered data and the results of these tests are presented in sections 3 4 1 to 3 4 5 tests were conducted considering the normalization of the input and output matrices with different parameters as given in table 6 the changed conditions correspond to the values that the ann requires to obtain an accurate prediction in comparison with the original conditions note that in these changed conditions 80 of data are used for training and 20 for prediction the values of the mapes are listed in tables 7 and 8 along with a comparison of the five forms used to normalize the parameters table 6 based on the previous analysis normalization defined by mokhtar and howe 2013 as well as mle sml normalization present good results when compared to the others 3 4 1 normalization by the maximum of input and output matrices mes normalization is conducted according to equation 13 at first a test was realized with original parameters of the ann using 50 of the data for training the maximum mape is 95 10 the minimum mape is 1 15 and the medium mape is 16 21 these are not satisfactory when compared with the normalization chosen for the approached problem normalization sle sn to obtain a better prediction the training parameters were changed according to table 6 while the percentage of data used for training was increased to 80 table 9 presents the values of mape for the changed conditions and a comparison of experimental and prediction curves is presented in fig 9 a and b in the changed situation the maximum mape is 33 35 the minimum mape is 1 79 and the medium mape is 12 35 these are higher than the expected values in comparison with the chosen normalization sle sn this behavior is not considered satisfactory therefore a second test using a different normalization form is executed 3 4 2 normalization realized by the maximum of each column mc this test realizes normalization by the maximum of each one of the columns either for the input or the output matrix according to equation 12 the maximum mape is 45 72 the minimum mape is zero and the medium mape is 15 41 even with minimum mape equal to zero the results are far from expected when analyzing the value of medium mape in this way a changed situation was also analyzed the results are presented in table 10 and fig 10 a and b considering the changed situation the ann presents a maximum mape of 29 44 a minimum of zero and a medium of 10 30 based on these results and data presented in table 10 this normalization when compared with the chosen one sle sn has higher mapes 3 4 3 normalization by the sum of the column sc the third investigation is realized considering normalization by the sum of each column of the input and output matrices according to equation 14 the maximum mape is 127 6 the minimum is zero and the medium is 14 90 proving that this normalization is not adequate for the problem due to the high values of maximum and medium mapes the change in the parameters of the ann was also investigated and the results are presented in table 11 and fig 11 a and b this changed situation is better than the previous one with a maximum mape of 16 81 minimum of 1 79 and medium of 7 72 however compared with the chosen normalization the normalization by the sum of the columns is not adequate for the problem even with the changed conditions table 11 left side and table 9 left side are identical this is due to an increase in the training percentages and the modification of the training parameters of the ann 3 4 4 normalization by the maximum of the row ml the fourth investigation was the normalization of the maximum of each row either on the input or output matrices according to equation 15 considering the pattern the maximum mape of the ann is 16 86 minimum is 0 70 and medium is 6 97 compared with the other normalizations this shows the best results however the medium mape shows that the predictions are still far from the expected the results for the changed conditions were also analyzed and are presented in table 12 and fig 12 a and b for the changed conditions the ann obtains a maximum mape of 11 09 a minimum of 0 70 and a medium of 2 33 there is an improvement with respect to the original conditions when compared to the medium mape of the chosen normalization but the minimum and maximum mapes are still higher 3 4 5 normalization according to carpenter 1992 mokhtar and howe 2013 with modified parameters ca for comparison the chosen normalization is analyzed for the changed conditions and the results are presented in table 13 and fig 13 a and 13 b comparing the two last normalizations by the maximum of the rows and according to mokhtar and howe 2013 the mokhtar and howe 2013 normalization is better when analyzing the maximum mape 11 09 and 8 99 respectively minimum 0 70 and 0 33 and medium 2 33 and 3 82 both are adequate to the problem under analysis it is emphasized that when analyzing all the situations normalization mokhtar and howe 2013 is the chosen one 4 conclusions this study is based on the works developed by huber 1980 santos et al 2016 and panizzo et al 2005 with a new approach using fuzzy artmap neural network to determine the evolution of the maximum heights of impact waves instead of using multilayer perceptron a common approach to sea wave problems the experimental data used for the input and output matrices come from huber 1980 which study contains one of the most important experimental database for impact waves after some preliminary analysis it was observed the need for filtering once there were some inconsistencies after executing the first tests considering the criterion of the best prediction the minimum mape it is verified that this criterion is not adequate for the problem new criteria were investigated until obtaining the adequate one the medium mape the minimum rmse medium mape and the medium rmse the criterion chosen for the best prediction is the medium mape and medium rmse another important procedure to improve the results is to randomly input the data to the ann although they are not presented in this study better and worse situations existed depending on the randomness however even after several executions the ann is stable and exhibits consistent results literature provides several works using the normalization according to mokhtar and howe 2013 however this work opts to investigate other normalization forms such that lead to best predictions five normalizations were tested including the one of mokhtar and howe 2013 the objective was to verify if changing the training parameters they could lead to best answers executing the tests with the original and modified parameters considering the five normalizations applied the conclusion is that normalizations me sm mce smc sce ssc were not adequate for the approaching problem nevertheless normalizations mle sml and sle sn present good results either with the original or modified parameters these two normalizations present the least maximum medium and minimum mapes therefore they are adequate for the approaching problem it was observed that in several analyzed situations the medium mape presented value close to the minimum mape indicating that the predictions obtained by ann were very close to the experimental data but the training parameters need to be further explored and the process to better answers needs to be further analyzed the rmse values show that the chosen ann is able to make the prediction curves consistent with the experimental ones thus predicting the wave behavior these two conclusions emphasize the ability of the fuzzy artmap neural network to predict the behavior of the impact waves comparing the results obtained from the experiences of huber 1980 with the predictions by fuzzy artmap ann the latter was found to predict the data related to the maximum waves heights with good precision the results and predictions of maximum heights could be applied to other depths based on the data that were explored and presented in non dimensional form and in situations of generating waves in channel 1d such as h h as function of m bh2 the proposed paper considers the analysis of h h h fixed in 12 cm depth the same way it is emphasized that such results must be used for predicting maximum waves within the non dimensional parameter range tested experimentally by huber 1980 such as 0 5 fr 4 and 0 023 hi h 0 76 fuzzy artmap neural network is a powerful tool to predict the characteristic parameter of impact waves evolution of the maximum heights although the ann is able to obtain significant results other situations still need to be analyzed and explored thus more significant results can be obtained this study can in the future help to develop an alert system that predicts the occurrence of catastrophes caused by impact waves therefore becoming a system that helps to prevent disasters funding information this study was financed in party by the coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior brasil capes finance code 001 são paulo state

21971,impact waves caused by landslides rock blocks and avalanches in lakes and dam reservoirs have provoked several disasters since the dawn of time further they have caused considerable number of deaths and property loss understanding the behavior and characteristics of these waves principally their height propagation velocity and energy are key for determining engineering parameters and therefore developing alert systems and evacuation plans several studies have investigated impact waves using experimental mathematical and numerical models however few have used artificial neural networks considering the learning and prediction characteristics of neural networks this work explores their application in the prediction of impact waves the main objective is to verify the capability of a fuzzy artmap neural network in predicting the evolution of the maximum wave height one of the main parameters of impact waves the experimental data used in this paper are from the work developed by huber 1980 when studying the impact waves generated by dropping deformable material granular in a channel this study uses different forms of normalization as well as different training parameters the fuzzy artmap neural network predicts adequately the evolution of the maximum wave heights becoming useful for this kind of application keywords impact waves fuzzy artmap intelligent systems 1 introduction water waves generated by landslides or rockfalls in reservoirs of dams can lead to partial or complete destruction of their margins leading to catastrophic consequences in valleys downstream this is a problem affecting the society and is of particular concern to hydraulic engineers as well as electrical energy suppliers risk factors in regions where there is a high probability of seismic or sliding activity particularly in regions with unfavorable geological conditions must be investigated during construction planning the processes of impact wave generation and propagation that lead to the collapse of a dam can occur in a very short period not giving time for an efficient evacuation procedure thus a construction project must consider the most unfavorable hypothesis with respect to accidents rockfalls into reservoir dam failure and evaluate the wave generation and propagation processes and consequent actions on the dam and adjacent structures besides predicting the high risk zones several studies in the literature have investigated such hazards where a significant number of victims were reported including the landslides that occurred in goldau in 1806 thuro and hatem 2010 in davos lake in 1923 huber 1980 lituya bay in 1958 huber 1980 pontesi reservoir in 1959 ponziani and gardoni 2017 vajont dam in 1963 slingerland and voight 1979 and furnas reservoir brazil in 1975 souza 2007 recently some efforts have been made to mitigate or prevent the impacts of hazards these efforts were made based on physical models scaled models of the dam and reservoir or by considering non deforming materials studied by souza 2007 kamphuis and bowering 1970 and de freitas maciel and do nascimento 2002 besides granular materials sliding on inclined planes into wave channels studied by huber 1980 and fritz et al 2003 several analytical or semi empirical solutions have been proposed based on dimensional analyses providing information on the height of waves and the energy dissipated by the impact including the classical works of kamphuis and bowering 1970 noda 1974 slingerland and voight 1979 and huber 1980 fritz et al fritz et al 2003 examined these physical phenomena with a focus on the impact zone using an artificial sliding material composed of barium sulfate and poly propylene and particle image velocimetry measurement techniques other studies such as de freitas maciel and do nascimento 2002 raney and butler 1976 heinrich 1992 zweifel et al 2007 serrano pacheco et al 2009 cremonesi et al 2011 tinti et al 2011 bosa and petti 2013 shi et al 2016 have described the drag effect caused by the solid material plunging into the reservoir using numerical and mathematical models moreover authors have also investigated the evolution of numerical techniques used to solve the impulse wave problem such as the finite difference method the finite element method the finite volume with free surface tracking technique vof and more recently the lagrangian method vasco et al 2011 mathematical numerical and experimental models have been traditionally used to solve these particular problems however new approaches based on big data sets are available and are considered to be an important tool to predict impact waves as for example the studies developed by santos et al 2016 and panizzo et al 2005 intelligent systems and artificial neural networks ann can analyze learn memorize and predict solutions to several problems there are several studies in the literature concerning solitary waves wei et al 2010 using back propagation coastal waves agrawal and deo 2004 using back propagation santos et al 2016 using fuzzy artmap sea waves sánchez et al 2018 using back propagation kumar et al 2016 using sequential learning neural network prahlada and deka 2015 using wavelet decomposed neural network tsunamis romano et al 2009 using multilayer perceptron and back propagation and impact waves panizzo et al 2005 using multilayer perceptron among others fuzzy artmap neural networks are used in several research fields the following examples show some of their applications mokhtar and howe 2013 applied such a network to the management of energy demand in buildings pourpanah et al pourpanah et al 2016 used a hybrid model with fuzzy artmap neural network and a genetic algorithm to classify data and extract rules marchiori et al marchiori et al 2011 used euclidian artmap for electrical energy systems barros et al barros et al 2015 used modified euclidian artmap with continuous training for detecting and classifying voltage disturbances in electrical energy systems the use of the adaptive resonance theory art family of neural networks to predict impact waves is an unexplored field however there are several works using numerical methods validated with experimental tests including one with multi layer perceptron neural networks haykin 1998 sections 2 to 2 1 2 present a fuzzy artmap neural network to predict impact waves the huber s data huber 1980 processing the nondimensional parameter calculus and the filtering processing of the data set sections 2 2 to 2 3 describe the training phase of fuzzy artmap the input matrices used in each situation studied the values of the training parameters and the diagnosis phase sections 3 to 3 2 describe the evaluation criteria of the proposed methodology and the normalizations applied sections 3 3 to 3 3 4 present the results of the best and worst prediction obtained in each situation studied sections 3 4 to 3 4 5 present the studies on how the different normalizations can modify the results of the impact wave predictions at last section four presents the conclusions and appendix a presents the fuzzy artmap algorithm 2 fuzzy artmap neural network applied to predict impact waves this work proposes to apply a fuzzy artmap neural network to predict impact waves according to the following steps data pre processing fuzzy artmap neural network training diagnosis phase and methodology evaluation as shown in fig 1 the application method is divided into the steps shown in fig 1 and the following sections describe them with details including information about the data set used there are two phases involved the first one is the training phase and the second one is the diagnosis phase the flowchart shown in fig 3 and the algorithm presented in appendix a describe the two phases of this ann matlab 2015a version 64 bit is used as the simulation environment to implement the ann 2 1 data set treatment from huber a 1980 this work uses the adaptive resonance theory art family of neural networks carpenter et al 1992a to predict impact waves based on the experimental study realized by huber 1980 of zurich university his studies contain experiences with impact waves performed on a masonry horizontal channel dimensions 30 33 m 0 50 m and 0 5 m with a variable declivity ramp 280 to 600 upstream and a wave damping beach declivity of 1 12 to 1 0 downstream allowing the dissipation of the generated waves fig 2 the sliding material used on the test was from granular nature mass of 5 15 30 and 50 kg that by impact have produced waves on the channel the tests generated waves presenting oscillatory pattern until bores waves measured by capacitive sensors along the channel positions x h 5 10 15 and 20 the depths tested on the channel were of 12 18 27 and 36 cm the total quantity of tests executed in huber 1980 were 704 consisting of four sliding masses six declivity ramps four impact velocities four damping shore declivities and four channel depths impact waves are modeled by several independent parameters such as the nondimensional slide volume m nondimensional impact velocity ve of the sliding material or froude impact number f plan inclination sliding slope α propagation relative distance x h where h is the still water depth in the channel downstream inclination β wave propagation direction γ and relative density i e ratio of the density of the sliding material to the density of water ρs ρ and dependent parameters such as the maximum height of the relative wave h h wave relative length λ h wave steepness hi λ ursell number u nondimensional wave velocity propagation fw and the wave period ti g h where g is the gravitational acceleration huber a huber 1980 presented correlation laws with the nondimensional parameters ϕi m f α x h β 0 for a channel and classified waves according to an oscillatory pattern such as sinusoidal cnoidal solitary and bore waves this work uses data referred to huber 1980 considering the depth to be h 0 12 m with nondimensional h h varying from 0 023 to 0 76 and considering 158 experiences these selected data require pre processing this is divided into two steps pre calculation of nondimensional parameters m and f and data filtering 2 1 1 pre calculation the nondimensional parameters m and f are calculated according to equations 1 and 2 before inserting the data into the input matrix 1 m mass ρ s bh 2 volume bh 2 where volume slide volume ρ s density of the sliding material b width of the channel 2 f v e gh 2 1 2 data filtering certain data presented non typical behavior without explanation even after an analysis was performed therefore they were excluded from the data set this non typical behavior is graphically verified in this paper and includes a general analysis of all parameters the excluded data contain no information about the relative height or the length period with the filtering process the data set with 158 experiences was reduced to 74 experiences 50 of it 37 experiences is used for training and the other 50 37 experiences for prediction for tests considering the influence of normalization on the modified parameters as given in table 6 80 of data 59 experiences is used for training and 20 15 experiences for prediction 2 2 fuzzy artmap neural network training phase a fuzzy artmap neural network is used to predict the maximum wave height the architecture of this network can be adapted to several problems and applications therefore despite the high complexity of the present problem this ann can interpret the parameters referred to as impact wave characteristics and provide an adequate analysis the input data for training 37 experiences are randomly selected from the 74 experiences for this step the lines of the matrix were numbered and the numerical order was randomly changed furthermore this work intends to investigate the robustness of this neural network 2 2 1 fuzzy artmap neural network this network is supervised it is composed of two art modules called arta and artb connected by an inter art module based on fuzzy logic carpenter and grossberg 1992 and the principal characteristics of fuzzy artmap are plasticity stability and malleability according to lopes 2005 the plasticity is the capacity to continue learning when including new patterns without losing the memory in relation to the previous patterns while the stability is the capacity to learn by adjusting the weights these two characteristics provide to the neural network a stable learning and a fast convergence furthermore the malleability or flexibility is the capacity of the neural network to be applicable in every area of knowledge lopes 2005 2 2 2 definition of input and output vectors the input data of the neural

the vigilance parameters of modules arta artb interart and prediction respectively pertaining to the interval 0 1 these values when close to 1 force the neural network to be more demanding leading to lose some categories and a low generalization meanwhile values close to zero group similar categories that are not necessarily equal according to lopes 2005 ε is the increment of the vigilance parameter the parameters presented in table 1 were obtained after several tests with the ann such as the least values provide good results allowing more malleability instead of increasing the exigency grade according to what is shown in section 3 4 2 3 diagnostic phase of the fuzzy artmap neural network after the training phase where the neural network groups the input patterns in categories representing by updated weight matrix the diagnosis phase begins during this step new input data are presented and evaluated by the neural network classifying them according to the adapted weight matrix obtained on the training phase the diagnosis phase is conducted according to item ix of the algorithm presented in appendix a at this step the ann can predict the maximum relative height of the impact waves and the results are evaluated in the following section 3 results and discussion comparisons were made between the data of huber 1980 and the predictions obtained by the fuzzy artmap ann the results are presented in tables 2 13 and figs 5 13 the values presented refer to the minimum and maximum mean absolute percentage error mape of the best prediction selected according to a certain criterion from 500 tests the best medium mape is presented on the analysis executed in sections 3 3 to 3 4 5 the values of rmse root mean square error presented in tables 2 13 are referred to the maximum and minimum mapes the rmse measures the behavior of the data furthermore a less value of rmse is not at all associated to a less value of mape it only means that the prediction curve is similar to the experimental data the tests realized do not measure overestimation or under estimation of the predictions however observing figs 5 13 is possible to visualize the overestimations and under estimations 3 1 criterion for evaluation of methodology to evaluate the methodology 500 random tests are conducted on the ann this is done to analyze the robustness of the ann the difference with each one of the 500 tests is due to the input position of each line of the matrix once the data are randomized the evaluation criterion is set according to the following procedure for each execution additional steps a calculation of mape and rmse root mean square error in each experience 7 m a p e n d i 1 m s s r i s p i s r i m s 100 8 r m s e n d i 1 m s s r i s p i 2 m s 1 2 where nd

the forward test using the value obtained according to equation 11 as comparison criterion at the first test as there is no previous one the best result is considered and from this one the comparison begins 11 best prediction min m a p e m e d i u m min r m s e m e d i u m the comparison criterion is chosen after executing tests with the ann using other criteria of selecting the best prediction at first time the minimum mape with each test is used as the criterion however it was not a good criterion once it presents only a very low mape at second time the minimum medium mape is used nevertheless even with a low medium mape the graphical behavior not always matches the experimental data at third time the minimum rmse is used however it only indicates that the curves have a similar behavior which not necessarily was associated to low mapes neither a good prediction at fourth time the medium rmse is used nevertheless the same situation presented when using the minimum rmse was observed at last the option was to join the medium mape and the medium rmse and verify if they were enough to indicate the best prediction within the 500 tests this is confirmed with the chosen criterion presented according to equation 11 fig 4 shows the previous steps observing that the steps described in fig 4 occur after the conclusion of the diagnosis 3 2 normalization the present work also analyzes the influence of the normalization process for the input and output matrices of the ann besides normalization according to mokhtar and howe 2013 the following normalizations were used maximum value of each column equation 12 maximum of the matrix equation 13 summation of each column sum equation 14 and maximum of each row 15 a normalization by the maximum value of each column 12 i i max i j b normalization by the maximum of the matrix 13 i i max i c normalization by summation of each column 14 i i σj i j d normalization by the maximum of each row 15 i i max i i where i input or output matrix i number of rows of matrix i j number of columns of matrix i an increase of 20 above the maximum values for the standardized data is considered this procedure allows the ann to analyze situations with values higher than the maximum presented in the training data set 3 3 prediction of the maximum relative height for h 0 12 m 3 3 1 results for fuzzy artmap ann without data filtering sf this test executes 158 experiences instead of 74 experiences chosen after filtering where 50 of data are for training and 50 are for prediction the parameters of the ann are according to table 1 and the input matrix is given in equation 3 table 2 presents the results of the minimum and maximum mapes of the best prediction result of the ann among 500 tests although the ann could predict part of the data there were some inconsistencies this is due to the presence of non typical data it is expected that the maximum heights exhibit a descending trend fig 5 a i e as the impact wave evolves and is attenuated on the channel the waves tend to decrease unlike what is shown in fig 5 b for the experimental results the maximum mape is 36 7 the minimum is 0 329 and the medium is 6 55 indicating the need to filter the input data an analysis of the rmse shows that the best prediction has an rmse value close to zero indicating that the ann could predict the trend of the data nicely however when its predictions become inconsistent the rmse value is close to 0 13 according to table 2 3 3 2 fuzzy artmap ann with data filtering fi further tests were conducted after filtering the data with 74 experiences 50 of which were used for training and 50 for prediction the training parameters and the matrices were unchanged table 3 presents the results of the minimum and maximum mapes an analysis of the results of this test and those of the previous one shows a reduction in the maximum mape from 36 75 to 20 59 the minimum mape is maintained in 0 32 and a reduction in the medium mape from 6 55 to 5 39 this reduction in the medium mape indicates that more data are close to the expected values than in the previous case an analysis of the rmse shows that predictions are in close agreement to the trends in experimental data as shown in fig 6 a and 6 b 3 3 3 results of fuzzy artmap ann with filtering and without the input of water depth h sh this test also uses 74 experiences out of which 50 data are used for training and 50 are used for prediction however the input matrix given in equation 3 is modified by eliminating the column referred to as h therefore the simulation executes for f m α β without the still water depth input h this parameter is removed to verify the parameters that have a greater influence on the predictions and to demonstrate the behavior of the ann table 4 presents the results referring to the minimum and maximum mapes little improvement is observed in the prediction results in comparison with the previous analysis considering a maximum mape of 16 0 a minimum mape of 0 60 and a medium mape of 5 29 according to fig 6 the behavior improves as the rmse is closer to zero with respect to the minimum mape fig 7 a and close to 0 05 with respect to the maximum mape fig 7 b based on this information the parameter h presents no significant influence on the prediction other tests were also conducted by eliminating parameters related to the inclined slope and downstream area these results also show no significant influence on the predictions and therefore were considered not important for analysis 3 3 4 results of the fuzzy artmap ann with filtering and only the nondimensional slide volume m am this test is realized only with the nondimensional slide volume m as a last search for the nondimensional parameter that is useful for prediction the input matrix is modified to one with 74 rows and single column the percentages of data used for training and prediction and the ann parameters remain unchanged the minimum and maximum mapes are presented in table 5 the ann exhibits a maximum mape of 16 2 minimum of 0 249 and medium of 5 12 showing little improvement when compared with the previous tests considering the behavior of the curves the rmses are close to zero and 0 05 as seen in fig 8 a and 8 b respectively these results are similar to those of the previous analysis the influence of froude number f on the ann behavior in predicting the maximum height was also verified although the ann could predict the data the maximum mape was 24 94 the minimum mape was 0 06 and the medium mape was 8 48 these results demonstrate that this parameter on its own is not enough to obtain a satisfactory prediction when compared to the results obtained using only the nondimensional slide volume m particularly in the case of impact waves generated by the fall of granular material considering both the analyses it is observed that information on the nondimensional slide volume m was enough to undertake the predictions which confirms the conclusion drawn by huber 1980 who stated that the maximum height of a wave could be predicted only using this parameter 3 4 influence of normalization on the determination of maximum heights the influence of normalizing the input and output matrices of the ann was investigated the matrices were normalized according to the five forms described in section 3 2 by assuming that the input and output matrices must be normalized using the same form the analyses were conducted with filtered data and the results of these tests are presented in sections 3 4 1 to 3 4 5 tests were conducted considering the normalization of the input and output matrices with different parameters as given in table 6 the changed conditions correspond to the values that the ann requires to obtain an accurate prediction in comparison with the original conditions note that in these changed conditions 80 of data are used for training and 20 for prediction the values of the mapes are listed in tables 7 and 8 along with a comparison of the five forms used to normalize the parameters table 6 based on the previous analysis normalization defined by mokhtar and howe 2013 as well as mle sml normalization present good results when compared to the others 3 4 1 normalization by the maximum of input and output matrices mes normalization is conducted according to equation 13 at first a test was realized with original parameters of the ann using 50 of the data for training the maximum mape is 95 10 the minimum mape is 1 15 and the medium mape is 16 21 these are not satisfactory when compared with the normalization chosen for the approached problem normalization sle sn to obtain a better prediction the training parameters were changed according to table 6 while the percentage of data used for training was increased to 80 table 9 presents the values of mape for the changed conditions and a comparison of experimental and prediction curves is presented in fig 9 a and b in the changed situation the maximum mape is 33 35 the minimum mape is 1 79 and the medium mape is 12 35 these are higher than the expected values in comparison with the chosen normalization sle sn this behavior is not considered satisfactory therefore a second test using a different normalization form is executed 3 4 2 normalization realized by the maximum of each column mc this test realizes normalization by the maximum of each one of the columns either for the input or the output matrix according to equation 12 the maximum mape is 45 72 the minimum mape is zero and the medium mape is 15 41 even with minimum mape equal to zero the results are far from expected when analyzing the value of medium mape in this way a changed situation was also analyzed the results are presented in table 10 and fig 10 a and b considering the changed situation the ann presents a maximum mape of 29 44 a minimum of zero and a medium of 10 30 based on these results and data presented in table 10 this normalization when compared with the chosen one sle sn has higher mapes 3 4 3 normalization by the sum of the column sc the third investigation is realized considering normalization by the sum of each column of the input and output matrices according to equation 14 the maximum mape is 127 6 the minimum is zero and the medium is 14 90 proving that this normalization is not adequate for the problem due to the high values of maximum and medium mapes the change in the parameters of the ann was also investigated and the results are presented in table 11 and fig 11 a and b this changed situation is better than the previous one with a maximum mape of 16 81 minimum of 1 79 and medium of 7 72 however compared with the chosen normalization the normalization by the sum of the columns is not adequate for the problem even with the changed conditions table 11 left side and table 9 left side are identical this is due to an increase in the training percentages and the modification of the training parameters of the ann 3 4 4 normalization by the maximum of the row ml the fourth investigation was the normalization of the maximum of each row either on the input or output matrices according to equation 15 considering the pattern the maximum mape of the ann is 16 86 minimum is 0 70 and medium is 6 97 compared with the other normalizations this shows the best results however the medium mape shows that the predictions are still far from the expected the results for the changed conditions were also analyzed and are presented in table 12 and fig 12 a and b for the changed conditions the ann obtains a maximum mape of 11 09 a minimum of 0 70 and a medium of 2 33 there is an improvement with respect to the original conditions when compared to the medium mape of the chosen normalization but the minimum and maximum mapes are still higher 3 4 5 normalization according to carpenter 1992 mokhtar and howe 2013 with modified parameters ca for comparison the chosen normalization is analyzed for the changed conditions and the results are presented in table 13 and fig 13 a and 13 b comparing the two last normalizations by the maximum of the rows and according to mokhtar and howe 2013 the mokhtar and howe 2013 normalization is better when analyzing the maximum mape 11 09 and 8 99 respectively minimum 0 70 and 0 33 and medium 2 33 and 3 82 both are adequate to the problem under analysis it is emphasized that when analyzing all the situations normalization mokhtar and howe 2013 is the chosen one 4 conclusions this study is based on the works developed by huber 1980 santos et al 2016 and panizzo et al 2005 with a new approach using fuzzy artmap neural network to determine the evolution of the maximum heights of impact waves instead of using multilayer perceptron a common approach to sea wave problems the experimental data used for the input and output matrices come from huber 1980 which study contains one of the most important experimental database for impact waves after some preliminary analysis it was observed the need for filtering once there were some inconsistencies after executing the first tests considering the criterion of the best prediction the minimum mape it is verified that this criterion is not adequate for the problem new criteria were investigated until obtaining the adequate one the medium mape the minimum rmse medium mape and the medium rmse the criterion chosen for the best prediction is the medium mape and medium rmse another important procedure to improve the results is to randomly input the data to the ann although they are not presented in this study better and worse situations existed depending on the randomness however even after several executions the ann is stable and exhibits consistent results literature provides several works using the normalization according to mokhtar and howe 2013 however this work opts to investigate other normalization forms such that lead to best predictions five normalizations were tested including the one of mokhtar and howe 2013 the objective was to verify if changing the training parameters they could lead to best answers executing the tests with the original and modified parameters considering the five normalizations applied the conclusion is that normalizations me sm mce smc sce ssc were not adequate for the approaching problem nevertheless normalizations mle sml and sle sn present good results either with the original or modified parameters these two normalizations present the least maximum medium and minimum mapes therefore they are adequate for the approaching problem it was observed that in several analyzed situations the medium mape presented value close to the minimum mape indicating that the predictions obtained by ann were very close to the experimental data but the training parameters need to be further explored and the process to better answers needs to be further analyzed the rmse values show that the chosen ann is able to make the prediction curves consistent with the experimental ones thus predicting the wave behavior these two conclusions emphasize the ability of the fuzzy artmap neural network to predict the behavior of the impact waves comparing the results obtained from the experiences of huber 1980 with the predictions by fuzzy artmap ann the latter was found to predict the data related to the maximum waves heights with good precision the results and predictions of maximum heights could be applied to other depths based on the data that were explored and presented in non dimensional form and in situations of generating waves in channel 1d such as h h as function of m bh2 the proposed paper considers the analysis of h h h fixed in 12 cm depth the same way it is emphasized that such results must be used for predicting maximum waves within the non dimensional parameter range tested experimentally by huber 1980 such as 0 5 fr 4 and 0 023 hi h 0 76 fuzzy artmap neural network is a powerful tool to predict the characteristic parameter of impact waves evolution of the maximum heights although the ann is able to obtain significant results other situations still need to be analyzed and explored thus more significant results can be obtained this study can in the future help to develop an alert system that predicts the occurrence of catastrophes caused by impact waves therefore becoming a system that helps to prevent disasters funding information this study was financed in party by the coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior brasil capes finance code 001 são paulo state

21972,when the ship propeller works besides non uniform flow field can generate exciting force shaft vibration can also cause the propeller to produce exciting force this type of force can usually be expressed as a combination of additional mass force and additional damping force the purpose of this paper is to study this type of force first based on boundary element method bem and combined with rotordynamics theories the new prediction model of the exciting force induced by shaft vibration is established second the model and codes are validated by some numerical and experiment examples at last the axial exciting force induced by the axial shafting vibration is investigated the results show that when the vibration amplitude is small or the vibration frequency is low the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak so that the exciting force is proportional to the vibration amplitude and square to the vibration frequency this means that the real part and imaginary part of the exciting force can be equivalent to constant added mass and added damping respectively by a series calculation of different propellers the simplified estimation formula of the axial exciting force in linear state is proposed and validated keywords propeller exciting force induced by shaft vibration propeller boundary element method nonlinear wake vortex 1 introduction when marine propeller works in water exciting forces are inevitably generated this is because the propeller usually operates in a spatially nonuniform wake due to the hull stern surrounding flow inclined shaft and unsteady sea conditions and so on therefore changes of flow angle of attack lead to rapid changes of pressure distribution on the blade which will cause propeller exciting forces the propeller exciting forces will cause vibrations of blades as well as the propulsion shaft system and even the hull vibrations transmitted via the surrounding fluid and the propulsion shaft system itself carlton 2012 vibrations can result in fatigue failure of the ship components and have a bad influence on the normal operation of the ship meanwhile discomfort to passengers and crew is greatly increased due to the radiated noise which is also generated by vibrations therefore in the design stage of the propulsion shaft system how to reduce the exciting forces of propellers and how to optimize their transmission path to the hull through the shaft should be considered this is a very complicated problem because there are some complex coupling effects among fluid propeller and shafting so to solve this problem it needs to establish a fluid structure interaction fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system and to investigate the fsi dynamic characteristics between fluid propeller and shafting and to reveal the law that how fluid propeller shafting and their coupling factors influence the exciting force of propeller and its transmission path to the hull however there is hardly any literature to build a fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system because it is very difficult most studies only analyze the fsi dynamic characteristic of the fluid propeller system where the blade root is usually regarded to be fixed in structural response analysis therefore the effects of the shaft vibrations on the propeller and fluid are ignored hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 young 2007 2008 we think there mainly exist three kinds of coupling effects in the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system namely the fluid solid coupling effect between propellers and fluid the elastic coupling effect between propellers and shafting zou et al 2019 and the feedback effect between fluid and shafting therefore the fsi dynamic model of the whole system could be broken down into three sub problems by us as shown in fig 1 the first sub problem is the fsi dynamic analysis between fluid and propellers which includes the prediction of the pressure distribution on the blade the calculation of natural frequencies of blades and the evaluation of deformation and stress of blades and so on the second sub problem is the coupling dynamic analysis about the propeller shaft bearings system which includes the calculation of systems natural frequencies checking the reaction forces of bearing and evaluation of the unbalance response and so on the third sub problem is the feedback effect analyses between the shafting and fluid which includes the feedback effects of shaft vibrations on the fluid and so on we think the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system can be built only if all these three sub problems are solved and investigated so far the first and second sub problems are widely studied by scholars he et al 2012 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 qi et al 2016 young 2007 2008 young and savander 2011 zou et al 2015 2016b but the research on the third sub problem is insufficient in fact the shaft vibrations will drive the propeller to make the complex space movement which stimulates fluid oscillating of the interface between the propeller and its wake and then it further produces the exciting forces the generation of these exciting forces means feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid some scholars used added water mass to simulate these exciting forces they simplified the propeller into a thin disk and proposed an approximate added mass calculation method fahy 2001 merz et al 2009a 2009b 2013 pan et al 2002 in fact in addition to the added mass forces these exciting forces also contain forces similar to damping 1 1 previous work to determine the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller operated in water some numerical methods are used such as lifting line theory su and huang 2013 lifting surface theory bramesfeld 2006 boundary element method kim et al 2015 bem or panel method and computational fluid dynamics cfd balaras et al 2015 in lifting line theory the geometry of the propeller blade is not directly dealt with and the kinematic boundary condition on the propeller surface is not satisfied so it leads to some errors lifting surface theory uses a discrete vortex representation of the blade on the mean camber surface where the kinematic boundary condition is satisfied so the prediction of the pressure distribution on the blade is not accurate enough in cfd the fluid surrounding the structure is discretized with finite volume similar to those used in fem the major disadvantages of this method are that it needs lots of cpu time and memory in the generation of an effective fluid model even though the viscous flow analysis gives a more accurate solution the bem overcomes these disadvantages and is widely used for the analysis of marine propellers greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2012 2015 so in this study the bem is applied to determine the secondary exciting forces of propellers induced by the shaft vibrations at present there are many studies on exciting forces caused by spatially nonuniform inflow abbas et al 2015 krasilnikov et al 2009 liefvendahl and troeng 2011 liu et al 2009 shu et al 2016 wei and wang 2013 but the researches related to the exciting forces induced by the shaft vibrations are insufficient some scholars have investigated the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller due to the unsteady motions of a ship kinnas et al 2012 politis 2011 shu et al 2017 mao and young 2016 studied the added mass and damping of propellers by using the lifting line theory and their works could provide some references for our study in our previous paper zou et al 2017 a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft system has been established the hydroelastic performances of propellers such as natural frequency of blades and dynamic stress of blades also have been studied however only the first and second sub problems as shown in fig 1 are considered in the fsi model the feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid the third sub problem are ignored therefore based on our previous study this research can make a further supplement to it and will aim to study the third sub problem 1 2 objective of the present work at present the study of the exciting force induced by shaft vibration is not sufficient so it brings some problems in some aspects such as how to establish a fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft systems and how to study the level of vibrations of the marine and so on therefore the purpose of this work is to study the feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid to be more specific it is to construct a mathematical model that can calculate the propeller excitation force induced by the vibration of the shafting our work could pave the way for establishing the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system for investigating the fsi dynamic characteristics between fluid propeller and shafting and for optimizing the exciting forces of propellers and their transmission path to the hull in the future 2 mathematical formulations in this study the prediction method of propeller exciting forces is determined by a low order potential based bem because the shaft vibrations drive the propeller to make the complex space movement the evaluation model based on the bem used by many scholars baltazar and de campos 2010 young 2008 young and savander 2011 zou et al 2017 should be made a few modifications including the mathematical description of the shaft vibrations the zero normal flow boundary condition on the propeller surface the use of the modified unsteady bernoulli equation and the construction of a wake model and so on the detailed description of the formulation and implementation is provided below 2 1 theories of rotordynamics because the marine propulsion shafting is also a rotation machine it is suitable to describe its complex space vibrations with the help of rotordynamics theories the reason calling them the complex space vibrations is because the shaft makes axial vibrations torsion vibrations and lateral vibrations simultaneously and there are coupling phenomena among different types of vibrations such as lateral torsional coupling vibrations hua et al 2017 lateral axial coupling vibrations zou et al 2016a 2016b and so on when the shaft rotates in the bearing clearance space it has two kinds of motions as shown in fig 2 zhang 1990 namely the spin around the center of the shaft and the precession around the center of the bearing in the theories of rotordynamics the precession motion is also called the whirl motion in fact the whirl orbit is just the amplitude of lateral vibrations in order to describe the motions of the shaft two coordinate systems are introduced in rotordynamics including the inertial frame o x y z the body coordinate system o x y z which rotates with the blade and the y axis coincides with the reference line of the key blade it assumes that the vibration displacements at the end of the shaft namely at the propeller could be expressed as x u v w θ x θ y θ z t which are defined in the inertial frame o x y z as shown in fig 2 and represent the axial the lateral and the torsion vibrations it could be known from the rotordynamics theory that θ y v x and θ z w x accordingly the vibration velocities at the end of the shaft are v s u v w and ω s θ x θ y θ z which represent the translation velocities and the rotation velocities respectively in rotordynamics theories the relationship between o x y z and o x y z could be described by using projection angle as shown in fig 3 zhang 1990 if the propeller s spin axis o x is projected onto the x y plane then the angle between the projected line and the o x axis is θ y similarly if o x axis is projected onto the x z plane then the angle between the projected line and the o x axis is θ z then the displacement and velocity transformation from the inertial frame o x y z to the body coordinate system o x y z can be expressed as 1 x y z t x u y v z w x y z t x y z when the vibration amplitudes are not large namely θ y and θ z are very small then using the angle transformation theories in rotordynamics and ignoring the infinitesimal of high order t can be approximately expressed as zhang 1990 2 t 1 θ y 2 2 θ z 2 2 θ y θ z θ y 1 θ y 2 2 θ y θ z 2 θ z θ y θ z 2 1 θ z 2 2 1 0 0 0 cos φ sin φ 0 sin φ cos φ where φ ω t θ x and ω is the spin velocity of the propeller from eq 1 and eq 2 the transformation between the inertial frame o x y z and the body coordinate system o x y z has been established which only depends on the vibration displacements of the end of the shaft therefore if the vibration displacements of the shaft at the end are known then the variables in these two coordinate systems could transfer each other easily to avoid the need for a moving mesh so the fluid problem is solved by bem in o x y z coordinate system and many variables should be transformed into it then eq 1 and eq 2 would be used regularly in next section 2 2 boundary integral equation in this study the cavitation is not considered as shown in fig 4 consider a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 which is defined in the inertial frame o x y z so in the body coordinate system o x y z using eq 1 the inflow velocity v i n on the propeller surface can be written as 3 v i n t v 0 v s ω ω s r where r is the position vector of the point q on the propeller surface s b from this equation it is seen that if the vibration displacements x the vibration velocities v s and ω s are all zero then eq 3 is consistent with the traditional expression in which the vibrations of the shaft are ignored su and huang 2013 the flow field perturbed by the propeller can be characterized by a perturbation velocity potential φ in the o x y z coordinate system it is also satisfied the laplace equation joseph katz 2001 4 2 φ 0 on the propeller surface s b kinematic boundary condition should be satisfied namely the zero normal velocity on the propeller surface s b this can be written as joseph katz 2001 5 φ n q v i n n q o n s b where n q is the unit normal vector of the propeller surface s b and v i n is the inflow velocity determined by eq 3 for eq 4 applying green s identity perturbation velocity potential at field point p x y z placed on the propeller surface s b can be written as a distribution of source and doublet over the boundary surface su and huang 2013 6 2 π φ p s b φ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ φ q 1 n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b v i n n q 1 r p q d s where q 1 is any point on the wake surface s w and δ φ q 1 is potential jump across the wake surface which strength and location are introduced in the next section 2 3 wake model at present for prediction of hydrodynamic performances of propellers there are some linear geometry models of wake to use by making some assumptions such as kerwin s contraction and roll up wake model kerwin and lee 1978 and su s equal pitch surface wake model su and huang 2013 because the geometry of the wake is assumed it is also called fixed wake model which is proved to be effective and is widely used but for the case where the propeller makes complex spatial motion this fixed wake model may not be suitable in theory trailing vortex leaves from the trailing edge of the blade and flows into the slipstream with the local velocity at that position therefore the geometry of the wake is determined by satisfying the force free condition this means that the wake should be aligned with the circumferentially averaged inflow at every time step this is called free wake model and there are also many studies greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2015 lee et al 2012 therefore in this paper the free wake model is used because the free wake model is a relatively mature technique the modeling process is not introduced in this paper and could be referred to some literature greco et al 2014 joseph katz 2001 kinnas et al 2015 however because compared to the previous studies the shaft vibrations are considered here there are still some details to be paid attention to in the free wake mode as shown in fig 5 the vortices shedding are generated at each time interval δ t at the beginning the propeller is stationary and no vortices are shed at the first time step δ t the trailing edge of the propeller moves a distance by v i n δ t and then the first vortex is shed therefore the length of the first vortex is also v i n δ t where v i n includes the effective inflow wake v 0 the angle velocities ω of the propeller the vibration velocities v s and vibration angle velocities ω s of the shaft at the propeller it is described in the body coordinate system o x y z and obtained by eq 3 v s and ω s are described by theories of rotordynamics and from fig 2 it is known that they could be expressed as v s u v w and ω s θ x θ y θ z if v s and ω s are all zero then the treatment of the free wake is consistent with the previous studies in which the vibrations of the shaft are ignored greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2015 the strength of the first vortex is determined by morino kutta condition morino and kuo 1974 at the second time step 2 δ t the second vortex is shed the first vortex sheet whose strength is unchanged moves with the local stream velocity this process is repeated until the required time step is calculated 2 4 numerical calculation process the boundary integral equation 6 is hard to solve analytically for complex geometry so a numerical solution is obtained by dividing the surface including the propeller surface and wake surface into a number of small elements where constant strength dipoles and sources are distributed the panel arrangements are shown as in fig 6 only one blade and its wake surfaces are shown it is assumed that the number of panels on one blade and corresponding hub surface is n p the number of blades is z and the total calculation time step is n t so at the i t time step the boundary integral equation 6 can be written as a system of linear algebraic equations 7 k 1 z j 1 n p c i j k φ j k t k 1 z m 1 n r w i m 1 k δ φ m 1 k t k 1 z j 1 n p b i j k v i n n q j k k 1 z m 1 n r l 2 i t w i m l k δ φ m l k t i 1 2 z n p i t 1 2 n t where δ φ m 1 k is potential jump across the vortex surface which is shed from the trailing edge at the current time step i t and its strength is unknown and determined by morino kutta condition δ φ m l k is potential jump which is shed at the previous time step and its strength is also known at the previous time step c i j k w i m l k and b i j k are influence coefficients and can be defined as 8 c i j k 1 2 π s j k n j k 1 r i j k d s j k w i m l 1 2 π s m l k n m l k 1 r i m l k d s m l k b i j k 1 2 π s j k 1 r i j k d s j k all these influence coefficients c i j k w i m l k and b i j k could be calculated by morino s analytical formulation morino and kuo 1974 eq 7 can be more generally expressed in matrix form as 9 a t φ t r h s t where a is defined as 10 a i j k c i j k i f p a n e l i s n o t a t t e c i j k w i m 1 k i f p a n e l i s a t t e where sign depends on whether the panel is at the upper suction side or the lower side pressure side of blade trailing edge once the perturbation velocity potential φ is solved then in the body coordinate system o x y z the pressure on the propeller surface can be expressed by unsteady bernoulli s equation as joseph katz 2001 11 p p 0 ρ 1 2 v i n 2 φ t 1 2 v 2 where p 0 is static pressure at infinity ρ is the density of water v is the total velocity of a point on the propeller surface which could be written as v v i n φ therefore in the body coordinate system o x y z the total exciting forces can be calculated by 12 f x i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t n x j k s j k m x i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t z j k n y j k y j k n

t y j k n x j k x j k n y j k s j k where n x j k n y j k and n z j k are the normal vector of the j t h panel for the k t h blade x j k y j k and z j k are the coordinates of the j t h panel for the k t h blade s j k is the area of the j t h panel for the k t h blade and all these variables are expressed in the body coordinate system o x y z the total exciting forces can be transformed into the inertial frame o x y z using eq 1 the solution procedure is described schematically by the flowchart of fig 7 in principle at each time step the inflow velocity v i n is calculated by eq 3 the location of the latest wake panel is established and the r h s t vector is calculated the influence coefficient matrix a t is also calculated at each time step but the c i j k is only calculated during the first time step then the perturbation velocity potential φ can be solved by eq 9 once the perturbation velocity potential is obtained the pressures and total exciting forces are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 at the end of each time step the corner point locations of every wake panel are updated 3 code validation in present work the solution is implemented in matlab so it is very necessary to validate the model established currently and codes by some numerical and experiment examples in this section three examples are analyzed to validate our model and codes including prediction of open water performance of propellers under uniform inflow prediction of unsteady pressure of propellers under nonuniform inflow and prediction of exciting forces of propellers under simple motion next these three examples would be introduced in detail respectively 3 1 prediction of open water performance for propellers under uniform inflow the first example is to calculate the steady pressure distributions of the propeller 4119 under the design advance coefficient propeller 4119 is a three blade no skewed propeller and the detail geometry parameters and experiment data come from the reference jessup 1989 it must be pointed out that the shaft vibration velocities v s and ω s in eq 3 need to be set to zero in the process of calculation the calculated and experiment results are shown in fig 8 it is seen that the prediction pressure distributions on the blade have a very good agreement with the measured data except at the edge of the blade the reasons are that it exists very complex flow phenomena in the edge of the blade for example the tip vortex and leading edge vortex separation which are not considered in present prediction model meanwhile the prediction results have higher accuracy than the results in fig 8 of our previous paper zou et al 2017 this is because the fixed wake model is used in the previous paper fig 9 is the open water characteristics of propeller 4119 it is also known that the thrust and torsion coefficients have a very good agreement with the experiment data and the lower the advance coefficient is the larger the errors are this is because the flow separation occurs easily at low advance coefficient su and huang 2013 but this phenomenon does not include in our model 3 2 the prediction of unsteady pressure for propellers under nonuniform inflow the second example is to calculate the unsteady pressure distributions of a five blade highly skewed propeller seiun maru under nonuniform inflow the detail geometry parameters and experiment data come from the reference hoshino 1998 the fluctuation pressure of a specified point at the chord and radial position during one revolution is compared similarly the shaft vibration velocities v s and ω s in eq 3 also need to be set to zero in the process of calculation the results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 it is seen that the prediction fluctuation pressure distributions have a very good agreement with the measured data and the calculation of hoshino 1993 it is also seen that the prediction accuracy is higher than the results in figs 9 and 10 of our previous paper zou et al 2017 the reason is explained in section 3 1 3 3 the prediction of exciting force for propellers under simple motion the third example is to calculate the unsteady thrust and torsion of a five blade no skewed propeller 4381 undergoing surge motion in uniform inflow the detail geometry parameters of propeller 4381 come from the reference carlton 2012 the fluctuation thrust and torsion coefficients of the propeller during one revolution are compared with the reference kinnas et al 2012 the results are shown in fig 12 it is seen that our results have a very good agreement with the calculation of the reference to sum up from these three examples it can be found that there is a very good accuracy between our solutions and the experiment data or other scholars calculation results suggesting the validity of the current exciting force prediction model and codes 4 analysis of the axial exciting forces characteristics in this section the exciting forces of propellers induced by the shaft vibrations would be analyzed a five blade skewed propeller of 4382 which is used widely in marine is used as a research example its design advance coefficient j is 0 889 and the diameter is assumed to be 5 m the primary geometries are given in reference carlton 2012 and are shown in fig 13 from fig 2 it is known that the shaft vibrations have six degrees of freedom and then in these directions would cause six kinds of exciting forces but the axial exciting forces are most concerned by engineers because they are the main reasons for the marine vibrations transmission through the thrust bearing merz et al 2009b pan et al 2002 so to save space as a representative only the axial exciting forces are investigated it is assumed that the axial vibration of the shaft at the propeller is 13 u a sin 2 π f t where u is the axial vibration a is the vibration amplitude f is the vibration frequency hz in this study the rotational speed of the propeller is always 120 rpm and the inflow velocity v 0 is set to be about 8 89 m s to ensure that the advance coefficient j be 0 889 the exciting forces is dimensionless using the following equation 14 f x ρ r 4 f s 2 f x m x ρ r 5 f s 2 m x where ρ is the density of water kgm 3 r is the radius of the propeller m and f s is the rotation frequency of the propeller in this study it is always 2 hz 4 1 evaluation of axial exciting force first it is assumed that a is 50 μm and f is 10 hz namely the vibration frequency is the blade passing frequency bpf because the propeller has five blades bpf is five times rotational frequency these axial vibration parameters of the shaft come from the experiment data chen 1987 so according to u 2 π f a cos 2 π f t the amplitude of vibration velocity is about 0 0031 m s in calculation it is also assumed the inflow is uniform to remove the interference of the exciting forces caused by nonuniform flow the solution procedure is described schematically by the flowchart of fig 7 when dividing panels the number of chordal divisions n s is 25 and the number of radial divisions n r is 30 the time step size is δ θ 1 six cycles are calculated to make sure that the transient solutions decay to zero so the total calculation time steps n t are 2160 6 360 first the convergence of the computational model is studied in this model it mainly involves the convergence of the number of grids the time step size and the total calculation time steps therefore the influence of these parameters on the calculation results is mainly studied fig 14 a is a comparison of calculation results when the blades are divided into different grid numbers fig 14 b is a comparison of calculation results at different time step sizes and fig 15 is the results at different total calculation time steps as can be seen from these figures the difference between them is very small indicating that the number of grids the time step size and the total calculation time steps selected in this study are all convergent to the calculation results from fig 15 a it also can be seen that the exciting force fluctuates widely at the start stage and are stable rapidly after one revolution therefore the results of the last lap which are stable are shown in the following discussion fig 16 is the axial and torsional exciting forces due to the axial vibration given in eq 13 from this figure it is known that the axial vibration would cause the axial and torsion exciting force and the frequency of exciting force is the same with the axial vibration frequency in order to show the amplitude relationship between excitation force caused by shafting vibration and static thrust then the ordinate in fig 16 is set to the ratios of fluctuating forces and moments to the mean thrust f t and torque m t it is known that the amplitudes account for about 3 2 of the static thrust and static torque this magnitude is approximately the same level as the axial exciting forces caused by the non uniform flow field zou 2017 fig 17 and fig 18 are the transverse and vertical exciting forces and moments due to the axial vibration from these figures it can be seen that although there is an exciting force on each blade the summing exciting force is zero so there exists certain relationship among the phase angles for the exciting forces of different blades which could make the summing exciting force offset each other therefore it can be concluded that the alone axial vibration of the shaft can not induce the transverse and vertical exciting forces and moments it should be pointed out that the cross flow phenomenon in the flow field has been neglected so this conclusion is more suitable for situations where the cross flow phenomenon is weak or absent 4 2 relationship between the axial exciting force and axial vibration in order to study the influence of the axial vibration amplitude and frequency on the axial exciting force further four working conditions are calculated in order to investigate the relationship between the axial vibration frequency and axial exciting force it is assumed that the vibration amplitude of the shaft system is 50 μm in the first group and 150 μm in the second group and remains unchanged the rotational frequency of the shaft is 2 hz and also remains unchanged make the axial vibration frequency be equal to 2 hz rotation frequency 4 hz two times rotation frequency 10 hz blade passing frequency bpf 20 hz two times bpf respectively similarly to investigate the relationship between the axial vibration amplitude and axial exciting force in the third and the forth group the vibration frequency of the shaft system is assumed to be 10 hz bpf and 20 hz respectively and remains unchanged make the axial vibration amplitude be equal to 50 μm 100 μm 150 μm 200 μm respectively take the stable results the results of the last revolution for analysis the excitation forces generated by the vibration of the shafting will have a phase difference from the vibration of the shafting therefore the analysis of these excitation forces should include the amplitude and phase or the real part and the imaginary part in engineering the real part is usually assumed to be an additional mass force and the imaginary part is assumed to be an additional damping force under the linear assumption they have the following relationship 15 m a re f x 4 π 2 f 2 a c a im f x 2 π f a where m a and c a are added mass and added damping respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 19 to fig 22 in order to explore the internal relation further a curve fitting method is adopted for these data the polynomial fitting is used and the fitting formulas are also obtained shown in fig 19 to fig 22 from these figures it can be seen that the exciting forces including the real part and the imaginary part are in proportion to the vibration amplitude and in square relation to the vibration frequency this shows that the nonlinear effect of the free wake model described in section 2 3 is weak under the calculation parameters selected in this study in engineering the reaction forces of shafting vibration to fluid are usually simplified into two parts additional mass force the real part and additional damping force the imaginary part therefore this also means that when the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak the equivalent added mass does not change with the vibration amplitude and frequency of the shafting and the equivalent added damping does not change with the vibration amplitude and is proportional to the vibration frequency of the shafting further fig 23 to fig 26 show the variation of added mass and added damping with the amplitude and frequency of shafting vibration it can be foreseen that there exists strong nonlinear effect if the vibration amplitude of the shaft becomes large enough and there also appears flow separation phenomenon on the surface of the blades at this time the excitation forces may no longer be in direct proportion to the vibration amplitude of the shafting and may no longer be in square relation to the vibration frequency of the shafting the equivalent additional mass and additional damping will also be nonlinear however the very large axial vibration amplitude is not realistic in practical engineering chen 1987 and also outranges the research of this study 4 3 simplified estimation formula of the axial exciting forces further a series propellers of different geometry parameters about 63 propellers with different radii blade number pitch ratios and blade area ratios are calculated the calculation results also show that the exciting forces are related to these geometry parameters such as radii blade number pitch ratios blade area ratios and skew angle so the simplified equation that estimates the exciting forces is proposed using regression and dimensional analysis the estimating equation can be expressed as 16 re f x ρ r 4 f s 2 a r f r 2 z r a 1 a 2 p d a 3 a e o a 4 p d a e o a 5 p d 2 a 6 a e o 2 im f x ρ r 4 f s 2 a r f r 2 z r b 1 b 2 p d b 3 a e o b 4 p d a e o b 5 p d 2 b 6 a e o 2 where a r a d which is the ratio of vibration amplitude a mm to propeller diameter d m f r f f s which is the ratio of vibration frequency f hz to propeller rotation frequency f s hz z r z 5 which is the ratio of the number of blade z to the blade base number take the number of blades as 5 p d is the pitch ratio of blades at 0 7 radius a e o is the disc area a 1 to a 6 and b 1 to b 6 are the coefficients the ranges of their values and the recommended values are shown in table 1 from eq 15 the corresponding additional mass and additional damping can be expressed as 17 m a ρ d 3 z r 64 π 2 a 1 a 2 p d a 3 a e o a 4 p d a e o a 5 p d 2 a 6 a e o 2 c a ρ d 3 f z r 32 π b 1 b 2 p d b 3 a e o b 4 p d a e o b 5 p d 2 b 6 a e o 2 in order to test the estimated accuracy of the simplified estimation formula the axial exciting forces of some propellers are evaluated by direct calculation as shown in fig 7 and by estimation formula using eq 16 then the results are compared the diameter of these propellers is assumed to be 5 m vibration amplitude a is 200 μm and vibration frequency f is 10 hz the calculation results are shown in fig 27 the relative errors between these two calculation methods are defined as follows 18 e r r o r s f d f e f d 100 where f d is the exciting force by the direct calculation and f e is the results by the simplified estimation formula from fig 27 it can be seen that the simplified formula has high accuracy for some propellers and the relative error is only 1 37 the real part for propeller 4679 but the relative errors are large for other propellers such as 18 28 the real part for propeller 4119 this is because the estimation formula is proposed taking into account the geometric characteristics of many propellers and is sensitive to the geometry parameters especially the pitch ratios however in these propellers the pitch ratios are uneven distribution and the number of propellers whose pitch ratios are between 0 95 and 1 1 is limited therefore the relative error of this type propeller is large such as p4119 after the relative errors census it is showed that this formula could have higher accuracy for the propellers whose pitch ratios are larger than 1 2 or are smaller than 0 9 the simplified estimation formula does not consider the effect of the skew angle there are two reasons first the calculation results show that if the skew angle is less than 60 then it has small effect on exciting force compared to the other geometry parameters such as the pitch ratios the disc area and so on so when the skew angle is not large ignoring the skew angle will bring small relative errors second if the skew angle is considered then the form of eq 16 should change the polynomial may not be suitable it is very complex so to simplify the skew angle is ignored although this simplified formula will bring some errors in any case this simplified formula can provide a preliminary estimation for the axial exciting force in engineering and is more suitable for the propeller with small skew angle so it also has some practical value it also should be noted that this simplified formula is put forward based on the rigid propeller if the propeller has large deformation this formula should be improved further and this job will be done in the future 5 conclusions in this study the new prediction model of the exciting forces induced by the shaft vibrations is established based on bem and rotordynamics theories in time domain this model could consider some nonlinear factors such as the nonlinear wake vortex and the sudden movement of the shafting and then the model is validated by some examples at last the characteristics of the axial exciting forces are analyzed and the interrelationships between the axial vibrations of the shaft and the axial exciting forces are explored based on these studies the following conclusions can be drawn the axial vibrations of the shaft only cause the axial and torsion exciting forces and do not lead to the lateral exciting forces when the vibration amplitude is small or the vibration frequency is low the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak so that the exciting forces are strictly proportional to the vibration amplitude and strictly square to the vibration frequency this means that the real part and imaginary part can be equivalent to constant added mass and added damping respectively the simplified estimation formula including the real part and the imaginary part is proposed and validated which can provide a preliminary estimation for the axial exciting forces in brief this work is to pave the way for establishing the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system in the future the present method only applies to the rigid propeller and the blade deformation is not considered for the very flexible propellers e g composite propellers large deformation will occur which will also affect the exciting forces some work is currently underway to extend the present method for flexible propellers acknowledgement this study was supported by a grant from the national natural science foundation of china no 11802175 and china postdoctoral science foundation no 2019t120339 no 2018m632107 
21972,when the ship propeller works besides non uniform flow field can generate exciting force shaft vibration can also cause the propeller to produce exciting force this type of force can usually be expressed as a combination of additional mass force and additional damping force the purpose of this paper is to study this type of force first based on boundary element method bem and combined with rotordynamics theories the new prediction model of the exciting force induced by shaft vibration is established second the model and codes are validated by some numerical and experiment examples at last the axial exciting force induced by the axial shafting vibration is investigated the results show that when the vibration amplitude is small or the vibration frequency is low the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak so that the exciting force is proportional to the vibration amplitude and square to the vibration frequency this means that the real part and imaginary part of the exciting force can be equivalent to constant added mass and added damping respectively by a series calculation of different propellers the simplified estimation formula of the axial exciting force in linear state is proposed and validated keywords propeller exciting force induced by shaft vibration propeller boundary element method nonlinear wake vortex 1 introduction when marine propeller works in water exciting forces are inevitably generated this is because the propeller usually operates in a spatially nonuniform wake due to the hull stern surrounding flow inclined shaft and unsteady sea conditions and so on therefore changes of flow angle of attack lead to rapid changes of pressure distribution on the blade which will cause propeller exciting forces the propeller exciting forces will cause vibrations of blades as well as the propulsion shaft system and even the hull vibrations transmitted via the surrounding fluid and the propulsion shaft system itself carlton 2012 vibrations can result in fatigue failure of the ship components and have a bad influence on the normal operation of the ship meanwhile discomfort to passengers and crew is greatly increased due to the radiated noise which is also generated by vibrations therefore in the design stage of the propulsion shaft system how to reduce the exciting forces of propellers and how to optimize their transmission path to the hull through the shaft should be considered this is a very complicated problem because there are some complex coupling effects among fluid propeller and shafting so to solve this problem it needs to establish a fluid structure interaction fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system and to investigate the fsi dynamic characteristics between fluid propeller and shafting and to reveal the law that how fluid propeller shafting and their coupling factors influence the exciting force of propeller and its transmission path to the hull however there is hardly any literature to build a fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system because it is very difficult most studies only analyze the fsi dynamic characteristic of the fluid propeller system where the blade root is usually regarded to be fixed in structural response analysis therefore the effects of the shaft vibrations on the propeller and fluid are ignored hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 young 2007 2008 we think there mainly exist three kinds of coupling effects in the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system namely the fluid solid coupling effect between propellers and fluid the elastic coupling effect between propellers and shafting zou et al 2019 and the feedback effect between fluid and shafting therefore the fsi dynamic model of the whole system could be broken down into three sub problems by us as shown in fig 1 the first sub problem is the fsi dynamic analysis between fluid and propellers which includes the prediction of the pressure distribution on the blade the calculation of natural frequencies of blades and the evaluation of deformation and stress of blades and so on the second sub problem is the coupling dynamic analysis about the propeller shaft bearings system which includes the calculation of systems natural frequencies checking the reaction forces of bearing and evaluation of the unbalance response and so on the third sub problem is the feedback effect analyses between the shafting and fluid which includes the feedback effects of shaft vibrations on the fluid and so on we think the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system can be built only if all these three sub problems are solved and investigated so far the first and second sub problems are widely studied by scholars he et al 2012 hyoungsuk lee et al 2014 qi et al 2016 young 2007 2008 young and savander 2011 zou et al 2015 2016b but the research on the third sub problem is insufficient in fact the shaft vibrations will drive the propeller to make the complex space movement which stimulates fluid oscillating of the interface between the propeller and its wake and then it further produces the exciting forces the generation of these exciting forces means feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid some scholars used added water mass to simulate these exciting forces they simplified the propeller into a thin disk and proposed an approximate added mass calculation method fahy 2001 merz et al 2009a 2009b 2013 pan et al 2002 in fact in addition to the added mass forces these exciting forces also contain forces similar to damping 1 1 previous work to determine the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller operated in water some numerical methods are used such as lifting line theory su and huang 2013 lifting surface theory bramesfeld 2006 boundary element method kim et al 2015 bem or panel method and computational fluid dynamics cfd balaras et al 2015 in lifting line theory the geometry of the propeller blade is not directly dealt with and the kinematic boundary condition on the propeller surface is not satisfied so it leads to some errors lifting surface theory uses a discrete vortex representation of the blade on the mean camber surface where the kinematic boundary condition is satisfied so the prediction of the pressure distribution on the blade is not accurate enough in cfd the fluid surrounding the structure is discretized with finite volume similar to those used in fem the major disadvantages of this method are that it needs lots of cpu time and memory in the generation of an effective fluid model even though the viscous flow analysis gives a more accurate solution the bem overcomes these disadvantages and is widely used for the analysis of marine propellers greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2012 2015 so in this study the bem is applied to determine the secondary exciting forces of propellers induced by the shaft vibrations at present there are many studies on exciting forces caused by spatially nonuniform inflow abbas et al 2015 krasilnikov et al 2009 liefvendahl and troeng 2011 liu et al 2009 shu et al 2016 wei and wang 2013 but the researches related to the exciting forces induced by the shaft vibrations are insufficient some scholars have investigated the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller due to the unsteady motions of a ship kinnas et al 2012 politis 2011 shu et al 2017 mao and young 2016 studied the added mass and damping of propellers by using the lifting line theory and their works could provide some references for our study in our previous paper zou et al 2017 a fsi dynamic model of the fluid propeller shaft system has been established the hydroelastic performances of propellers such as natural frequency of blades and dynamic stress of blades also have been studied however only the first and second sub problems as shown in fig 1 are considered in the fsi model the feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid the third sub problem are ignored therefore based on our previous study this research can make a further supplement to it and will aim to study the third sub problem 1 2 objective of the present work at present the study of the exciting force induced by shaft vibration is not sufficient so it brings some problems in some aspects such as how to establish a fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft systems and how to study the level of vibrations of the marine and so on therefore the purpose of this work is to study the feedback effects of the shaft vibrations on fluid to be more specific it is to construct a mathematical model that can calculate the propeller excitation force induced by the vibration of the shafting our work could pave the way for establishing the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system for investigating the fsi dynamic characteristics between fluid propeller and shafting and for optimizing the exciting forces of propellers and their transmission path to the hull in the future 2 mathematical formulations in this study the prediction method of propeller exciting forces is determined by a low order potential based bem because the shaft vibrations drive the propeller to make the complex space movement the evaluation model based on the bem used by many scholars baltazar and de campos 2010 young 2008 young and savander 2011 zou et al 2017 should be made a few modifications including the mathematical description of the shaft vibrations the zero normal flow boundary condition on the propeller surface the use of the modified unsteady bernoulli equation and the construction of a wake model and so on the detailed description of the formulation and implementation is provided below 2 1 theories of rotordynamics because the marine propulsion shafting is also a rotation machine it is suitable to describe its complex space vibrations with the help of rotordynamics theories the reason calling them the complex space vibrations is because the shaft makes axial vibrations torsion vibrations and lateral vibrations simultaneously and there are coupling phenomena among different types of vibrations such as lateral torsional coupling vibrations hua et al 2017 lateral axial coupling vibrations zou et al 2016a 2016b and so on when the shaft rotates in the bearing clearance space it has two kinds of motions as shown in fig 2 zhang 1990 namely the spin around the center of the shaft and the precession around the center of the bearing in the theories of rotordynamics the precession motion is also called the whirl motion in fact the whirl orbit is just the amplitude of lateral vibrations in order to describe the motions of the shaft two coordinate systems are introduced in rotordynamics including the inertial frame o x y z the body coordinate system o x y z which rotates with the blade and the y axis coincides with the reference line of the key blade it assumes that the vibration displacements at the end of the shaft namely at the propeller could be expressed as x u v w θ x θ y θ z t which are defined in the inertial frame o x y z as shown in fig 2 and represent the axial the lateral and the torsion vibrations it could be known from the rotordynamics theory that θ y v x and θ z w x accordingly the vibration velocities at the end of the shaft are v s u v w and ω s θ x θ y θ z which represent the translation velocities and the rotation velocities respectively in rotordynamics theories the relationship between o x y z and o x y z could be described by using projection angle as shown in fig 3 zhang 1990 if the propeller s spin axis o x is projected onto the x y plane then the angle between the projected line and the o x axis is θ y similarly if o x axis is projected onto the x z plane then the angle between the projected line and the o x axis is θ z then the displacement and velocity transformation from the inertial frame o x y z to the body coordinate system o x y z can be expressed as 1 x y z t x u y v z w x y z t x y z when the vibration amplitudes are not large namely θ y and θ z are very small then using the angle transformation theories in rotordynamics and ignoring the infinitesimal of high order t can be approximately expressed as zhang 1990 2 t 1 θ y 2 2 θ z 2 2 θ y θ z θ y 1 θ y 2 2 θ y θ z 2 θ z θ y θ z 2 1 θ z 2 2 1 0 0 0 cos φ sin φ 0 sin φ cos φ where φ ω t θ x and ω is the spin velocity of the propeller from eq 1 and eq 2 the transformation between the inertial frame o x y z and the body coordinate system o x y z has been established which only depends on the vibration displacements of the end of the shaft therefore if the vibration displacements of the shaft at the end are known then the variables in these two coordinate systems could transfer each other easily to avoid the need for a moving mesh so the fluid problem is solved by bem in o x y z coordinate system and many variables should be transformed into it then eq 1 and eq 2 would be used regularly in next section 2 2 boundary integral equation in this study the cavitation is not considered as shown in fig 4 consider a propeller subjected to an effective inflow wake v 0 which is defined in the inertial frame o x y z so in the body coordinate system o x y z using eq 1 the inflow velocity v i n on the propeller surface can be written as 3 v i n t v 0 v s ω ω s r where r is the position vector of the point q on the propeller surface s b from this equation it is seen that if the vibration displacements x the vibration velocities v s and ω s are all zero then eq 3 is consistent with the traditional expression in which the vibrations of the shaft are ignored su and huang 2013 the flow field perturbed by the propeller can be characterized by a perturbation velocity potential φ in the o x y z coordinate system it is also satisfied the laplace equation joseph katz 2001 4 2 φ 0 on the propeller surface s b kinematic boundary condition should be satisfied namely the zero normal velocity on the propeller surface s b this can be written as joseph katz 2001 5 φ n q v i n n q o n s b where n q is the unit normal vector of the propeller surface s b and v i n is the inflow velocity determined by eq 3 for eq 4 applying green s identity perturbation velocity potential at field point p x y z placed on the propeller surface s b can be written as a distribution of source and doublet over the boundary surface su and huang 2013 6 2 π φ p s b φ q n q 1 r p q d s s w δ φ q 1 n q 1 1 r p q 1 d s s b v i n n q 1 r p q d s where q 1 is any point on the wake surface s w and δ φ q 1 is potential jump across the wake surface which strength and location are introduced in the next section 2 3 wake model at present for prediction of hydrodynamic performances of propellers there are some linear geometry models of wake to use by making some assumptions such as kerwin s contraction and roll up wake model kerwin and lee 1978 and su s equal pitch surface wake model su and huang 2013 because the geometry of the wake is assumed it is also called fixed wake model which is proved to be effective and is widely used but for the case where the propeller makes complex spatial motion this fixed wake model may not be suitable in theory trailing vortex leaves from the trailing edge of the blade and flows into the slipstream with the local velocity at that position therefore the geometry of the wake is determined by satisfying the force free condition this means that the wake should be aligned with the circumferentially averaged inflow at every time step this is called free wake model and there are also many studies greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2015 lee et al 2012 therefore in this paper the free wake model is used because the free wake model is a relatively mature technique the modeling process is not introduced in this paper and could be referred to some literature greco et al 2014 joseph katz 2001 kinnas et al 2015 however because compared to the previous studies the shaft vibrations are considered here there are still some details to be paid attention to in the free wake mode as shown in fig 5 the vortices shedding are generated at each time interval δ t at the beginning the propeller is stationary and no vortices are shed at the first time step δ t the trailing edge of the propeller moves a distance by v i n δ t and then the first vortex is shed therefore the length of the first vortex is also v i n δ t where v i n includes the effective inflow wake v 0 the angle velocities ω of the propeller the vibration velocities v s and vibration angle velocities ω s of the shaft at the propeller it is described in the body coordinate system o x y z and obtained by eq 3 v s and ω s are described by theories of rotordynamics and from fig 2 it is known that they could be expressed as v s u v w and ω s θ x θ y θ z if v s and ω s are all zero then the treatment of the free wake is consistent with the previous studies in which the vibrations of the shaft are ignored greco et al 2014 kinnas et al 2015 the strength of the first vortex is determined by morino kutta condition morino and kuo 1974 at the second time step 2 δ t the second vortex is shed the first vortex sheet whose strength is unchanged moves with the local stream velocity this process is repeated until the required time step is calculated 2 4 numerical calculation process the boundary integral equation 6 is hard to solve analytically for complex geometry so a numerical solution is obtained by dividing the surface including the propeller surface and wake surface into a number of small elements where constant strength dipoles and sources are distributed the panel arrangements are shown as in fig 6 only one blade and its wake surfaces are shown it is assumed that the number of panels on one blade and corresponding hub surface is n p the number of blades is z and the total calculation time step is n t so at the i t time step the boundary integral equation 6 can be written as a system of linear algebraic equations 7 k 1 z j 1 n p c i j k φ j k t k 1 z m 1 n r w i m 1 k δ φ m 1 k t k 1 z j 1 n p b i j k v i n n q j k k 1 z m 1 n r l 2 i t w i m l k δ φ m l k t i 1 2 z n p i t 1 2 n t where δ φ m 1 k is potential jump across the vortex surface which is shed from the trailing edge at the current time step i t and its strength is unknown and determined by morino kutta condition δ φ m l k is potential jump which is shed at the previous time step and its strength is also known at the previous time step c i j k w i m l k and b i j k are influence coefficients and can be defined as 8 c i j k 1 2 π s j k n j k 1 r i j k d s j k w i m l 1 2 π s m l k n m l k 1 r i m l k d s m l k b i j k 1 2 π s j k 1 r i j k d s j k all these influence coefficients c i j k w i m l k and b i j k could be calculated by morino s analytical formulation morino and kuo 1974 eq 7 can be more generally expressed in matrix form as 9 a t φ t r h s t where a is defined as 10 a i j k c i j k i f p a n e l i s n o t a t t e c i j k w i m 1 k i f p a n e l i s a t t e where sign depends on whether the panel is at the upper suction side or the lower side pressure side of blade trailing edge once the perturbation velocity potential φ is solved then in the body coordinate system o x y z the pressure on the propeller surface can be expressed by unsteady bernoulli s equation as joseph katz 2001 11 p p 0 ρ 1 2 v i n 2 φ t 1 2 v 2 where p 0 is static pressure at infinity ρ is the density of water v is the total velocity of a point on the propeller surface which could be written as v v i n φ therefore in the body coordinate system o x y z the total exciting forces can be calculated by 12 f x i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t n x j k s j k m x i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t z j k n y j k y j k n z j k s j k f y i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t n y j k s j k m y i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t x j k n z j k z j k n x j k s j k f z i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t n z j k s j k m z i t k 1 z j 1 n p p j k i t y j k n x j k x j k n y j k s j k where n x j k n y j k and n z j k are the normal vector of the j t h panel for the k t h blade x j k y j k and z j k are the coordinates of the j t h panel for the k t h blade s j k is the area of the j t h panel for the k t h blade and all these variables are expressed in the body coordinate system o x y z the total exciting forces can be transformed into the inertial frame o x y z using eq 1 the solution procedure is described schematically by the flowchart of fig 7 in principle at each time step the inflow velocity v i n is calculated by eq 3 the location of the latest wake panel is established and the r h s t vector is calculated the influence coefficient matrix a t is also calculated at each time step but the c i j k is only calculated during the first time step then the perturbation velocity potential φ can be solved by eq 9 once the perturbation velocity potential is obtained the pressures and total exciting forces are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 at the end of each time step the corner point locations of every wake panel are updated 3 code validation in present work the solution is implemented in matlab so it is very necessary to validate the model established currently and codes by some numerical and experiment examples in this section three examples are analyzed to validate our model and codes including prediction of open water performance of propellers under uniform inflow prediction of unsteady pressure of propellers under nonuniform inflow and prediction of exciting forces of propellers under simple motion next these three examples would be introduced in detail respectively 3 1 prediction of open water performance for propellers under uniform inflow the first example is to calculate the steady pressure distributions of the propeller 4119 under the design advance coefficient propeller 4119 is a three blade no skewed propeller and the detail geometry parameters and experiment data come from the reference jessup 1989 it must be pointed out that the shaft vibration velocities v s and ω s in eq 3 need to be set to zero in the process of calculation the calculated and experiment results are shown in fig 8 it is seen that the prediction pressure distributions on the blade have a very good agreement with the measured data except at the edge of the blade the reasons are that it exists very complex flow phenomena in the edge of the blade for example the tip vortex and leading edge vortex separation which are not considered in present prediction model meanwhile the prediction results have higher accuracy than the results in fig 8 of our previous paper zou et al 2017 this is because the fixed wake model is used in the previous paper fig 9 is the open water characteristics of propeller 4119 it is also known that the thrust and torsion coefficients have a very good agreement with the experiment data and the lower the advance coefficient is the larger the errors are this is because the flow separation occurs easily at low advance coefficient su and huang 2013 but this phenomenon does not include in our model 3 2 the prediction of unsteady pressure for propellers under nonuniform inflow the second example is to calculate the unsteady pressure distributions of a five blade highly skewed propeller seiun maru under nonuniform inflow the detail geometry parameters and experiment data come from the reference hoshino 1998 the fluctuation pressure of a specified point at the chord and radial position during one revolution is compared similarly the shaft vibration velocities v s and ω s in eq 3 also need to be set to zero in the process of calculation the results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 it is seen that the prediction fluctuation pressure distributions have a very good agreement with the measured data and the calculation of hoshino 1993 it is also seen that the prediction accuracy is higher than the results in figs 9 and 10 of our previous paper zou et al 2017 the reason is explained in section 3 1 3 3 the prediction of exciting force for propellers under simple motion the third example is to calculate the unsteady thrust and torsion of a five blade no skewed propeller 4381 undergoing surge motion in uniform inflow the detail geometry parameters of propeller 4381 come from the reference carlton 2012 the fluctuation thrust and torsion coefficients of the propeller during one revolution are compared with the reference kinnas et al 2012 the results are shown in fig 12 it is seen that our results have a very good agreement with the calculation of the reference to sum up from these three examples it can be found that there is a very good accuracy between our solutions and the experiment data or other scholars calculation results suggesting the validity of the current exciting force prediction model and codes 4 analysis of the axial exciting forces characteristics in this section the exciting forces of propellers induced by the shaft vibrations would be analyzed a five blade skewed propeller of 4382 which is used widely in marine is used as a research example its design advance coefficient j is 0 889 and the diameter is assumed to be 5 m the primary geometries are given in reference carlton 2012 and are shown in fig 13 from fig 2 it is known that the shaft vibrations have six degrees of freedom and then in these directions would cause six kinds of exciting forces but the axial exciting forces are most concerned by engineers because they are the main reasons for the marine vibrations transmission through the thrust bearing merz et al 2009b pan et al 2002 so to save space as a representative only the axial exciting forces are investigated it is assumed that the axial vibration of the shaft at the propeller is 13 u a sin 2 π f t where u is the axial vibration a is the vibration amplitude f is the vibration frequency hz in this study the rotational speed of the propeller is always 120 rpm and the inflow velocity v 0 is set to be about 8 89 m s to ensure that the advance coefficient j be 0 889 the exciting forces is dimensionless using the following equation 14 f x ρ r 4 f s 2 f x m x ρ r 5 f s 2 m x where ρ is the density of water kgm 3 r is the radius of the propeller m and f s is the rotation frequency of the propeller in this study it is always 2 hz 4 1 evaluation of axial exciting force first it is assumed that a is 50 μm and f is 10 hz namely the vibration frequency is the blade passing frequency bpf because the propeller has five blades bpf is five times rotational frequency these axial vibration parameters of the shaft come from the experiment data chen 1987 so according to u 2 π f a cos 2 π f t the amplitude of vibration velocity is about 0 0031 m s in calculation it is also assumed the inflow is uniform to remove the interference of the exciting forces caused by nonuniform flow the solution procedure is described schematically by the flowchart of fig 7 when dividing panels the number of chordal divisions n s is 25 and the number of radial divisions n r is 30 the time step size is δ θ 1 six cycles are calculated to make sure that the transient solutions decay to zero so the total calculation time steps n t are 2160 6 360 first the convergence of the computational model is studied in this model it mainly involves the convergence of the number of grids the time step size and the total calculation time steps therefore the influence of these parameters on the calculation results is mainly studied fig 14 a is a comparison of calculation results when the blades are divided into different grid numbers fig 14 b is a comparison of calculation results at different time step sizes and fig 15 is the results at different total calculation time steps as can be seen from these figures the difference between them is very small indicating that the number of grids the time step size and the total calculation time steps selected in this study are all convergent to the calculation results from fig 15 a it also can be seen that the exciting force fluctuates widely at the start stage and are stable rapidly after one revolution therefore the results of the last lap which are stable are shown in the following discussion fig 16 is the axial and torsional exciting forces due to the axial vibration given in eq 13 from this figure it is known that the axial vibration would cause the axial and torsion exciting force and the frequency of exciting force is the same with the axial vibration frequency in order to show the amplitude relationship between excitation force caused by shafting vibration and static thrust then the ordinate in fig 16 is set to the ratios of fluctuating forces and moments to the mean thrust f t and torque m t it is known that the amplitudes account for about 3 2 of the static thrust and static torque this magnitude is approximately the same level as the axial exciting forces caused by the non uniform flow field zou 2017 fig 17 and fig 18 are the transverse and vertical exciting forces and moments due to the axial vibration from these figures it can be seen that although there is an exciting force on each blade the summing exciting force is zero so there exists certain relationship among the phase angles for the exciting forces of different blades which could make the summing exciting force offset each other therefore it can be concluded that the alone axial vibration of the shaft can not induce the transverse and vertical exciting forces and moments it should be pointed out that the cross flow phenomenon in the flow field has been neglected so this conclusion is more suitable for situations where the cross flow phenomenon is weak or absent 4 2 relationship between the axial exciting force and axial vibration in order to study the influence of the axial vibration amplitude and frequency on the axial exciting force further four working conditions are calculated in order to investigate the relationship between the axial vibration frequency and axial exciting force it is assumed that the vibration amplitude of the shaft system is 50 μm in the first group and 150 μm in the second group and remains unchanged the rotational frequency of the shaft is 2 hz and also remains unchanged make the axial vibration frequency be equal to 2 hz rotation frequency 4 hz two times rotation frequency 10 hz blade passing frequency bpf 20 hz two times bpf respectively similarly to investigate the relationship between the axial vibration amplitude and axial exciting force in the third and the forth group the vibration frequency of the shaft system is assumed to be 10 hz bpf and 20 hz respectively and remains unchanged make the axial vibration amplitude be equal to 50 μm 100 μm 150 μm 200 μm respectively take the stable results the results of the last revolution for analysis the excitation forces generated by the vibration of the shafting will have a phase difference from the vibration of the shafting therefore the analysis of these excitation forces should include the amplitude and phase or the real part and the imaginary part in engineering the real part is usually assumed to be an additional mass force and the imaginary part is assumed to be an additional damping force under the linear assumption they have the following relationship 15 m a re f x 4 π 2 f 2 a c a im f x 2 π f a where m a and c a are added mass and added damping respectively the calculation results are shown in fig 19 to fig 22 in order to explore the internal relation further a curve fitting method is adopted for these data the polynomial fitting is used and the fitting formulas are also obtained shown in fig 19 to fig 22 from these figures it can be seen that the exciting forces including the real part and the imaginary part are in proportion to the vibration amplitude and in square relation to the vibration frequency this shows that the nonlinear effect of the free wake model described in section 2 3 is weak under the calculation parameters selected in this study in engineering the reaction forces of shafting vibration to fluid are usually simplified into two parts additional mass force the real part and additional damping force the imaginary part therefore this also means that when the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak the equivalent added mass does not change with the vibration amplitude and frequency of the shafting and the equivalent added damping does not change with the vibration amplitude and is proportional to the vibration frequency of the shafting further fig 23 to fig 26 show the variation of added mass and added damping with the amplitude and frequency of shafting vibration it can be foreseen that there exists strong nonlinear effect if the vibration amplitude of the shaft becomes large enough and there also appears flow separation phenomenon on the surface of the blades at this time the excitation forces may no longer be in direct proportion to the vibration amplitude of the shafting and may no longer be in square relation to the vibration frequency of the shafting the equivalent additional mass and additional damping will also be nonlinear however the very large axial vibration amplitude is not realistic in practical engineering chen 1987 and also outranges the research of this study 4 3 simplified estimation formula of the axial exciting forces further a series propellers of different geometry parameters about 63 propellers with different radii blade number pitch ratios and blade area ratios are calculated the calculation results also show that the exciting forces are related to these geometry parameters such as radii blade number pitch ratios blade area ratios and skew angle so the simplified equation that estimates the exciting forces is proposed using regression and dimensional analysis the estimating equation can be expressed as 16 re f x ρ r 4 f s 2 a r f r 2 z r a 1 a 2 p d a 3 a e o a 4 p d a e o a 5 p d 2 a 6 a e o 2 im f x ρ r 4 f s 2 a r f r 2 z r b 1 b 2 p d b 3 a e o b 4 p d a e o b 5 p d 2 b 6 a e o 2 where a r a d which is the ratio of vibration amplitude a mm to propeller diameter d m f r f f s which is the ratio of vibration frequency f hz to propeller rotation frequency f s hz z r z 5 which is the ratio of the number of blade z to the blade base number take the number of blades as 5 p d is the pitch ratio of blades at 0 7 radius a e o is the disc area a 1 to a 6 and b 1 to b 6 are the coefficients the ranges of their values and the recommended values are shown in table 1 from eq 15 the corresponding additional mass and additional damping can be expressed as 17 m a ρ d 3 z r 64 π 2 a 1 a 2 p d a 3 a e o a 4 p d a e o a 5 p d 2 a 6 a e o 2 c a ρ d 3 f z r 32 π b 1 b 2 p d b 3 a e o b 4 p d a e o b 5 p d 2 b 6 a e o 2 in order to test the estimated accuracy of the simplified estimation formula the axial exciting forces of some propellers are evaluated by direct calculation as shown in fig 7 and by estimation formula using eq 16 then the results are compared the diameter of these propellers is assumed to be 5 m vibration amplitude a is 200 μm and vibration frequency f is 10 hz the calculation results are shown in fig 27 the relative errors between these two calculation methods are defined as follows 18 e r r o r s f d f e f d 100 where f d is the exciting force by the direct calculation and f e is the results by the simplified estimation formula from fig 27 it can be seen that the simplified formula has high accuracy for some propellers and the relative error is only 1 37 the real part for propeller 4679 but the relative errors are large for other propellers such as 18 28 the real part for propeller 4119 this is because the estimation formula is proposed taking into account the geometric characteristics of many propellers and is sensitive to the geometry parameters especially the pitch ratios however in these propellers the pitch ratios are uneven distribution and the number of propellers whose pitch ratios are between 0 95 and 1 1 is limited therefore the relative error of this type propeller is large such as p4119 after the relative errors census it is showed that this formula could have higher accuracy for the propellers whose pitch ratios are larger than 1 2 or are smaller than 0 9 the simplified estimation formula does not consider the effect of the skew angle there are two reasons first the calculation results show that if the skew angle is less than 60 then it has small effect on exciting force compared to the other geometry parameters such as the pitch ratios the disc area and so on so when the skew angle is not large ignoring the skew angle will bring small relative errors second if the skew angle is considered then the form of eq 16 should change the polynomial may not be suitable it is very complex so to simplify the skew angle is ignored although this simplified formula will bring some errors in any case this simplified formula can provide a preliminary estimation for the axial exciting force in engineering and is more suitable for the propeller with small skew angle so it also has some practical value it also should be noted that this simplified formula is put forward based on the rigid propeller if the propeller has large deformation this formula should be improved further and this job will be done in the future 5 conclusions in this study the new prediction model of the exciting forces induced by the shaft vibrations is established based on bem and rotordynamics theories in time domain this model could consider some nonlinear factors such as the nonlinear wake vortex and the sudden movement of the shafting and then the model is validated by some examples at last the characteristics of the axial exciting forces are analyzed and the interrelationships between the axial vibrations of the shaft and the axial exciting forces are explored based on these studies the following conclusions can be drawn the axial vibrations of the shaft only cause the axial and torsion exciting forces and do not lead to the lateral exciting forces when the vibration amplitude is small or the vibration frequency is low the nonlinear effect of the wake vortex is weak so that the exciting forces are strictly proportional to the vibration amplitude and strictly square to the vibration frequency this means that the real part and imaginary part can be equivalent to constant added mass and added damping respectively the simplified estimation formula including the real part and the imaginary part is proposed and validated which can provide a preliminary estimation for the axial exciting forces in brief this work is to pave the way for establishing the fsi dynamic model of the whole fluid propeller shaft system in the future the present method only applies to the rigid propeller and the blade deformation is not considered for the very flexible propellers e g composite propellers large deformation will occur which will also affect the exciting forces some work is currently underway to extend the present method for flexible propellers acknowledgement this study was supported by a

21973,multi criteria decision making methods are applied to select the final design from the pareto front obtained in multi objective optimization problems in a ship design problem the focus is on the selection of the final design of the internal layout of oil tankers to fulfil this aim some of the widely used methods of multi criteria decision making are applied and the final selected internal layout dimensions are discussed in a comparative study for a shuttle tanker whereas the final selected design by the multi criteria decision making methods is significantly dependent on the specified weight for each criterion the weights are defined by two methods first the objective weights are defined by shannon entropy technique next the monte carlo simulation is used to compare the ranked solutions by random subjective weights the selected design by the applied methods of multi criteria decision making is discussed for both weight assignment approaches keywords ship design internal layout of tanker multi criteria decision making multi objective optimization pareto front subjective and objective weights abbreviations mcdm multi criteria decision making madm multiple attribute

enrichment evaluation swbm still water bending moment acfs alternatives that have the chance of being first selected 1 introduction nowadays ship design is improving by optimization strategies considering the specified merit functions and limits which are dependent on the expected functionally of the vessel the design of the internal layout of the hull is one major task of the early stage of the ship design process though the consideration differs for each type of the vessels for instance lyu et al 2015 defined a single objective problem for optimization of subdivision arrangement of a military ship the target of optimization was the improvement of anti wind capacity after the considered damage scenario however for oil tankers the internal layout of ships has been optimized with a multi objective approach based on different objectives such as economic environmental pollution prevention and survivability of the ships as matter of fact the global optimization procedure in ship design results in exploration of a wide range of the non dominated solutions which not only fulfil the constraints but also each one is superior at least in one of the objective functions relative to the other solutions because usually the objectives of optimization have conflict in the favourite direction for the majority of these problems thus approaching the pareto front solutions has been considered as a prominent strategy by the optimization algorithms however reaching to the recognizable front of pareto solutions is not guaranteed in all the cases for instance chen et al 2010 adopted the integer coding and special crossover operation in the genetic algorithm to obtain the optimum designs of watertight bulkheads position along with the transverse frames they reached a few non dominated solutions which were spread widely in the design space a comparative analysis was presented to depict the privileges of the picked non dominated solutions relative to the reference design however the selection of the final design from the pareto solutions was not discussed on the other hand if the optimization results in a set of the recognizable pareto frontier posterior methods are required to identify the superior design one of these posterior methods is a visualization of the pareto front which assists the designer to understand the similarities and differences between the alternatives in the objectives of the defined problem these methods are categorized in miettinen 2014 for small sets of alternatives and described in lotov and miettinen 2008 for a large number of alternatives a visual comparison can be performed with the two dimensional or three dimensional diagrams of non dominated solutions as done by papanikolaou 2010 who used a multi objective approach for optimization of the arrangement of ro ro ships where the pareto front was recognized and the values of the objectives for each design were presented in two dimensional scatter diagrams which served the basis for the comparison which was performed based on the designer s preference and experiences on the other hand the designer requires additional tools to quantify the pros and cons of each alternative the final optimal solution can be selected by a trade off between conflicting objective functions thus the selection of final designs can be defined as a multi criteria decision making mcdm problem which aims to rank the alternatives to find the best satisfaction of the given criteria which are not necessarily in the same direction so the pareto solutions can be judged by the mcdm methods and the superior design can be identified among the available alternatives this concept is applied in papanikolaou et al 2010 for optimization of the internal layout of an oil tanker and similarly in koutroukis et al 2014 priftis et al 2018 and nikolopoulos and boulougouris 2018 for optimization of the internal layout of container ships they used a utility function to reach the final selected design after performing the multi objective optimization for the problem of the internal layout of the ships the importance of each objective was defined by the weights which were assigned by considering sample scenarios the applied mcdm methods in the ship design are not limited to the utility function method as caprace and rigo 2011 used the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee for decision making about the metric of complexity of the passenger ship design the criteria were defined as subdivision complexities in a predefined layout of a generic passenger ship the alternatives were defined as different designs of passenger ships with approximatively the same size then promethee was used for judgment of the few alternatives with the considered criteria however the weights of the criteria were assigned by considering sample scenarios in a different approach ölçer et al 2006 developed a new mcdm methodology for subdivision arrangement of ro ro vessels which integrates the multi objective optimization with a fuzzy multi attributive group decision making technique later for subdivision arrangement of ropax vessels ölçer 2008 approximated the set of pareto optimal solutions by an evolutionary method then the topsis method was applied to rank the obtained solutions where the weights of criteria were assigned by the weight evaluation technique in this technique the decision maker specifies the rank orders of attributes the weights are assigned on the interval of 0 100 based on their relative importance generally mcdm can be divided into two main categories multiple attribute decision making madm and multiple objective decision making modm based on the suggestion of hwang and yoon 1973 the madm deals with a limited number of predetermined alternatives and discrete preference ratings the modm aims to achieve the optimal or aspired goals by considering the various interactions within the given constraints also the approaches for solving the madm problem can be divided into two groups of compensatory and non compensatory milani et al 2006 in the compensatory models the trade off among the attributes is allowed by applying the multi attribute utility theory maut keeney et al 1979 the maut is based on providing a utility function to evaluate the alternatives the utility function aggregate all the criteria in one dimension and can be used to rank the alternatives weight sum method and analytic hierarchy process saaty 1980 are examples of this approach in the non compensatory models the alternatives are compared to each other with respect to individual criteria such as electre method roy 1968 which use the outranking relationship in this work the problem of the internal layout of the ship is considered a subset of the main topic of mcdm because the problem has been optimized by an evolutionary algorithm jafaryeganeh et al 2019 and the results of the pareto front are considered as predetermined alternatives and different approaches of madm are applied to select the final design many methods have been developed for mcdm considering the type of problem and fig 1 shows the taxonomy of the mcdm based on the procedure of decision making ribeiro et al 2011 each method of mcdm follows a different procedure for ordering the preferred alternatives where the methods differ in criteria weightings determination normalization techniques and aggregation jahan and edwards 2015 thus they may result in producing a different ranking for the alternatives and effect on the final design selection however the confidence of decision making can reach a higher level by measuring the similarity of the provided ranks with different methods these similarities can be evaluated through the measurement of the correlation coefficient of the specified ranks for the alternatives the assigned weight for each criterion significantly influences the recommended selection by each mcdm method the methods of weight assignment can be categorized roughly into three groups of objective subjective and integrated wang and luo 2010 the subjective methods assign the weights of criteria based on the subjective preference information of decision makers the objective methods specify the weights using objective decision matrix information the integrated methods determined the weights by a combination of subjective information of decision makers and objective information of decision matrix in this work an overview is presented for the problem of the hull internal layout of an oil tanker and the obtained pareto solutions are introduced as the input of the mcdm problem then the methods of weighted sum weighted product topsis and electre are applied for decision making of the final selection solution from the pareto front the importance of the criteria is discussed by objective and subjective weight vectors the objective weights are calculated by the shannon entropy technique shannon 1948 then the applied methods of mcdm are compared by top ranked selections and the spearman correlation coefficient subjective weights are provided by the stochastic method to study the effect of ranking by each mcdm method in monte carlo simulations then the alternatives that have the maximum probability of the getting each rank are determined and used for comparative analysis of final design selection finally the superior designs in the pareto fonts are discussed 2 problem definition for internal hull layout of oil tanker here a summary is presented to describe the process that resulted in pareto solutions for a problem of internal layout design of oil tanker because the obtained pareto solutions are introduced as the input of the mcdm problem though the focus of the present work is on the post optimization process more detail can be found in jafaryeganeh et al 2019 regarding the definition of the optimization problem the applied approach to reach the pareto solutions and discussion about the results of the optimization process design of the hull internal layout is one of the preliminary tasks in the ship design which depends on the type of the ship and the internal spaces applications usually similar arrangements are supposed to be used for a special type of vessel but the dimensions of the internal compartments still need to be determined in the initial stage of ship design on the other hand the designers intend to reach the maximum functionality in the available space of ship hull while they have to consider the safety and pollution prevention for the design of the internal layout of the tankers improvement of safety and pollution prevention can be defined as the goal in the design process and at the same time should comply with the restrictions of the survivability regulations all these conflicting objectives and constraints lead to define the design of internal layout as an optimization problem fig 2 shows the schematic view of the internal layout definition as the multi objective optimization for the oil tankers 2 1 objectives the optimization process intends to improve the following objectives 1 mean oil outflow parameter to measure pollution prevention accidental oil outflow parameter indicates the performance of the tanker in the event of an accident and the lower value for mean oil outflow results in less pollution of the marine environment thus minimization of the objective is favourable the oil outflow is calculated according to the regulations of marpol annex i reg 23 imo 2004 2 cargo capacity to measure the economic profits the cargo capacity indicates the economic property of a ship in the operation of oil transportation thus maximization of the available space for cargo is favourable 3 maximum still water bending moment swbm to improve the structural safety reduction of the induced load to the ship hull results in increasing the safety of the structure against the failures guedes soares et al 1996 the sill water loads are one of the major induced loads to the ship hull and the vertical still water loads are the most investigated component of the still water induced loads because of the higher values of imposed loads relative to the other directions these loads have a significant effect for design of the ship s structure and consequently more effective on the safety of the ship hull guedes soares 1990a the vertical bending moment is a significant indication of the imposed load to the ship hull among the components of induced loads due to the still water max swbm indicates the imposed load to the ship structure in the normal operation guedes soares 1990b so the safety of the ship improves with the reduction of the imposed load to the ship structure 2 2 design variables the design variables are the set of the parameters that control the dimension of the internal layouts as listed below and depicted in fig 3 the longitudinal positions of the transverse bulkheads alongside the ship li i 1 7 the longitudinal position of forming internal layout in the curved area of hull li i 8 9 the hull of tankers mostly has a parallel wall sided shell in the mid body and more curved shape in the aft and especially forward in these parts the inclination points are adapted to the ship hull to provide the ability to reach the maximum available space and providing the shape diversity for internal layout thus the longitudinal positions of these points are considered as the design variables the widths of the wing tanks w the heights of double bottom tanks h for each longitudinal subdivision it should be noted that the longitudinal position of collision bulkhead is not considered as the independent design variable and calculated using the below equation 1 l c b d l b p i 1 9 l i where lbp is the length between the perpendiculars 2 3 constraints the constraints of the problem can be divided into two categories regulatory restrictions and practical design limitations the regulation limits are mentioned in solas imo 2012 marpol imo 2006 and cll imo 1966 some of them specify direct restriction for the size of internal layout members and the others determine confinements for the ship stability in the intact and damage conditions the practical design constraints deal with the minimum requirement of spaces for the machinery slop and fuel tanks and minimum bulkhead distances in a feasible design approach table 1 shows the summary of the main applied constraint with the references more detail of the constrains for oil tankers can be found in jafaryeganeh et al 2018 2 4 case study a shuttle tanker has been considered as a case study and its main particulars are listed in table 2 in the reference design the main subdivision consists of eight transverse bulkheads and a central longitudinal bulkhead fig 4 shows the initial general arrangement of the tanker where the upper structure is located in the forward and the below compartment of the supper structure includes the machinery spaces such as engine room and pump room the parametric model is provided according to jafaryeganeh et al 2016 and jafaryeganeh et al 2018 by the caeses friendship systems 2019 and maxsurf bentley systems 2018 software the ship hull shape is assumed to be fixed and a unique topology is assumed for the compartment layout to generate the parametric model the number of transverse and longitudinal bulkheads are assumed constant for a configuration the diversity of configurations is provided by introducing the parameters for the shape of the internal layout 2 5 optimization method the determination of the hull internal layout dimensions is defined as a non linear multi objective and multi constraint problem so the multi objective genetic algorithm moga is used to approach the non dominated solutions the genetic algorithm can approach the global optimum designs and avoid the trap of local optimum solutions however it may converge slowly with a large number of iterations the adopted moga by dakota adams et al 2017 software has the ability to handle discrete design variables which is required for a realistic assessment of internal layout 2 6 pareto solutions the pareto front that has been determined from the optimization of the multi objective problem is presented in figs 5 7 the trade off between the objectives is observed because the increment in the capacity of cargo results in an increment in the mean oil outflow parameter and max swbm the reference design can improve significantly in the aspects of oil outflow and max swbm while improving only slightly the cargo capacity although the reference design approaches the dominated solutions from the aspect of capacity it is not identified as one of the pareto solutions 3 methods of mcdm the output of the optimization problem is redefined according to the mcdm inputs so the available pareto front becomes the decision matrix x as below 2 c 1 c 2 c m x x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 21 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x n m a l t e r n a t i v e 1 a l t e r n a t i v e 2 a l t e r n a t i v e n where the criteria of c j indicate the objective function of the optimization problem alternative i denotes the provided non dominant design in the pareto set the majority of the mcdm methods require to use a normalization method for the attribute values thus initially the applied technique of normalization is described then the methods of mcdm are explained 3 1 method of normalization of the attribute values most mcdm methods apply the normalization technique to convert the criteria values into non dimensional values in fact the values should be approximately in the same range of magnitude milani et al 2005 so as an initial step the vector normalization is applied for scale the decision matrix into the interval 0 1 the values of criteria are normalized by the following formulation 3 r i j x i j i 1 n x i j 2 for benefit criteria 4 r i j 1 x i j i 1 n x i j 2 for cost criteria using the separate formulations has the advantage of unifying the trend of normalized values regardless of the criteria type because the higher normalized value indicates the better performance for the alternatives in that specific criteria 3 2 weighted sum method wsm weighted sum method is probably the most widely used among the method of mcdm due to the simplicity of applying and following an intuitive process kolios et al 2016 the underlying assumption of the wsm is that attributes are preferentially independent i e the contribution of each individual attribute to the total score does not depend on the other attributes values the following steps are performed in this method step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although if the units of alternatives are commensurable their value can be used directly in the utility function however for the defined problem of internal layout design the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 a utility function u i is provided by a combination of all the performance value of alternatives with their relevant weights w j 5 u i j 1 m r i j w j where n and m are the numbers of alternative and criteria respectively step 3 the alternatives are sorted based on the achieved score by the mentioned utility function the following formulation can drive the best alternative a 6 a m a x u i i 1 2 n 3 3 weighted product method wpm the wpm can compare two alternatives without normalization of attribute values the following formulation presents the comparison ratio r between alternative a u and a v 7 r a u a v j 1 m x u j x v j k j k j w j if j t h criteria is benefit k j w j if j t h criteria is cost where m is the number of criteria and w j is the weight of j th criterion if r 1 the alternative a u is better than the a v the following steps can be used for ranking all the alternatives in relation to an ideal solution step 1 the ideal solution a d is determined it is defined as the alternative with the best value for the attributes among the whole alternatives i e the attributes of the ideal solution are selected as maximum values for the benefit and minimum values for the cost criteria step 2 the comparison ratio is calculated by comparing all the alternatives relative to the ideal solution 8 r i a i a d i 1 2 n step 3 the alternatives are sorted based on the achieved score by the mentioned comparison ratio thus the best solution a is presented by the following expression 9 a m a x r i i 1 2 n where r i is the score of i th alternative and n is the number of alternatives 3 4 technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution topsis the concept of topsis method is based on choosing a compromise solution by measuring the distance relative to the best and worst ideal solution hwang and yoon 1973 so the best solution is as close as possible to the positive ideal solution and at the same time it is as far as possible from the negative ideal solution a euclidean norm measures the distance between each solution with the positive and negative ideal ones the following steps are applied for ranking the alternatives based on the topsis method step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 the weighted the normalization matrix is calculated as follow 10 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m step 3 the positive ideal a and negative ideal solution a are identified as bellow 11 a v 1 v 2 v m m a x i v i j j i m i n i v i j j i i 1 n 12 a v 1 v 2 v m m i n i v i j j i m a x i v i j j i i 1 n where i and i indicate for the benefit and cost criteria respectively step 4 the separation distance between alternative to positive ideal solutions s and negative ideal solution s are measured with n dimensional euclidean distance as below 13 s i j 1 m v i j v j 2 i 1 n 14 s i j 1 m v i j v j 2 i 1 n step 5 the distance of solution is calculated relative to the ideal ones by measuring the similarity to the positive ideal solution and incorporation the dissimilarity to the negative ideal solution according to the following formula 15 c i s i s i s i where c i is the relative closeness index for the ith alternative step 6 each alternative is ranked based on the obtained score of similarity to the positive ideal solution thus alternative with the maximum relative closeness index is the most preferred one a 16 a m a x c i i 1 2 n 3 5 elimination et choice translating reality electre method the electre method is based on the definition of outranking relationships which uses concordance and discordance concept concordance and discordance indicate the quantity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction from the viewpoint of the decision maker then threshold idea is used to form a kernel consisting of preferred alternatives a variety of electre methods were developed for different purposes tzeng and huang 2011 such as electre i ii iii iv is and tri each type is based on the same concept but they operate in different ways a modified electre i method nijkamp and rietveld 1976 is applied in this study the used method includes the following steps step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 the weighted the normalization matrix is calculated as follow 17 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m step 3 determining the concordance and discordance set the concordance c and discordance d sets are determined by pairwise comparison of the alternatives following formulation is considered for two alternatives of a p and a q 18 c p q j v p j v p j p q j 1 m 19 d p q j v p j v p j p q j 1 m in other words c p q is the collection of criteria where a p is better than or equal to a q and d p q is the collection of criteria where a p is worse than a q step 4 calculating the concordance and discordance index the relative power of each concordance and discordance set is measured by concordance c pq or discordance d pq index as below 20 c p q j w j 21 d p q j v p j v q j j v p j v q j where j and j are attributes contained in the concordance set c p q and discordance set of d p q respectively in other words the c pq and d pq are the degrees of agreement and disagreement of two alternatives of a p and a q thus the outranking relationship can be defined based on higher value for the concordance index and at the same time lower value for the discordance index step 5 forming a kernel of alternatives if c t and d t are assumed to be threshold values for the c pq and d pq receptively then the following outrank relationship between a p and a q will be used to determine the kernel of preferred alternatives 22 a p a q c p q c t d p q d t where c t and d t can be considered as arbitrary values though normally they are assumed to be mean of c pq and d pq two following weakness is recognized for such electre method the kernel preferred set is depended on the assigned value for the threshold c t and d t significantly no preference is defined for indicating the better alternatives in a kernel set thus the concept of net concordance and discordance index is applied to overcome the mentioned problems in the next step step 6 the net concordance c net and discordance d net index are calculated using the following formulation 23 c i n e t k 1 k i n c i k k 1 k i n c k i i 1 2 n 24 d i n e t k 1 k i n d i k k 1 k i n d k i i 1 2 n step 7 the net concordance and discordance indices provide the score for each alternative to sort all of them from the best to the worst higher net concordance and lower net discordance values are always preferred thus the best solution a is calculated by following expression 25 a m a x c i n e t d i n e t i 1 2 n 4 methods of weight assignment since the objectives of optimization have diverse purposes their importance is not equal the degree of importance is specified by assigning a weight to each attribute many methods have been applied for weight determination in the mcdm hwang and masud 1979 such as the eigenvector method weighted least square method entropy method and analytic hierarchy process ahp some of these methods focus on quantifying the quality of experts comments to extract the weight factors which are called subjective weights for example owners ship designers crew officers may consider the different level of importance for attributes of the economic safety and environmental pollution prevention attributes of a tanker ship thus ahp method can be used to determine the weight of each attribute however this research aims to assess the application of the mcdm methods for final design selection regardless of any specificity view of the decision makers so initially the weight entropy method is applied to measure the weight of the criteria then random weight vectors are generated with the uniform distribution and the result of such a stochastic input is analyzed with monte carlo simulation 4 1 weight entropy technique the shannon entropy technique is based on information theory entropy indicates the uncertainty of the information using the probabilistic methods in fact the technique defines the importance of each criterion based on the value of its alternatives i e the wider range of the values of the attributes leads to higher weights of the criteria similarly the lower weights are defined for the criteria that have less variation besides the derived weights can be used either as the objective weights independently or as the subjective weights with incorporating the assigned weights by the decision maker the decision matrix x of m criteria and n alternative designs is normalized with the following formula 26 n i j x i j i 1 n x i j j 1 2 m then the entropy is measured by the following equation 27 δ j k i 1 n n i j ln n i j j 1 2 m where 28 k 1 ln m therefore the divergence degree d j can be calculated as 29 d j 1 δ j objective weights o j are evaluated based on the entropy concept 30 o j d j i 1 n d i j and finally the shannon entropy w j weights are calculated by incorporating the set of subjective weights 31 w j w j d j i 1 n w j d i j 4 2 stochastic subjective weights in the monte carlo simulation assume that a large number of designers have different viewpoints about the importance of each criterion in fact each viewpoint of a designer can be transferred into a subjective weight vector that reflects the importance of the criteria the final design selection is affected by the introduced weight to mcdm methods however the dependency of the selected alternatives and introduced weights need to be studied for this purpose a large number of weight vectors are introduced to the mcdm methods the diversity of provided weights covers the whole domains of interest to present the different viewpoint of designers for instance if a series of weights for a criterion is defined by interval step of 0 001 from 0 to 1 then 1 000 different weights are provided to present different viewpoints of 1 000 designers then the outcome of mcdm methods is predicted due to the intervention of introduced subjective weights in fact the principal of monte carlo simulation is used to analyze the final design selection from a pareto set of alternatives by the mcdm methods the monte carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that generates random variables for modelling risk or uncertainty of a certain system it can be applied to the systems coming from the deterministic analysis such as the mcdm methods for an infinite set of alternatives kolios et al 2016 in the mathematical sense the subjective weights can be assigned by any values which follows the following equation 32 j 1 m w j 1 j 1 2 m where m is a number of criteria although weights can be modelled with different probability distributions as an input of monte carlo simulations such as normal lognormal uniform and triangular the uniform random distribution is used to study the decision making process for considering the equal probability of the subjective weights afterwards the mcdm methods provide ranks for the alternatives due to each weight s inputs these ranks are recorded for a certain number of iterations and the probability of occurrence of each rank is calculated for all the alternatives and used for the modelling the output of the monte carlo simulation several trials are performed to observe the convergence of the results of mcdm methods the number of introduced weight vectors is increased in each trial the convergence of the monte carlo simulation is studied by measuring the consistency of the list of the following alternatives and their related probabilities the alternatives that have the maximum probability of getting each rank the alternatives that have the probability of being the first rank the alternative that has the maximum probability of being the first rank 5 method of comparison the results the mcdm methods the mcdm methods provide ranks for each alternative according to assigned weights for the criteria the results are compared in two steps initially the first ranked alternative is discussed in comparison with the top ranked ones among the pareto front solutions then the correlation between the provided ranks are measured by the spearman correlation coefficient r s as follow 33 r s 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 34 d i r a n k i a i r a n k i i a i where the rank i and rank ii present the rank of ith alternative based on the two applied ranking methods usually r s value lies between 1 and 1 where the value of 1 indicates a perfect match between two sets of rank orderings and a 1 value indicates a strong negative correlation between the methods 6 results and discussion 6 1 comparison of the alternative ranks based on the objective weights table 3 presents the objective weights of shannon entropy technique which are used for measuring the importance of each criterion table 4 shows the maximum and minimum values of alternatives for each criterion in the obtained pareto frontier the percentage of the changes of these values are also presented for showing the correlation between the diversity of alternatives values and objective weights of shannon entropy technique the oil outflow criteria have the highest variation in the non dominated solutions thus more importance is specified for the weight of the criterion the specified weight for max swbm is almost half of the mean oil outflow criterion however the variation percentage between the minimum and maximum values of max swbm is only around 5 less than the mean oil outflow the lowest importance is specified for the cargo capacity according to the shannon entropy technique table 5 presents the top selected designs among the whole alternatives for each mcdm methods the majority of selected alternatives are common for the methods of wsm wpm and electre while topsis results in different selected alternative relative to the other methods more details can be seen in table 6 which shows the comparison of superior designs selected by the wsm with the other methods although the score of each method has different rank the superior designs selected by the wsm are recognized as high ranked alternatives in the other methods the consistency of the provided rank for all the alternatives is measured by the spearman correlation coefficients which are presented in table 7 in general high correlation between the provided ranks indicates a similar trend of the specified ranks by the applied mcdm methods however there are different selections that can be observed by the small differences between the calculated value for the correlation coefficient the highest correlation is detected between the methods of wsm and wpm while the lowest correlation is detected in the topsis with wsm and electre methods also the average spearman correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of agreement of a method relative to the other methods chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 the wsm electre wpm and topsis have the strongest average correlation respectively 6 2 monte carlo simulation for the stochastic weights of the criteria the stochastic inputs are generated for each method of mcdm based on the monte carlo simulation the input variables are the weights which are modelled with the uniform random distribution afterwards the decision matrix is generated in an iterative process and the alternatives are ranked with the mentioned methods of the mcdm the outputs of iterations are recorded and the frequency of occurring of each rank is calculated also the spearman correlation coefficient is evaluated for each iteration and the mean value of the recorded coefficients is considered as the base of total ranking comparison the process has been performed three times in the first and second trials 10 000 and 50 000 weight vectors are generated respectively finally 100 000 iterations are performed in the third trial and the convergence study confirmed the accuracy of the number of simulations the alternatives that have the maximum probability of getting each rank are identified from the recorded results table 8 presents the dominant alternatives that have a higher probability of occurring of the top ten ranks for all the methods of mcdm for instance in the wsm the alternative number of 764 with the maximum probability of 47 7 can achieve the first rank and an alternative number of 4236 can achieve the 10th rank with the maximum probability of 11 7 the results show the most probable selected alternatives are most common in all the mcdm methods though there are differences in the probability of occurrences and order of ranks also the highest probability of achieving a rank is obtained for the first and second rank while the other ranks can be achieved by alternatives with significantly less value of maximum probability the first ranked alternative has a special importance because the final design is selected as the first ranked alternative thus the probability of being the first rank is calculated for all the alternatives from the recorded output of the iterations though the total number of alternatives are 264 as non dominated solutions in the pareto front not all of them have the equal chance of being the first alternative even with the mentioned number of iterations with different weight vectors table 9 presents the number of the alternatives that have the chance of being first selected acfs by the applied mcdm methods also it shows the maximum and minimum probability of being first for these alternatives with stochastic inputs for the subjective weights for instance in the wsm only 27 alternatives have the chance of being the first selected design where the highest probability of being first selected is 47 68 for the alternative 764 and the lowest probability is 0 02 for the alternative 1450 it should be noted the number and probability of these alternatives are observed during the convergence study of the monte carlo simulation they converge to a limited number of alternatives with approximately the same probabilities of being first i e no significant changes are observed in the number and probabilities of alternative that have the chance of being first even with increasing the resolution of the random subjective weights the alternatives ids that have the chance of being first selected by the applied mcdm methods are specified in figs 8 10 with the label of acfs fig 8 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of max swbm and oil outflow the majority of acfs are more concentrated in the region of the solutions that present the lower value for the oil outflow and max swbm fig 9 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of cargo capacity and oil outflow the majority of acfs are close to the border of maximum available cargo capacity and minimum available oil outflow for the obtained solutions fig 10 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of cargo capacity and max swbm the majority of acfs are close to the border of maximum available cargo capacity and minimum available max swbm for the obtained solutions considering that the oil outflow and max swbm are cost criteria and the cargo capacity is a benefit criterion the number of afcs that have better values in cost criteria are more than the number of afcs that have a better value in benefit criterion the reason can be described due to the number of cost criteria that is more than benefit criteria and the behavior of the cost criteria that are in the same agreeable direction because the uniform random distribution provides an equal chance for assigning the weight to the criteria and the problem is defined for two cost criteria with the same agreeable direction against one benefit criterion thus more chances are provided for the alternatives that have a better value in the cost criteria it should be noted that the values of the criteria for the acfs indicate that they present the diversities of the provided solutions by the pareto front i e they are distributed all over the domain of pareto solutions though their numbers are limited to a few selections distribution of the probabilities of being first is not equal to the acfs as is shown in figs 11 13 for the wsm fig 11 shows the maximum probability of being first for the criteria of max swbm and mean oil outflow which are cost criteria the higher probability of being first is dedicated to the alternatives that have a lower distance relative to the interested values of these criteria figs 12 and 13 show the maximum probability of being first for one of the cost criteria against the benefit criterion cargo capacity however the higher probabilities of the alternatives that have a chance of being first are observed for those with better values of the cost criteria there are relatively few afcs with a good value of benefit criteria and a high probability of being first a similar trend is observed for all the other applied methods of mcdm fig 14 shows the comparison of the alternatives id and their relative probability of being first for all the methods of the mcdm in these figures only the ten top alternatives that have the most probability of being the first selection are shown as can be seen the alternative 764 is the most probable selection as the first design for the methods wsm wpm and topsis and the maximum probability of first having a significant difference with the second ranked alternative however the alternative 2565 is the most probable selection as the first design in electre and there is a slight difference between the maximum probability of being first and second selected alternative additionally the spearman correlation coefficient which measures the correlation between the provided ranks by each method and the average of the coefficient is presented in table 10 the maximum average correlation is observed between wsm and wpm and the minimum one is observed between wpm and topsis the average of all these coefficients indicates that wsm wpm electre and topsis have the strongest average correlation respectively 6 3 discussion on the final design selection the alternative 764 is the one selected by the majority of the mcdm methods with the objective weights of shannon entropy technique it also has the maximum probability of being the first ranked in the majority of the applied mcdm methods fig 15 and fig 16 show the criteria values of the alternative 764 in comparison with the other alternatives in the pareto frontier reduction of cost criteria is observed as the main tendency of the selection of the top alternatives by the applied mcdm methods especially the alternative 764 indicates the importance of selecting better values for the cost criteria though the selection tendency is expected because of the assigned objective weights which specify the cost criteria have more importance relative to the benefit criterion similarly when the mcdm methods are fed with the wide range of subjective weights that follow a random uniform distribution the stochastic analysis of monte carlo simulation shows the highest probability of being first is dedicated to the alternative 764 regardless of the type of criteria that could be cost or benefit the alternative 764 has better values for two criteria among the three defined criteria the higher chance of selection of such an alternative is due to the privilege of the alternative in two of three criteria relative to the other alternatives on the other hand the monte carlo simulations resulted in the other afcs that can provide a wide range of interests in different criteria with a fewer number of alternatives relative to the number of alternatives in pareto front the method can provide a free hand for a designer to select the final design among the afcs for instance a decision maker may not be interested in the selected alternative due to lower assigned weight to the benefit criterion such as alternative 764 thus higher weights need to be determined to the benefit criterion relative to the cost ones consequently one of the afcs can be selected by the applied mcdm methods for the case study so the afcs can be suggested to ease the decision making for a designer the following example elaborates the application of afcs based on designer interests assume that the designer searching for an alternative design in the vicinity of the reference design with a higher benefit criterion relative to the cost criteria the designer expectation can be specified by a maximum and a minimum variation of the benefit criterion cargo capacity relative to the reference design thun the final design selection is limited to the alternatives that are in the specified limits by the designer s expectations consequently a few afcs remain in the redefined feasible domain the alternative 3125 can be suggested as the final design among the alternatives that have a chance of being first ranked figs 15 and 16 show the alternative 3125 has a higher value of cargo capacity while it has slight variations for the oil outflow and max swbm relative to the reference design the properties of the two alternatives are compared in table 11 considering the design variable of the defined optimization problem 7 conclusion the outputs of multi objective optimization are defined as the input of the mcdm problem for the selection of the final internal layout of tankers well known methods of mcdm are applied for ranking the solutions of the obtained pareto frontier the importance of criteria is assigned by the objective weights of shannon entropy technique afterwards stochastic analysis is applied in a monte carlo simulation to compare the effect of weight assignment on the final design selection by different methods of mcdm furthermore a comparison study is performed for the evaluated rank of alternatives by the applied mcdm methods the applied mcdm methods result in selection of similar top ranked alternatives mostly a unique solution is selected as the final design in the absence of interest data of the decision maker for final design the objective weight of shannon can be applied to specify the importance of the criteria however the assigned weights for the criteria are highly affected by the behavior of the objective functions in the defined optimization problem and the diversity and concentration of the obtained solution for the pareto frontier the higher importance is assigned to the two cost criteria relative to the only benefit criterion consequently the mcdm methods selected the alternative that has better values in max swbm and oil outflow relative to cargo capacity when subjective weights are assigned in a random uniform distribution the stochastic analysis of the monte carlo outputs indicates that few alternatives have high chance of being the first ranked ones in spite of assigning a variety of weight vectors for the criteria these alternatives are similar for all applied methods of mcdm the alternative that has the highest chance of being the first rank is in agreement with the selected alternative due to assigning weight by shannon entropy technique the alternatives with a chance of being first ranked present a diversity of different interest objectives in the pareto frontier though they are limited to a few numbers these alternatives are capable to make the decision making process easier with reducing the number of suggested solutions to the designer however a comprehensive study is required to examine the quality and quantity of these alternatives for other case studies of the obtained pareto solutions in the future works credit authorship contribution statement h jafaryeganeh methodology

21973,multi criteria decision making methods are applied to select the final design from the pareto front obtained in multi objective optimization problems in a ship design problem the focus is on the selection of the final design of the internal layout of oil tankers to fulfil this aim some of the widely used methods of multi criteria decision making are applied and the final selected internal layout dimensions are discussed in a comparative study for a shuttle tanker whereas the final selected design by the multi criteria decision making methods is significantly dependent on the specified weight for each criterion the weights are defined by two methods first the objective weights are defined by shannon entropy technique next the monte carlo simulation is used to compare the ranked solutions by random subjective weights the selected design by the applied methods of multi criteria decision making is discussed for both weight assignment approaches keywords ship design internal

considering the specified merit functions and limits which are dependent on the expected functionally of the vessel the design of the internal layout of the hull is one major task of the early stage of the ship design process though the consideration differs for each type of the vessels for instance lyu et al 2015 defined a single objective problem for optimization of subdivision arrangement of a military ship the target of optimization was the improvement of anti wind capacity after the considered damage scenario however for oil tankers the internal layout of ships has been optimized with a multi objective approach based on different objectives such as economic environmental pollution prevention and survivability of the ships as matter of fact the global optimization procedure in ship design results in exploration of a wide range of the non dominated solutions which not only fulfil the constraints but also each one is superior at least in one of the objective functions relative to the other solutions because usually the objectives of optimization have conflict in the favourite direction for the majority of these problems thus approaching the pareto front solutions has been considered as a prominent strategy by the optimization algorithms however reaching to the recognizable front of pareto solutions is not guaranteed in all the cases for instance chen et al 2010 adopted the integer coding and special crossover operation in the genetic algorithm to obtain the optimum designs of watertight bulkheads position along with the transverse frames they reached a few non dominated solutions which were spread widely in the design space a comparative analysis was presented to depict the privileges of the picked non dominated solutions relative to the reference design however the selection of the final design from the pareto solutions was not discussed on the other hand if the optimization results in a set of the recognizable pareto frontier posterior methods are required to identify the superior design one of these posterior methods is a visualization of the pareto front which assists the designer to understand the similarities and differences between the alternatives in the objectives of the defined problem these methods are categorized in miettinen 2014 for small sets of alternatives and described in lotov and miettinen 2008 for a large number of alternatives a visual comparison can be performed with the two dimensional or three dimensional diagrams of non dominated solutions as done by papanikolaou 2010 who used a multi objective approach for optimization of the arrangement of ro ro ships where the pareto front was recognized and the values of the objectives for each design were presented in two dimensional scatter diagrams which served the basis for the comparison which was performed based on the designer s preference and experiences on the other hand the designer requires additional tools to quantify the pros and cons of each alternative the final optimal solution can be selected by a trade off between conflicting objective functions thus the selection of final designs can be defined as a multi criteria decision making mcdm problem which aims to rank the alternatives to find the best satisfaction of the given criteria which are not necessarily in the same direction so the pareto solutions can be judged by the mcdm methods and the superior design can be identified among the available alternatives this concept is applied in papanikolaou et al 2010 for optimization of the internal layout of an oil tanker and similarly in koutroukis et al 2014 priftis et al 2018 and nikolopoulos and boulougouris 2018 for optimization of the internal layout of container ships they used a utility function to reach the final selected design after performing the multi objective optimization for the problem of the internal layout of the ships the importance of each objective was defined by the weights which were assigned by considering sample scenarios the applied mcdm methods in the ship design are not limited to the utility function method as caprace and rigo 2011 used the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee for decision making about the metric of complexity of the passenger ship design the criteria were defined as subdivision complexities in a predefined layout of a generic passenger ship the alternatives were defined as different designs of passenger ships with approximatively the same size then promethee was used for judgment of the few alternatives with the considered criteria however the weights of the criteria were assigned by considering sample scenarios in a different approach ölçer et al 2006 developed a new mcdm methodology for subdivision arrangement of ro ro vessels which integrates the multi objective optimization with a fuzzy multi attributive group decision making technique later for subdivision arrangement of ropax vessels ölçer 2008 approximated the set of pareto optimal solutions by an evolutionary method then the topsis method was applied to rank the obtained solutions where the weights of criteria were assigned by the weight evaluation technique in this technique the decision maker specifies the rank orders of attributes the weights are assigned on the interval of 0 100 based on their relative importance generally mcdm can be divided into two main categories multiple attribute decision making madm and multiple objective decision making modm based on the suggestion of hwang and yoon 1973 the madm deals with a limited number of predetermined alternatives and discrete preference ratings the modm aims to achieve the optimal or aspired goals by considering the various interactions within the given constraints also the approaches for solving the madm problem can be divided into two groups of compensatory and non compensatory milani et al 2006 in the compensatory models the trade off among the attributes is allowed by applying the multi attribute utility theory maut keeney et al 1979 the maut is based on providing a utility function to evaluate the alternatives the utility function aggregate all the criteria in one dimension and can be used to rank the alternatives weight sum method and analytic hierarchy process saaty 1980 are examples of this approach in the non compensatory models the alternatives are compared to each other with respect to individual criteria such as electre method roy 1968 which use the outranking relationship in this work the problem of the internal layout of the ship is considered a subset of the main topic of mcdm because the problem has been optimized by an evolutionary algorithm jafaryeganeh et al 2019 and the results of the pareto front are considered as predetermined alternatives and different approaches of madm are applied to select the final design many methods have been developed for mcdm considering the type of problem and fig 1 shows the taxonomy of the mcdm based on the procedure of decision making ribeiro et al 2011 each method of mcdm follows a different procedure for ordering the preferred alternatives where the methods differ in criteria weightings determination normalization techniques and aggregation jahan and edwards 2015 thus they may result in producing a different ranking for the alternatives and effect on the final design selection however the confidence of decision making can reach a higher level by measuring the similarity of the provided ranks with different methods these similarities can be evaluated through the measurement of the correlation coefficient of the specified ranks for the alternatives the assigned weight for each criterion significantly influences the recommended selection by each mcdm method the methods of weight assignment can be categorized roughly into three groups of objective subjective and integrated wang and luo 2010 the subjective methods assign the weights of criteria based on the subjective preference information of decision makers the objective methods specify the weights using objective decision matrix information the integrated methods determined the weights by a combination of subjective information of decision makers and objective information of decision matrix in this work an overview is presented for the problem of the hull internal layout of an oil tanker and the obtained pareto solutions are introduced as the input of the mcdm problem then the methods of weighted sum weighted product topsis and electre are applied for decision making of the final selection solution from the pareto front the importance of the criteria is discussed by objective and subjective weight vectors the objective weights are calculated by the shannon entropy technique shannon 1948 then the applied methods of mcdm are compared by top ranked selections and the spearman correlation coefficient subjective weights are provided by the stochastic method to study the effect of ranking by each mcdm method in monte carlo simulations then the alternatives that have the maximum probability of the getting each rank are determined and used for comparative analysis of final design selection finally the superior designs in the pareto fonts are discussed 2 problem definition for internal hull layout of oil tanker here a summary is presented to describe the process that resulted in pareto solutions for a problem of internal layout design of oil tanker because the obtained pareto solutions are introduced as the input of the mcdm problem though the focus of the present work is on the post optimization process more detail can be found in jafaryeganeh et al 2019 regarding the definition of the optimization problem the applied approach to reach the pareto solutions and discussion about the results of the optimization process design of the hull internal layout is one of the preliminary tasks in the ship design which depends on the type of the ship and the internal spaces applications usually similar arrangements are supposed to be used for a special type of vessel but the dimensions of the internal compartments still need to be determined in the initial stage of ship design on the other hand the designers intend to reach the maximum functionality in the available space of ship hull while they have to consider the safety and pollution prevention for the design of the internal layout of the tankers improvement of safety and pollution prevention can be defined as the goal in the design process and at the same time should comply with the restrictions of the survivability regulations all these conflicting objectives and constraints lead to define the design of internal layout as an optimization problem fig 2 shows the schematic view of the internal layout definition as the multi objective optimization for the oil tankers 2 1 objectives the optimization process intends to improve the following objectives 1 mean oil outflow parameter to measure pollution prevention accidental oil outflow parameter indicates the performance of the tanker in the event of an accident and the lower value for mean oil outflow results in less pollution of the marine environment thus minimization of the objective is favourable the oil outflow is calculated according to the regulations of marpol annex i reg 23 imo 2004 2 cargo capacity to measure the economic profits the cargo capacity indicates the economic property of a ship in the operation of oil transportation thus maximization of the available space for cargo is favourable 3 maximum still water bending moment swbm to improve the structural safety reduction of the induced load to the ship hull results in increasing the safety of the structure against the failures guedes soares et al 1996 the sill water loads are one of the major induced loads to the ship hull and the vertical still water loads are the most investigated component of the still water induced loads because of the higher values of imposed loads relative to the other directions these loads have a significant effect for design of the ship s structure and consequently more effective on the safety of the ship hull guedes soares 1990a the vertical bending moment is a significant indication of the imposed load to the ship hull among the components of induced loads due to the still water max swbm indicates the imposed load to the ship structure in the normal operation guedes soares 1990b so the safety of the ship improves with the reduction of the imposed load to the ship structure 2 2 design variables the design variables are the set of the parameters that control the dimension of the internal layouts as listed below and depicted in fig 3 the longitudinal positions of the transverse bulkheads alongside the ship li i 1 7 the longitudinal position of forming internal layout in the curved area of hull li i 8 9 the hull of tankers mostly has a parallel wall sided shell in the mid body and more curved shape in the aft and especially forward in these parts the inclination points are adapted to the ship hull to provide the ability to reach the maximum available space and providing the shape diversity for internal layout thus the longitudinal positions of these points are considered as the design variables the widths of the wing tanks w the heights of double bottom tanks h for each longitudinal subdivision it should be noted that the longitudinal position of collision bulkhead is not considered as the independent design variable and calculated using the below equation 1 l c b d l b p i 1 9 l i where lbp is the length between the perpendiculars 2 3 constraints the constraints of the problem can be divided into two categories regulatory restrictions and practical design limitations the regulation limits are mentioned in solas imo 2012 marpol imo 2006 and cll imo 1966 some of them specify direct restriction for the size of internal layout members and the others determine confinements for the ship stability in the intact and damage conditions the practical design constraints deal with the minimum requirement of spaces for the machinery slop and fuel tanks and minimum bulkhead distances in a feasible design approach table 1 shows the summary of the main applied constraint with the references more detail of the constrains for oil tankers can be found in jafaryeganeh et al 2018 2 4 case study a shuttle tanker has been considered as a case study and its main particulars are listed in table 2 in the reference design the main subdivision consists of eight transverse bulkheads and a central longitudinal bulkhead fig 4 shows the initial general arrangement of the tanker where the upper structure is located in the forward and the below compartment of the supper structure includes the machinery spaces such as engine room and pump room the parametric model is provided according to jafaryeganeh et al 2016 and jafaryeganeh et al 2018 by the caeses friendship systems 2019 and maxsurf bentley systems 2018 software the ship hull shape is assumed to be fixed and a unique topology is assumed for the compartment layout to generate the parametric model the number of transverse and longitudinal bulkheads are assumed constant for a configuration the diversity of configurations is provided by introducing the parameters for the shape of the internal layout 2 5 optimization method the determination of the hull internal layout dimensions is defined as a non linear multi objective and multi constraint problem so the multi objective genetic algorithm moga is used to approach the non dominated solutions the genetic algorithm can approach the global optimum designs and avoid the trap of local optimum solutions however it may converge slowly with a large number of iterations the adopted moga by dakota adams et al 2017 software has the ability to handle discrete design variables which is required for a realistic assessment of internal layout 2 6 pareto solutions the pareto front that has been determined from the optimization of the multi objective problem is presented in figs 5 7 the trade off between the objectives is observed because the increment in the capacity of cargo results in an increment in the mean oil outflow parameter and max swbm the reference design can improve significantly in the aspects of oil outflow and max swbm while improving only slightly the cargo capacity although the reference design approaches the dominated solutions from the aspect of capacity it is not identified as one of the pareto solutions 3 methods of mcdm the output of the optimization problem is redefined according to the mcdm inputs so the available pareto front becomes the decision matrix x as below 2 c 1 c 2 c m x x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 21 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x n m a l t e r n a t i v e 1 a l t e r n a t i v e 2 a l t e r n a t i v e n where the criteria of c j indicate the objective function of the optimization problem alternative i denotes the provided non dominant design in the pareto set the majority of the mcdm methods require to use a normalization method for the attribute values thus initially the applied technique of normalization is described then the methods of mcdm are explained 3 1 method of normalization of the attribute values most mcdm methods apply the normalization technique to convert the criteria values into non dimensional values in fact the values should be approximately in the same range of magnitude milani et al 2005 so as an initial step the vector normalization is applied for scale the decision matrix into the interval 0 1 the values of criteria are normalized by the following formulation 3 r i j x i j i 1 n x i j 2 for benefit criteria 4 r i j 1 x i j i 1 n x i j 2 for cost criteria using the separate formulations has the advantage of unifying the trend of normalized values regardless of the criteria type because the higher normalized value indicates the better performance for the alternatives in that specific criteria 3 2 weighted sum method wsm weighted sum method is probably the most widely used among the method of mcdm due to the simplicity of applying and following an intuitive process kolios et al 2016 the underlying assumption of the wsm is that attributes are preferentially independent i e the contribution of each individual attribute to the total score does not depend on the other attributes values the following steps are performed in this method step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although if the units of alternatives are commensurable their value can be used directly in the utility function however for the defined problem of internal layout design the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 a utility function u i is provided by a combination of all the performance value of alternatives with their relevant weights w j 5 u i j 1 m r i j w j where n and m are the numbers of alternative and criteria respectively step 3 the alternatives are sorted based on the achieved score by the mentioned utility function the following formulation can drive the best alternative a 6 a m a x u i i 1 2 n 3 3 weighted product method wpm the wpm can compare two alternatives without normalization of attribute values the following formulation presents the comparison ratio r between alternative a u and a v 7 r a u a v j 1 m x u j x v j k j k j w j if j t h criteria is benefit k j w j if j t h criteria is cost where m is the number of criteria and w j is the weight of j th criterion if r 1 the alternative a u is better than the a v the following steps can be used for ranking all the alternatives in relation to an ideal solution step 1 the ideal solution a d is determined it is defined as the alternative with the best value for the attributes among the whole alternatives i e the attributes of the ideal solution are selected as maximum values for the benefit and minimum values for the cost criteria step 2 the comparison ratio is calculated by comparing all the alternatives relative to the ideal solution 8 r i a i a d i 1 2 n step 3 the alternatives are sorted based on the achieved score by the mentioned comparison ratio thus the best solution a is presented by the following expression 9 a m a x r i i 1 2 n where r i is the score of i th alternative and n is the number of alternatives 3 4 technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution topsis the concept of topsis method is based on choosing a compromise solution by measuring the distance relative to the best and worst ideal solution hwang and yoon 1973 so the best solution is as close as possible to the positive ideal solution and at the same time it is as far as possible from the negative ideal solution a euclidean norm measures the distance between each solution with the positive and negative ideal ones the following steps are applied for ranking the alternatives based on the topsis method step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 the weighted the normalization matrix is calculated as follow 10 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m step 3 the positive ideal a and negative ideal solution a are identified as bellow 11 a v 1 v 2 v m m a x i v i j j i m i n i v i j j i i 1 n 12 a v 1 v 2 v m m i n i v i j j i m a x i v i j j i i 1 n where i and i indicate for the benefit and cost criteria respectively step 4 the separation distance between alternative to positive ideal solutions s and negative ideal solution s are measured with n dimensional euclidean distance as below 13 s i j 1 m v i j v j 2 i 1 n 14 s i j 1 m v i j v j 2 i 1 n step 5 the distance of solution is calculated relative to the ideal ones by measuring the similarity to the positive ideal solution and incorporation the dissimilarity to the negative ideal solution according to the following formula 15 c i s i s i s i where c i is the relative closeness index for the ith alternative step 6 each alternative is ranked based on the obtained score of similarity to the positive ideal solution thus alternative with the maximum relative closeness index is the most preferred one a 16 a m a x c i i 1 2 n 3 5 elimination et choice translating reality electre method the electre method is based on the definition of outranking relationships which uses concordance and discordance concept concordance and discordance indicate the quantity of satisfaction and dissatisfaction from the viewpoint of the decision maker then threshold idea is used to form a kernel consisting of preferred alternatives a variety of electre methods were developed for different purposes tzeng and huang 2011 such as electre i ii iii iv is and tri each type is based on the same concept but they operate in different ways a modified electre i method nijkamp and rietveld 1976 is applied in this study the used method includes the following steps step 1 transferring the decision matrix to the normalized value although the vector normalization is applied to provide the scaled values r ij for attributes as described before step 2 the weighted the normalization matrix is calculated as follow 17 v i j w j r i j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m step 3 determining the concordance and discordance set the concordance c and discordance d sets are determined by pairwise comparison of the alternatives following formulation is considered for two alternatives of a p and a q 18 c p q j v p j v p j p q j 1 m 19 d p q j v p j v p j p q j 1 m in other words c p q is the collection of criteria where a p is better than or equal to a q and d p q is the collection of criteria where a p is worse than a q step 4 calculating the concordance and discordance index the relative power of each concordance and discordance set is measured by concordance c pq or discordance d pq index as below 20 c p q j w j 21 d p q j v p j v q j j v p j v q j where j and j are attributes contained in the concordance set c p q and discordance set of d p q respectively in other words the c pq and d pq are the degrees of agreement and disagreement of two alternatives of a p and a q thus the outranking relationship can be defined based on higher value for the concordance index and at the same time lower value for the discordance index step 5 forming a kernel of alternatives if c t and d t are assumed to be threshold values for the c pq and d pq receptively then the following outrank relationship between a p and a q will be used to determine the kernel of preferred alternatives 22 a p a q c p q c t d p q d t where c t and d t can be considered as arbitrary values though normally they are assumed to be mean of c pq and d pq two following weakness is recognized for such electre method the kernel preferred set is depended on the assigned value for the threshold c t and d t significantly no preference is defined for indicating the better alternatives in a kernel set thus the concept of net concordance and discordance index is applied to overcome the mentioned problems in the next step step 6 the net concordance c net and discordance d net index are calculated using the following formulation 23 c i n e t k 1 k i n c i k k 1 k i n c k i i 1 2 n 24 d i n e t k 1 k i n d i k k 1 k i n d k i i 1 2 n step 7 the net concordance and discordance indices provide the score for each alternative to sort all of them from the best to the worst higher net concordance and lower net discordance values are always preferred thus the best solution a is calculated by following expression 25 a m a x c i n e t d i n e t i 1 2 n 4 methods of weight assignment since the objectives of optimization have diverse purposes their importance is not equal the degree of importance is specified by assigning a weight to each attribute many methods have been applied for weight determination in the mcdm hwang and masud 1979 such as the eigenvector method weighted least square method entropy method and analytic hierarchy process ahp some of these methods focus on quantifying the quality of experts comments to extract the weight factors which are called subjective weights for example owners ship designers crew officers may consider the different level of importance for attributes of the economic safety and environmental pollution prevention attributes of a tanker ship thus ahp method can be used to determine the weight of each attribute however this research aims to assess the application of the mcdm methods for final design selection regardless of any specificity view of the decision makers so initially the weight entropy method is applied to measure the weight of the criteria then random weight vectors are generated with the uniform distribution and the result of such a stochastic input is analyzed with monte carlo simulation 4 1 weight entropy technique the shannon entropy technique is based on information theory entropy indicates the uncertainty of the information using the probabilistic methods in fact the technique defines the importance of each criterion based on the value of its alternatives i e the wider range of the values of the attributes leads to higher weights of the criteria similarly the lower weights are defined for the criteria that have less variation besides the derived weights can be used either as the objective weights independently or as the subjective weights with incorporating the assigned weights by the decision maker the decision matrix x of m criteria and n alternative designs is normalized with the following formula 26 n i j x i j i 1 n x i j j 1 2 m then the entropy is measured by the following equation 27 δ j k i 1 n n i j ln n i j j 1 2 m where 28 k 1 ln m therefore the divergence degree d j can be calculated as 29 d j 1 δ j objective weights o j are evaluated based on the entropy concept 30 o j d j i 1 n d i j and finally the shannon entropy w j weights are calculated by incorporating the set of subjective weights 31 w j w j d j i 1 n w j d i j 4 2 stochastic subjective weights in the monte carlo simulation assume that a large number of designers have different viewpoints about the importance of each criterion in fact each viewpoint of a designer can be transferred into a subjective weight vector that reflects the importance of the criteria the final design selection is affected by the introduced weight to mcdm methods however the dependency of the selected alternatives and introduced weights need to be studied for this purpose a large number of weight vectors are introduced to the mcdm methods the diversity of provided weights covers the whole domains of interest to present the different viewpoint of designers for instance if a series of weights for a criterion is defined by interval step of 0 001 from 0 to 1 then 1 000 different weights are provided to present different viewpoints of 1 000 designers then the outcome of mcdm methods is predicted due to the intervention of introduced subjective weights in fact the principal of monte carlo simulation is used to analyze the final design selection from a pareto set of alternatives by the mcdm methods the monte carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that generates random variables for modelling risk or uncertainty of a certain system it can be applied to the systems coming from the deterministic analysis such as the mcdm methods for an infinite set of alternatives kolios et al 2016 in the mathematical sense the subjective weights can be assigned by any values which follows the following equation 32 j 1 m w j 1 j 1 2 m where m is a number of criteria although weights can be modelled with different probability distributions as an input of monte carlo simulations such as normal lognormal uniform and triangular the uniform random distribution is used to study the decision making process for considering the equal probability of the subjective weights afterwards the mcdm methods provide ranks for the alternatives due to each weight s inputs these ranks are recorded for a certain number of iterations and the probability of occurrence of each rank is calculated for all the alternatives and used for the modelling the output of the monte carlo simulation several trials are performed to observe the convergence of the results of mcdm methods the number of introduced weight vectors is increased in each trial the convergence of the monte carlo simulation is studied by measuring the consistency of the list of the following alternatives and their related probabilities the alternatives that have the maximum probability of getting each rank the alternatives that have the probability of being the first rank the alternative that has the maximum probability of being the first rank 5 method of comparison the results the mcdm methods the mcdm methods provide ranks for each alternative according to assigned weights for the criteria the results are compared in two steps initially the first ranked alternative is discussed in comparison with the top ranked ones among the pareto front solutions then the correlation between the provided ranks are measured by the spearman correlation coefficient r s as follow 33 r s 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n n 2 1 34 d i r a n k i a i r a n k i i a i where the rank i and rank ii present the rank of ith alternative based on the two applied ranking methods usually r s value lies between 1 and 1 where the value of 1 indicates a perfect match between two sets of rank orderings and a 1 value indicates a strong negative correlation between the methods 6 results and discussion 6 1 comparison of the alternative ranks based on the objective weights table 3 presents the objective weights of shannon entropy technique which are used for measuring the importance of each criterion table 4 shows the maximum and minimum values of alternatives for each criterion in the obtained pareto frontier the percentage of the changes of these values are also presented for showing the correlation between the diversity of alternatives values and objective weights of shannon entropy technique the oil outflow criteria have the highest variation in the non dominated solutions thus more importance is specified for the weight of the criterion the specified weight for max swbm is almost half of the mean oil outflow criterion however the variation percentage between the minimum and maximum values of max swbm is only around 5 less than the mean oil outflow the lowest importance is specified for the cargo capacity according to the shannon entropy technique table 5 presents the top selected designs among the whole alternatives for each mcdm methods the majority of selected alternatives are common for the methods of wsm wpm and electre while topsis results in different selected alternative relative to the other methods more details can be seen in table 6 which shows the comparison of superior designs selected by the wsm with the other methods although the score of each method has different rank the superior designs selected by the wsm are recognized as high ranked alternatives in the other methods the consistency of the provided rank for all the alternatives is measured by the spearman correlation coefficients which are presented in table 7 in general high correlation between the provided ranks indicates a similar trend of the specified ranks by the applied mcdm methods however there are different selections that can be observed by the small differences between the calculated value for the correlation coefficient the highest correlation is detected between the methods of wsm and wpm while the lowest correlation is detected in the topsis with wsm and electre methods also the average spearman correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of agreement of a method relative to the other methods chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 the wsm electre wpm and topsis have the strongest average correlation respectively 6 2 monte carlo simulation for the stochastic weights of the criteria the stochastic inputs are generated for each method of mcdm based on the monte carlo simulation the input variables are the weights which are modelled with the uniform random distribution afterwards the decision matrix is generated in an iterative process and the alternatives are ranked with the mentioned methods of the mcdm the outputs of iterations are recorded and the frequency of occurring of each rank is calculated also the spearman correlation coefficient is evaluated for each iteration and the mean value of the recorded coefficients is considered as the base of total ranking comparison the process has been performed three times in the first and second trials 10 000 and 50 000 weight vectors are generated respectively finally 100 000 iterations are performed in the third trial and the convergence study confirmed the accuracy of the number of simulations the alternatives that have the maximum probability of getting each rank are identified from the recorded results table 8 presents the dominant alternatives that have a higher probability of occurring of the top ten ranks for all the methods of mcdm for instance in the wsm the alternative number of 764 with the maximum probability of 47 7 can achieve the first rank and an alternative number of 4236 can achieve the 10th rank with the maximum probability of 11 7 the results show the most probable selected alternatives are most common in all the mcdm methods though there are differences in the probability of occurrences and order of ranks also the highest probability of achieving a rank is obtained for the first and second rank while the other ranks can be achieved by alternatives with significantly less value of maximum probability the first ranked alternative has a special importance because the final design is selected as the first ranked alternative thus the probability of being the first rank is calculated for all the alternatives from the recorded output of the iterations though the total number of alternatives are 264 as non dominated solutions in the pareto front not all of them have the equal chance of being the first alternative even with the mentioned number of iterations with different weight vectors table 9 presents the number of the alternatives that have the chance of being first selected acfs by the applied mcdm methods also it shows the maximum and minimum probability of being first for these alternatives with stochastic inputs for the subjective weights for instance in the wsm only 27 alternatives have the chance of being the first selected design where the highest probability of being first selected is 47 68 for the alternative 764 and the lowest probability is 0 02 for the alternative 1450 it should be noted the number and probability of these alternatives are observed during the convergence study of the monte carlo simulation they converge to a limited number of alternatives with approximately the same probabilities of being first i e no significant changes are observed in the number and probabilities of alternative that have the chance of being first even with increasing the resolution of the random subjective weights the alternatives ids that have the chance of being first selected by the applied mcdm methods are specified in figs 8 10 with the label of acfs fig 8 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of max swbm and oil outflow the majority of acfs are more concentrated in the region of the solutions that present the lower value for the oil outflow and max swbm fig 9 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of cargo capacity and oil outflow the majority of acfs are close to the border of maximum available cargo capacity and minimum available oil outflow for the obtained solutions fig 10 presents the scatter plot the pareto solutions and the specified acfs for criteria of cargo capacity and max swbm the majority of acfs are close to the border of maximum available cargo capacity and minimum available max swbm for the obtained solutions considering that the oil outflow and max swbm are cost criteria and the cargo capacity is a benefit criterion the number of afcs that have better values in cost criteria are more than the number of afcs that have a better value in benefit criterion the reason can be described due to the number of cost criteria that is more than benefit criteria and the behavior of the cost criteria that are in the same agreeable direction because the uniform random distribution provides an equal chance for assigning the weight to the criteria and the problem is defined for two cost criteria with the same agreeable direction against one benefit criterion thus more chances are provided for the alternatives that have a better value in the cost criteria it should be noted that the values of the criteria for the acfs indicate that they present the diversities of the provided solutions by the pareto front i e they are distributed all over the domain of pareto solutions though their numbers are limited to a few selections distribution of the probabilities of being first is not equal to the acfs as is shown in figs 11 13 for the wsm fig 11 shows the maximum probability of being first for the criteria of max swbm and mean oil outflow which are cost criteria the higher probability of being first is dedicated to the alternatives that have a lower distance relative to the interested values of these criteria figs 12 and 13 show the maximum probability of being first for one of the cost criteria against the benefit criterion cargo capacity however the higher probabilities of the alternatives that have a chance of being first are observed for those with better values of the cost criteria there are relatively few afcs with a good value of benefit criteria and a high probability of being first a similar trend is observed for all the other applied methods of mcdm fig 14 shows the comparison of the alternatives id and their relative probability of being first for all the methods of the mcdm in these figures only the ten top alternatives that have the most probability of being the first selection are shown as can be seen the alternative 764 is the most probable selection as the first design for the methods wsm wpm and topsis and the maximum probability of first having a significant difference with the second ranked alternative however the alternative 2565 is the most probable selection as the first design in electre and there is a slight difference between the maximum probability of being first and second selected alternative additionally the spearman correlation coefficient which measures the correlation between the provided ranks by each method and the average of the coefficient is presented in table 10 the maximum average correlation is observed between wsm and wpm and the minimum one is observed between wpm and topsis the average of all these coefficients indicates that wsm wpm electre and topsis have the strongest average correlation respectively 6 3 discussion on the final design selection the alternative 764 is the one selected by the majority of the mcdm methods with the objective weights of shannon entropy technique it also has the maximum probability of being the first ranked in the majority of the applied mcdm methods fig 15 and fig 16 show the criteria values of the alternative 764 in comparison with the other alternatives in the pareto frontier reduction of cost criteria is observed as the main tendency of the selection of the top alternatives by the applied mcdm methods especially the alternative 764 indicates the importance of selecting better values for the cost criteria though the selection tendency is expected because of the assigned objective weights which specify the cost criteria have more importance relative to the benefit criterion similarly when the mcdm methods are fed with the wide range of subjective weights that follow a random uniform distribution the stochastic analysis of monte carlo simulation shows the highest probability of being first is dedicated to the alternative 764 regardless of the type of criteria that could be cost or benefit the alternative 764 has better values for two criteria among the three defined criteria the higher chance of selection of such an alternative is due to the privilege of the alternative in two of three criteria relative to the other alternatives on the other hand the monte carlo simulations resulted in the other afcs that can provide a wide range of interests in different criteria with a fewer number of alternatives relative to the number of alternatives in pareto front the method can provide a free hand for a designer to select the final design among the afcs for instance a decision maker may not be interested in the selected alternative due to lower assigned weight to the benefit criterion such as alternative 764 thus higher weights need to be determined to the benefit criterion relative to the cost ones consequently one of the afcs can be selected by the applied mcdm methods for the case study so the afcs can be suggested to ease the decision making for a designer the following example elaborates the application of afcs based on designer interests assume that the designer searching for an alternative design in the vicinity of the reference design with a higher benefit criterion relative to the cost criteria the designer expectation can be specified by a maximum and a minimum variation of the benefit criterion cargo capacity relative to the reference design thun the final design selection is limited to the alternatives that are in the specified limits by the designer s expectations consequently a few afcs remain in the redefined feasible domain the alternative 3125 can be suggested as the final design among the alternatives that have a chance of being first ranked figs 15 and 16 show the alternative 3125 has a higher value of cargo capacity while it has slight variations for the oil outflow and max swbm relative to the reference design the properties of the two alternatives are compared in table 11 considering the design variable of the defined optimization problem 7 conclusion the outputs of multi objective optimization are defined as the input of the mcdm problem for the selection of the final internal layout of tankers well known methods of mcdm are applied for ranking the solutions of the obtained pareto frontier the importance of criteria is assigned by the objective weights of shannon entropy technique afterwards stochastic analysis is applied in a monte carlo simulation to compare the effect of weight assignment on the final design selection by different methods of mcdm furthermore a comparison study is performed for the evaluated rank of alternatives by the applied mcdm methods the applied mcdm methods result in selection of similar top ranked alternatives mostly a unique solution is selected as the final design in the absence of interest data of the decision maker for final design the objective weight of shannon can be applied to specify the importance of the criteria however the assigned weights for the criteria are highly affected by the behavior of the objective functions in the defined optimization problem and the diversity and concentration of the obtained solution for the pareto frontier the higher importance is assigned to the two cost criteria relative to the only benefit criterion consequently the mcdm methods selected the alternative that has better values in max swbm and oil outflow relative to cargo capacity when subjective weights are assigned in a random uniform distribution the stochastic analysis of the monte carlo outputs indicates that few alternatives have high chance of being the first ranked ones in spite of assigning a variety of weight vectors for the criteria these alternatives are similar for all applied methods of mcdm the alternative that has the highest chance of being the first rank is in agreement with the selected alternative due to assigning weight by shannon entropy technique the alternatives with a chance of being first ranked present a diversity of different interest objectives in the pareto frontier though they are limited to a few numbers these alternatives are capable to make the decision making process easier with reducing the number of suggested solutions to the designer however a comprehensive study is required to examine the quality and quantity of these alternatives for other case studies of the obtained pareto solutions in the future works credit authorship contribution statement h jafaryeganeh methodology

21974,an umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf is a novel foundation for offshore wind turbines compared to the local scour occurring around deep foundations such as monopiles the scour around an usaf can significantly influence the stability of wind turbine systems therefore research on the local scour around an usaf induced by waves and currents is of great value to coastal engineering projects in this study a series of scour tests of an usaf were carried out and the authors evaluated the influences of a steady current waves and the combination of waves and currents the flow field and wave field were captured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter and wave gauge respectively moreover the equilibrium depth scope and shape of the scour holes are determined using an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the results demonstrate that the scour profiles are definitely distinctive for the three environmental conditions a standard k ω turbulent model is used to simulate the turbulent flow field the volume of fluid vof method is used in computational fluid dynamic cfd software to deal with the free water surface and moving mesh to explore the changes in the topography over time a dynamic three dimensional numerical model of the local scour around the usaf is developed and validated by comparing the results with previous scour tests and other published experimental data the scour characteristics of the usaf and the suction anchor foundation saf are determined by solving the fully three dimensional transient navier stokes equations in a fixed eulerian grid the results indicate that compared with a conventional saf the usaf can significantly prevent scour moreover the scour depth is significantly different for the two foundations under the combined wave current action and is approximately twice as large for the saf than the usaf keywords usaf offshore wind turbine scour tests numerical simulations wave current action 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owt have been widely developed in many countries despite the fact that the marine environment is extremely complex because tidal currents and waves probably create a horseshoe vortex and the vortex shedding which results in the fact that the contraction and acceleration of flow at the side edge of the foundations plays a significant role in the amplification of the bed shear stress and in turn the formation of scour wind turbines can be damaged wind turbine foundations have a significant impact on the structural stability many types of foundations exist for wind turbines including gravity foundation monopile foundation jacket foundation floating foundation and suction anchor foundation saf safs have been widely used for vessel mooring positioning buoys storage facilities lighthouses and offshore platforms therefore the installation and construction technology for foundations are quite mature moreover a new foundation type an umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf has been designed by the authors research group for wind farms in the yellow river delta in china which has been confirmed to be effective for broad application and high value due to its high bearing capacity low cost and promising future the detail information and engineering background can be found in the previous work liu et al 2014 li 2017 in fact the foundation mentioned in this study is composite of the suction anchor and monopile which should be one kind of suction caisson foundation as shown in fig 1 it is comprised of an internal compartment part 1 that includes a closed upper lid connected to the anchor ring and an open bottom an external skirt part 2 with an open lid linked to the anchor branches by supporting rods part 5 and a number of anchor branches part 4 with small holes hinged on the anchor ring part 3 the internal compartment consists of a telescopic hook part 6 on both sides of the external skirt that is attached to the skirt cylinder the anchor ring is welded together with the internal compartment through the four bearing rods that are attached to the anchor branches resulting in an umbrella shape of the whole longitudinal section of the usaf in the process of sinking the anchor accompanied by the implantation of the external skirt the anchor branches gradually expand driven by the supporting rods after the internal compartment is sunk completely the horizontally extended shape is located close to the seabed and the external skirt is fastened by the telescopic hook constituting an entire structure with an internal compartment that bears various static and dynamic loads the dimensions of the usaf and saf are listed in table 1 to date most researchers have mainly focused on the scour around monopiles induced by waves and currents such as scour mechanisms and time scale of scour development local scour around owt foundations has been studied by many researchers over the last decades petersen et al 2015 qi and gao 2014 ong et al 2013 whitehouse et al 2011 zanke et al 2011 and most studies have used scale model tests numerical simulations and field observations in general the local scour occurs in the clear water or in the live bed regimes raudkivi and ettema 1983 they can be determined by shields number θ and critical shields number θ cr of the bed material the clear water scour θ θ cr does not involve general sediment movements from upstream of the pile for live bed scour θ θ cr sand ripples usually occur when the median sediment diameter is smaller than 0 7 mm van rijn 1993 vortex shedding at the back of the pile is the critical factor of scour attributed to wave action while the horseshoe vortex occurring in front of the pile and streamline compression at the side of the pile are key factors for scour induced by steady flows as for the pile foundation the scour depth is a function of the orbit velocity near the bed u c u c u m and the kc number of the combined wave and current actions the scour depth is independent of the relative direction of the wave and flow sumer and fredsøe 1992 sumer and fredsøe 2001a 2001b conducted scour tests and determined that the horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and the vortex shedding at the lee side were the main reason for local scour around the pile foundation as illustrated in fig 2 in addition the kc number shields number the roughness of the pile and the reynolds number are the factors that affect the scour depth whitehouse et al 2006 conducted several scour tests and proposed that the equilibrium scour depth induced by a single flow is prominent compared with other conditions in the scour protection tests the authors stated that the optimum protective design consists of one layer of armor stone placed on one layer of filter around the monopile in terms of numerical analysis a lagrangian water sediment surface capturing method has been applied in the two and three dimensional scouring models with moving mesh approach which can reduce the computation time and also ensure the accuracy of scour simulation liu 2008 stahlmann et al 2010 carried out a set of physical scale model 1 40 and 1 12 tests for investigating the scour process induced by wave current and wave current actions around the tripod offshore foundation furthermore the three dimensional scour model stahlmann 2012b 2014 based on openfoam has been established and validated with experimental and theoretical data which indicates that the numerical model is capable of capturing the flow profile shear stress and scour profile importantly the scaling effect sediment sliding and suspended particle transport has been taken into account in the analysis the results show that local shear stress induced by the wave current action is 5 times as that of single load nielsen et al 2013 conducted numerical simulations and the results showed that the fluid velocity distribution shear stress distribution and scour protection layer settlement can be modeled by a vortex model rng in flow 3d it should be noted that the flow outside the scour protection is modeled correctly compared with the measured values in the physical model also the velocities inside the scour protection are comparable to the measured values although they are more uniform in the vertical direction based on the euler bernoulli beam element and the winkler hypothesis prendergast et al 2015 presented a finite element model of monopile soil to simulate scour by removing some spring beam elements the results demonstrated that the natural frequency of the structure was 6 5 lower in loose sand than in dense sand which indicated that a structure in loose sand was more likely to resonate moreover a new method was proposed for the design of scour based on the ultimate limit state and the fatigue limit state the scour processes in five european offshore wind farms were observed and the results showed that the field data and indoor model tests exhibited little discrepancy and that the maximum scour depth in scroby sands offshore wind farm east coast of uk occurred in shallow water the maximum scour depth was 1 38 d where d is the foundation diameter which was slightly larger than the dnv specification of 1 3 d but smaller than the value of 1 75 d derived using the opti pile design tool whitehouse et al 2008 boon et al 2004 further investigated several parameters using the opti pile design tool based on data from field observations of the beihai q7 horns rev and scorby sands wind farms and obtained relatively accurate results after applying the scour design tools to the horns rev and scorby sands wind farms however not much research has been conducted on scour around suction anchors in order to fill this research gap the authors investigate local scour around usaf under the actions of waves and currents and clarify the methods and processes of scour tests the scour tests their results and the related discussion follow in the next section for the numerical simulations the authors first introduce the theory of fluid sediment models and present the governing equations additionally the boundary conditions are also detailed in this section subsequently the validation of the proposed model is verified by comparisons with the scour tests and previously published experimental results finally the differences between the scour characteristics of an usaf and a saf for a single current waves and the combined wave current action are clarified in the results and discussion section the scour development is analyzed in a real marine environment and the resulting maximum scour depth scour range and shape of the usaf and saf are defined the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the scour development in an usaf and references for preventing erosion in ocean engineering 2 scour tests 2 1 methods the scour tests were carried out in the wave flume of the lab of coastal engineering environment ocean university of china the flume is 0 5 m in width 0 7 m in height and 14 m in length it is equipped with a piston type wave generator a slope is made up with fibrous mass and gravels in the end of the flume which can greatly reduce the effect of wave reflection and a simple circulatory current system designed by ourselves figs 3 and 4 the current systems are composed of two prefabricated rectangular guiding channels 0 2 m in length 0 48 m in width and 0 15 m in height in the upstream and downstream of the pile with distance 3 m which are connected by a pipe and a two phase water pump thus the circulation of the current in the flume is achieved a wave absorption was positioned in the wave flume on the opposite side of the wave generator to reduce any reflections that might occur during the tests each run started with the leveling of the sand bed after which water was slowly added until the required water depth was reached for a run to determine the effects of only waves the waves were generated directly for a combined wave current run a steady current was generated first using the circular flow system and then waves were added simultaneously the acquisition of topography and velocity data began and was maintained throughout the entire test when the run was finished the wave and current generators were stopped and the water was slowly drained until the scour hole could be observed clearly we recorded the topographical measurements of the scour hole using a total station and acquired photographs of the scour hole a steel usaf and a pile with a diameter of 0 1 m were mounted in the middle of the flume along its longitudinal axis to function as an anchor foundation a sand layer of 0 6 m in thickness was laid down to support the anchor and to function as the eroding material it is worth noticing that the top of the suction anchor was almost flush with the sand surface then the wooden block was used to level the sand and the water was added to the predetermined depth in order to reach the state of full consolidation the sufficient period of time 24 h was needed before carrying out the tests the median diameter of the sand grains was 0 257 mm the particle sizes were between 0 005 and 1 mm and the specific density of the sand is 1 903 the water depth was maintained at 0 375 m for single current and 0 4 m for wave action throughout all experimental runs the changes over time in the scour depth were simultaneously monitored by an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter with the controlling and analysis software ttmsexe created by sinfotek 2015 as shown in fig 5 during the scour test the measuring velocity 3 cm s probe moving velocity 3 cm s and the interval of each measurement 1000 ms were set for obtaining accurate scour depth during the scouring test 5 surveying lines were conducted at intervals of 2 h and the distance between the measuring points on the lines was 1 cm as shown in fig 6 a after the completion of the scour processes the last two measured topographies were basically similar during each test run the topography of the scour hole was measured using a total station after draining some of the water in the flume the pictures of scour pattern have been captured by camera dewatering definitely affects the scour pattern in some extent but it can be neglected in these tests depending on the extent of the actual scour the entire measuring area is selected and the whole grid is 0 01 m 0 01 m as shown in fig 6b an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter fig 3 was installed 5 m away from the cylinder and 0 05 m above the sand bed on the upstream side along the longitudinal axis of the flume to monitor the bottom velocity of the incoming current the wave parameters were recorded by a wave gauge fig 3 installed on the side wall of the flume in total three test runs were performed including one run with waves alone one run with the combined wave current flow and one run with a single current for the analysis of the effects of the combined wave and current on the scour in all of the combined wave current runs the waves and the current were co directional the depth averaged flow velocity was 0 189 m s only regular linear airy waves were considered in the tests the wave height was about 0 1 m and the wave period was 1 5 s the test conditions are summarized in table 2 and table 3 due to the limitation of flume all the scour test cases belonged to the clear water scour regime however the live bed scour regime was discussed in the section of numerical simulations the shields parameters θ for combined wave current conditions is calculated with θ τ max s 1 ρgd 50 soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 here τ max is the maximum bed shear stress under a combined wave current flow which is calculated using τ max τ m τ w cosϕ 2 τ w sinϕ 2 1 2 soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 the wave mobility parameter ϕ can be computed by ϕ u w 2 s 1 gd 50 soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 τ m is the mean bed shear stress during a wave cycle under combined wave current conditions soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 estimated by 1 τ m τ c 1 1 2 τ w τ c τ w 3 2 where τ w and τ c are the maximum bottom shear stresses induced by waves and current respectively τ w and τ c are calculated as τ w 0 5ρf w u w 2 and τ c ρc d u c 2 here u c is the depth averaged current velocity u w is the maximum bottom wave orbit velocity c d is the drag coefficient of flow soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 and estimated by 2 c d κ 1 ln z 0 d where z 0 is the bed roughness length z 0 d 50 12 κ is the von karman constant κ 0 4 d is the water depth f w is the wave friction factor the critical shields parameter for incipient sand motion is calculated using soulsby formula 1998 and is expressed as 3 θ cr 0 3 1 1 2 d 0 055 1 exp 0 02 d where d is a non dimensional sand parameter d g s 1 ν 2 1 3 d 50 ν is the kinematic viscosity of the water 1 3 10 6 m2 s 2 2 results and discussion of scour tests the topographic survey of the five lines was conducted during the scour tests with an interval of 2 h for clarity of representation only the experimental data of one line y4 0 11 m with an interval of 4 h is provided here as illustrated in fig 7 it is noted that scour depths s are non dimensional by the diameter of the steel tube d and that the negative value represents scour depth and the positive value stands for deposition height in addition scour depth of these lines may not be the maximum scour depth of the test 2 2 1 single current 2 2 1 1 scour shape and range in the range of 2 10 h the scour near the usaf is not particularly obvious but there is a certain deposition at the downstream end in the range of 10 18 h the scour depth changes markedly specifically the maximum scour depth increases from 0 013d to 0 068d furthermore the deposition at the upstream side of the usaf gradually decreases and scour occurs with depth changes from 0 003d to 0 054d in addition the location at the downstream side near the tube also exhibits more erosion the maximum scour variation in the upstream location is in the range of 14 18 h and the scour depth increases from 0 015d to 0 053d while the maximum scour at the lee surface is in the range of 10 14 h with a total increase of 0 047d additionally the deposition that previously occurred downstream away from the skirt exhibits a decreasing trend the section characteristics of the scour at the final time 18 h are given in fig 8 a overall overwhelming scour is located near the edge of the flume and the closer to the usaf the weaker the scour is the lines y2 and y3 have the largest range of variation and the maximum scour depth of the section increases from 0 018d to 0 086d the shape and range of the scour hole around the usaf under a single flow are shown in fig 9 generally local scour forms around the usaf along both sides of the flume and is symmetrically distributed the extent of the erosion and deposition is approximately 0 3 m 0 25 m it can be seen that the usaf erosion areas are mainly concentrated at the downstream side of the anchor branch and in close proximity to the skirt with a maximum scour depth of 0 17d on the upstream side of the usaf anchor branches and the downstream side of the usaf deposition occurred the maximum deposition height is 0 04d the causes of the scouring patterns may be the existence of the anchor branches as a result the vortex formation at the upstream side of the steel pipe is not enough to affect the sediment near the skirt therefore the sediment in front of the anchor branches begins to move and is further transferred by the current a small amount of sediments remains on the upstream side of the usaf but most of it is transported to the downstream side where the maximum height of deposition occurs because of the streamline compression caused by the flow the sediment is accumulated on the downstream side of the usaf and then migrates and ultimately the maximum scour pit is formed here after the test is finished the elevation of the reference points are measured in the 1 cm 1 cm grid by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter and the data are imported into mathematica software where the contour map fig 12a is obtained it is evident that there is a general consistency although there are some differences between the contour map fig 12a and the observation results fig 9 the reason is that the measurement area does not include all the measurement points and the remaining points are interpolated to obtain the elevation 2 2 1 2 equilibrium time for the single flow the elevation at the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h it should be noted that the reach of the maximum scour depth at the reference point was regarded as the criterion in three scour tests which indicates the equilibrium stage has been achieved however fig 7 was plotted only until 18 h for the reason that the scour depth of the measuring line is oscillated without significant change therefore it can be thought that the equilibrium state has been reached the curve of the scour depth over time is plotted as shown in fig 13a in general the scour development curve is divided into three stages a rapid erosion stage b slow erosion stage c erosion equilibrium stage within 0 6 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 067d between 6 h and 12 h the erosion rate decreases slightly at 12 h the erosion rate gradually decreases and the scour depth increases from 0 138d to 0 143d after 18 h the scour depth is basically unchanged and the maximum scour depth is reached based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the underlying causes of these three stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the flow encounters the steel structures in the upper area of the suction anchor the current flows around the cylinder which causes a horseshoe vortex to form in front of the steel tube and streamline compression at the sides of the tube the sediment starts to move and smaller scour pits occur after that turbulence appears induced by the scour hole and a large amount of the sediment is removed from the scour hole therefore the scour pit becomes rapidly enlarged in the slow erosion stage the effect of the flow on the existing sediment weakens and the erosion rate is reduced in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is 18 h 2 2 2 wave alone 2 2 2 1 scour shape and range the scour characteristics of y4 0 11 m fig 7b illustrate that the scour depth at the upstream side of the usaf exhibits almost no change over time while the downstream scour depth increases over time and the scour range extends outward eventually the maximum scour depth 0 149d occurs at the downstream side of the usaf in addition there is a scour pit at each side of the steel pipe maximum scour depth of 0 025d and there is some deposition on both sides of the pit maximum deposition height of 0 063d the characteristics of the scour at the final moment 20 h are shown in fig 8b overall significant scour occurs near the edge of the flume and the closer to the usaf the weaker the scour is the lines y2 and y3 have the largest range of variation and the scour depth of the section increases from 0 015d to 0 077d the shape and range of the scour pits of the usaf under the action of the waves are shown in fig 10 in general the scour is stronger in the downstream than the upstream side of the usaf and some deposition occurs at the upstream side of the anchor the maximum deposition height is 0 08d and the extent of the scour and deposition is approximately 0 25 m 0 25 m sand ripples are apparent in the entire soil box it is evident that the usaf erosion areas are mainly concentrated at the downstream side of the usaf the position of the maximum scour depth is located between two anchor branches and has a scour depth of 0 11d this result is in agreement with the results of the single flow experiment but the waves induce a greater scour range the causes of the scour patterns may be the existence of the anchor branches that prevent the effects of the horseshoe vortex on the sediment near the skirt resulting in the movement of the upstream sediment away from the usaf because the carrying capacity is certainly weaker for the waves than the current most of the sediment occurs on the upstream side of the usaf and is partly transferred to the downstream side owing to the vortex shedding the sediment in the downstream side of the anchor branch begins to migrate and ultimately the maximum scour pit forms here as in the single flow test the elevation of the reference points are captured by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the data are imported into the mathematica software and the contour map fig 12b is obtained 2 2 2 2 equilibrium time under the wave action the elevation of the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h the curve of the scour depth over time is shown in fig 13b the scour development curve is also divided into three stages a rapid erosion stage b slow erosion stage c erosion equilibrium stage within 0 6 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 052d between 6 h and 14 h the scour rate decreases slightly at 14 h the erosion rate gradually increases but is slightly weaker than in the previous phase the scour depth increases from 0 069d to 0 078d after 20 h the scour depth is basically unchanged and the maximum scour depth is reached based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the causes of these three stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the wave encounters the steel structures in the upper area of the suction anchor the waves flow around the cylinder which causes horseshoe vortices to form in front of the steel tube the sediment begins to move and small scour pits occur after that turbulence appears induced by the scour hole and a large amount of the sediment is removed from the scour hole therefore the scour pit becomes rapidly enlarged in the slow erosion stage the effect of the wave on the existing sediment weakens and the erosion rate decreases in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is around 20 h 2 2 3 combined wave and current 2 2 3 1 scour shape and range compared with the scour characteristics for the single flow the scour holes induced by the wave and current occur on both sides of the skirt during the test and the scour depth increases continuously over time as shown in fig 7 between 2 h and 14 h the development trend of the scour pit is nearly identical for the upstream and downstream side of the skirt the maximum scour depth increases from 0 007d to 0 169d upstream and from 0 031d to 0 127d downstream fig 7c scour pits also appear at the upstream and downstream sides of the steel tube and the trends are similar to the trends for the scour holes near the skirt the maximum scour depths are 0 116d upstream and 0 085d downstream of the steel tube fig 7c the scour characteristics at the final moment 18 h are shown in fig 7c there are significant differences in the scour characteristics for each line to be more specific the scour depth is smaller near the edge of the flume but there is a large area of erosion in front of the usaf lines y2 y3 and y4 and the scour depth is nearly similar 0 155d 0 157d and 0 149d respectively due to the fact that the scour around foundation under single current and wave current action are mainly dominated by the streamline compression and vortex respectively the scour is formed in the two sides of the usaf the y4 and y5 line profiles show that the scour pits at the upstream side of the usaf near the skirt have depths of 0 19d and 0 212d respectively the depths of the y3 and y4 lines at the downstream side near the skirt are 0 063d and 0 129d respectively the shape and extent of the scour pits of the usaf under the combined wave and current action are shown in fig 11 local scour forms around the usaf and is distributed symmetrically the erosion deposition extent is approximately 0 3 m 0 25 m it can be seen that the sand has been hollowed out under the anchor branches at the upstream side of the usaf scour pits with a maximum depth of 0 27d appear at the center of the two anchor branches and a scour pit also forms between the two anchor branches at the downstream side of the usaf sediment deposition occurs mainly at the downstream side of the usaf near the edge of the flume and the deposition height is 0 05d in addition the top surface of the skirt is completely covered by sediment the causes of the scour patterns may be related to the combined action of the waves and current leading to the formation of more intense turbulence therefore a large amount of the sediment in front of the usaf begins to move and the current carries it further there is little sediment at the upstream side of the usaf and most of it is transported to the downstream side of the usaf resulting in the formation of the largest height of deposition because of the streamline compression and vortex shedding caused by the flow the sediment on the downstream side of the usaf begins to move and is transported finally the scour pit forms at this location after the test is finished the elevation of the reference points are measured by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the data are imported into the mathematica software and the contour map fig 12c is obtained 2 2 3 2 equilibrium time under the wave current action the elevation of the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h the curve of the scour depth over time is shown in fig 13c the scour curve is divided into two stages 1 rapid erosion stage 2 erosion equilibrium stage within 0 14 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 11d at 16 h the scour depth increases slightly and reaches the maximum scour depth at 18 h based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the causes of these two stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the wave and current encounter the tube structure in the upper part of the suction anchor horseshoe vortices vortex shedding and streamline compression occur caused by the flow around the cylinder resulting in the movement of a large amount of sediment and the occurrence of small scour pits this influences the wave current field the turbulence energy is stronger than the energy produced by either the wave or the current alone a large amount of sediment is removed from the scour hole leading to a rapid increase in the size of the scour pit in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour depth development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is 18 h it is observed that under the combined wave and current action there is no slow growth stage of erosion the reason may be that the turbulent kinetic energy caused by the wave and current is larger than for the wave or current alone 3 numerical simulations 3 1 theoretical model all the models in this study are formulated based on volume and area porosity functions this formulation called favortm for fractional area or volume obstacle representation method is applied to simulate complicated geometric regions flow3d 2013 the details of the model have been described by hirt 1985 1993 3 1 1 momentum equations the equations of the motion for the fluid velocity u v w in the three coordinate

3 turbulent model in this study the standard k ω turbulent model was used to simulate the turbulent state for the reason that it is better enough than the k ε models in terms of the separation flow adverse pressure gradient after the pile additionally k ω sst turbulent model is still complex and difficult to get converged results although it is much more suitable to simulate the strong curvature streamline flow state the standard k ω model is based on the wilcox k ω model and is an improved model in that it considers low reynolds numbers compressibility and shear flow propagation the model predicts the propagation velocity of free shear flow such as lee wake mixing flow plate flow cylinder flow and radial jet therefore the model can be applied to the wall bounded flow and free shear

advection and deposition of the sediments it should be noted that the bed load effect was dominated in this model while the suspended effect was not taken into account due to its influence in the waves condition the suspended load will be considered in the future for bed load transport the model currently used was developed by meyer peter and müller 1948 this model predicts the volumetric flow of the sediment per unit width over the surface of the packed bed 10 φ s β s θ θ c r 1 5 c b s φ s is the dimensionless bed load transport rate and is related to the bed load transport rate of the

parameter can be defined by equation 3 the local shields parameter is calculated based on the local bed shear stress τ 12 θ τ g d s ρ s ρ w 3 2 boundary conditions 3 2 1 specified velocity condition the velocity boundary condition is the prescribed velocity with various velocities over time and surface of fluid at the boundary has been provided with elevation and the distribution of the velocity is uniform across the entire section at the inlet zero transverse v and vertical w velocities were specified the inlet characteristics of u k and ω are based on the equilibrium profiles obtained from the uniform channel flow computations with similar flow conditions 3 2 2 wave boundary a periodic linear surface wave can be generated at a mesh boundary the model is based on airy s linear wave theory as shown in fig 14 the linear wave is assumed to originate from a flat bottom reservoir and flows into the computational domain a linear wave is characterized by the wave amplitude a wave length λ angular frequency ω and wave number k 2π λ a uniform current may also exist and its undisturbed velocity component in the wave propagation direction is u c constant for the equations in this section a reference system x z is established with its origin fixed at the mean free surface x points towards the wave propagation direction and z towards the upward direction when using the code users can place the coordinate origin at any location but z must be in the upward direction 3 2 3 outflow condition the outflow boundary condition can be used for both compressible and incompressible fluid flows that are confined or have free surfaces at the outlet n 0 the neumann conditions were applied for all quantities 3 2 3 1 symmetry condition this represents the fundamental boundary condition which indicates that the fluid has no shear and no flux at the boundary this boundary can be well applied to simulate the symmetric flow and greatly reduces the number of calculations at the symmetry boundaries the neumann conditions were used for k ω u v and w 3 2 4 walls u v w 0 k 0 when the wall was smooth while the neumann condition was applied when the wall was rough and transitional regarding the latter condition experiments have shown that the neumann condition is satisfied k n 0 at the wall for rough boundaries where n is the direction normal to the wall tominaga et al 2001 sumer et al 2001 2003 3 3 application of model and validation 3 3 1 application of model the numerical simulations of the sediment scour around the usaf are conducted using flow 3d v11 0 3 2013 flow 3d is a computational fluid dynamic cfd code solving the fully three dimensional 3d transient navier stokes equations using a finite volume finite difference method in a fixed eulerian grid the detailed methods and governing equations have been given in section 3 1 the k ω model is applied to simulate a turbulent field which is considered a turbulent vortex and has high accuracy boon et al 2004 the usaf model is placed at the center of the seabed model and the mesh is locally encrypted with a nested grid the 3d mesh grid is shown in figs 16 and 17 and includes the usaf model with the steel tube the seabed model the baffle and the wave absorption set for wave action the input parameters are described in tables 1 3 and 4 in fact there are some inaccuracies induced by the difference of grain sizes for the reason that the density and median diameter of sand could be only implemented in this cfd code thus the effects of sands were neglected here all the boundary conditions are described in section 3 2 the entrance of the flow xmin prescribed velocity wave boundary the exit of the flow xmax outflow boundary the two sides of the flume ymin and ymax symmetry boundary the bottom of the flume zmin wall boundary the surface of the flume zmax symmetry boundary as shown in fig 15 in the simulation of the scour for the single flow the solid model includes the suction anchor foundation sand bed and baffle because the thicknesses of the suction anchor foundation and steel pipe are extremely small it must be meshed with a very small sized grid in order to reduce the total number of units and improve the computational efficiency the authors used a nested grid to partition the model and the minimum sizes of the grid are 0 35 1 1 and 0 02 1 40 respectively the extent of the local refinement around the suction anchor is 10 m 10 m 1 1 and 0 25 m 0 25 m 1 40 respectively and the minimum sizes of the grids are 0 17 1 1 and 0 067 1 40 respectively as shown in fig 16 the numbers of the cells in the grids are 3482624 1 1 and 878000 1 40 respectively which not only reduces the number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation a fixed inlet velocity and fixed flow elevation are used for the grid inlet and the specific parameters are shown in tables 1 3 and 4 in the simulation of the wave action the solid model includes the suction anchor foundation sand bed baffle and wave absorption a nested grid is also used for the local encryption to ensure high accuracy and reduce the computation time in order to ensure that there is no strong reflection at the exit of the wave it should be noted that the computational region is enlarged and a porous medium slope is added the grid is divided into three parts the wave production the structure and the wave absorption as shown in fig 17 in the three parts the minimum mesh sizes are 0 03 0 009 0 06 1 40 and 1 2 0 24 2 4 1 1 respectively and the numbers of the cells in the grids are 921552 1 40 and 4253472 1 1 respectively the wave boundary is used in the grid inlet and the specific parameters are shown in tables 1 3 and 4 3 3 2 validation of scour model in order to validate the present model the authors compared the numerical results with the results of experiments conducted by roulund et al 2005 roulund s scour test was conducted only for a monopile therefore the validation was limited to a monopile model the input parameters of our model originated from the experiment by roulund et al 2005 as seen in table 5 the comparison between the horizontal distribution of the current velocity calculated by the authors model and the data from the scour test is shown in fig 18 the data in the figure indicate that the numerical simulation result of the upstream horizontal velocity of the pile is smaller than the experimental data result while the simulation result for the downstream side is larger than the experimental data result the velocity distribution is basically the same the vertical velocity in the upstream side of the single pile shows good agreement between the numerical simulation and the experimental data but the differences between the downstream sides are apparent it is found that there are some differences between the numerical simulations and the experimental data the reason may be that the time of selection is inaccurate although the velocity distribution is basically the same the authors also compared the numerical simulation results with the test data for the scour development as shown in fig 19 overall the numerical solution is in agreement with the experimental data the scour depth gradually increases over time for both methods although the scour depth is lower for the model moreover the scour development curves over time for the measuring point data x 0 08 y 0 08 and the scour depth of line y4 are compared for the experimental and numerical data for the single flow wave and wave current action as shown in fig 20 the numerical simulation results show that the time required to reach the scouring balance is lower than for the scour test the equilibrium times for the single flow wave and wave current are 16 h 17 h and 15 h respectively in the scour tests the wave and current action have to be stopped during each measurement in contrast the numerical simulations applied hypothetical govern equations to simulate wave and current and there is a little deviation additionally the scour process is totally continuous so this is the probable reason why the numerical simulations seemly produce faster scour for the combined wave current condition the numerical simulation result of the scour depth is lower than the test data result the scour depth for the single flow is basically the same for the experimental and numerical results while the differences between the methods for the waves and wave current are 16 7 and 9 1 respectively it is evident that the trends for the scour depth are similar for the three conditions however between 4 h and 14 h the scour depth result for the single flow is larger than the experimental data result and the maximum difference is 25 9 in terms of the section scour depth fig 21 the experimental and numerical results are similar for the single flow and the scour characteristics are also similar for most of the positions nevertheless the distribution of the numerical simulation results are shifted towards the direction of flow and the distance is approximately 0 04 m for the waves and wave current actions the scour and deposition portions are in reverse such as x 0 1 m 0 2 m as a matter of the fact the scour depth was measured in intervals of 1 cm in the tests and the scour depth of the rest of points were obtained through interpolation and fitting however there were smaller cell size in the numerical simulations resulting that the scour depth of each meshing point are more accurate that is probably the reason why the reverse behavior existing even so the locations of the maximum scour depth are consistent for the two methods and both occur at the sides of the skirt the preceding figures velocities and scour processes obtained from this model are in agreement with the experiment results this supports that the model is reasonable and reliable therefore we may conclude that the present model captures the mean properties of the flow around the usaf and can be used for studying scour processes around the usaf 3 3 3 analysis of time step size and grid size a series of numerical simulations have been carried out in order to explore the effect of grid size and time step size on the numerical results and compared the difference among various conditions it should be noted that the flow 3d software used automatic time step to ensure the optimal stability and calculating time that is to say we could just input the initial time step and flow 3d automatically adjusts the time step size to be as large as possible without exceeding any of the stability limits affecting accuracy or unduly increasing the effort required to enforce the continuity condition additionally we can also see these characteristics in the numerical results as shown in fig 22 in order to satisfy the grid independence the author carried out three simulations with different cell sizes global grid 0 29 local grid 0 14 global grid 0 35 local grid 0 17 global grid 0 42 local grid 0 2 the distribution of horizontal velocity around steel pile near the sand bed and the scour depth of one reference line y 9 m near the foundation were compared as can be seen from fig 23 the velocities obtained from three different meshes have the similar properties that the velocity in front of the pile is almost zero and the largest velocity forms in both sides of the pipe however the discrepancy of the largest velocity can be observed among three meshes fig 24 illustrates that there is relatively stronger scour in the upstream of foundation compared with downstream the results from three meshes are almost consistent with each other excluding the downstream profile of coarse mesh altogether it is accuracy enough to capture the flow and simulate scour process additionally it is too time consuming if the smallest grid is selected thus the author chose the medium one in the following numerical simulations 3 3 4 the influence of flume blockage due to the limit of flume the author can only explore the blockage effect through numerical simulation two models have been established the one is the same width 0 5 m as real flume and the other is 0 8 m in width the scour characteristics were compared at the same time as shown in fig 25 the result shows that the scour shape are similar between the two conditions and the locations of the maximum scour and deposition are the same however the maximum scour depth in the narrow flume is larger than that in the wide flume in this paper the author neglected the effect of flume blockage due to the limit of experimental apparatus 3 4 results and discussion the main objective of this research is to demonstrate the scour processes around the usaf for a single current and analyze the differences between the usaf and saf due to the special anchor branches in this section the crucial input parameters for the numerical study are summarized in table 4 with additional parameters tabulated in tables 1 and 3 at first the difference in the equilibrium scour depth scour range and scour shape between the two foundations will be described then the effects of the current velocity on the scour development will be discussed in detail finally the influence of the water depth on the scour processes will be explored in the last part local scour around a monopile under the combined wave and current action or alone have been investigated widely as mentioned above because the foundation of an owt is very important to the stability of the entire structure it is very meaningful to explore the scour characteristics of new owt foundations such as the usaf 3 4 1 single current under the action of a single flow a backwater flow occurs in front of the pile flows around the circular pile and a downward flow velocity occurs the flow around both sides of the pile forms a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and a streamline compression in the back of the pile which is the main reason for the erosion of the sediment around the saf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a current velocity of 1 m s and a water depth of 15 m are shown in fig 26 it is apparent that the maximum scour depth of the saf exceeds that of the usaf and the maximum scour depths are 0 081d and 0 057d respectively with an increase of 42 5 a large area of scour forms along the saf and the maximum scour depth occurs near the skirts downstream of the foundation however in the usaf the scour occurs mainly at the downstream side of the anchor branches close to the skirt the scour pits are spoon shaped and are symmetrically distributed along the longitudinal direction of the flume 3 4 2 wave alone under the action of a wave alone a backwater flow occurs in front of the pile flows around the circular pile and a downward flow velocity occurs the flow around both sides of the pile forms a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and vortex shedding at the back of the pile which is the main reason for the erosion of the sediment around the usaf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a wave height of 4 m a period of 8 6 s and a water depth of 10 m are presented in fig 27 different from the single flow the maximum scour depth is less for the saf than the usaf with values of 0 057d and 0 079d respectively representing a decrease of 27 9 this behavior is not fully clear to the authors and needs further attention in the future a scour with a large extent forms along the saf and the maximum scour depth occurs near the skirts at the downstream side of the foundation however in the usaf the scour occurs mainly at the downstream side of the anchor branches close to the skirt compared with the single flow a scour pit also appears between the branches at the upstream side of the usaf the scour patterns form an inverted truncated cone and are symmetrically distributed along the longitudinal direction of the flume additionally there is some deposition at the downstream side of the usaf from the skirt top extending to around 15 m with a maximum deposition height of 0 039d a large amount of sediment deposition occurs at the upstream side of the saf with a maximum height of 0 33d the reason could indeed be the neglecting of the suspended effect and it should be checked in the next steps 3 4 3 combined wave and current under the combined wave and current action the flow around both sides of the pile results in a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and streamline compression and vortex shedding at the back of the pile these are the main reasons for the erosion of the sediment around the usaf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a wave height of 4 m a period of 8 6 s a water depth of 10 m and a flow velocity of 1 m s are shown in fig 28 compared with the single flow or wave alone a strong scour occurs around the foundation under the combined condition overall large scour pits occur around both foundations and even the skirt is exposed however the scale of the erosion is clearly greater for the saf than for the usaf small scour pits form between the anchor branches of the usaf nevertheless the maximum scour depth is not between the anchor branches but occurs outside the branches and has a depth of 0 24d the large scour pit around the saf contains three smaller scour holes and the location of the maximum scour depth is close to the skirt upstream of the anchor and has a scour depth of 0 4d which is 1 7 times the maximum scour depth of the usaf in addition there is a certain amount of sediment deposition around the scour pits of the usaf and saf and the deposition height of the saf is twice as high as that of the usaf 4 summary and conclusions in this study a series of scour tests of an usaf were carried out for a single flow waves alone and a combined wave and current action the flow field and wave field were captured by an adv current meter and a wave gauge respectively moreover the equilibrium depth scope and shape of the scour holes are obtained by an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the research and development of a 3d mathematical model of fluid sediment are of great significance for ocean engineering by using the vof model to investigate the influence of the free surface and the dynamic mesh technique to simulate the changes in the topography 3d numerical models of the sediment scour around the usaf and saf are established overall the numerical results agree with the experimental data and the difference in the scour characteristics between the usaf and saf can be explained based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the scour tests demonstrate that the scour characteristics of the usaf are definitely distinctive for the three conditions especially the scour profiles the maximum scour depth for the single flow the waves only and the wave current action are 0 17d 0 11d and 0 27d respectively it is noted that the equilibrium time is nearly the identical for the three conditions 2 the flow field around the monopile and the scour development over time obtained by the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data and the numerical results are also in good agreement with our scour tests this indicates that the model is reasonable and reliable for predicting the scour profiles around owt foundations 3 the usaf and saf exhibit significantly distinctive scour characteristics and the equilibrium scour depth under the combined wave current action is 1 7 times larger for the saf 0 4d than the usaf 0 24d therefore the usaf is better able to prevent scour 4 because the influences of the wave current parameters and sediment profiles on the scour characteristics are not considered in this study this topic will be explored in a future study in addition the effect of the local scour on the bearing capacity and dynamic response of the usaf should be investigated in the future author

21974,an umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf is a novel foundation for offshore wind turbines compared to the local scour occurring around deep foundations such as monopiles the scour around an usaf can significantly influence the stability of wind turbine systems therefore research on the local scour around an usaf induced by waves and currents is of great value to coastal engineering projects in this study a series of scour tests of an usaf were carried out and the authors evaluated the influences of a steady current waves and the combination of waves and currents the flow field and wave field were captured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter and wave gauge respectively moreover the equilibrium depth scope and shape of the scour holes are determined using an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the results demonstrate that the scour profiles are definitely distinctive for the three environmental conditions a standard k ω turbulent model is used to simulate the turbulent flow field the volume of fluid vof method is used in computational fluid dynamic cfd software to deal with the free water surface and moving mesh to explore the changes in the topography over time a dynamic three dimensional numerical model of the local scour around the usaf is developed and validated by comparing the results with previous scour tests and other published experimental data the scour characteristics of the usaf and the suction anchor foundation saf are determined by solving the fully three dimensional transient navier stokes equations in a fixed eulerian grid the results indicate that compared with a conventional saf the usaf can significantly prevent scour moreover the scour depth is significantly different for the two foundations under the combined wave current action and is approximately twice as large for the saf than the usaf keywords usaf offshore wind turbine scour tests numerical simulations wave current action 1 introduction offshore wind turbines owt have been widely developed in many countries despite the fact that the marine environment is extremely complex because tidal currents and waves probably create a horseshoe vortex and the vortex shedding which results in the fact that the contraction and acceleration of flow at the side edge of the foundations plays a significant role in the amplification of the bed shear stress and in turn the formation of scour wind turbines can be damaged wind turbine foundations have a significant impact on the structural stability many types of foundations exist for wind turbines including gravity foundation monopile foundation jacket foundation floating foundation and suction anchor foundation saf safs have been widely used for vessel mooring positioning buoys storage facilities lighthouses and offshore platforms therefore the installation and construction technology for foundations are quite mature moreover a new foundation type an umbrella suction anchor foundation usaf has been designed by the authors research group for wind farms in the yellow river delta in china which has been confirmed to be effective for broad application and high value due to its high bearing capacity low cost and promising future the detail information and engineering background can be found in the previous work liu et al 2014 li 2017 in fact the foundation mentioned in this study is composite of the suction anchor and monopile which should be one kind of suction caisson foundation as shown in fig 1 it is comprised of an internal compartment part 1 that includes a closed upper lid connected to the anchor ring and an open bottom an external skirt part 2 with an open lid linked to the anchor branches by supporting rods part 5 and a number of anchor branches part 4 with small holes hinged on the anchor ring part 3 the internal compartment consists of a telescopic hook part 6 on both sides of the external skirt that is attached to the skirt cylinder the anchor ring is welded together with the internal compartment through the four bearing rods that are attached to the anchor branches resulting in an umbrella shape of the whole longitudinal section of the usaf in the process of sinking the anchor accompanied by the implantation of the external skirt the anchor branches gradually expand driven by the supporting rods after the internal compartment is sunk completely the horizontally extended shape is located close to the seabed and the external skirt is fastened by the telescopic hook constituting an entire structure with an internal compartment that bears various static and dynamic loads the dimensions of the usaf and saf are listed in table 1 to date most researchers have mainly focused on the scour around monopiles induced by waves and currents such as scour mechanisms and time scale of scour development local scour around owt foundations has been studied by many researchers over the last decades petersen et al 2015 qi and gao 2014 ong et al 2013 whitehouse et al 2011 zanke et al 2011 and most studies have used scale model tests numerical simulations and field observations in general the local scour occurs in the clear water or in the live bed regimes raudkivi and ettema 1983 they can be determined by shields number θ and critical shields number θ cr of the bed material the clear water scour θ θ cr does not involve general sediment movements from upstream of the pile for live bed scour θ θ cr sand ripples usually occur when the median sediment diameter is smaller than 0 7 mm van rijn 1993 vortex shedding at the back of the pile is the critical factor of scour attributed to wave action while the horseshoe vortex occurring in front of the pile and streamline compression at the side of the pile are key factors for scour induced by steady flows as for the pile foundation the scour depth is a function of the orbit velocity near the bed u c u c u m and the kc number of the combined wave and current actions the scour depth is independent of the relative direction of the wave and flow sumer and fredsøe 1992 sumer and fredsøe 2001a 2001b conducted scour tests and determined that the horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and the vortex shedding at the lee side were the main reason for local scour around the pile foundation as illustrated in fig 2 in addition the kc number shields number the roughness of the pile and the reynolds number are the factors that affect the scour depth whitehouse et al 2006 conducted several scour tests and proposed that the equilibrium scour depth induced by a single flow is prominent compared with other conditions in the scour protection tests the authors stated that the optimum protective design consists of one layer of armor stone placed on one layer of filter around the monopile in terms of numerical analysis a lagrangian water sediment surface capturing method has been applied in the two and three dimensional scouring models with moving mesh approach which can reduce the computation time and also ensure the accuracy of scour simulation liu 2008 stahlmann et al 2010 carried out a set of physical scale model 1 40 and 1 12 tests for investigating the scour process induced by wave current and wave current actions around the tripod offshore foundation furthermore the three dimensional scour model stahlmann 2012b 2014 based on openfoam has been established and validated with experimental and theoretical data which indicates that the numerical model is capable of capturing the flow profile shear stress and scour profile importantly the scaling effect sediment sliding and suspended particle transport has been taken into account in the analysis the results show that local shear stress induced by the wave current action is 5 times as that of single load nielsen et al 2013 conducted numerical simulations and the results showed that the fluid velocity distribution shear stress distribution and scour protection layer settlement can be modeled by a vortex model rng in flow 3d it should be noted that the flow outside the scour protection is modeled correctly compared with the measured values in the physical model also the velocities inside the scour protection are comparable to the measured values although they are more uniform in the vertical direction based on the euler bernoulli beam element and the winkler hypothesis prendergast et al 2015 presented a finite element model of monopile soil to simulate scour by removing some spring beam elements the results demonstrated that the natural frequency of the structure was 6 5 lower in loose sand than in dense sand which indicated that a structure in loose sand was more likely to resonate moreover a new method was proposed for the design of scour based on the ultimate limit state and the fatigue limit state the scour processes in five european offshore wind farms were observed and the results showed that the field data and indoor model tests exhibited little discrepancy and that the maximum scour depth in scroby sands offshore wind farm east coast of uk occurred in shallow water the maximum scour depth was 1 38 d where d is the foundation diameter which was slightly larger than the dnv specification of 1 3 d but smaller than the value of 1 75 d derived using the opti pile design tool whitehouse et al 2008 boon et al 2004 further investigated several parameters using the opti pile design tool based on data from field observations of the beihai q7 horns rev and scorby sands wind farms and obtained relatively accurate results after applying the scour design tools to the horns rev and scorby sands wind farms however not much research has been conducted on scour around suction anchors in order to fill this research gap the authors investigate local scour around usaf under the actions of waves and currents and clarify the methods and processes of scour tests the scour tests their results and the related discussion follow in the next section for the numerical simulations the authors first introduce the theory of fluid sediment models and present the governing equations additionally the boundary conditions are also detailed in this section subsequently the validation of the proposed model is verified by comparisons with the scour tests and previously published experimental results finally the differences between the scour characteristics of an usaf and a saf for a single current waves and the combined wave current action are clarified in the results and discussion section the scour development is analyzed in a real marine environment and the resulting maximum scour depth scour range and shape of the usaf and saf are defined the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the scour development in an usaf and references for preventing erosion in ocean engineering 2 scour tests 2 1 methods the scour tests were carried out in the wave flume of the lab of coastal engineering environment ocean university of china the flume is 0 5 m in width 0 7 m in height and 14 m in length it is equipped with a piston type wave generator a slope is made up with fibrous mass and gravels in the end of the flume which can greatly reduce the effect of wave reflection and a simple circulatory current system designed by ourselves figs 3 and 4 the current systems are composed of two prefabricated rectangular guiding channels 0 2 m in length 0 48 m in width and 0 15 m in height in the upstream and downstream of the pile with distance 3 m which are connected by a pipe and a two phase water pump thus the circulation of the current in the flume is achieved a wave absorption was positioned in the wave flume on the opposite side of the wave generator to reduce any reflections that might occur during the tests each run started with the leveling of the sand bed after which water was slowly added until the required water depth was reached for a run to determine the effects of only waves the waves were generated directly for a combined wave current run a steady current was generated first using the circular flow system and then waves were added simultaneously the acquisition of topography and velocity data began and was maintained throughout the entire test when the run was finished the wave and current generators were stopped and the water was slowly drained until the scour hole could be observed clearly we recorded the topographical measurements of the scour hole using a total station and acquired photographs of the scour hole a steel usaf and a pile with a diameter of 0 1 m were mounted in the middle of the flume along its longitudinal axis to function as an anchor foundation a sand layer of 0 6 m in thickness was laid down to support the anchor and to function as the eroding material it is worth noticing that the top of the suction anchor was almost flush with the sand surface then the wooden block was used to level the sand and the water was added to the predetermined depth in order to reach the state of full consolidation the sufficient period of time 24 h was needed before carrying out the tests the median diameter of the sand grains was 0 257 mm the particle sizes were between 0 005 and 1 mm and the specific density of the sand is 1 903 the water depth was maintained at 0 375 m for single current and 0 4 m for wave action throughout all experimental runs the changes over time in the scour depth were simultaneously monitored by an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter with the controlling and analysis software ttmsexe created by sinfotek 2015 as shown in fig 5 during the scour test the measuring velocity 3 cm s probe moving velocity 3 cm s and the interval of each measurement 1000 ms were set for obtaining accurate scour depth during the scouring test 5 surveying lines were conducted at intervals of 2 h and the distance between the measuring points on the lines was 1 cm as shown in fig 6 a after the completion of the scour processes the last two measured topographies were basically similar during each test run the topography of the scour hole was measured using a total station after draining some of the water in the flume the pictures of scour pattern have been captured by camera dewatering definitely affects the scour pattern in some extent but it can be neglected in these tests depending on the extent of the actual scour the entire measuring area is selected and the whole grid is 0 01 m 0 01 m as shown in fig 6b an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv current meter fig 3 was installed 5 m away from the cylinder and 0 05 m above the sand bed on the upstream side along the longitudinal axis of the flume to monitor the bottom velocity of the incoming current the wave parameters were recorded by a wave gauge fig 3 installed on the side wall of the flume in total three test runs were performed including one run with waves alone one run with the combined wave current flow and one run with a single current for the analysis of the effects of the combined wave and current on the scour in all of the combined wave current runs the waves and the current were co directional the depth averaged flow velocity was 0 189 m s only regular linear airy waves were considered in the tests the wave height was about 0 1 m and the wave period was 1 5 s the test conditions are summarized in table 2 and table 3 due to the limitation of flume all the scour test cases belonged to the clear water scour regime however the live bed scour regime was discussed in the section of numerical simulations the shields parameters θ for combined wave current conditions is calculated with θ τ max s 1 ρgd 50 soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 here τ max is the maximum bed shear stress under a combined wave current flow which is calculated using τ

stress during a wave cycle under combined wave current conditions soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 estimated by 1 τ m τ c 1 1 2 τ w τ c τ w 3 2 where τ w and τ c are the maximum bottom shear stresses induced by waves and current respectively τ w and τ c are calculated as τ w 0 5ρf w u w 2 and τ c ρc d u c 2 here u c is the depth averaged current velocity u w is the maximum bottom wave orbit velocity c d is the drag coefficient of flow soulsby 1998 soulsby and clarke 2005 and estimated by 2 c d κ 1 ln z 0 d where z 0 is the bed roughness length z 0 d 50 12 κ is the von karman constant κ 0 4 d is the water depth f w is the wave friction factor the critical shields parameter for incipient sand motion is calculated using soulsby formula 1998 and is expressed as 3 θ cr 0 3 1 1

topographic survey of the five lines was conducted during the scour tests with an interval of 2 h for clarity of representation only the experimental data of one line y4 0 11 m with an interval of 4 h is provided here as illustrated in fig 7 it is noted that scour depths s are non dimensional by the diameter of the steel tube d and that the negative value represents scour depth and the positive value stands for deposition height in addition scour depth of these lines may not be the maximum scour depth of the test 2 2 1 single current 2 2 1 1 scour shape and range in the range of 2 10 h the scour near the usaf is not particularly obvious but there is a certain deposition at the downstream end in the range of 10 18 h the scour depth changes markedly specifically the maximum scour depth increases from 0 013d to 0 068d furthermore the deposition at the upstream side of the usaf gradually decreases and scour occurs with depth changes from 0 003d to 0 054d in addition the location at the downstream side near the tube also exhibits more erosion the maximum scour variation in the upstream location is in the range of 14 18 h and the scour depth increases from 0 015d to 0 053d while the maximum scour at the lee surface is in the range of 10 14 h with a total increase of 0 047d additionally the deposition that previously occurred downstream away from the skirt exhibits a decreasing trend the section characteristics of the scour at the final time 18 h are given in fig 8 a overall overwhelming scour is located near the edge of the flume and the closer to the usaf the weaker the scour is the lines y2 and y3 have the largest range of variation and the maximum scour depth of the section increases from 0 018d to 0 086d the shape and range of the scour hole around the usaf under a single flow are shown in fig 9 generally local scour forms around the usaf along both sides of the flume and is symmetrically distributed the extent of the erosion and deposition is approximately 0 3 m 0 25 m it can be seen that the usaf erosion areas are mainly concentrated at the downstream side of the anchor branch and in close proximity to the skirt with a maximum scour depth of 0 17d on the upstream side of the usaf anchor branches and the downstream side of the usaf deposition occurred the maximum deposition height is 0 04d the causes of the scouring patterns may be the existence of the anchor branches as a result the vortex formation at the upstream side of the steel pipe is not enough to affect the sediment near the skirt therefore the sediment in front of the anchor branches begins to move and is further transferred by the current a small amount of sediments remains on the upstream side of the usaf but most of it is transported to the downstream side where the maximum height of deposition occurs because of the streamline compression caused by the flow the sediment is accumulated on the downstream side of the usaf and then migrates and ultimately the maximum scour pit is formed here after the test is finished the elevation of the reference points are measured in the 1 cm 1 cm grid by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter and the data are imported into mathematica software where the contour map fig 12a is obtained it is evident that there is a general consistency although there are some differences between the contour map fig 12a and the observation results fig 9 the reason is that the measurement area does not include all the measurement points and the remaining points are interpolated to obtain the elevation 2 2 1 2 equilibrium time for the single flow the elevation at the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h it should be noted that the reach of the maximum scour depth at the reference point was regarded as the criterion in three scour tests which indicates the equilibrium stage has been achieved however fig 7 was plotted only until 18 h for the reason that the scour depth of the measuring line is oscillated without significant change therefore it can be thought that the equilibrium state has been reached the curve of the scour depth over time is plotted as shown in fig 13a in general the scour development curve is divided into three stages a rapid erosion stage b slow erosion stage c erosion equilibrium stage within 0 6 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 067d between 6 h and 12 h the erosion rate decreases slightly at 12 h the erosion rate gradually decreases and the scour depth increases from 0 138d to 0 143d after 18 h the scour depth is basically unchanged and the maximum scour depth is reached based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the underlying causes of these three stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the flow encounters the steel structures in the upper area of the suction anchor the current flows around the cylinder which causes a horseshoe vortex to form in front of the steel tube and streamline compression at the sides of the tube the sediment starts to move and smaller scour pits occur after that turbulence appears induced by the scour hole and a large amount of the sediment is removed from the scour hole therefore the scour pit becomes rapidly enlarged in the slow erosion stage the effect of the flow on the existing sediment weakens and the erosion rate is reduced in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is 18 h 2 2 2 wave alone 2 2 2 1 scour shape and range the scour characteristics of y4 0 11 m fig 7b illustrate that the scour depth at the upstream side of the usaf exhibits almost no change over time while the downstream scour depth increases over time and the scour range extends outward eventually the maximum scour depth 0 149d occurs at the downstream side of the usaf in addition there is a scour pit at each side of the steel pipe maximum scour depth of 0 025d and there is some deposition on both sides of the pit maximum deposition height of 0 063d the characteristics of the scour at the final moment 20 h are shown in fig 8b overall significant scour occurs near the edge of the flume and the closer to the usaf the weaker the scour is the lines y2 and y3 have the largest range of variation and the scour depth of the section increases from 0 015d to 0 077d the shape and range of the scour pits of the usaf under the action of the waves are shown in fig 10 in general the scour is stronger in the downstream than the upstream side of the usaf and some deposition occurs at the upstream side of the anchor the maximum deposition height is 0 08d and the extent of the scour and deposition is approximately 0 25 m 0 25 m sand ripples are apparent in the entire soil box it is evident that the usaf erosion areas are mainly concentrated at the downstream side of the usaf the position of the maximum scour depth is located between two anchor branches and has a scour depth of 0 11d this result is in agreement with the results of the single flow experiment but the waves induce a greater scour range the causes of the scour patterns may be the existence of the anchor branches that prevent the effects of the horseshoe vortex on the sediment near the skirt resulting in the movement of the upstream sediment away from the usaf because the carrying capacity is certainly weaker for the waves than the current most of the sediment occurs on the upstream side of the usaf and is partly transferred to the downstream side owing to the vortex shedding the sediment in the downstream side of the anchor branch begins to migrate and ultimately the maximum scour pit forms here as in the single flow test the elevation of the reference points are captured by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the data are imported into the mathematica software and the contour map fig 12b is obtained 2 2 2 2 equilibrium time under the wave action the elevation of the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h the curve of the scour depth over time is shown in fig 13b the scour development curve is also divided into three stages a rapid erosion stage b slow erosion stage c erosion equilibrium stage within 0 6 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 052d between 6 h and 14 h the scour rate decreases slightly at 14 h the erosion rate gradually increases but is slightly weaker than in the previous phase the scour depth increases from 0 069d to 0 078d after 20 h the scour depth is basically unchanged and the maximum scour depth is reached based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the causes of these three stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the wave encounters the steel structures in the upper area of the suction anchor the waves flow around the cylinder which causes horseshoe vortices to form in front of the steel tube the sediment begins to move and small scour pits occur after that turbulence appears induced by the scour hole and a large amount of the sediment is removed from the scour hole therefore the scour pit becomes rapidly enlarged in the slow erosion stage the effect of the wave on the existing sediment weakens and the erosion rate decreases in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is around 20 h 2 2 3 combined wave and current 2 2 3 1 scour shape and range compared with the scour characteristics for the single flow the scour holes induced by the wave and current occur on both sides of the skirt during the test and the scour depth increases continuously over time as shown in fig 7 between 2 h and 14 h the development trend of the scour pit is nearly identical for the upstream and downstream side of the skirt the maximum scour depth increases from 0 007d to 0 169d upstream and from 0 031d to 0 127d downstream fig 7c scour pits also appear at the upstream and downstream sides of the steel tube and the trends are similar to the trends for the scour holes near the skirt the maximum scour depths are 0 116d upstream and 0 085d downstream of the steel tube fig 7c the scour characteristics at the final moment 18 h are shown in fig 7c there are significant differences in the scour characteristics for each line to be more specific the scour depth is smaller near the edge of the flume but there is a large area of erosion in front of the usaf lines y2 y3 and y4 and the scour depth is nearly similar 0 155d 0 157d and 0 149d respectively due to the fact that the scour around foundation under single current and wave current action are mainly dominated by the streamline compression and vortex respectively the scour is formed in the two sides of the usaf the y4 and y5 line profiles show that the scour pits at the upstream side of the usaf near the skirt have depths of 0 19d and 0 212d respectively the depths of the y3 and y4 lines at the downstream side near the skirt are 0 063d and 0 129d respectively the shape and extent of the scour pits of the usaf under the combined wave and current action are shown in fig 11 local scour forms around the usaf and is distributed symmetrically the erosion deposition extent is approximately 0 3 m 0 25 m it can be seen that the sand has been hollowed out under the anchor branches at the upstream side of the usaf scour pits with a maximum depth of 0 27d appear at the center of the two anchor branches and a scour pit also forms between the two anchor branches at the downstream side of the usaf sediment deposition occurs mainly at the downstream side of the usaf near the edge of the flume and the deposition height is 0 05d in addition the top surface of the skirt is completely covered by sediment the causes of the scour patterns may be related to the combined action of the waves and current leading to the formation of more intense turbulence therefore a large amount of the sediment in front of the usaf begins to move and the current carries it further there is little sediment at the upstream side of the usaf and most of it is transported to the downstream side of the usaf resulting in the formation of the largest height of deposition because of the streamline compression and vortex shedding caused by the flow the sediment on the downstream side of the usaf begins to move and is transported finally the scour pit forms at this location after the test is finished the elevation of the reference points are measured by the ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the data are imported into the mathematica software and the contour map fig 12c is obtained 2 2 3 2 equilibrium time under the wave current action the elevation of the reference point x 0 08 m y 0 08 m is measured during the scour test and the scour depth is recorded every 2 h the curve of the scour depth over time is shown in fig 13c the scour curve is divided into two stages 1 rapid erosion stage 2 erosion equilibrium stage within 0 14 h the scour depth increases rapidly from 0 to 0 11d at 16 h the scour depth increases slightly and reaches the maximum scour depth at 18 h based on the basic theory of local scour around monopile foundation the causes of these two stages are as follows in the rapid erosion stage when the wave and current encounter the tube structure in the upper part of the suction anchor horseshoe vortices vortex shedding and streamline compression occur caused by the flow around the cylinder resulting in the movement of a large amount of sediment and the occurrence of small scour pits this influences the wave current field the turbulence energy is stronger than the energy produced by either the wave or the current alone a large amount of sediment is removed from the scour hole leading to a rapid increase in the size of the scour pit in the equilibrium stage the scour depth of the reference point no longer increases over time and this stage is an important basis for judging the scour stability based on the scour depth development over time the final equilibrium time for the scour of the usaf is 18 h it is observed that under the combined wave and current action there is no slow growth stage of erosion the reason may be that the turbulent kinetic energy caused by the wave and current is larger than for the wave or current alone 3 numerical simulations 3 1 theoretical model all the models in this study are formulated based on volume and area porosity functions this formulation called favortm for fractional area or volume obstacle representation method is applied to simulate complicated geometric regions flow3d 2013 the details of the model have been described by hirt 1985 1993 3 1 1 momentum equations the equations of the motion for the fluid velocity u v w in the three coordinate

3 turbulent model in this study the standard k ω turbulent model was used to simulate the turbulent state for the reason that it is better enough than the k ε models in terms of the separation flow adverse pressure gradient after the pile additionally k ω sst turbulent model is still complex and difficult to get converged results although it is much more suitable to simulate the strong curvature streamline flow state the standard k ω model is based on the wilcox k ω model and is an improved model in that it considers low reynolds numbers compressibility and shear flow propagation the model predicts the propagation velocity of free shear flow such as lee wake mixing flow plate flow cylinder flow and radial jet therefore the model can be applied to the wall bounded flow and free shear

advection and deposition of the sediments it should be noted that the bed load effect was dominated in this model while the suspended effect was not taken into account due to its influence in the waves condition the suspended load will be considered in the future for bed load transport the model currently used was developed by meyer peter and müller 1948 this model predicts the volumetric flow

the velocity boundary condition is the prescribed velocity with various velocities over time and surface of fluid at the boundary has been provided with elevation and the distribution of the velocity is uniform across the entire section at the inlet zero transverse v and vertical w velocities were specified the inlet characteristics of u k and ω are based on the equilibrium profiles obtained from the uniform channel flow computations with similar flow conditions 3 2 2 wave boundary a periodic linear surface wave can be generated at a mesh boundary the model is based on airy s linear wave theory as shown in fig 14 the linear wave is assumed to originate from a flat bottom reservoir and flows into the computational domain a linear wave is characterized by the wave amplitude a wave length λ angular frequency ω and wave number k 2π λ a uniform current may also exist and its undisturbed velocity component in the wave propagation direction is u c constant for the equations in this section a reference system x z is established with its origin fixed at the mean free surface x points towards the wave propagation direction and z towards the upward direction when using the code users can place the coordinate origin at any location but z must be in the upward direction 3 2 3 outflow condition the outflow boundary condition can be used for both compressible and incompressible fluid flows that are confined or have free surfaces at the outlet n 0 the neumann conditions were applied for all quantities 3 2 3 1 symmetry condition this represents the fundamental boundary condition which indicates that the fluid has no shear and no flux at the boundary this boundary can be well applied to simulate the symmetric flow and greatly reduces the number of calculations at the symmetry boundaries the neumann conditions were used for k ω u v and w 3 2 4 walls u v w 0 k 0 when the wall was smooth while the neumann condition was applied when the wall was rough and transitional regarding the latter condition experiments have shown that the neumann condition is satisfied k n 0 at the wall for rough boundaries where n is the direction normal to the wall tominaga et al 2001 sumer et al 2001 2003 3 3 application of model and validation 3 3 1 application of model the numerical simulations of the sediment scour around the usaf are conducted using flow 3d v11 0 3 2013 flow 3d is a computational fluid dynamic cfd code solving the fully three dimensional 3d transient navier stokes equations using a finite volume finite difference method in a fixed eulerian grid the detailed methods and governing equations have been given in section 3 1 the k ω model is applied to simulate a turbulent field which is considered a turbulent vortex and has high accuracy boon et al 2004 the usaf model is placed at the center of the seabed model and the mesh is locally encrypted with a nested grid the 3d mesh grid is shown in figs 16 and 17 and includes the usaf model with the steel tube the seabed model the baffle and the wave absorption set for wave action the input parameters are described in tables 1 3 and 4 in fact there are some inaccuracies induced by the difference of grain sizes for the reason that the density and median diameter of sand could be only implemented in this cfd code thus the effects of sands were neglected here all the boundary conditions are described in section 3 2 the entrance of the flow xmin prescribed velocity wave boundary the exit of the flow xmax outflow boundary the two sides of the flume ymin and ymax symmetry boundary the bottom of the flume zmin wall boundary the surface of the flume zmax symmetry boundary as shown in fig 15 in the simulation of the scour for the single flow the solid model includes the suction anchor foundation sand bed and baffle because the thicknesses of the suction anchor foundation and steel pipe are extremely small it must be meshed with a very small sized grid in order to reduce the total number of units and improve the computational efficiency the authors used a nested grid to partition the model and the minimum sizes of the grid are 0 35 1 1 and 0 02 1 40 respectively the extent of the local refinement around the suction anchor is 10 m 10 m 1 1 and 0 25 m 0 25 m 1 40 respectively and the minimum sizes of the grids are 0 17 1 1 and 0 067 1 40 respectively as shown in fig 16 the numbers of the cells in the grids are 3482624 1 1 and 878000 1 40 respectively which not only reduces the number of units but also ensures the accuracy of the calculation a fixed inlet velocity and fixed flow elevation are used for the grid inlet and the specific parameters are shown in tables 1 3 and 4 in the simulation of the wave action the solid model includes the suction anchor foundation sand bed baffle and wave absorption a nested grid is also used for the local encryption to ensure high accuracy and reduce the computation time in order to ensure that there is no strong reflection at the exit of the wave it should be noted that the computational region is enlarged and a porous medium slope is added the grid is divided into three parts the wave production the structure and the wave absorption as shown in fig 17 in the three parts the minimum mesh sizes are 0 03 0 009 0 06 1 40 and 1 2 0 24 2 4 1 1 respectively and the numbers of the cells in the grids are 921552 1 40 and 4253472 1 1 respectively the wave boundary is used in the grid inlet and the specific parameters are shown in tables 1 3 and 4 3 3 2 validation of scour model in order to validate the present model the authors compared the numerical results with the results of experiments conducted by roulund et al 2005 roulund s scour test was conducted only for a monopile therefore the validation was limited to a monopile model the input parameters of our model originated from the experiment by roulund et al 2005 as seen in table 5 the comparison between the horizontal distribution of the current velocity calculated by the authors model and the data from the scour test is shown in fig 18 the data in the figure indicate that the numerical simulation result of the upstream horizontal velocity of the pile is smaller than the experimental data result while the simulation result for the downstream side is larger than the experimental data result the velocity distribution is basically the same the vertical velocity in the upstream side of the single pile shows good agreement between the numerical simulation and the experimental data but the differences between the downstream sides are apparent it is found that there are some differences between the numerical simulations and the experimental data the reason may be that the time of selection is inaccurate although the velocity distribution is basically the same the authors also compared the numerical simulation results with the test data for the scour development as shown in fig 19 overall the numerical solution is in agreement with the experimental data the scour depth gradually increases over time for both methods although the scour depth is lower for the model moreover the scour development curves over time for the measuring point data x 0 08 y 0 08 and the scour depth of line y4 are compared for the experimental and numerical data for the single flow wave and wave current action as shown in fig 20 the numerical simulation results show that the time required to reach the scouring balance is lower than for the scour test the equilibrium times for the single flow wave and wave current are 16 h 17 h and 15 h respectively in the scour tests the wave and current action have to be stopped during each measurement in contrast the numerical simulations applied hypothetical govern equations to simulate wave and current and there is a little deviation additionally the scour process is totally continuous so this is the probable reason why the numerical simulations seemly produce faster scour for the combined wave current condition the numerical simulation result of the scour depth is lower than the test data result the scour depth for the single flow is basically the same for the experimental and numerical results while the differences between the methods for the waves and wave current are 16 7 and 9 1 respectively it is evident that the trends for the scour depth are similar for the three conditions however between 4 h and 14 h the scour depth result for the single flow is larger than the experimental data result and the maximum difference is 25 9 in terms of the section scour depth fig 21 the experimental and numerical results are similar for the single flow and the scour characteristics are also similar for most of the positions nevertheless the distribution of the numerical simulation results are shifted towards the direction of flow and the distance is approximately 0 04 m for the waves and wave current actions the scour and deposition portions are in reverse such as x 0 1 m 0 2 m as a matter of the fact the scour depth was measured in intervals of 1 cm in the tests and the scour depth of the rest of points were obtained through interpolation and fitting however there were smaller cell size in the numerical simulations resulting that the scour depth of each meshing point are more accurate that is probably the reason why the reverse behavior existing even so the locations of the maximum scour depth are consistent for the two methods and both occur at the sides of the skirt the preceding figures velocities and scour processes obtained from this model are in agreement with the experiment results this supports that the model is reasonable and reliable therefore we may conclude that the present model captures the mean properties of the flow around the usaf and can be used for studying scour processes around the usaf 3 3 3 analysis of time step size and grid size a series of numerical simulations have been carried out in order to explore the effect of grid size and time step size on the numerical results and compared the difference among various conditions it should be noted that the flow 3d software used automatic time step to ensure the optimal stability and calculating time that is to say we could just input the initial time step and flow 3d automatically adjusts the time step size to be as large as possible without exceeding any of the stability limits affecting accuracy or unduly increasing the effort required to enforce the continuity condition additionally we can also see these characteristics in the numerical results as shown in fig 22 in order to satisfy the grid independence the author carried out three simulations with different cell sizes global grid 0 29 local grid 0 14 global grid 0 35 local grid 0 17 global grid 0 42 local grid 0 2 the distribution of horizontal velocity around steel pile near the sand bed and the scour depth of one reference line y 9 m near the foundation were compared as can be seen from fig 23 the velocities obtained from three different meshes have the similar properties that the velocity in front of the pile is almost zero and the largest velocity forms in both sides of the pipe however the discrepancy of the largest velocity can be observed among three meshes fig 24 illustrates that there is relatively stronger scour in the upstream of foundation compared with downstream the results from three meshes are almost consistent with each other excluding the downstream profile of coarse mesh altogether it is accuracy enough to capture the flow and simulate scour process additionally it is too time consuming if the smallest grid is selected thus the author chose the medium one in the following numerical simulations 3 3 4 the influence of flume blockage due to the limit of flume the author can only explore the blockage effect through numerical simulation two models have been established the one is the same width 0 5 m as real flume and the other is 0 8 m in width the scour characteristics were compared at the same time as shown in fig 25 the result shows that the scour shape are similar between the two conditions and the locations of the maximum scour and deposition are the same however the maximum scour depth in the narrow flume is larger than that in the wide flume in this paper the author neglected the effect of flume blockage due to the limit of experimental apparatus 3 4 results and discussion the main objective of this research is to demonstrate the scour processes around the usaf for a single current and analyze the differences between the usaf and saf due to the special anchor branches in this section the crucial input parameters for the numerical study are summarized in table 4 with additional parameters tabulated in tables 1 and 3 at first the difference in the equilibrium scour depth scour range and scour shape between the two foundations will be described then the effects of the current velocity on the scour development will be discussed in detail finally the influence of the water depth on the scour processes will be explored in the last part local scour around a monopile under the combined wave and current action or alone have been investigated widely as mentioned above because the foundation of an owt is very important to the stability of the entire structure it is very meaningful to explore the scour characteristics of new owt foundations such as the usaf 3 4 1 single current under the action of a single flow a backwater flow occurs in front of the pile flows around the circular pile and a downward flow velocity occurs the flow around both sides of the pile forms a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and a streamline compression in the back of the pile which is the main reason for the erosion of the sediment around the saf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a current velocity of 1 m s and a water depth of 15 m are shown in fig 26 it is apparent that the maximum scour depth of the saf exceeds that of the usaf and the maximum scour depths are 0 081d and 0 057d respectively with an increase of 42 5 a large area of scour forms along the saf and the maximum scour depth occurs near the skirts downstream of the foundation however in the usaf the scour occurs mainly at the downstream side of the anchor branches close to the skirt the scour pits are spoon shaped and are symmetrically distributed along the longitudinal direction of the flume 3 4 2 wave alone under the action of a wave alone a backwater flow occurs in front of the pile flows around the circular pile and a downward flow velocity occurs the flow around both sides of the pile forms a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and vortex shedding at the back of the pile which is the main reason for the erosion of the sediment around the usaf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a wave height of 4 m a period of 8 6 s and a water depth of 10 m are presented in fig 27 different from the single flow the maximum scour depth is less for the saf than the usaf with values of 0 057d and 0 079d respectively representing a decrease of 27 9 this behavior is not fully clear to the authors and needs further attention in the future a scour with a large extent forms along the saf and the maximum scour depth occurs near the skirts at the downstream side of the foundation however in the usaf the scour occurs mainly at the downstream side of the anchor branches close to the skirt compared with the single flow a scour pit also appears between the branches at the upstream side of the usaf the scour patterns form an inverted truncated cone and are symmetrically distributed along the longitudinal direction of the flume additionally there is some deposition at the downstream side of the usaf from the skirt top extending to around 15 m with a maximum deposition height of 0 039d a large amount of sediment deposition occurs at the upstream side of the saf with a maximum height of 0 33d the reason could indeed be the neglecting of the suspended effect and it should be checked in the next steps 3 4 3 combined wave and current under the combined wave and current action the flow around both sides of the pile results in a horseshoe vortex at the upstream side of the pile and streamline compression and vortex shedding at the back of the pile these are the main reasons for the erosion of the sediment around the usaf the final scour characteristics of the usaf and saf at a wave height of 4 m a period of 8 6 s a water depth of 10 m and a flow velocity of 1 m s are shown in fig 28 compared with the single flow or wave alone a strong scour occurs around the foundation under the combined condition overall large scour pits occur around both foundations and even the skirt is exposed however the scale of the erosion is clearly greater for the saf than for the usaf small scour pits form between the anchor branches of the usaf nevertheless the maximum scour depth is not between the anchor branches but occurs outside the branches and has a depth of 0 24d the large scour pit around the saf contains three smaller scour holes and the location of the maximum scour depth is close to the skirt upstream of the anchor and has a scour depth of 0 4d which is 1 7 times the maximum scour depth of the usaf in addition there is a certain amount of sediment deposition around the scour pits of the usaf and saf and the deposition height of the saf is twice as high as that of the usaf 4 summary and conclusions in this study a series of scour tests of an usaf were carried out for a single flow waves alone and a combined wave and current action the flow field and wave field were captured by an adv current meter and a wave gauge respectively moreover the equilibrium depth scope and shape of the scour holes are obtained by an ultrasonic topographic surveying meter the research and development of a 3d mathematical model of fluid sediment are of great significance for ocean engineering by using the vof model to investigate the influence of the free surface and the dynamic mesh technique to simulate the changes in the topography 3d numerical models of the sediment scour around the usaf and saf are established overall the numerical results agree with the experimental data and the difference in the scour characteristics between the usaf and saf can be explained based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the scour tests demonstrate that the scour characteristics of the usaf are definitely distinctive for the three conditions especially the scour profiles the maximum scour depth for the single flow the waves only and the wave current action are 0 17d 0 11d and 0 27d respectively it is noted that the equilibrium time is nearly the identical for the three conditions 2 the flow field around the monopile and the scour development over time obtained by the proposed model are consistent with the experimental data and the numerical results are also in good agreement with our scour tests this indicates that the model is reasonable and reliable for predicting the scour profiles around owt foundations 3 the usaf and saf exhibit significantly distinctive scour characteristics and the equilibrium scour depth under the combined wave current action is 1 7 times larger for the saf 0 4d than the usaf 0 24d therefore the usaf is better able to prevent scour 4 because the influences of the wave current parameters and sediment profiles on the scour characteristics are not considered in this study this topic will be explored in a future study in addition the effect of the local scour on the bearing capacity and dynamic response of the usaf should be investigated in the future author
