4055,a multi dimensional mass conservative numerical method particularly suitable for limited computational resources is developed for solving transient variably saturated groundwater flow problems the richards equation is discretized spatially with a finite element method and temporally with an implicit euler scheme in which mass conservative and mass lumping techniques are used to keep the numerical simulation stable in addition the stiffness and mass matrices involved are approximated in a way to guarantee less computational effort to confirm the accuracy and the efficiency of this code we verified it using benchmark tests using one two and three dimensional problems the present model is also applied to a real field case problem where its superiority is clearly demonstrated the code achieved reliable results for each problem keywords groundwater flow finite element modeling richards equation variably saturated flow 1 introduction flow in a variably saturated porous medium is governed by the richards equation a highly nonlinear pde few analytical solutions using simplifying conditions or restrictive hypotheses were presented polubarinova kochina 1962 teloglou et al 2008 moutsopoulos 2013 tracy 1995 2006 2007 hayek 2015 nevertheless the most attempts to solve saturated unsaturated flow problems are based on numerical techniques several models using the numerical approach of celia et al 1990 were developed clement et al 1994 van dam and feddes 2000 kuznetsov et al 2012 herrada et al 2014 belfort et al 2013 presented a review of several estimations of the equivalent conductivity and analyzed the efficiency of the different averaging fashions when solving unsaturated flow fahs et al 2009 used the method of lines combined with the mixed finite element discretization to solve variably saturated flow in porous media younes et al 2013 studied the monotonicity of a finite volume based method for solving flow in variably saturated and heterogeneous porous media hassane maina and ackerer 2017 discussed newton raphson method and time stepping strategies for solving the mixed form of richards equation koohbor et al 2021 solved richards equation in the context of fractured porous media zha et al 2017 presented a modified picard iteration scheme for overcoming drawbacks arising when simulating infiltration into dry soils farthing and ogden 2017 and zha et al 2019 presented a state of the art review of the numerical solution of the richards equation numerous aspects were discussed and challenges underlined related to equivalent hydraulic conductivity computational efficiency or choice of primary variable among others other models were also developed thoms et al 2006 šimůnek et al 2006 in view to solve 3d flow in variably saturated porous media these numerical models proceed by solving the resulting equations system subsequent to various approximation methods however these codes may be costing in cpu time when much finer temporal and spatial discretizations are necessary or in case of applications at the watershed scale e g for climate change purposes when huge equations systems are to be solved drawbacks to the numerical resolution attempt of the richards equation may be exacerbated when computational resources are limited alternatives are proposed to avoid high cpu time costs of fully 3d numerical models yakirevich et al 1998 paulus et al 2013 kuznetsov et al 2012 xu et al 2012 these techniques act by lowering dimensions of the fully 3d richards equation in both unsaturated and saturated domains or only in the unsaturated one when the saturated flow is modeled in its whole dimensionality as a consequence the number of unknowns to be solved decrease significantly and the cpu time as well however doing so may constitute a source of inaccuracies that can affect the hydraulic heads as well as the fluxes in the separated domains indeed as it is pointed out by twarakavi et al 2008 only solving the fully 3d richards equation for the whole continuous flow domain is able to provide accurate solutions for hydraulic heads and subsequent fluxes in both unsaturated and saturated compartments however the most obstacle that limits the applicability of such models for regional scales is their computational demand and time cost in this paper a multi dimensional numerical model based on the mixed form of richards equation particularly suitable for limited computational resources is developed to solve flow equation in both unsaturated and saturated zones under unsteady and steady regimes the numerical model is galerkin fe based and uses the celia et al s 1990 first order time integration method to solve the derived algebraic equations system the use the richrads equation may be inappropriate with coarse grids because of violation of the assumption of representative elementary volume which can result in loss of accuracy zha et al 2019 the use of the fine grids however may complicate the resolution or simply make it infeasible due to high computational coast in order to circumvent these difficulties the proposed numerical numerical scheme approximates the matrices involved in a newly fashion to guarantee less computational effort when solving the involved pde the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the flow model used to solve variably saturated porous media and reports the most used retention curves equations section 3 is dedicated to the numerical procedure adopted and the proposed approximation of the matrices obtained in section 4 benchmark tests against analytical solutions show the present model capabilities to provide high level of accuracy in addition other tests available in the literature are also examined and the efficiency of the present model is demonstrated finally section 5 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 mathematical statement the richards equation can be expressed on three usual forms the head based form the moisture based form and under a mix form using the moisture and the head for the temporal and the spatial terms respectively discussion about these forms can be found in fahs et al 2009 farthing and ogden 2017 and zha et al 2019 the mixed form of richards equation modeling water flow in a variably saturated porous medium is obtained by combining darcy s law and continuity equation and is expressed as 1 k s k r h h q θ t where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor k r h is the relative conductivity q is the source sink per volume of aquifer θ stands for the volumetric moisture content and h is the hydraulic head solving richards equation necessitates eliminating one of the two dependent variables water content and the pressure head ψ h z where z is elevation this is often done by introducing constitutive equations namely the water retention curves that express the water content and the relative conductivity as functions of the pressure head various formulations can be found in the literature in this work some of them will be used ranging from simplest to very complex ones and are listed below based on the model of irmay 1954 the moisture content as in tracy 2006 is expressed as 2 θ θ r θ s θ r e α ψ ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θ s and θ r are saturated and residual moisture content respectively gardner 1958 expressed the relative conductivity as an exponential function of the pressure head 3 k r ψ e α ψ ψ 0 1 ψ 0 the moisture content and the relative conductivity formulated by van genuchten 1980 are very popular and are written as 4 θ θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m θ r ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 5 k r ψ θ 1 2 1 1 θ 1 m 2 ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where θ θ θ r θ s θ r expresses the effective saturation and α n and m n 1 n are constants depending upon the soil properties brooks and corey 1964 provided also equations describing hydraulic properties of soils expressed originally as functions of the moisture content θ 6 ψ ψ s θ θ r θ θ s 1 λ 7 k r θ θ θ r θ θ s 2 3 λ λ where ψ s ψ θ s is the pressure head at saturation θ r is the residual water moisture content and λ is a parameter describing the pore size distribution index of the medium other relationships linking moisture content and relative conductivity to the pressure head are presented by haverkamp et al 1977 8 θ a θ s θ r 1 100 ψ b θ r ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 9 k r ψ c c 100 ψ d ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where a b c and d are constants to be determined experimentally for the soil type 3 numerical solution 3 1 finite element model to solve the flow equation 1 the finite element galerkin method with linear basis functions is used to discretize the whole domain of flow saturated and unsaturated along with an implicit finite difference scheme for time linear rectangular and hexahedral elements are used in the codes for 1d 2d and 3d features discretization leads to the following system of nonlinear equations 10 g h k 1 h k 1 m h k 1 q t k 1 0 where h k 1 is the vector of nodal head values at time t k 1 k is a time step index g is the conductance stiffness matrix m is a vector containing the moisture content derivative with respect to time and q is a vector containing the boundary conditions and flow rates pumped or injected 3 2 linearization technique applied to 10 the picard scheme where the soil moisture at the current iteration level is approximated as a truncated expansion of taylor series about the pressure head at the last iteration level celia et al 1990 gives the following system of linear equations to be solved for h k 1 m 1 the vector of nodal hydraulic heads at the current iteration level superscript m is the iteration index 11 g h k 1 m h k 1 m 1 c h k 1 m h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m δ t k 1 m h k 1 m q t k 1 0 stiffness matrix g mass matrix c and vector m depend upon the hydraulic head the entries of these matrices and the elements of the vector are defined as follows 12 g ij e v e k r t b i k s b j d x d y d z 13 c ij e v e s g ψ b i b j d x d y d z 14 c ii e v e s g ψ b i d x d y d z where s g ψ θ θ s s s d θ d ψ indicates the general storage coefficient and s s stands for the specific storage coefficient equation 14 gives the coefficients of the mass matrix c if mass lumping technique is used 15 m i e v e d θ dt b i d x d y d z chord slope is used to perform the moisture content derivative with respect to time as follows 16 d θ dt θ k 1 m θ k δ t k 1 i and j represent the global nodes while b i and b j are basis functions related respectively to local nodes i and j belonging to the element e gaussian quadrature rule is applied to perform the integrals 3 3 solution procedure to solve iteratively the equation 11 the matrices involved have to be updated at each iteration level making the solution process very costly on a cpu time basis particularly for large scale problems to make the procedure fast approximations are proposed for the matrix coefficients aharmouch and amaziane 2012 the idea is to split the coefficients into to quantities one constant computed once and stored and the other varying with iteration needing to be updated the authors applied the method to solve 3d steady state groundwater flow problems only in the saturated zone and neglect the flow in the unsaturated region however the flow modeling in the vadose zone constitutes an important issue in hydrology and plays a key role for sustainable groundwater use particularly in dry regions by evaluating the water transfer rates to the water table during recharge and also by assessing the water losses during dry periods for these purposes retention curves equations have to be used to characterize the unsaturated medium in the present work the stiffness entries are approximated as in the work of aharmouch and amaziane 2012 but with incorporating the retention curves equations aforementioned to solve correctly the flow in the vadose zone as well as for the saturated one the stiffness entries equation 12 are approximated for 1d 2d and 3d features as 17 g ij k e 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ 18 g ij k e 1 1 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ d η 19 g ij k e 1 1 1 1 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ d η d ζ 20 k 1 n g n es e 1 n es n g 1 n g k r e n g det j e n g the mass matrix entries for the distributed form equation 13 can be readily approximated as for the stiffness coefficients with making the necessary change however the lumped form equation 14 is used only because of its property to guarantee non oscillatory solution as it was demonstrated by celia et al 1990 the mass matrix entries using mass lumping technique equation 14 are approximated for 1d 2d and 3d features as 21 c ii s g e 1 1 b i d ξ 22 c ii s g e 1 1 1 1 b i d ξ d η 23 c ii s g e 1 1 1 1 1 1 b i d ξ d η d ζ 24 s g 1 n g n es e 1 n es n g 1 n g s g e n g det j e n g ξ η and ζ are local coordinates n es is the number of elements sharing the nodes i and j n g indicates gauss integration points n g 2 4 8 stands for their numbers depending on the dimensionality of the problem and det j e n g is the jacobian matrix determinant related to gauss integration point n g and element e as it was pointed out in the work of aharmouch and amaziane 2012 k expresses the arithmetic mean of the term k r det j over the integration points involved in the elements that share the nodes i and j similarly it can be seen that s g is the arithmetic mean of the term s g det j over the integration points involved in the elements that share the nodes i and j only the hydraulic properties relative conductivity and general storage coefficient have to be updated during the iteration process which guarantees gain in cpu time time stepping is performed as in the work of paniconi and putti 1994 time step sizes during transient simulations are dynamically recalculated depending on the convergence behavior of the nonlinear procedure the simulations start with a certain time step δt 0 which can be augmented by a magnificence factor δmag to a certain δt max or reduced using a reduction coefficient δred to a minimum value δt min depending on the number of iterations allowed in each nonlinear iteration and according to some performance criteria if the convergence is achieved in less than maxit1 iterations the time step in increased and remains unchanged if the number of iterations is within maxit1 and maxit2 iterations and reduced if convergence iterations needed are more than maxit2 the solution can also be recomputed at the current time if convergence is not accomplished among the specified criteria when maxit limit is exceeded by reducing the time step and going back to the old status back stepping the infinity norm l of the convergence error is adopted as stopping criterion of the nonlinear iterative process thus the convergence is achieved when h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m t o l is satisfied in the field case example the convergence is checked using a relative norm based stopping criterion the convergence is therefore achieved when h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m 2 h k 1 m 2 t o l is satisfied where 2 expresses the l 2 norm the square root of the sum of squares of a vector components owing to that the systems of linear equations obtained with the picard finite element approximation are sparse and symmetric conjugate gradient solvers are particularly indicated in such situation in this work preconditioned conjugate gradient method with incomplete cholesky decomposition preconditioner iccg is used to solve the resulting linear systems for 2d and 3d problems whereas tridiagonal direct algorithm is used for solving those obtained for 1d configuration 4 numerical tests and model assessment for validation purposes numerical examples are treated to verify the proposed model described in section 3 either equations17 24 designated as m1 or equations 14 and 17 20 designated as m2 the obtained results are then checked against some available solutions measured or analytical to account for the model accuracy numerous examples are considered including 1d 2d and 3d flow features and dealing with the most encountered problems of groundwater in variably saturated porous media ranging from infiltration evaporation in a soil column recharge drainage of a free surface 2d aquifer and free surface 3d aquifer response to recharge and pumping special attention is paid to flow in unsaturated flow in porous media the efficiency of the proposed numerical model is demonstrated against the standard model labeled stand where stiffness and mass matrices entries are expressed normally equations 12 and 14 comparisons between the two models were focused on the following criteria the number of time steps nts the number of back steps nbs the total computation time cpu the total number of nonlinear iterations nnlit the mass balance error mbe computed as in yeh 1981 all the simulations were performed on a 3 00 ghz pentium dual core e5700 microcomputer 4 1 transient flow in a soil column under infiltration 4 1 1 description this example was chosen to verify the presented model when dealing with infiltration the experimental results have been reported by haverkamp et al 1977 later clement et al 1994 presented a 2 dimensional numerical study of the same case and checked the obtained results to those observed by haverkamp et al 1977 in the present study the flow domain is a one dimensional sand column of 0 7 m length where a constant pressure head of ψ 0 615 m is specified at the outlet and a constant flux of 3 29 m day is imposed at the inlet the soil properties are taken as in clement et al 1994 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is ks 8 16 m day the porosity saturated water content is θs 0 287 and the residual water content is θr 0 075 the values of the soil properties used to parameterize the retention curve equation 8 are a 1 61 106 and b 3 96 and those for the relative conductivity expression equation 9 are c 1 18 106 and d 4 74 4 1 2 results and discussion the domain of study is discretized in 71 nodes with a constant spacing of 0 01 m transient simulations are performed during a period of 0 8 h using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 10 2 hr δtmin 0 1 10 5 hr δtmax 0 1 10 1 hr δtmag 1 2 δtred 0 5 along with maxit1 10 maxit2 20 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations the linear system of equations is solved directly using tridiagonal algorithm transient solutions are then computed at each 0 1 h during a total time simulation of 0 8 h both with the present model and the standard one simulation details are summarized in table 1 simulated and measured water content are shown in fig 1 the numerical water content profiles are identical for the standard formulation and the new model both are in good agreement with the experimental results numerically the two models perform quiet similarly as it can be seen in table 1 for every time simulation the time steps number the nonlinear iterations number the cpu times are almost the same as well as the mass balance error the new model version m1 performs similarly but takes 2 or 3 iterations more to converge to the same solution 4 2 two dimensional transient variably saturated water table recharge 4 2 1 description this test case is taken from vauclin et al 1979 and involves a transient flow through a homogeneous and isotropic rectangular soil embankment of 6 00 length and 2 00 m height the soil surface is recharged with a constant flux of q 3 55 m day applied over a strip of 1 00 m width located at the center of the domain the remaining surface is covered to avoid evaporation because of symmetry only one part of the whole domain is to be modeled for instance the right one the subsequent domain is of 3 00 m by 2 00 m and the recharge flux is then applied over a 0 5 m wide strip the remaining soil surface is subject to no flow condition as well as the bottom and the left side of the resulting domain fixed head boundary is used at the wetting zone of the right side of the domain by maintaining the water level at 0 65 m whereas a no flow condition is set to the remaining zone clement et al 1994 the soil properties are those of vauclin et al 1979 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is ks 8 40 m day the porosity saturated water content is θs 0 30 and the residual water content is θr 0 30 the values of the soil properties used to fit van genuchten s 1980 retention curve model equations 4 and 5 are α 3 3 m 1 and n 4 1 clement et al 1994 kuznetsov et al 2012 specific storage is set to zero clement et al 1994 4 2 2 results and discussion two grids are used one coarse with nodal distance of δx 0 1 m along the horizontal axis and δz 0 05 m with respect to the vertical axis for the fine grid nodal distances are taken to be the half of those of the coarse grid for the initial conditions the water level is fixed to 0 65 m throughout the whole domain transient simulations are performed during a period of 8 h using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 10 2 hr δtmin 0 1 10 6 hr δtmax 0 1 hr δtmag 1 2 δtred 0 5 with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner iccg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 2 3 4 and 8 hr elapsed time using the present model and the standard one simulation details related to the coarse grid are exhibited in the table 2 simulated water table positions for different periods independently of the model are in good agreement with the measured data of vauclin et al 1979 as it can be seen in fig 2 however the solutions obtained with the fine grid are more close to the experimental data the proposed model m1 and m2 and the standard one provide identical solution the two versions of the present model in all cases converge in less cpu time when compared to the standard model overall the standard model takes more cpu time to achieve the convergence to the fixed level of accuracy the best performance is recorded by the version m2 of the proposed model as an example during the 2 h duration of the first period the convergence of the version m2 is accomplished in 6401 iterations for 436 s whereas the version m1 converges in 9552 iterations for 617 s and the standard one converges in 7839 iterations for 993 s however on a per non linear iteration basis the versions m1 and m2 of the present model and the standard one needed respectively an average cpu time of 0 0645 s 0 0681 s and 0 1266 to converge in addition the version m1 the standard model and in a lesser extent the version m2 experience difficulties during the iterative process which is reflected by the number of the needing back steps 6 for the version m1 5 for the standard model and only 2 for the version m2 the mass balance errors are of 0 215 10 1 and 0 208 10 1 for the standard and the version m2 respectively and of 0 398 for the version m1 the same performances of the competing models can be observed at the end of the other periods of simulation the overall cpu time required for the version m2 to attain the solution is about 2 3 times lesser than that needed by the standard model for the fine grid the same outcome is observed regarding the rate of convergence and the efficiency of the 3 models with however the cpu time needed for model m2 about 2 5 times lesser than that necessitated by the standard model 4 3 three dimensional transient unsaturated flow in a cubic block 4 3 1 description this test deals with three dimensional flow in an unsaturated porous media the flow domain is taken as a very dry cubic block of soil of length a 15 m and is discretized with hexahedral elements of size 0 25 0 25 0 25 m3 because of the symmetry of the problem only the half of the domain is discretized resulting in 58 621 nodes and 54 000 elements on the top and the bottom of the cubic domain the pressure head is given by ψ x y z t 1 α ln e α ψ r 1 e α ψ r sin π x a sin π y a and ψ ψr respectively where as a non flux condition is assigned to the vertical sides to complete the problem the following initial conditions are taken h x y z 0 ψr z where z indicates elevation the relative conductivity is modeled as kr eαψ and he moisture content as θ θr θs θr eαψ where θs is the saturated moisture content and θr is the residual content parameters of the problem are α 0 25 θs 0 45 θr 0 15 ψr 15 m and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is taken ks 0 15 m day 4 3 2 results and discussion transient simulations are conducted during a period of 15 days using a varying time step technique δt0 0 01 day δtmin 0 001 day δtmax 0 025 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 transient solutions are then computed at 2 5 5 10 and 15 days elapsed time using the present model and the standard one simulation details are listed in table 3 fig 3 shows the pressure head contours at different times obtained with the present numerical model versions m1 and m2 and the standard one together with those obtained with the analytical solution tracy 2006 very good agreement can be noted between the solutions as for the precedent cases the present model performs better than the standard one for all time simulations in addition the version m1 ensures its superiority when compared to the version m2 on a per non linear iteration basis for all the time simulations the versions m1 and m2 of the present model needed an average of 8 23 s and 8 96 s of cpu time respectively to converge whereas an average time of 25 83 s is required for the standard model which represent more than 3 times the time needed by the present model in the case of the version m1 and slightly less than 3 for the other version overall with respect to the total cpu time the standard model takes about 3 11 times and 2 88 times the cpu time needed for the versions m1 and m2 respectively to converge the standard model is very costly in terms of cpu time as an example during the 15 days period of simulation the cpu time needed for the standard model to attain the solution is 9 hr 51 min 40 s whereas 3 hr 10 min and 3 hr 25 min were recorded for the versions m1 and m2 respectively again the version m1 of the presented model shows its highest efficiency regarding the rate of convergence the three models show practically the same number of iterations for every time simulation despite a little advantage of the standard model and the version m2 against the version m1 which takes 7 more iterations to accomplish the convergence to the same solution none of the 3 models had experienced difficulties to converge during all the periods of simulation thus any back step was noticed finally the present model and the standard one show very satisfactory mass balance the absolute values of the mass balance errors for almost all simulations are less than 10 3 4 4 three dimensional transient variably saturated infiltration and pumping 4 4 1 description two tests are involved and are taken from kuznetsov et al 2012 both deals with three dimensional flow in a variably saturated porous media recharge from the top is considered first and pumping is studied afterwards separately the flow domain is a rectangular parallelepiped of 1000 m in both lateral directions and of 10 m height the domain is discretized with hexahedral elements of size 10 10 1 m3 resulting in 112 211 nodes and 100 000 elements for the infiltration case the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition except the top which receives a recharging flux of 0 01 m day from a square area of 100 m 100 m located at the centre of the surface domain whereas the remainder part is taken to be impervious for the pumping case the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition and a fully penetrating vertical well is situated in the centre of the domain and screened over 2 m from the bottom with constant pumping rate 50 m3 day during 150 days for the both cases the initial water table height is of 5 m from the bottom of the domain parameters of the soil properties used along with the van genuchten s 1980 retention curve model are α 0 145 m 1 and n 2 68 kuznetsov et al 2012 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is taken ks 5 m day 4 4 2 results and discussion transient simulations are conducted during a period of 150 days using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 day δtmin 0 001 day δtmax 1 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner pcg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 50 100 and 150 days elapsed time using the present model and the standard one tables 4 and 5 summarize simulation results and simulated water table positions obtained are shown in fig 4 as can be expected the present model performs better than the standard one for all time simulations also the version m1 shows again its relative superiority when compared to the version m2 on a per non linear iteration basis for all the time simulations the versions m1 of the present model necessitated an average of 24 20 s to converge and the version m2 needed an average of 25 44 s of cpu time to achieve the convergence while the standard model required an average time of 93 24 s to accomplish the convergence to the same level of accuracy for the pumping case the performances are of 24 10 s 25 39 s and 90 68 s of cpu time respectively consequently the versions m1 and m2 of the present model are more than 3 times and half faster than the standard model globally with respect to the total cpu time the standard model takes about 3 85 times and 3 66 times the cpu time needed respectively for the versions m1 and m2 to converge when dealing with infiltration and about 3 95 times and 3 74 times the cpu time needed in case of pumping this demonstrates the high computational cost of the standard model and the highest efficiency of the version m1 of the present model concerning the rate of convergence the three models show exactly the same number of iterations for every time simulation no resize was necessary for the time step already fixed depending on the convergence history during all the time simulations finally the two versions of the present model show very satisfactory mass balance contrarily to the standard model indeed for all the simulations the mass balance errors are under 10 2 for the present model and are more than 5 for the standard model in the infiltration case and are under 0 1 for the present model and more than 10 0 for the standard model when dealing with pumping as a comparison with an already published work kuznetsov et al 2012 studied the same test medium scale and reported that their quasi 3d model performs almost as a standard full 3d model the cpu time needed for the standard full 3d is almost about 1 16 times superior to the cpu time needed for the quasi 3d model 4 5 three dimensional flow in a river connected aquifer 4 5 1 description this example deals with a hypothetical large scale groundwater flow problem in a semi arid context that is described by prudic et al 2004 the flow domain is a closed alluvial basin in which recharge is tributary to interactions between the aquifer and the rivers that cross it broadly from northwest to southeast and from east to west the aquifer is constituted of unconsolidated deposits of mostly sand and gravel overlying a substratum that is many times less permeable than the filling material of the valley which thickness increase toward the centre a three dimensional structured mesh of this hypothetical aquifer is generated and adjusted to fit aquifer geometry and wells location maps of the aquifer top and bottom are presented in fig 5 below the studied domain is discretized into non uniform finite hexahedral elements by a 51 54 11 mesh respectively in x y and z direction resulting in 30 294 nodes and 26 500 elements the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition except the top where evaporation occurs mostly in the vicinity of the streams network as described in prudic et al 2004 when the depth of the free surface is less than a certain value 6 5 m for the present simulations and with variable rates to a maximum of 0 0021 m d the streambed thickness is of 0 915 m and the corresponding leakance is globally constant of 0 864 d 1 but can reach locally 1 728 d 1 in the blue river prudic et al 2004 the elevation of the water in different streams sum of the streambed thickness and the stream depth is taken constant and equal to 1 25 m for the retention curve model brooks and corey s model 1964 is chosen equations 6 and 7 with the sets of values of herrada et al 2014 and which are used as follows in the vicinity of the channels θs 0 396 θr 0 ψs 0 131 m and λ 0 127 and θs 0 477 θr 0 1 ψs 0 45 m and λ 1 20 for the sediments in the remainder part of the valley the hydraulic conductivity is taken as in prudic et al 2004 52 8 m d in the vicinity of the streams and 10 7 m d elsewhere ten pumping wells are considered from each one an amount of 40000 m3 d is extracted during a period of 50 years the initial conditions are provided as a result of a steady state simulation of the model without pumping 4 5 2 results and discussion two simulations were conducted to provide the results presented in the framework of this study first a steady state simulation without pumping but taking into account leakage and evaporation was conducted to provide initial conditions inputs necessary to the transient simulation for this purpose a constant guess water head of 320 25 m was used for all the nodes a tolerance of 10 4 using the relative norm is fixed for non linear iterations together with a tolerance of 10 12 for inner pcg iteration the steady state simulation performed with the present model required 18 iterations to converge to the specified criteria with an error mass balance of 0 211 the cpu time needed for the model to converge in steady state regime is 44 3 s the standard model however fails to converge to the same level of solution mentioned above the convergence of the standard method is also examined with alleviated criteria and did not converge even with non linear tolerance reduced to 10 2 indeed the inner iterations i e the pcg iterations fail to converge when the inner tolerance is still 10 12 with less drastic conditions non linear tolerance of 10 2 and inner tolerance of 10 5 the standard method reaches convergence in 17 iterations within 125 s of cpu time and with a mass balance error of 34 6 whereas the present new model converges in 2 iterations within only 11 8 s of cpu time and with a mass balance error of 0 866 fig 6 left shows steady state water table contours transient simulations are conducted during a period of 50 years using a varying time step technique δt0 15 day δtmin 5 day δtmax 365 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 4 is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner pcg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 50 years elapsed time using the present model and the standard one table 6 displays obtained simulation results fig 6 right exhibits water level contours obtained with the version m1 of the present model after 50 years of pumping for this mimicking real world groundwater flow problem the present model shows its absolute superiority compared to the standard model the versions m1 and m2 of the present model achieve the convergence in 167 and 301 iterations with cpu times respectively of 584 s and 1040 s whereas for the standard model the convergence is achieved in 450 iterations within 5680 s on a per iteration basis standard model version m1 and version m2 of the present model need respectively 12 62 s 3 45 sand 3 5 s cpu time thus the present model versions m1 and m2 is about 3 6 times faster than the standard one in addition regarding the total cpu time the version m1 of the present model is almost 10 times faster than the standard model and almost 2 times faster than the version m2 of the present model which demonstrates the high convergence rate of the version m1 compared to the standard model and the version m2 of the present model this is confirmed by the iterations numbers needed for convergence which are of 167 301 and 450 respectively for the versions m1 and m2 of the present model and the standard one as it can be seen particularly for this real world test the version m1 of the present model shows the highest numerical efficiency to solve large and complex groundwater flow problems regarding the mass balance analysis the versions m1 and m2 provide satisfactory mass balance 0 144 and 0 633 contrarily to the standard model which shows an excessively high mass balance error of 131 thus the standard model equations 12 and 14 may be inadequate to solve complex groundwater flow problems in addition to its high numerical cost fig 7 shows the solutions obtained with the version m1 and m2 of the present model together with the solution obtained with the standard one 5 conclusions an efficient transient numerical mass conservative model is constructed to solve variably saturated groundwater flow problems a galerkin linear finite element mesh is used to discretize the entire domain saturated and unsaturated compartments picard iteration technique together with the fully implicit euler method is used to solve the obtained discretized equations system the present model is particularly suitable for limited computational resources when 3d groundwater flow problems are tackled the stiffness and mass matrices involved are approximated in a way that only hydraulic properties are updated during the iterative process to guarantee less computational effort when solving the pde the geometric part of the matrices remains unchanged so computed once and stored which ensures important savings in cpu time the new model is presented with or without approximate mass matrix versions m1 and m2 both are tested and compared to a standard numerical model obtained with non altered matrices the proposed model capabilities are tested and compared to the standard model across benchmark tests for which analytical solutions or experimental results are available a real world groundwater flow problem is also solved to examine the performance of the competing numerical tools different soil water curve models conferring variable non linearity degrees to the richards equation are also implemented emphasis is made when reproducing these examples on two major aspects that are accuracy and efficiency assessed respectively by the mass balance error and the cpu time to achieve convergence along with the studied examples the developed new model shows its superiority to solve variably saturated flow problems in 1d 2d and 3d configurations the developed new model exhibits high computational performance regarding time cost and solution accuracy these outcomes are clearly revealed with high dimensionality problems in effect the present model and the standard one perform almost similarly when dealing with 1d flow problems may be because of the relatively small number of nodes and elements the numerical water content curves are identical and the cpu times are very close as well as the mass balance errors since the dimensionality increases the present model m1 and m2 performs increasingly better than the standard model the latter is computationally intensive due to the fact that the involved matrices should be totally rebuilt at every nonlinear iteration contrarily to the proposed new model where only the hydraulic parts are to be updated the geometric parts are computed once and stored as a consequence the cpu time needed to attain the convergence becomes dramatically highest for the standard model it is clear that the required cpu time increases with high dimensionality and the total number of elements and nodes for the 2d recharge test the cpu time needed by the standard model is about 2 3 2 5 times higher than the cpu time needed for the present model whereas the mass balance errors are satisfactory for the competing models when dealing with the 3d flow examples the cpu time needed by the standard model to achieve convergence is about 3 66 3 95 times greater than that needed by the present model to converge to the same level of accuracy on the other hand the mass balance error is very satisfactory for the present model less than 0 01 for the recharge test and less than 0 1 for test of pumping whereas for the standard model these mass balance errors are more than 5 and more than 10 for the two tests mentioned respectively it is to notice that the mass balance error provided by the two competing model are very satisfactory less than 0 001 when dealing with the totally unsaturated flow example indeed the numerical solutions obtained with the two models present and standard match very well however the cpu time needed by the standard model to converge under the same constraints is globally about 3 times greater than that needed for the present model for the hypothetical real word test the present model shows its absolute superiority when compared to the standard model also the version m1 confirms its superiority when compared to the version m2 globally with respect to cpu time the standard model takes almost 10 times and more than 5 times the cpu time needed respectively by the versions m1 and m2 of the present model to converge this clearly shows the highest efficiency of the version m1 of the present model the version m2 take about 2 times the cpu time needed to the version m1 to converge indeed regarding the mass balance analysis the versions m1 and m2 provide satisfactory mass balance 0 144 and 0 633 contrarily to the standard model which shows an excessively high mass balance error of 131 as it can be seen particularly for this real world test the version m1 of the present model shows the highest numerical efficiency to solve large and complex groundwater flow problems consequently the use of the standard model to solve groundwater flow problems may be difficult and almost prohibitive to perform more complicated and repetitive operations as the calibration for instance or to solve coupled groundwater flow and solute transport problems particularly with poor or insufficient computational resources the present model however particularly the version m1 is shown to be suitable for solving large and complex groundwater flow problems and probably to be used usefully for the anticipated related issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4055,a multi dimensional mass conservative numerical method particularly suitable for limited computational resources is developed for solving transient variably saturated groundwater flow problems the richards equation is discretized spatially with a finite element method and temporally with an implicit euler scheme in which mass conservative and mass lumping techniques are used to keep the numerical simulation stable in addition the stiffness and mass matrices involved are approximated in a way to guarantee less computational effort to confirm the accuracy and the efficiency of this code we verified it using benchmark tests using one two and three dimensional problems the present model is also applied to a real field case problem where its superiority is clearly demonstrated the code achieved reliable results for each problem keywords groundwater flow finite element modeling richards equation variably saturated flow 1 introduction flow in a variably saturated porous medium is governed by the richards equation a highly nonlinear pde few analytical solutions using simplifying conditions or restrictive hypotheses were presented polubarinova kochina 1962 teloglou et al 2008 moutsopoulos 2013 tracy 1995 2006 2007 hayek 2015 nevertheless the most attempts to solve saturated unsaturated flow problems are based on numerical techniques several models using the numerical approach of celia et al 1990 were developed clement et al 1994 van dam and feddes 2000 kuznetsov et al 2012 herrada et al 2014 belfort et al 2013 presented a review of several estimations of the equivalent conductivity and analyzed the efficiency of the different averaging fashions when solving unsaturated flow fahs et al 2009 used the method of lines combined with the mixed finite element discretization to solve variably saturated flow in porous media younes et al 2013 studied the monotonicity of a finite volume based method for solving flow in variably saturated and heterogeneous porous media hassane maina and ackerer 2017 discussed newton raphson method and time stepping strategies for solving the mixed form of richards equation koohbor et al 2021 solved richards equation in the context of fractured porous media zha et al 2017 presented a modified picard iteration scheme for overcoming drawbacks arising when simulating infiltration into dry soils farthing and ogden 2017 and zha et al 2019 presented a state of the art review of the numerical solution of the richards equation numerous aspects were discussed and challenges underlined related to equivalent hydraulic conductivity computational efficiency or choice of primary variable among others other models were also developed thoms et al 2006 šimůnek et al 2006 in view to solve 3d flow in variably saturated porous media these numerical models proceed by solving the resulting equations system subsequent to various approximation methods however these codes may be costing in cpu time when much finer temporal and spatial discretizations are necessary or in case of applications at the watershed scale e g for climate change purposes when huge equations systems are to be solved drawbacks to the numerical resolution attempt of the richards equation may be exacerbated when computational resources are limited alternatives are proposed to avoid high cpu time costs of fully 3d numerical models yakirevich et al 1998 paulus et al 2013 kuznetsov et al 2012 xu et al 2012 these techniques act by lowering dimensions of the fully 3d richards equation in both unsaturated and saturated domains or only in the unsaturated one when the saturated flow is modeled in its whole dimensionality as a consequence the number of unknowns to be solved decrease significantly and the cpu time as well however doing so may constitute a source of inaccuracies that can affect the hydraulic heads as well as the fluxes in the separated domains indeed as it is pointed out by twarakavi et al 2008 only solving the fully 3d richards equation for the whole continuous flow domain is able to provide accurate solutions for hydraulic heads and subsequent fluxes in both unsaturated and saturated compartments however the most obstacle that limits the applicability of such models for regional scales is their computational demand and time cost in this paper a multi dimensional numerical model based on the mixed form of richards equation particularly suitable for limited computational resources is developed to solve flow equation in both unsaturated and saturated zones under unsteady and steady regimes the numerical model is galerkin fe based and uses the celia et al s 1990 first order time integration method to solve the derived algebraic equations system the use the richrads equation may be inappropriate with coarse grids because of violation of the assumption of representative elementary volume which can result in loss of accuracy zha et al 2019 the use of the fine grids however may complicate the resolution or simply make it infeasible due to high computational coast in order to circumvent these difficulties the proposed numerical numerical scheme approximates the matrices involved in a newly fashion to guarantee less computational effort when solving the involved pde the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the flow model used to solve variably saturated porous media and reports the most used retention curves equations section 3 is dedicated to the numerical procedure adopted and the proposed approximation of the matrices obtained in section 4 benchmark tests against analytical solutions show the present model capabilities to provide high level of accuracy in addition other tests available in the literature are also examined and the efficiency of the present model is demonstrated finally section 5 summarizes the concluding remarks 2 mathematical statement the richards equation can be expressed on three usual forms the head based form the moisture based form and under a mix form using the moisture and the head for the temporal and the spatial terms respectively discussion about these forms can be found in fahs et al 2009 farthing and ogden 2017 and zha et al 2019 the mixed form of richards equation modeling water flow in a variably saturated porous medium is obtained by combining darcy s law and continuity equation and is expressed as 1 k s k r h h q θ t where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor k r h is the relative conductivity q is the source sink per volume of aquifer θ stands for the volumetric moisture content and h is the hydraulic head solving richards equation necessitates eliminating one of the two dependent variables water content and the pressure head ψ h z where z is elevation this is often done by introducing constitutive equations namely the water retention curves that express the water content and the relative conductivity as functions of the pressure head various formulations can be found in the literature in this work some of them will be used ranging from simplest to very complex ones and are listed below based on the model of irmay 1954 the moisture content as in tracy 2006 is expressed as 2 θ θ r θ s θ r e α ψ ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 where θ s and θ r are saturated and residual moisture content respectively gardner 1958 expressed the relative conductivity as an exponential function of the pressure head 3 k r ψ e α ψ ψ 0 1 ψ 0 the moisture content and the relative conductivity formulated by van genuchten 1980 are very popular and are written as 4 θ θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m θ r ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 5 k r ψ θ 1 2 1 1 θ 1 m 2 ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where θ θ θ r θ s θ r expresses the effective saturation and α n and m n 1 n are constants depending upon the soil properties brooks and corey 1964 provided also equations describing hydraulic properties of soils expressed originally as functions of the moisture content θ 6 ψ ψ s θ θ r θ θ s 1 λ 7 k r θ θ θ r θ θ s 2 3 λ λ where ψ s ψ θ s is the pressure head at saturation θ r is the residual water moisture content and λ is a parameter describing the pore size distribution index of the medium other relationships linking moisture content and relative conductivity to the pressure head are presented by haverkamp et al 1977 8 θ a θ s θ r 1 100 ψ b θ r ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 9 k r ψ c c 100 ψ d ψ 0 1 ψ 0 where a b c and d are constants to be determined experimentally for the soil type 3 numerical solution 3 1 finite element model to solve the flow equation 1 the finite element galerkin method with linear basis functions is used to discretize the whole domain of flow saturated and unsaturated along with an implicit finite difference scheme for time linear rectangular and hexahedral elements are used in the codes for 1d 2d and 3d features discretization leads to the following system of nonlinear equations 10 g h k 1 h k 1 m h k 1 q t k 1 0 where h k 1 is the vector of nodal head values at time t k 1 k is a time step index g is the conductance stiffness matrix m is a vector containing the moisture content derivative with respect to time and q is a vector containing the boundary conditions and flow rates pumped or injected 3 2 linearization technique applied to 10 the picard scheme where the soil moisture at the current iteration level is approximated as a truncated expansion of taylor series about the pressure head at the last iteration level celia et al 1990 gives the following system of linear equations to be solved for h k 1 m 1 the vector of nodal hydraulic heads at the current iteration level superscript m is the iteration index 11 g h k 1 m h k 1 m 1 c h k 1 m h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m δ t k 1 m h k 1 m q t k 1 0 stiffness matrix g mass matrix c and vector m depend upon the hydraulic head the entries of these matrices and the elements of the vector are defined as follows 12 g ij e v e k r t b i k s b j d x d y d z 13 c ij e v e s g ψ b i b j d x d y d z 14 c ii e v e s g ψ b i d x d y d z where s g ψ θ θ s s s d θ d ψ indicates the general storage coefficient and s s stands for the specific storage coefficient equation 14 gives the coefficients of the mass matrix c if mass lumping technique is used 15 m i e v e d θ dt b i d x d y d z chord slope is used to perform the moisture content derivative with respect to time as follows 16 d θ dt θ k 1 m θ k δ t k 1 i and j represent the global nodes while b i and b j are basis functions related respectively to local nodes i and j belonging to the element e gaussian quadrature rule is applied to perform the integrals 3 3 solution procedure to solve iteratively the equation 11 the matrices involved have to be updated at each iteration level making the solution process very costly on a cpu time basis particularly for large scale problems to make the procedure fast approximations are proposed for the matrix coefficients aharmouch and amaziane 2012 the idea is to split the coefficients into to quantities one constant computed once and stored and the other varying with iteration needing to be updated the authors applied the method to solve 3d steady state groundwater flow problems only in the saturated zone and neglect the flow in the unsaturated region however the flow modeling in the vadose zone constitutes an important issue in hydrology and plays a key role for sustainable groundwater use particularly in dry regions by evaluating the water transfer rates to the water table during recharge and also by assessing the water losses during dry periods for these purposes retention curves equations have to be used to characterize the unsaturated medium in the present work the stiffness entries are approximated as in the work of aharmouch and amaziane 2012 but with incorporating the retention curves equations aforementioned to solve correctly the flow in the vadose zone as well as for the saturated one the stiffness entries equation 12 are approximated for 1d 2d and 3d features as 17 g ij k e 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ 18 g ij k e 1 1 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ d η 19 g ij k e 1 1 1 1 1 1 t b i k s b j d ξ d η d ζ 20 k 1 n g n es e 1 n es n g 1 n g k r e n g det j e n g the mass matrix entries for the distributed form equation 13 can be readily approximated as for the stiffness coefficients with making the necessary change however the lumped form equation 14 is used only because of its property to guarantee non oscillatory solution as it was demonstrated by celia et al 1990 the mass matrix entries using mass lumping technique equation 14 are approximated for 1d 2d and 3d features as 21 c ii s g e 1 1 b i d ξ 22 c ii s g e 1 1 1 1 b i d ξ d η 23 c ii s g e 1 1 1 1 1 1 b i d ξ d η d ζ 24 s g 1 n g n es e 1 n es n g 1 n g s g e n g det j e n g ξ η and ζ are local coordinates n es is the number of elements sharing the nodes i and j n g indicates gauss integration points n g 2 4 8 stands for their numbers depending on the dimensionality of the problem and det j e n g is the jacobian matrix determinant related to gauss integration point n g and element e as it was pointed out in the work of aharmouch and amaziane 2012 k expresses the arithmetic mean of the term k r det j over the integration points involved in the elements that share the nodes i and j similarly it can be seen that s g is the arithmetic mean of the term s g det j over the integration points involved in the elements that share the nodes i and j only the hydraulic properties relative conductivity and general storage coefficient have to be updated during the iteration process which guarantees gain in cpu time time stepping is performed as in the work of paniconi and putti 1994 time step sizes during transient simulations are dynamically recalculated depending on the convergence behavior of the nonlinear procedure the simulations start with a certain time step δt 0 which can be augmented by a magnificence factor δmag to a certain δt max or reduced using a reduction coefficient δred to a minimum value δt min depending on the number of iterations allowed in each nonlinear iteration and according to some performance criteria if the convergence is achieved in less than maxit1 iterations the time step in increased and remains unchanged if the number of iterations is within maxit1 and maxit2 iterations and reduced if convergence iterations needed are more than maxit2 the solution can also be recomputed at the current time if convergence is not accomplished among the specified criteria when maxit limit is exceeded by reducing the time step and going back to the old status back stepping the infinity norm l of the convergence error is adopted as stopping criterion of the nonlinear iterative process thus the convergence is achieved when h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m t o l is satisfied in the field case example the convergence is checked using a relative norm based stopping criterion the convergence is therefore achieved when h k 1 m 1 h k 1 m 2 h k 1 m 2 t o l is satisfied where 2 expresses the l 2 norm the square root of the sum of squares of a vector components owing to that the systems of linear equations obtained with the picard finite element approximation are sparse and symmetric conjugate gradient solvers are particularly indicated in such situation in this work preconditioned conjugate gradient method with incomplete cholesky decomposition preconditioner iccg is used to solve the resulting linear systems for 2d and 3d problems whereas tridiagonal direct algorithm is used for solving those obtained for 1d configuration 4 numerical tests and model assessment for validation purposes numerical examples are treated to verify the proposed model described in section 3 either equations17 24 designated as m1 or equations 14 and 17 20 designated as m2 the obtained results are then checked against some available solutions measured or analytical to account for the model accuracy numerous examples are considered including 1d 2d and 3d flow features and dealing with the most encountered problems of groundwater in variably saturated porous media ranging from infiltration evaporation in a soil column recharge drainage of a free surface 2d aquifer and free surface 3d aquifer response to recharge and pumping special attention is paid to flow in unsaturated flow in porous media the efficiency of the proposed numerical model is demonstrated against the standard model labeled stand where stiffness and mass matrices entries are expressed normally equations 12 and 14 comparisons between the two models were focused on the following criteria the number of time steps nts the number of back steps nbs the total computation time cpu the total number of nonlinear iterations nnlit the mass balance error mbe computed as in yeh 1981 all the simulations were performed on a 3 00 ghz pentium dual core e5700 microcomputer 4 1 transient flow in a soil column under infiltration 4 1 1 description this example was chosen to verify the presented model when dealing with infiltration the experimental results have been reported by haverkamp et al 1977 later clement et al 1994 presented a 2 dimensional numerical study of the same case and checked the obtained results to those observed by haverkamp et al 1977 in the present study the flow domain is a one dimensional sand column of 0 7 m length where a constant pressure head of ψ 0 615 m is specified at the outlet and a constant flux of 3 29 m day is imposed at the inlet the soil properties are taken as in clement et al 1994 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is ks 8 16 m day the porosity saturated water content is θs 0 287 and the residual water content is θr 0 075 the values of the soil properties used to parameterize the retention curve equation 8 are a 1 61 106 and b 3 96 and those for the relative conductivity expression equation 9 are c 1 18 106 and d 4 74 4 1 2 results and discussion the domain of study is discretized in 71 nodes with a constant spacing of 0 01 m transient simulations are performed during a period of 0 8 h using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 10 2 hr δtmin 0 1 10 5 hr δtmax 0 1 10 1 hr δtmag 1 2 δtred 0 5 along with maxit1 10 maxit2 20 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations the linear system of equations is solved directly using tridiagonal algorithm transient solutions are then computed at each 0 1 h during a total time simulation of 0 8 h both with the present model and the standard one simulation details are summarized in table 1 simulated and measured water content are shown in fig 1 the numerical water content profiles are identical for the standard formulation and the new model both are in good agreement with the experimental results numerically the two models perform quiet similarly as it can be seen in table 1 for every time simulation the time steps number the nonlinear iterations number the cpu times are almost the same as well as the mass balance error the new model version m1 performs similarly but takes 2 or 3 iterations more to converge to the same solution 4 2 two dimensional transient variably saturated water table recharge 4 2 1 description this test case is taken from vauclin et al 1979 and involves a transient flow through a homogeneous and isotropic rectangular soil embankment of 6 00 length and 2 00 m height the soil surface is recharged with a constant flux of q 3 55 m day applied over a strip of 1 00 m width located at the center of the domain the remaining surface is covered to avoid evaporation because of symmetry only one part of the whole domain is to be modeled for instance the right one the subsequent domain is of 3 00 m by 2 00 m and the recharge flux is then applied over a 0 5 m wide strip the remaining soil surface is subject to no flow condition as well as the bottom and the left side of the resulting domain fixed head boundary is used at the wetting zone of the right side of the domain by maintaining the water level at 0 65 m whereas a no flow condition is set to the remaining zone clement et al 1994 the soil properties are those of vauclin et al 1979 the saturated hydraulic conductivity is ks 8 40 m day the porosity saturated water content is θs 0 30 and the residual water content is θr 0 30 the values of the soil properties used to fit van genuchten s 1980 retention curve model equations 4 and 5 are α 3 3 m 1 and n 4 1 clement et al 1994 kuznetsov et al 2012 specific storage is set to zero clement et al 1994 4 2 2 results and discussion two grids are used one coarse with nodal distance of δx 0 1 m along the horizontal axis and δz 0 05 m with respect to the vertical axis for the fine grid nodal distances are taken to be the half of those of the coarse grid for the initial conditions the water level is fixed to 0 65 m throughout the whole domain transient simulations are performed during a period of 8 h using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 10 2 hr δtmin 0 1 10 6 hr δtmax 0 1 hr δtmag 1 2 δtred 0 5 with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner iccg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 2 3 4 and 8 hr elapsed time using the present model and the standard one simulation details related to the coarse grid are exhibited in the table 2 simulated water table positions for different periods independently of the model are in good agreement with the measured data of vauclin et al 1979 as it can be seen in fig 2 however the solutions obtained with the fine grid are more close to the experimental data the proposed model m1 and m2 and the standard one provide identical solution the two versions of the present model in all cases converge in less cpu time when compared to the standard model overall the standard model takes more cpu time to achieve the convergence to the fixed level of accuracy the best performance is recorded by the version m2 of the proposed model as an example during the 2 h duration of the first period the convergence of the version m2 is accomplished in 6401 iterations for 436 s whereas the version m1 converges in 9552 iterations for 617 s and the standard one converges in 7839 iterations for 993 s however on a per non linear iteration basis the versions m1 and m2 of the present model and the standard one needed respectively an average cpu time of 0 0645 s 0 0681 s and 0 1266 to converge in addition the version m1 the standard model and in a lesser extent the version m2 experience difficulties during the iterative process which is reflected by the number of the needing back steps 6 for the version m1 5 for the standard model and only 2 for the version m2 the mass balance errors are of 0 215 10 1 and 0 208 10 1 for the standard and the version m2 respectively and of 0 398 for the version m1 the same performances of the competing models can be observed at the end of the other periods of simulation the overall cpu time required for the version m2 to attain the solution is about 2 3 times lesser than that needed by the standard model for the fine grid the same outcome is observed regarding the rate of convergence and the efficiency of the 3 models with however the cpu time needed for model m2 about 2 5 times lesser than that necessitated by the standard model 4 3 three dimensional transient unsaturated flow in a cubic block 4 3 1 description this test deals with three dimensional flow in an unsaturated porous media the flow domain is taken as a very dry cubic block of soil of length a 15 m and is discretized with hexahedral elements of size 0 25 0 25 0 25 m3 because of the symmetry of the problem only the half of the domain is discretized resulting in 58 621 nodes and 54 000 elements on the top and the bottom of the cubic domain the pressure head is given by ψ x y z t 1 α ln e α ψ r 1 e α ψ r sin π x a sin π y a and ψ ψr respectively where as a non flux condition is assigned to the vertical sides to complete the problem the following initial conditions are taken h x y z 0 ψr z where z indicates elevation the relative conductivity is modeled as kr eαψ and he moisture content as θ θr θs θr eαψ where θs is the saturated moisture content and θr is the residual content parameters of the problem are α 0 25 θs 0 45 θr 0 15 ψr 15 m and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is taken ks 0 15 m day 4 3 2 results and discussion transient simulations are conducted during a period of 15 days using a varying time step technique δt0 0 01 day δtmin 0 001 day δtmax 0 025 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 transient solutions are then computed at 2 5 5 10 and 15 days elapsed time using the present model and the standard one simulation details are listed in table 3 fig 3 shows the pressure head contours at different times obtained with the present numerical model versions m1 and m2 and the standard one together with those obtained with the analytical solution tracy 2006 very good agreement can be noted between the solutions as for the precedent cases the present model performs better than the standard one for all time simulations in addition the version m1 ensures its superiority when compared to the version m2 on a per non linear iteration basis for all the time simulations the versions m1 and m2 of the present model needed an average of 8 23 s and 8 96 s of cpu time respectively to converge whereas an average time of 25 83 s is required for the standard model which represent more than 3 times the time needed by the present model in the case of the version m1 and slightly less than 3 for the other version overall with respect to the total cpu time the standard model takes about 3 11 times and 2 88 times the cpu time needed for the versions m1 and m2 respectively to converge the standard model is very costly in terms of cpu time as an example during the 15 days period of simulation the cpu time needed for the standard model to attain the solution is 9 hr 51 min 40 s whereas 3 hr 10 min and 3 hr 25 min were recorded for the versions m1 and m2 respectively again the version m1 of the presented model shows its highest efficiency regarding the rate of convergence the three models show practically the same number of iterations for every time simulation despite a little advantage of the standard model and the version m2 against the version m1 which takes 7 more iterations to accomplish the convergence to the same solution none of the 3 models had experienced difficulties to converge during all the periods of simulation thus any back step was noticed finally the present model and the standard one show very satisfactory mass balance the absolute values of the mass balance errors for almost all simulations are less than 10 3 4 4 three dimensional transient variably saturated infiltration and pumping 4 4 1 description two tests are involved and are taken from kuznetsov et al 2012 both deals with three dimensional flow in a variably saturated porous media recharge from the top is considered first and pumping is studied afterwards separately the flow domain is a rectangular parallelepiped of 1000 m in both lateral directions and of 10 m height the domain is discretized with hexahedral elements of size 10 10 1 m3 resulting in 112 211 nodes and 100 000 elements for the infiltration case the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition except the top which receives a recharging flux of 0 01 m day from a square area of 100 m 100 m located at the centre of the surface domain whereas the remainder part is taken to be impervious for the pumping case the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition and a fully penetrating vertical well is situated in the centre of the domain and screened over 2 m from the bottom with constant pumping rate 50 m3 day during 150 days for the both cases the initial water table height is of 5 m from the bottom of the domain parameters of the soil properties used along with the van genuchten s 1980 retention curve model are α 0 145 m 1 and n 2 68 kuznetsov et al 2012 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is taken ks 5 m day 4 4 2 results and discussion transient simulations are conducted during a period of 150 days using a varying time step technique δt0 0 1 day δtmin 0 001 day δtmax 1 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 3 m is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner pcg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 50 100 and 150 days elapsed time using the present model and the standard one tables 4 and 5 summarize simulation results and simulated water table positions obtained are shown in fig 4 as can be expected the present model performs better than the standard one for all time simulations also the version m1 shows again its relative superiority when compared to the version m2 on a per non linear iteration basis for all the time simulations the versions m1 of the present model necessitated an average of 24 20 s to converge and the version m2 needed an average of 25 44 s of cpu time to achieve the convergence while the standard model required an average time of 93 24 s to accomplish the convergence to the same level of accuracy for the pumping case the performances are of 24 10 s 25 39 s and 90 68 s of cpu time respectively consequently the versions m1 and m2 of the present model are more than 3 times and half faster than the standard model globally with respect to the total cpu time the standard model takes about 3 85 times and 3 66 times the cpu time needed respectively for the versions m1 and m2 to converge when dealing with infiltration and about 3 95 times and 3 74 times the cpu time needed in case of pumping this demonstrates the high computational cost of the standard model and the highest efficiency of the version m1 of the present model concerning the rate of convergence the three models show exactly the same number of iterations for every time simulation no resize was necessary for the time step already fixed depending on the convergence history during all the time simulations finally the two versions of the present model show very satisfactory mass balance contrarily to the standard model indeed for all the simulations the mass balance errors are under 10 2 for the present model and are more than 5 for the standard model in the infiltration case and are under 0 1 for the present model and more than 10 0 for the standard model when dealing with pumping as a comparison with an already published work kuznetsov et al 2012 studied the same test medium scale and reported that their quasi 3d model performs almost as a standard full 3d model the cpu time needed for the standard full 3d is almost about 1 16 times superior to the cpu time needed for the quasi 3d model 4 5 three dimensional flow in a river connected aquifer 4 5 1 description this example deals with a hypothetical large scale groundwater flow problem in a semi arid context that is described by prudic et al 2004 the flow domain is a closed alluvial basin in which recharge is tributary to interactions between the aquifer and the rivers that cross it broadly from northwest to southeast and from east to west the aquifer is constituted of unconsolidated deposits of mostly sand and gravel overlying a substratum that is many times less permeable than the filling material of the valley which thickness increase toward the centre a three dimensional structured mesh of this hypothetical aquifer is generated and adjusted to fit aquifer geometry and wells location maps of the aquifer top and bottom are presented in fig 5 below the studied domain is discretized into non uniform finite hexahedral elements by a 51 54 11 mesh respectively in x y and z direction resulting in 30 294 nodes and 26 500 elements the boundaries of the domain are subject to no flow condition except the top where evaporation occurs mostly in the vicinity of the streams network as described in prudic et al 2004 when the depth of the free surface is less than a certain value 6 5 m for the present simulations and with variable rates to a maximum of 0 0021 m d the streambed thickness is of 0 915 m and the corresponding leakance is globally constant of 0 864 d 1 but can reach locally 1 728 d 1 in the blue river prudic et al 2004 the elevation of the water in different streams sum of the streambed thickness and the stream depth is taken constant and equal to 1 25 m for the retention curve model brooks and corey s model 1964 is chosen equations 6 and 7 with the sets of values of herrada et al 2014 and which are used as follows in the vicinity of the channels θs 0 396 θr 0 ψs 0 131 m and λ 0 127 and θs 0 477 θr 0 1 ψs 0 45 m and λ 1 20 for the sediments in the remainder part of the valley the hydraulic conductivity is taken as in prudic et al 2004 52 8 m d in the vicinity of the streams and 10 7 m d elsewhere ten pumping wells are considered from each one an amount of 40000 m3 d is extracted during a period of 50 years the initial conditions are provided as a result of a steady state simulation of the model without pumping 4 5 2 results and discussion two simulations were conducted to provide the results presented in the framework of this study first a steady state simulation without pumping but taking into account leakage and evaporation was conducted to provide initial conditions inputs necessary to the transient simulation for this purpose a constant guess water head of 320 25 m was used for all the nodes a tolerance of 10 4 using the relative norm is fixed for non linear iterations together with a tolerance of 10 12 for inner pcg iteration the steady state simulation performed with the present model required 18 iterations to converge to the specified criteria with an error mass balance of 0 211 the cpu time needed for the model to converge in steady state regime is 44 3 s the standard model however fails to converge to the same level of solution mentioned above the convergence of the standard method is also examined with alleviated criteria and did not converge even with non linear tolerance reduced to 10 2 indeed the inner iterations i e the pcg iterations fail to converge when the inner tolerance is still 10 12 with less drastic conditions non linear tolerance of 10 2 and inner tolerance of 10 5 the standard method reaches convergence in 17 iterations within 125 s of cpu time and with a mass balance error of 34 6 whereas the present new model converges in 2 iterations within only 11 8 s of cpu time and with a mass balance error of 0 866 fig 6 left shows steady state water table contours transient simulations are conducted during a period of 50 years using a varying time step technique δt0 15 day δtmin 5 day δtmax 365 day with maxit1 10 maxit2 10 and maxit 30 a tolerance of 10 4 is fixed for non linear iterations and 10 12 for inner pcg iteration transient solutions are then computed at 50 years elapsed time using the present model and the standard one table 6 displays obtained simulation results fig 6 right exhibits water level contours obtained with the version m1 of the present model after 50 years of pumping for this mimicking real world groundwater flow problem the present model shows its absolute superiority compared to the standard model the versions m1 and m2 of the present model achieve the convergence in 167 and 301 iterations with cpu times respectively of 584 s and 1040 s whereas for the standard model the convergence is achieved in 450 iterations within 5680 s on a per iteration basis standard model version m1 and version m2 of the present model need respectively 12 62 s 3 45 sand 3 5 s cpu time thus the present model versions m1 and m2 is about 3 6 times faster than the standard one in addition regarding the total cpu time the version m1 of the present model is almost 10 times faster than the standard model and almost 2 times faster than the version m2 of the present model which demonstrates the high convergence rate of the version m1 compared to the standard model and the version m2 of the present model this is confirmed by the iterations numbers needed for convergence which are of 167 301 and 450 respectively for the versions m1 and m2 of the present model and the standard one as it can be seen particularly for this real world test the version m1 of the present model shows the highest numerical efficiency to solve large and complex groundwater flow problems regarding the mass balance analysis the versions m1 and m2 provide satisfactory mass balance 0 144 and 0 633 contrarily to the standard model which shows an excessively high mass balance error of 131 thus the standard model equations 12 and 14 may be inadequate to solve complex groundwater flow problems in addition to its high numerical cost fig 7 shows the solutions obtained with the version m1 and m2 of the present model together with the solution obtained with the standard one 5 conclusions an efficient transient numerical mass conservative model is constructed to solve variably saturated groundwater flow problems a galerkin linear finite element mesh is used to discretize the entire domain saturated and unsaturated compartments picard iteration technique together with the fully implicit euler method is used to solve the obtained discretized equations system the present model is particularly suitable for limited computational resources when 3d groundwater flow problems are tackled the stiffness and mass matrices involved are approximated in a way that only hydraulic properties are updated during the iterative process to guarantee less computational effort when solving the pde the geometric part of the matrices remains unchanged so computed once and stored which ensures important savings in cpu time the new model is presented with or without approximate mass matrix versions m1 and m2 both are tested and compared to a standard numerical model obtained with non altered matrices the proposed model capabilities are tested and compared to the standard model across benchmark tests for which analytical solutions or experimental results are available a real world groundwater flow problem is also solved to examine the performance of the competing numerical tools different soil water curve models conferring variable non linearity degrees to the richards equation are also implemented emphasis is made when reproducing these examples on two major aspects that are accuracy and efficiency assessed respectively by the mass balance error and the cpu time to achieve convergence along with the studied examples the developed new model shows its superiority to solve variably saturated flow problems in 1d 2d and 3d configurations the developed new model exhibits high computational performance regarding time cost and solution accuracy these outcomes are clearly revealed with high dimensionality problems in effect the present model and the standard one perform almost similarly when dealing with 1d flow problems may be because of the relatively small number of nodes and elements the numerical water content curves are identical and the cpu times are very close as well as the mass balance errors since the dimensionality increases the present model m1 and m2 performs increasingly better than the standard model the latter is computationally intensive due to the fact that the involved matrices should be totally rebuilt at every nonlinear iteration contrarily to the proposed new model where only the hydraulic parts are to be updated the geometric parts are computed once and stored as a consequence the cpu time needed to attain the convergence becomes dramatically highest for the standard model it is clear that the required cpu time increases with high dimensionality and the total number of elements and nodes for the 2d recharge test the cpu time needed by the standard model is about 2 3 2 5 times higher than the cpu time needed for the present model whereas the mass balance errors are satisfactory for the competing models when dealing with the 3d flow examples the cpu time needed by the standard model to achieve convergence is about 3 66 3 95 times greater than that needed by the present model to converge to the same level of accuracy on the other hand the mass balance error is very satisfactory for the present model less than 0 01 for the recharge test and less than 0 1 for test of pumping whereas for the standard model these mass balance errors are more than 5 and more than 10 for the two tests mentioned respectively it is to notice that the mass balance error provided by the two competing model are very satisfactory less than 0 001 when dealing with the totally unsaturated flow example indeed the numerical solutions obtained with the two models present and standard match very well however the cpu time needed by the standard model to converge under the same constraints is globally about 3 times greater than that needed for the present model for the hypothetical real word test the present model shows its absolute superiority when compared to the standard model also the version m1 confirms its superiority when compared to the version m2 globally with respect to cpu time the standard model takes almost 10 times and more than 5 times the cpu time needed respectively by the versions m1 and m2 of the present model to converge this clearly shows the highest efficiency of the version m1 of the present model the version m2 take about 2 times the cpu time needed to the version m1 to converge indeed regarding the mass balance analysis the versions m1 and m2 provide satisfactory mass balance 0 144 and 0 633 contrarily to the standard model which shows an excessively high mass balance error of 131 as it can be seen particularly for this real world test the version m1 of the present model shows the highest numerical efficiency to solve large and complex groundwater flow problems consequently the use of the standard model to solve groundwater flow problems may be difficult and almost prohibitive to perform more complicated and repetitive operations as the calibration for instance or to solve coupled groundwater flow and solute transport problems particularly with poor or insufficient computational resources the present model however particularly the version m1 is shown to be suitable for solving large and complex groundwater flow problems and probably to be used usefully for the anticipated related issues declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4056,since 2002 the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo have been widely used in water resources management drought monitoring and forecasting however the disrupted twsa time series due to the temporal gap i e from july 2017 to may 2018 between the two missions limits its further applications to bridge this gap we reconstruct the twsa by combining the twsa trends from the grace grace fo twsa data including the long term trend and piecewise trends with the de trended twsa of humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets for the period from april 2002 to july 2019 over australia these reconstructed data are evaluated against the twsa from grace grace fo a water balance model and three recently published reconstructed products results suggest that our reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends shows great consistency with grace grace fo comparing to other reconstructed products with a correlation coefficient r of 0 98 root mean square error rmse of 0 70 cm and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 96 the proposed reconstruction approach presented in the current study is straightforward and efficient to enable a seamless continuation of the twsa time series between the grace and grace fo missions in regional and global hydrological studies keywords time series decomposition grace grace fo reconstructed terrestrial water storage filling data gaps australian continent 1 introduction since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004a and its successor the grace follow on grace fo mission landerer et al 2020 have provided unprecedented measurements of the global mass variability in the earth system tapley et al 2004b terrestrial water storage tws variations composed of surface water canopy water soil water groundwater and snow water where appropriate rodell et al 2018 are the most critical contribution of this mass variability tapley et al 2019 therefore the grace and grace fo data have been widely used in the field of hydrology scanlon et al 2016 with a typical spatial resolution of 300 km and at an error level of 2 cm in terms of equivalent water thickness ewt for a catchment of the size 63 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 these applications include evaluation of tws variations in the context of climate variability boergens et al 2020 chen et al 2010 leblanc et al 2009 long et al 2013 reager et al 2014 tapley et al 2019 xie et al 2019a estimation of human induced groundwater depletion chen et al 2016 famiglietti 2014 feng et al 2013 ojha et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 wang et al 2018 quantification of hydrological flux castle et al 2016 liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 swenson and wahr 2006 syed et al 2005 wan et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 and improvement of hydrological models performance lo et al 2010 niu and yang 2006 scanlon et al 2018 2019 swenson and lawrence 2015 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however due to instrument issues calibration campaigns battery management and especially the launch time of the grace fo mission i e 22 may 2018 is later than the termination time of the grace mission i e 12 october 2017 the time series of tws anomalies twsa derived from grace and grace fo are intermittent that is there is a 20 month data gap in the grace observations 163 monthly solutions out of 183 possible months from april 2002 to june 2017 two month data gap in the grace fo measurements august and september 2018 from june 2018 to july 2019 and 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions from july 2017 to may 2018 these interrupted twsa time series break their applications in the continuity of hydrologic research for instance we cannot fully track the central european droughts spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in 2015 and 2018 because of several missing grace grace fo monthly observations in those years boergens et al 2020 hence it raises the question of how to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa besides the grace grace fo missions several alternative measurements and data processing techniques can be used to monitor twsa for example hydrological model simulation scanlon et al 2018 2019 basin scale water balance calculation xie et al 2019b swarm satellites observation richter et al 2021 and global navigation satellite system gnss inversion jiang et al 2021 however none of these products are able to provide an equivalent precision and or spatiotemporal sampling compared with that of grace grace fo li et al 2021 the simple linear interpolation method is typically used to fill the above mentioned data gaps rodell et al 2018 however this method is only effective for short term data gaps 1 2 months but unreliable for the long term data gaps e g the approximately one year data gap between the grace and grace fo missions sun et al 2020a by applying the classical linear or multiple linear regression mlr models to derive the relationships between the grace twsa and its predictors e g in situ river gauging data soil moisture precipitation air temperature and other climate variables the long term continuous twsa can be reconstructed becker et al 2011 de linage et al 2014 humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 humphrey et al 2017 nie et al 2015 sohoulande et al 2020 for instance humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 applied a linear regression model calibrated with the grace observations to reconstruct the global climate driven twsa from precipitation and air temperature at daily and monthly scales sohoulande et al 2020 used an mlr method on principal components model with lag signals to predict the twsa across the conterminous united states based on the grace measurements and climate variables i e precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and the number of wet days however these reconstructed twsa cannot explain the trends in grace caused by human activities due to that the generation of these data is only based on climate driven factors hence it is not feasible to directly use this reconstructed twsa to fill the grace grace fo data gaps furthermore although these regression methods are simple and easy to implement they are typically reliable only in specific regions with a linear relationship between the grace derived twsa and the independent variables jing et al 2020a recently more successful stories have been found by using the advanced machine learning ml algorithms e g artificial neural network ann autoregressive exogenous arx deep convolutional neural network cnn random forest rf seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables sarimax extreme gradient boost xgb to reconstruct the long term continuous twsa ahmed et al 2019 chen et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 forootan et al 2014 hasan et al 2019 jing et al 2020a b c li et al 2020 2021 long et al 2014 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020b xie et al 2019b yang et al 2018 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for example forootan et al 2014 reconstructed the twsa over west africa by first separating the spatial patterns from grace twsa using the independent component analysis and then applying the arx method to related predictors to model the grace temporal modes they indicated that this approach is reliable for filling the spatial and temporal gaps for up to 2 years sun et al 2019 reconstructed the grace twsa over india by applying cnn models to learn the spatial temporal mismatch patterns between the twsa from grace and the noah land surface model simulations they indicated that these methods could compensate the deficiency of the noah model on the lack of the groundwater component and then significantly improve model performance similar jing et al 2020c calibrated the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment model based on the grace data by using two ensemble learning algorithms i e rf and xgb combined with a spatially moving window structure to develop long and consistent time series of the grace like twsa in the nile river basin they pointed out that the ensemble learning approaches are an alternative way to improve the twsa estimation of hydrological models sun et al 2020b trained and compared the efficacy of three learning based models i e dnn mlr and sarimax using the grace data and forcing data i e precipitation air temperature and noah tws to predict the global twsa they found that all the three models are credible for reconstructing twsa in areas with humid and no low human impacts but vary significantly in dry and or intense human activities regions they also showed that the dnn and sarimax models outperform the mlr models in more grid cells however anthropogenic impacts were rarely considered in the above reconstructed twsa to reduce the influences of human interventions on the reconstructed twsa li et al 2020 decomposed the time series of twsa climate fields i e precipitation global land surface temperature and sea surface temperature and climate indices into trend seasonal inter annual and residual components and applied three different data driven techniques i e ann arx and mlr to generated the grace like twsa over 26 global major river basins based on the reconstruction of the seasonal inter annual and residual components of twsa separately rather than the total twsa they indicated that arx and ann approaches provide reasonable simulations of the target variables better than the mlr method but are not robust due to some overfitting problems although the advanced ml methods simulate the grace like twsa better than mlr jing et al 2020b li et al 2020 sun et al 2020b they will be less easily applicable in dry and or intense human activities regions jing et al 2020c sun et al 2020b additionally no single approach is consistently superior to other overall global regions li et al 2020 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2020b furthermore these ml algorithms are sophisticated and require a large computational cost sun et al 2020a finally the twsa agreements between these reconstructed data and their corresponding calibrated grace data are lower than those between different grace grace fo measurements e g jpl and csr mascon solutions in other words the accuracy of these reconstructed data could be further improved in this study we developed a simple and efficient method to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa which can be easily applied in hydrological studies we use the standard linear least square regression to decompose the twsa time series into trend seasonal and residual components then we combine the twsa trend derived from the grace grace fo data including the long term trend for the period of april 2002 to july 2019 and the piecewise trends respectively with the de trended twsa simulated by humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa the proposed method was applied to reconstruct the twsa over the australian continent the reconstructed twsa was compared with the grace grace fo data the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l simulation and another three reconstructed grace based products the comparison results offer experimental evidence on the high efficacy of our reconstruction approach in bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions additionally to illustrate the importance of filling these data gaps we measured the hydrological drought occurrence and severity in australia based on our reconstructed twsa 2 study area the australian continent has an area of 7 617 930 square kilometers that can be divided into 13 hydrological regions called drainage divisions fig 1 a the annual rainfall and areas of these drainage divisions is listed in table 1 as the driest inhabited continent on earth annual rainfall averaged across the whole continent is usually less than 500 mm fig 1 b the strong inter annual variability in rainfall is related to a variety of climate modes mainly including the el niño southern oscillation enso the indian ocean dipole iod and the southern annular mode sam xie et al 2019a for instance the annual precipitation dramatically increased to nearly 700 mm in 2010 2011 fig 1 b due to the combined influence of one of the largest la niña events in the past century and an extremely positive excursion of sam xie et al 2016 moreover the spatial pattern of rainfall across australia is also highly variable concentric around the extensive arid core of the continent with an average annual rainfall of less than 200 mm increase rainfall high than 1500 mm in the tropics and some coastal areas fig 1 a the australian tws variations have a significant correlation with precipitation rieser et al 2010 hence the temporal and spatial distributions of australia twsa are also multifarious xie et al 2016 this twsa pattern gives an excellent experimental area to verify the reliability of our reconstructed continuous twsa approach additionally to ensure that the verification process is objective and comprehensive we not only reconstructed the twsa across the continent but also generated the twsa in nine different drainage divisions which are labeled with pink in fig 1 a it should be noted that due to the sufficient accuracy of the grace derived twsa ranges from approximately 200 000 km2 at low latitudes to about 90 000 km2 near the poles rodell et al 2018 we did not reconstruct the twsa in the south east coast south east coast victoria south australian gulf and tasmania drainage divisions whose area are around 100 000 km2 table 1 furthermore australia experienced another severe drought in the period from 2018 to 2019 fang et al 2021 however the intermittent grace grace fo data could not fully track the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of this drought therefore it gives us a good opportunity to emphasize the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps 3 data 3 1 grace grace fo derived twsa two officially released grcae grace fo mascon solutions covering the period from april 2002 to july 2019 were used in the current study to estimate the twsa in australia that is the jet propulsion laboratory release 06 rl06 mascon solutions version 02 jpl with coastline resolution improvement filter watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 and the center for space research rl06 mascon solutions version 02 csr save et al 2016 additionally to be consistent in spatial resolution the csr data represented on 0 25 0 25 was resampled to 0 5 0 5 as the spatial resolution of jpl 3 2 humphrey and gudmundsson s twsa humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have used a linear regression model calibrated against the grace measurements to directly reconstruct the global tws variations at a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of both daily and monthly scales this reconstruction includes three basic processes model formulation model calibration and reconstructed tws variations generation in the model formulation a climate driven statistical model was formulated using precipitation and air temperature products during the model calibration the trends in grace derived tws variations are caused by climate changes and or anthropogenic activities rodell et al 2018 while the trends in climate driven tws variations are only influenced by precipitation and air temperature humphrey et al 2017 hence humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have removed the trends in tws changes in model calibration in addition humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have focused on capturing the inter annual variability correctly the seasonal cycle in tws changes was also removed therefore model calibration was conducted at each de trended and de seasonalized grace gridded tws observation individually with a monthly scale as follows 1 anom grace t β anom tws t ε where anom means de trended and de seasonalized water storage variations t represents a monthly time vector β is a calibrated scaling factor ε stands for the empirical difference between the grace derived tws variations and the climate driven tws variations including the measurement and leakage errors of grace structural model errors and meteorological forcing errors humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 tws t is the climate driven tws variations more details about the formulation of tws t can be found in the working paper of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in the last process the reconstructed tws variations tws rec were generated by combing the climate driven tws variations tws t in eq 1 with the randomly created residuals ε t 2 tws rec t β deseas tws t ε t where deseas means the seasonal cycle was removed as mentioned above it should be pointed out that the empirical errors ε in equation 1 are spatially and temporally correlated any aggregating operation should consider this error covariance but not trivial humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to provide a practical solution to this problem humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used a spatial autoregressive noise model to generate the random residuals ε which is comparable to the empirical errors ε more details about the generation of the residuals can be referenced to humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the reconstruction above does not include the seasonal cycle and human impacts since the trends in the reconstructed tws variations are from precipitation and air temperature forcings humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the seasonal cycle derived from grace data can be added to the reconstructed tws variations and represents the entire reconstructed changes such that 3 hgd tws rec grace seasonal where hgd represents the total reconstructed tws variations of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 grace seasonal means the seasonal cycle in grace derived twsa humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have offered six different reconstructed tws variations based on three different meteorological forcing datasets i e the multisource weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the global soil wetness project phase 3 gswp3 and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and two different grace mascon solutions i e jpl and goddard space flight center mascon solutions v02 4 gsfc these reconstructed tws variations can be used to evaluations of tws representation in hydrological models assessments of long term changes in the frequency of drought events as well as study sea level budget and fill the missing data between the grace and grace fo missions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in this study to facilitate a comparison with previously reconstructed data we only selected the jpl era reconstruction dataset processed by subtracting the mean from 2004 to 2009 to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa 3 3 awra l model simulated twsa the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l version 6 is a daily 0 05 5km grid based distributed water balance model operationalized by the australian bureau of meteorology for national water account and water resources assessment frost et al 2018 the awra l model provides credible estimates of soil moisture surface water and groundwater across australia van dijk et al 2011 and shows superior twsa agreement with grace than other hydrological models yang et al 2020 therefore the awra model simulated twsa can be used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstructed twsa especially for the reconstructed data during the gap between the grace and grace fo missions additionally to be consistent with the spatial and temporal resolution of the reconstructed twsa the daily awra model simulated twsa from april 2002 to july 2019 was averaged to monthly composite relative to the time mean baseline of 2004 2009 and resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 4 methodology 4 1 time series decomposition the twsa time series derived from grace grace fo and hgd can be decomposed into the following components by using the standard linear least square regression scanlon et al 2016 4 twsa total twsa trend twsa seasonal twsa residual where twsa total is the total signal twsa trend means linear trend component twsa seasonal stands for seasonal component including annual and semi annual signal twsa residual includes the un modeled trend and seasonal components and reflects the inter annual sub seasonal signal and noise 4 2 reconstruction of continuous grace grace fo twsa according to the generation process of hgd section 3 2 model calibration was conducted against the de trended and de seasonalized grace derived tws measurements i e the residual component in eq 4 at a monthly scale humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 it indicates that the continuous twsa residuals simulated by hgd could be a reasonable substitute for those derived from the grace grace fo data additionally humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 also have offered the seasonal component derived from grace that is the seasonal component in grace twsa can be replaced by the twsa seasonality in hgd furthermore although the twsa trend component can be found in hgd this trend only reflect the precipitation and air temperature and cannot explain the impacts caused by other climate variables e g sea surface temperature and climate indices li et al 2020 and anthropogenic activities humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 this deficiency could be the main reason for the twsa discrepancy between hgd and grace grace fo therefore in this study our reconstruction of continuous grace grace fo twsa was generated as follows 5 grace rec grace trend hgd total hgd trend where grace rec is our reconstructed continuous grace grace fo twsa grace trend represents the twsa trend derived from the original grace grace fo hgd total means the total twsa time series simulated by hgd and hgd trend corresponds to the twsa trend in hgd in other words the focus of our reconstructed twsa was the application of the grace grace fo born twsa trend to replace that derived from hgd in the current case we used two different trend replacement methods to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa and evaluate the performance of these reconstructed data one method was based on the long term trend from april 2002 to july 2019 that is 6 grace rec grace trend long term hgd total hgd trend long term another approach was dependent on the piecewise trends as follows 7 grace rec grace trends piecewise hgd total hgd trends piecewise the determination of the long term trend and piecewise trends are described in detail in the next section 4 3 determination of trends in twsa all twsa trends i e the long term trend and the piecewise trends were determined by the standard linear least square regression section 4 1 tested at a 95 confidence interval using the t statistic unlike the influence of the missing grace grace fo data on the calculation of the long term trend could be ignored this impact on the estimation of the short term piecewise trends might not be neglected especially for the 11 month data gap i e july 2017 to may 2018 therefore to ensure that the impact of the missing data on the calculation of the piecewise trends is negligible this calculation should be conducted in a long term period on the contrary to ensure that the piecewise trends can reflect more increasing and decreasing fluctuations in the australian twsa the estimation of the piecewise trends should be controlled in a short term period to balance this conflict the minimum interval between adjacent changepoints in trend was set as 24 months additionally these changepoints were detected by a bayesian estimator of abrupt change seasonal change and trend beast zhao et al 2019 the beast algorithm can decompose the twsa time series into three different components i e seasonality trend and changepoints and residual as follows 8 y i s t i θ s t t i θ t ε i where y is the original time series s and t are seasonal and trend signal respectively ε represents the reminder in the time series not explained by s and t signals changepoints are indirectly represented in the parameters θ s and θ t of the seasonal and trend components zhao et al 2019 more details about the beast formulation and the process of determining the changepoints in trend are referenced in texts s1 and s2 4 4 assumption validation in this study two assumptions were made that may potentially impact the calculation of the twsa trend the first assumption is that no system biases exist from the grace and grace fo measurements to verify this assumption we adopted the approach used in the research of boergens et al 2020 and landerer et al 2020 we compared the grace fo de trended and de seasonalized twsa with that from hgd which used the precipitation and air temperature as input parameters and was only calibrated with the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 if the grace fo twsa is very close to that of hgd it provides high confidence that the grace fo data record is unbiased compared with grace landerer et al 2020 the second hypothesis is that the influence of the missing data on the calculation of the piecewise trends could be negligible to prove this hypothesis first we used the values of piecewise trends from the reconstructed twsa based on long term trend rec as reference values second we removed the missing grace grace fo monthly data in rec above noted as rec nan and estimated the piecewise trends from rec nan lastly we compared these two different piecewise trends if the twsa fluctuations caused by these trend differences are much lower than the rmse value between grace grace fo and rec it implies that the influence of the missing data is not the main reason for the twsa difference between grace fo and rec and the determination method of the piecewise trends is credible 4 5 evaluation strategy since the generation of our reconstructed twsa was calibrated against the grace grace fo data the corresponding grace grace fo twsa could be used as a reference value to evaluate the performance of this reconstructed twsa humphrey et al 2017 li et al 2020 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2020b this evaluation was quantified using the following agreement metrics the pearson correlation coefficient r 1 1 at the significance level p 0 05 root mean square error rmse 0 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 11 nse 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and m i are the twsa derived from grace grace fo and the reconstructed data respectively overbar denotes the mean value i is the number of the month and n is the total number of months after removing the month in which the missing data in the grace grace fo measurements during the period from april 2002 to july 2019 i e 175 months the values of r or nse closer to 1 or lower values of rmse mean that the reconstructed data indicate better performance due to our reconstructed data was based on jpl we focused on evaluating the twsa agreement between the reconstructed data and jpl additionally for ease of evaluation the twsa agreement between jpl and csr was used as a standard value to assess whether the performance of the reconstructed twsa meets our reconstruction requirement that is if the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data is similar or even better than that between jpl and csr it means that our reconstructed approach could be a good alternative method to filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo solutions it should be pointed out that the performance of the reconstructed data was impacted by multiple sources of error which mainly includes the uncertainties in grace data the errors in forcing data and the parameter tuning errors sun et al 2020b hence not all twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data is better than that between jpl and csr the evaluation method above is commonly used but cannot be conducted in the nearly one year data gap between the grace and grace fo observations additionally validation of the reconstructed twsa with independent in situ measurements is challenging due to the integral nature of the satellite gravimetric measurements landerer et al 2020 alternatively the state of the art awra model simulated twsa could be used as available evaluation data it should be noted that the awra model tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude and trend in twsa relative to grace over australia van dijk et al 2011 as well as the influence of the missing data on the estimation of seasonality and trend in twsa can be negligible hence we focused on using the awra model to evaluate the performance of the de trended and de seasonalized reconstructed twsa during the 11 month gap we acknowledge that the awra model simulations might also underestimate the de trended and de seasonalized twsa compared to grace however we quantified and compared the differences in de trended and de seasonalized twsa between the reconstructed data and model simulations at each time step if the rmse value between the reconstructed data and awra models in the data gaps are consistent with the rmse values of adjacent 11 month it indicates that the reconstructed data in these data gaps are reliable 5 results and discussion 5 1 evaluation of the performance of humphrey and gudmundsson s twsa before reconstructing our continuous twsa we evaluated the performance of hgd with the jpl data from april 2002 to july 2019 as shown in fig 2 hgd expresses reasonable spatial agreement in twsa with jpl in australia with the median values of r rmse and nse are 0 83 2 79 cm and 0 55 respectively this reasonable agreement is expected because the generation of hgd was calibrated against the de trended and de seasonalized grace measurements and the twsa seasonality simulated by hgd was derived from the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 however the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of this agreement is lower than that between jpl and csr fig 2 c f and i in other words the performance of hgd cannot satisfy our reconstruction requirement therefore it is not feasible to directly use the continuous hgd simulated twsa to fill the data gaps between the grace and grace fo data as shown in fig 3 after removing the long term trend in twsa the ecdf of the agreement in de trended twsa between jpl and hgd the median values of r rmse nse are 0 86 2 14 cm and 0 73 respectively is very close to that between jpl and csr the median values of r rmse nse are 0 88 2 06 cm and 0 73 respectively it indicates that the consecutive de trended twsa simulated by hgd could be a reasonable alternative to the interrupted de trended twsa derived from grace grace fo additionally the similar agreement in de trended twsa also means that the twsa trend is the main reason for degrading the performance of hgd according to the definition of hgd we can find that the generation of twsa in hgd was only influenced by precipitation and air temperature humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 whereas changes in other climate variables and human activities also impact the trends in grace grace fo twsa rodell et al 2018 such discrepancies result in the underestimation of hgd twsa trends fig 4 in australia particularly in the north and northwest for instance grace grace fo shows obvious wetting trends in the north whereas hgd indicates opposite drying trends 5 2 reconstruction of continuous twsa based on long term trend based on the analysis in section 5 1 our reconstruction method took advantage of the good agreement in the de trended twsa between hgd and grace grace fo and focused on how to use the grace grace fo derived twsa trend to replace that from hgd in this study we used two different methods of trend replacement i e the long term trend from april 2002 to july 2019 and the piecewise trends to reconstruct the continuous twsa and evaluate whether the performance of these reconstructed data can satisfy our reconstruction requirement i e the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data should similar or even better than that between jpl and csr fig 5 illustrates the process of the reconstructed twsa dependent on the long term trend in australia these reconstructed data are closer to jpl than hgd table 2 however the twsa agreement between jpl and this reconstructed data r 0 96 rmse 1 01 cm and nse 0 91 is still less than that between jpl and csr r 0 98 rmse 0 76 cm and nse 0 95 this underestimation could be caused by the uncertainty in the long term trend and the model calibration error of hgd in equation 2 in other words the performance of the reconstructed twsa based on the long term trend does not meet our reconstruction requirement it should be pointed out that the potential bias between the grace and grace fo missions might affect the reliability of the long term twsa trend above as shown in fig s2 although the generation of hgd was only calibrated with the de trended and de seasonalized grace data from april 2002 to june 2017 humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the de trended and de seasonalized grace fo twsa is very close to that from hgd over the period june 2018 to july 2019 this gives us high confidence that no grace grace fo bias exists and the data between the two missions are continuous similar verifications were conducted in the research of boergens et al 2020 and landerer et al 2020 who also demonstrated that no system offset between the grace and grace fo measurements and the grace fo mission continues the grace record with an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling therefore the long term trend based on the grace and grace fo data is reliable 5 3 reconstruction of continuous twsa based on piecewise trends fig 6 shows that the procedure of the reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends which were segmented by the changepoints in the twsa trend from hgd the detailed determination process of these changepoints can be found in text s2 the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends are closer to jpl than the reconstructed data dependent on the long term trend table 2 additionally the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends r 0 98 rmse 0 70 cm and nse 0 96 is even slightly better than that between jpl and csr r 0 98 rmse 0 76 cm and nse 0 95 in other words the reconstructed method based on the piecewise trends not only reserves the twsa trend in grace grace fo but also reduces the influences of the uncertainty in twsa trend and the error of model calibration in hgd on the performance of this reconstructed data therefore the performance of the reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends satisfies our reconstruction requirement and this reconstructed approach could be an alternative to filling the data gaps in the grace grace fo data similar to the long term trend the continuity between the grace and grace fo data ensures that the estimated piecewise trends are not impacted by the potential bias between the two satellite missions furthermore as shown in fig 7 a the twsa piecewise trends from rec based on the long term trend are very close to those from rec nan although the missing data results in a max trend difference of 0 37 cm year in period 6 october 2013 to august 2016 this difference only causes a maximum twsa fluctuation of 0 66 cm which is lower than the rmse value 1 01 cm table 2 between the reconstructed data and jpl therefore the influences of the missing data on the calculation of piecewise trends can be negligible and the calculation method of our piecewise trends is reliable moreover the state of the art awra model simulated twsa is used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstructed data in the data gaps as shown in fig 8 compared to the awra model simulation the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends indicate similar de trended and de seasonalized twsa during the 11 month data gap the corresponding rmse value is only 0 64 cm very close to its neighbors rmse values i e 1 05 cm and 0 66 cm during the green and yellow shading areas in fig 8 respectively therefore our reconstructed data in the data gaps show an equivalent precision with other data to underline the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps we observed the hydrological drought in australia using grace based tws deficits the tws deficits were defined as the negative residuals after subtracting the grace climatology from the grace twsa time series thomas et al 2014 a hydrological drought event is designated as any instance where the tws deficits last three or more consecutive months thomas et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 based on our reconstructed tws deficits we observed five hydrological drought events in australia from april 2002 to july 2019 the quantification of these droughts occurrence and severity is referred to in table s1 additionally we found that the last drought event occurs in april 2018 and lasted until july 2019 in other words the grace grace fo data cannot be used to analyze the australian drought in april and may 2018 therefore to fully track the spatiotemporal evolution of the drought in australia in 2018 2019 bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions is necessary it should be pointed out that this study focused on how to fill the grace grace fo data gaps the characterization and reason of these hydrological drought events are beyond the scope of our study and these issues will be discussed in the following research 5 4 reconstruction of continuous twsa in nine australian drainage divisions to evaluate the universality of our proposed approach for reconstructing the continuous grace grace fo twsa we also reconstructed the twsa in nine hydrological regions over australia these hydrological regions have different areas and average annual rainfall table 1 which resulted in different tws changes fig 10 additionally besides climate changes the twsa trends in some regions were also influenced by other uncertain factors for instance the declining twsa trend in the northwest plateau fig 4 has been primarily caused by natural variability but the influence of human mining activities is also possibly contributed rodell et al 2018 therefore the tws changes in these hydrological regions are good representatives of the twsa in other world regions as shown in fig 10 the twsa simulated by hgd in nine hydrological regions indicates similar changes with those derived from jpl and csr however besides in south west coast swc the twsa agreements between hgd and jpl in all hydrological regions are lower than those between jpl and csr fig 11 therefore the performance of hgd does not meet the requirement of our reconstruction requirement in these regions it is interesting to note that the twsa agreement between jpl and csr over swc is lower than that between hgd and jpl fig 11 which can be related to the fact that the 3 spatial resolution of grace is insufficient for monitoring the weaker twsa changes in the smaller regions scanlon et al 2016 for swc its area is only 326 000 km2 table 1 and its twsa magnitude is smaller than 5 cm fig 10 i in other words the continuous twsa simulated by hgd can directly be used to fill the data gaps between the grace grace fo data in swc based on the reconstruction approach presented in the present study we reconstructed the continuous twsa in nine hydrological regions based on the long term trend and piecewise trends respectively fig 10 as illustrated in fig 11 the reconstructed data based on the long term trend indicate a closer twsa agreement with jpl than hgd however except for north east coast nec and swc the twsa agreements between these reconstructed data and jpl are lower than those between jpl and csr in other drainage divisions by comparison the reconstructed data depended on the piecewise trends show similar or even higher twsa agreement with jpl than csr in all drainage divisions fig 11 additionally the influence of the missing data on calculating the piecewise trends in these nine divisions can also be ignored figs s3 s11 and the twsa differences between these rec data and the awra model in the data gaps are consistent with the adjacent data fig s12 therefore the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends meet the performance of our reconstruction requirement and can be applied to bridge the data gaps between the grace and grace fo solutions in these nine australian drainage divisions obviously our reconstruction method is universal and effective 5 5 uncertainty of the reconstruction twsa according to our reconstruction process eq 7 the uncertainties of the reconstructed data are mainly caused by the measurement and leakage errors in the grace grace fo data the calibration errors in hgd and the uncertainties in estimating twsa trends however the estimation of these errors is not trivial considering that the data continuity between grace and grace fo boergens et al 2020 landerer et al 2020 and the calibration of hgd was only based on the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the grace fo observation provides a straightforward and unique measurement to estimate the uncertainties of the reconstructed twsa li et al 2021 similar to the evaluation metric used in li et al 2021 we applied the rmse between the reconstructed data and grace fo measurements as the criterion for the uncertainty estimates table 3 summarizes the uncertainties of our reconstructed twsa in australia and its nine drainage divisions in general these uncertainties are limited within a reasonable error range 0 34 1 39 cm and lower than the rmse values between jpl and csr table s2 therefore our reconstruction method presents a reliable alternative for filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions 5 6 comparison with previous studies besides humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 sun et al 2020b and li et al 2021 also have provided publicly accessible reconstructed twsa referred to as hgd sun and li respectively which are related to the australian environment unlike hgd which was applied a linear regression model calibrated with the grace measurements to reconstruct the global climate driven twsa sun and li were trained ml methods using the grace data and climate forcing data to generate the reconstructed data additionally the generation of hgd sun and li compared in the current study were conducted with different grace mascon solutions and periods i e hgd was generated with jpl from april 2002 to july 2019 sun was produced with jpl for the period from april 2002 to august 2018 and li was created with csr over the period april 2002 to june 2020 therefore we compared the twsa agreement between these reconstructed data and the corresponding grace data for the same periods figs 12 and 14 to keep consistent with the generation of li was calibrated by csr we took advantage of the agreements in de trended twsa between csr and hgd similar to those between jpl and hgd fig 6 b s13 and s14 and used the de trended hgd and the piecewise trends of csr to generate the reconstructed data it should be noted that the generation of these reconstructed data was not rigorous but this simple replacement already satisfies our comparison requirements furthermore hgd was compared in sections 5 1 hence we focused on comparing sun and li in this section as shown in fig 12 although the generation of sun was based on the advanced and complex ml methods it shows lower twsa agreements with jpl than our reconstructed data in australia and its nine hydrological regions fig 13 this underestimation is mainly caused by sun underestimates the grace grace fo derived twsa trends sun et al 2020b on the contrary our reconstructed data ultimately reserve the grace derived trends in other words our reconstructed data indicate better performance than sun compared with sun the generation of li is also used the ml approach but it shows closer twsa agreement with the grace grace fo data fig 14 this improvement is mainly attributed to li retaining all grace grace fo born trends li et al 2021 however our reconstructed data also demonstrate higher twsa agreement with csr than li in all compared regions except plibara gasconyne pg and south west coast swc fig 13 which have low signal to noise ratios fig 14 i g therefore our reconstructed method not only retain the grace grace fo derived trends but also limits the error in the generation process of the reconstructed data 6 conclusions filling the data gaps is the first question to be solved when the grace and grace fo observations are used to monitor tws changes for hydrological applications continuously in the current study we present a simple and robust method based on time series decomposition to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa that is we used the least squares to decompose the twsa time series into the trend seasonality and residual components then we verified the data continuity between the grace and grace fo missions and the de trended twsa consistency between the grace grace fo solutions and humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets hgd eventually we combined the twsa trends derived from grace grace fo including the long term trend and piecewise trends respectively with the de trended twsa simulated by hgd to reconstruct the continuous twsa this reconstruction approach is systematically assessed over the australian continent and its nine drainage divisions using various evaluation metrics the comparison result indicates that the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends indicate excellent twsa agreement with the grace grace fo solutions and outperforms previous researches additionally we observed the hydrology drought event in australia during the 11 month gap based on our reconstructed twsa this demonstrates the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps in general our reconstructed approach can be a good alternative to filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions compared to the multiple linear regression methods or the machine learning techniques for reconstructing continuous twsa major strengths of our presented approach include 1 the implementation is straightforward and reliable with high accuracy and efficiency 2 the capability to retain the impacts of climate changes and human activities on twsa and reasonably limit the error in the generation process of the reconstructed data due to our reconstruction approach is based on the grace derived twsa trend hence this method does not hindcast or predict twsa however it presents an alternative for bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions this reconstruction method could also have potential

4056,since 2002 the terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo have been widely used in water resources management drought monitoring and forecasting however the disrupted twsa time series due to the temporal gap i e from july 2017 to may 2018 between the two missions limits its further applications to bridge this gap we reconstruct the twsa by combining the twsa trends from the grace grace fo twsa data including the long term trend and piecewise trends with the de trended twsa of humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets for the period from april 2002 to july 2019 over australia these reconstructed data are evaluated against the twsa from grace grace fo a water balance model and three recently published reconstructed products results suggest that our reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends shows great consistency with grace grace fo comparing to other reconstructed products with a correlation coefficient r of 0 98 root mean square error rmse of 0 70 cm and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 96 the proposed reconstruction approach presented in the current study is straightforward and efficient to enable a seamless continuation of the twsa time series between the grace and grace fo missions in regional and global hydrological studies keywords time series decomposition grace grace fo reconstructed terrestrial water storage filling data gaps australian continent 1 introduction since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission tapley et al 2004a and its successor the grace follow on grace fo mission landerer et al 2020 have provided unprecedented measurements of the global mass variability in the earth system tapley et al 2004b terrestrial water storage tws variations composed of surface water canopy water soil water groundwater and snow water where appropriate rodell et al 2018 are the most critical contribution of this mass variability tapley et al 2019 therefore the grace and grace fo data have been widely used in the field of hydrology scanlon et al 2016 with a typical spatial resolution of 300 km and at an error level of 2 cm in terms of equivalent water thickness ewt for a catchment of the size 63 000 km2 vishwakarma et al 2018 these applications include evaluation of tws variations in the context of climate variability boergens et al 2020 chen et al 2010 leblanc et al 2009 long et al 2013 reager et al 2014 tapley et al 2019 xie et al 2019a estimation of human induced groundwater depletion chen et al 2016 famiglietti 2014 feng et al 2013 ojha et al 2019 rodell et al 2009 wang et al 2018 quantification of hydrological flux castle et al 2016 liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 rodell et al 2004 swenson

lawrence 2015 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however due to instrument issues calibration campaigns battery management and especially the launch time of the grace fo mission i e 22 may 2018 is later than the termination time of the grace mission i e 12 october 2017 the time series of tws anomalies twsa derived from grace and grace fo are intermittent that is there is a 20 month data gap in the grace observations 163 monthly solutions out of 183 possible months from april 2002 to june 2017 two month data gap in the grace fo measurements august and september 2018 from june 2018 to july 2019 and 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions from july 2017 to may 2018 these interrupted twsa time series break their applications in the continuity of hydrologic research for instance we cannot fully track the central european droughts spatial and temporal evolution characteristics in 2015 and 2018 because of several missing grace grace fo monthly observations in those years boergens et al 2020 hence it raises the question of how to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa besides the grace grace fo missions several alternative measurements and data processing techniques can be used to monitor twsa for example hydrological model simulation scanlon et al 2018 2019 basin scale water balance calculation xie et al 2019b swarm satellites observation richter et al 2021 and global navigation satellite system gnss inversion jiang et al 2021 however none of these products are able to provide an equivalent precision and or spatiotemporal sampling compared with that of grace grace fo li et al 2021 the simple linear interpolation method is typically used to fill the above mentioned data gaps rodell et al 2018 however this method is only effective for short term data gaps 1 2 months but unreliable for the long term data gaps e g the approximately one year data gap between the grace and grace fo missions sun et al 2020a by applying the classical linear or multiple linear regression mlr models to derive the relationships between the grace twsa and its predictors e g in situ river gauging data soil moisture precipitation air temperature and other climate variables the long term continuous twsa can be reconstructed becker et al 2011 de linage et al 2014 humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 humphrey et al 2017 nie et al 2015 sohoulande et al 2020 for instance humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 applied a linear regression model calibrated with the grace observations to reconstruct the global climate driven twsa from precipitation and air temperature at daily and monthly scales sohoulande et al 2020 used an mlr method on principal components model with lag signals to predict the twsa across the conterminous united states based on the grace measurements and climate variables i e precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and the number of wet days however these reconstructed twsa cannot explain the trends in grace caused by human activities due to that the generation of these data is only based on climate driven factors hence it is not feasible to directly use this reconstructed twsa to fill the grace grace fo data gaps furthermore although these regression methods are simple and easy to implement they are typically reliable only in specific regions with a linear relationship between the grace derived twsa and the independent variables jing et al 2020a recently more successful stories have been found by using the advanced machine learning ml algorithms e g artificial neural network ann autoregressive exogenous arx deep convolutional neural network cnn random forest rf seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables sarimax extreme gradient boost xgb to reconstruct the long term continuous twsa ahmed et al 2019 chen et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 forootan et al 2014 hasan et al 2019 jing et al 2020a b c li et al 2020 2021 long et al 2014 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020b xie et al 2019b yang et al 2018 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 for example forootan et al 2014 reconstructed the twsa over west africa by first separating the spatial patterns from grace twsa using the independent component analysis and then applying the arx method to related predictors to model the grace temporal modes they indicated that this approach is reliable for filling the spatial and temporal gaps for up to 2 years sun et al 2019 reconstructed the grace twsa over india by applying cnn models to learn the spatial temporal mismatch patterns between the twsa from grace and the noah land surface model simulations they indicated that these methods could compensate the deficiency of the noah model on the lack of the groundwater component and then significantly improve model performance similar jing et al 2020c calibrated the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment model based on the grace data by using two ensemble learning algorithms i e rf and xgb combined with a spatially moving window structure to develop long and consistent time series of the grace like twsa in the nile river basin they pointed out that the ensemble learning approaches are an alternative way to improve the twsa estimation of hydrological models sun et al 2020b trained and compared the efficacy of three learning based models i e dnn mlr and sarimax using the grace data and forcing data i e precipitation air temperature and noah tws to predict the global twsa they found that all the three models are credible for reconstructing twsa in areas with humid and no low human impacts but vary significantly in dry and or intense human activities regions they also showed that the dnn and sarimax models outperform the mlr models in more grid cells however anthropogenic impacts were rarely considered in the above reconstructed twsa to reduce the influences of human interventions on the reconstructed twsa li et al 2020 decomposed the time series of twsa climate fields i e precipitation global land surface temperature and sea surface temperature and climate indices into trend seasonal inter annual and residual components and applied three different data driven techniques i e ann arx and mlr to generated the grace like twsa over 26 global major river basins based on the reconstruction of the seasonal inter annual and residual components of twsa separately rather than the total twsa they indicated that arx and ann approaches provide reasonable simulations of the target variables better than the mlr method but are not robust due to some overfitting problems although the advanced ml methods simulate the grace like twsa better than mlr jing et al 2020b li et al 2020 sun et al 2020b they will be less easily applicable in dry and or intense human activities regions jing et al 2020c sun et al 2020b additionally no single approach is consistently superior to other overall global regions li et al 2020 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2020b furthermore these ml algorithms are sophisticated and require a large computational cost sun et al 2020a finally the twsa agreements between these reconstructed data and their corresponding calibrated grace data are lower than those between different grace grace fo measurements e g jpl and csr mascon solutions in other words the accuracy of these reconstructed data could be further improved in this study we developed a simple and efficient method to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa which can be easily applied in hydrological studies we use the standard linear least square regression to decompose the twsa time series into trend seasonal and residual components then we combine the twsa trend derived from the grace grace fo data including the long term trend for the period of april 2002 to july 2019 and the piecewise trends respectively with the de trended twsa simulated by humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa the proposed method was applied to reconstruct the twsa over the australian continent the reconstructed twsa was compared with the grace grace fo data the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l simulation and another three reconstructed grace based products the comparison results offer experimental evidence on the high efficacy of our reconstruction approach in bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions additionally to illustrate the importance of filling these data gaps we measured the hydrological drought occurrence and severity in australia based on our reconstructed twsa 2 study area the australian continent has an area of 7 617 930 square kilometers that can be divided into 13 hydrological regions called drainage divisions fig 1 a the annual rainfall and areas of these drainage divisions is listed in table 1 as the driest inhabited continent on earth annual rainfall averaged across the whole continent is usually less than 500 mm fig 1 b the strong inter annual variability in rainfall is related to a variety of climate modes mainly including the el niño southern oscillation enso the indian ocean dipole iod and the southern annular mode sam xie et al 2019a for instance the annual precipitation dramatically increased to nearly 700 mm in 2010 2011 fig 1 b due to the combined influence of one of the largest la niña events in the past century and an extremely positive excursion of sam xie et al 2016 moreover the spatial pattern of rainfall across australia is also highly variable concentric around the extensive arid core of the continent with an average annual rainfall of less than 200 mm increase rainfall high than 1500 mm in the tropics and some coastal areas fig 1 a the australian tws variations have a significant correlation with precipitation rieser et al 2010 hence the temporal and spatial distributions of australia twsa are also multifarious xie et al 2016 this twsa pattern gives an excellent experimental area to verify the reliability of our reconstructed continuous twsa approach additionally to ensure that the verification process is objective and comprehensive we not only reconstructed the twsa across the continent but also generated the twsa in nine different drainage divisions which are labeled with pink in fig 1 a it should be noted that due to the sufficient accuracy of the grace derived twsa ranges from approximately 200 000 km2 at low latitudes to about 90 000 km2 near the poles rodell et al 2018 we did not reconstruct the twsa in the south east coast south east coast victoria south australian gulf and tasmania drainage divisions whose area are around 100 000 km2 table 1 furthermore australia experienced another severe drought in the period from 2018 to 2019 fang et al 2021 however the intermittent grace grace fo data could not fully track the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of this drought therefore it gives us a good opportunity to emphasize the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps 3 data 3 1 grace grace fo derived twsa two officially released grcae grace fo mascon solutions covering the period from april 2002 to july 2019 were used in the current study to estimate the twsa in australia that is the jet propulsion laboratory release 06 rl06 mascon solutions version 02 jpl with coastline resolution improvement filter watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 and the center for space research rl06 mascon solutions version 02 csr save et al 2016 additionally to be consistent in spatial resolution the csr data represented on 0 25 0 25 was resampled to 0 5 0 5 as the spatial resolution of jpl 3 2 humphrey and gudmundsson s twsa humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have used a linear regression model calibrated against the grace measurements to directly reconstruct the global tws variations at a spatial resolution of 0 5 and a temporal resolution of both daily and monthly scales this reconstruction includes three basic processes model formulation model calibration and reconstructed tws variations generation in the model formulation a climate driven statistical model was formulated using precipitation and air temperature products during the model calibration the trends in grace derived tws variations are caused by climate changes and or anthropogenic activities rodell et al 2018 while the trends in climate driven tws variations are only influenced by precipitation and air temperature humphrey et al 2017 hence humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have removed the trends in tws changes in model calibration in addition humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have focused on capturing the inter annual variability correctly the seasonal cycle in tws changes was also removed therefore model calibration was conducted at each de trended and de seasonalized grace gridded tws observation individually with a monthly scale as follows 1 anom grace t β anom tws t ε where anom means de trended and de seasonalized water storage variations t represents a monthly time vector β is a calibrated scaling factor ε stands for the empirical difference between the grace derived tws variations and the climate driven tws variations including the measurement and leakage errors of grace structural model errors and meteorological forcing errors humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 tws t is the climate driven tws variations more details about the formulation of tws t can be found in the working paper of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in the last process the reconstructed tws variations tws rec were generated by combing the climate driven tws variations tws t in eq 1 with the randomly created residuals ε t 2 tws rec t β deseas tws t ε t where deseas means the seasonal cycle was removed as mentioned above it should be pointed out that the empirical errors ε in equation 1 are spatially and temporally correlated any aggregating operation should consider this error covariance but not trivial humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 to provide a practical solution to this problem humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 used a spatial autoregressive noise model to generate the random residuals ε which is comparable to the empirical errors ε more details about the generation of the residuals can be referenced to humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the reconstruction above does not include the seasonal cycle and human impacts since the trends in the reconstructed tws variations are from precipitation and air temperature forcings humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the seasonal cycle derived from grace data can be added to the reconstructed tws variations and represents the entire reconstructed changes such that 3 hgd tws rec grace seasonal where hgd represents the total reconstructed tws variations of humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 grace seasonal means the seasonal cycle in grace derived twsa humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 have offered six different reconstructed tws variations based on three different meteorological forcing datasets i e the multisource weighted ensemble precipitation mswep the global soil wetness project phase 3 gswp3 and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and two different grace mascon solutions i e jpl and goddard space flight center mascon solutions v02 4 gsfc these reconstructed tws variations can be used to evaluations of tws representation in hydrological models assessments of long term changes in the frequency of drought events as well as study sea level budget and fill the missing data between the grace and grace fo missions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 in this study to facilitate a comparison with previously reconstructed data we only selected the jpl era reconstruction dataset processed by subtracting the mean from 2004 to 2009 to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa 3 3 awra l model simulated twsa the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l version 6 is a daily 0 05 5km grid based distributed water balance model operationalized by the australian bureau of meteorology for national water account and water resources assessment frost et al 2018 the awra l model provides credible estimates of soil moisture surface water and groundwater across australia van dijk et al 2011 and shows superior twsa agreement with grace than other hydrological models yang et al 2020 therefore the awra model simulated twsa can be used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstructed twsa especially for the reconstructed data during the gap between the grace and grace fo missions additionally to be consistent with the spatial and temporal resolution of the reconstructed twsa the daily awra model simulated twsa from april 2002 to july 2019 was averaged to monthly composite relative to the time mean baseline of 2004 2009 and resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 4 methodology 4 1 time series decomposition the twsa time series derived from grace grace fo and hgd can be decomposed into the following components by using the standard linear least square regression scanlon et al 2016 4 twsa total twsa trend twsa seasonal twsa residual where twsa total is the total signal twsa trend means linear trend component twsa seasonal stands for seasonal component including annual and semi annual signal twsa residual includes the un modeled trend and seasonal components and reflects the inter annual sub seasonal signal and noise 4 2 reconstruction of continuous grace grace fo twsa according to the generation process of hgd section 3 2 model calibration was conducted against the de trended and de seasonalized grace derived tws measurements i e the residual component in eq 4 at a monthly scale humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 it indicates that the continuous twsa residuals simulated by hgd could be a reasonable substitute for those derived from the grace grace fo data additionally humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 also have offered the seasonal component derived from grace that is the seasonal component in grace twsa can be replaced by the twsa seasonality in hgd furthermore although the twsa trend component can be found in hgd this trend only reflect the precipitation and air temperature and cannot explain the impacts caused by other climate variables e g sea surface temperature and climate indices li et al 2020 and anthropogenic activities humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 this deficiency could be the main reason for the twsa discrepancy between hgd and grace grace fo therefore in this study our reconstruction of continuous grace grace fo twsa was generated as follows 5 grace rec grace trend hgd total hgd trend where grace rec is our reconstructed continuous grace grace fo twsa grace trend represents the twsa trend derived from the original grace grace fo hgd total means the total twsa time series simulated by hgd and hgd trend corresponds to the twsa trend in hgd in other words the focus of our reconstructed twsa was the application of the grace grace fo born twsa trend to replace that derived from hgd in the current case we used two different trend replacement methods to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa and evaluate the performance of these reconstructed data one method was based on the long term trend from april 2002 to july 2019 that is 6 grace rec grace trend long term hgd total hgd trend long term another approach was dependent on the piecewise trends as follows 7 grace rec grace trends piecewise hgd total hgd trends piecewise the determination of the long term trend and piecewise trends are described in detail in the next section 4 3 determination of trends in twsa all twsa trends i e the long term trend and the piecewise trends were determined by the standard linear least square regression section 4 1 tested at a 95 confidence interval using the t statistic unlike the influence of the missing grace grace fo data on the calculation of the long term trend could be ignored this impact on the estimation of the short term piecewise trends might not be neglected especially for the 11 month data gap i e july 2017 to may 2018 therefore to ensure that the impact of the missing data on the calculation of the piecewise trends is negligible this calculation should be conducted in a long term period on the contrary to ensure that the piecewise trends can reflect more increasing and decreasing fluctuations in the australian twsa the estimation of the piecewise trends should be controlled in a short term period to balance this conflict the minimum interval between adjacent changepoints in trend was set as 24 months additionally these changepoints were detected by a bayesian estimator of abrupt change seasonal change and trend beast zhao et al 2019 the beast algorithm can decompose the twsa time series into three different components i e seasonality trend and changepoints and residual as follows 8 y i s t i θ s t t i θ t ε i where y is the original time series s and t are seasonal and trend signal respectively ε represents the reminder in the time series not explained by s and t signals changepoints are indirectly represented in the parameters θ s and θ t of the seasonal and trend components zhao et al 2019 more details about the beast formulation and the process of determining the changepoints in trend are referenced in texts s1 and s2 4 4 assumption validation in this study two assumptions were made that may potentially impact the calculation of the twsa trend the first assumption is that no system biases exist from the grace and grace fo measurements to verify this assumption we adopted the approach used in the research of boergens et al 2020 and landerer et al 2020 we compared the grace fo de trended and de seasonalized twsa with that from hgd which used the precipitation and air temperature as input parameters and was only calibrated with the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 if the grace fo twsa is very close to that of hgd it provides high confidence that the grace fo data record is unbiased compared with grace landerer et al 2020 the second hypothesis is that the influence of the missing data on the calculation of the piecewise trends could be negligible to prove this hypothesis first we used the values of piecewise trends from the reconstructed twsa based on long term trend rec as reference values second we removed the missing grace grace fo monthly data in rec above noted as rec nan and estimated the piecewise trends from rec nan lastly we compared these two different piecewise trends if the twsa fluctuations caused by these trend differences are much lower than the rmse value between grace grace fo and rec it implies that the influence of the missing data is not the main reason for the twsa difference between grace fo and rec and the determination method of the piecewise trends is credible 4 5 evaluation strategy since the generation of our reconstructed twsa was calibrated against the grace grace fo data the corresponding grace grace fo twsa could be used as a reference value to evaluate the performance of this reconstructed twsa humphrey et al 2017 li et al 2020 sun et al 2020a sun et al 2020b this evaluation was quantified using the following agreement metrics the pearson correlation coefficient r 1 1 at the significance level p 0 05 root mean square error rmse 0 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 9 r i 1 n o i o m i m i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n m i m 2 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i m i 2 11 nse 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o i and m i are the twsa derived from grace grace fo and the reconstructed data respectively overbar denotes the mean value i is the number of the month and n is the total number of months after removing the month in which the missing data in the grace grace fo measurements during the period from april 2002 to july 2019 i e 175 months the values of r or nse closer to 1 or lower values of rmse mean that the reconstructed data indicate better performance due to our reconstructed data was based on jpl we focused on evaluating the twsa agreement between the reconstructed data and jpl additionally for ease of evaluation the twsa agreement between jpl and csr was used as a standard value to assess whether the performance of the reconstructed twsa meets our reconstruction requirement that is if the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data is similar or even better than that between jpl and csr it means that our reconstructed approach could be a good alternative method to filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo solutions it should be pointed out that the performance of the reconstructed data was impacted by multiple sources of error which mainly includes the uncertainties in grace data the errors in forcing data and the parameter tuning errors sun et al 2020b hence not all twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data is better than that between jpl and csr the evaluation method above is commonly used but cannot be conducted in the nearly one year data gap between the grace and grace fo observations additionally validation of the reconstructed twsa with independent in situ measurements is challenging due to the integral nature of the satellite gravimetric measurements landerer et al 2020 alternatively the state of the art awra model simulated twsa could be used as available evaluation data it should be noted that the awra model tends to underestimate the seasonal amplitude and trend in twsa relative to grace over australia van dijk et al 2011 as well as the influence of the missing data on the estimation of seasonality and trend in twsa can be negligible hence we focused on using the awra model to evaluate the performance of the de trended and de seasonalized reconstructed twsa during the 11 month gap we acknowledge that the awra model simulations might also underestimate the de trended and de seasonalized twsa compared to grace however we quantified and compared the differences in de trended and de seasonalized twsa between the reconstructed data and model simulations at each time step if the rmse value between the reconstructed data and awra models in the data gaps are consistent with the rmse values of adjacent 11 month it indicates that the reconstructed data in these data gaps are reliable 5 results and discussion 5 1 evaluation of the performance of humphrey and gudmundsson s twsa before reconstructing our continuous twsa we evaluated the performance of hgd with the jpl data from april 2002 to july 2019 as shown in fig 2 hgd expresses reasonable spatial agreement in twsa with jpl in australia with the median values of r rmse and nse are 0 83 2 79 cm and 0 55 respectively this reasonable agreement is expected because the generation of hgd was calibrated against the de trended and de seasonalized grace measurements and the twsa seasonality simulated by hgd was derived from the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 however the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of this agreement is lower than that between jpl and csr fig 2 c f and i in other words the performance of hgd cannot satisfy our reconstruction requirement therefore it is not feasible to directly use the continuous hgd simulated twsa to fill the data gaps between the grace and grace fo data as shown in fig 3 after removing the long term trend in twsa the ecdf of the agreement in de trended twsa between jpl and hgd the median values of r rmse nse are 0 86 2 14 cm and 0 73 respectively is very close to that between jpl and csr the median values of r rmse nse are 0 88 2 06 cm and 0 73 respectively it indicates that the consecutive de trended twsa simulated by hgd could be a reasonable alternative to the interrupted de trended twsa derived from grace grace fo additionally the similar agreement in de trended twsa also means that the twsa trend is the main reason for degrading the performance of hgd according to the definition of hgd we can find that the generation of twsa in hgd was only influenced by precipitation and air temperature humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 whereas changes in other climate variables and human activities also impact the trends in grace grace fo twsa rodell et al 2018 such discrepancies result in the underestimation of hgd twsa trends fig 4 in australia particularly in the north and northwest for instance grace grace fo shows obvious wetting trends in the north whereas hgd indicates opposite drying trends 5 2 reconstruction of continuous twsa based on long term trend based on the analysis in section 5 1 our reconstruction method took advantage of the good agreement in the de trended twsa between hgd and grace grace fo and focused on how to use the grace grace fo derived twsa trend to replace that from hgd in this study we used two different methods of trend replacement i e the long term trend from april 2002 to july 2019 and the piecewise trends to reconstruct the continuous twsa and evaluate whether the performance of these reconstructed data can satisfy our reconstruction requirement i e the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data should similar or even better than that between jpl and csr fig 5 illustrates the process of the reconstructed twsa dependent on the long term trend in australia these reconstructed data are closer to jpl than hgd table 2 however the twsa agreement between jpl and this reconstructed data r 0 96 rmse 1 01 cm and nse 0 91 is still less than that between jpl and csr r 0 98 rmse 0 76 cm and nse 0 95 this underestimation could be caused by the uncertainty in the long term trend and the model calibration error of hgd in equation 2 in other words the performance of the reconstructed twsa based on the long term trend does not meet our reconstruction requirement it should be pointed out that the potential bias between the grace and grace fo missions might affect the reliability of the long term twsa trend above as shown in fig s2 although the generation of hgd was only calibrated with the de trended and de seasonalized grace data from april 2002 to june 2017 humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the de trended and de seasonalized grace fo twsa is very close to that from hgd over the period june 2018 to july 2019 this gives us high confidence that no grace grace fo bias exists and the data between the two missions are continuous similar verifications were conducted in the research of boergens et al 2020 and landerer et al 2020 who also demonstrated that no system offset between the grace and grace fo measurements and the grace fo mission continues the grace record with an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling therefore the long term trend based on the grace and grace fo data is reliable 5 3 reconstruction of continuous twsa based on piecewise trends fig 6 shows that the procedure of the reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends which were segmented by the changepoints in the twsa trend from hgd the detailed determination process of these changepoints can be found in text s2 the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends are closer to jpl than the reconstructed data dependent on the long term trend table 2 additionally the twsa agreement between jpl and the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends r 0 98 rmse 0 70 cm and nse 0 96 is even slightly better than that between jpl and csr r 0 98 rmse 0 76 cm and nse 0 95 in other words the reconstructed method based on the piecewise trends not only reserves the twsa trend in grace grace fo but also reduces the influences of the uncertainty in twsa trend and the error of model calibration in hgd on the performance of this reconstructed data therefore the performance of the reconstructed twsa based on the piecewise trends satisfies our reconstruction requirement and this reconstructed approach could be an alternative to filling the data gaps in the grace grace fo data similar to the long term trend the continuity between the grace and grace fo data ensures that the estimated piecewise trends are not impacted by the potential bias between the two satellite missions furthermore as shown in fig 7 a the twsa piecewise trends from rec based on the long term trend are very close to those from rec nan although the missing data results in a max trend difference of 0 37 cm year in period 6 october 2013 to august 2016 this difference only causes a maximum twsa fluctuation of 0 66 cm which is lower than the rmse value 1 01 cm table 2 between the reconstructed data and jpl therefore the influences of the missing data on the calculation of piecewise trends can be negligible and the calculation method of our piecewise trends is reliable moreover the state of the art awra model simulated twsa is used to evaluate the reliability of the reconstructed data in the data gaps as shown in fig 8 compared to the awra model simulation the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends indicate similar de trended and de seasonalized twsa during the 11 month data gap the corresponding rmse value is only 0 64 cm very close to its neighbors rmse values i e 1 05 cm and 0 66 cm during the green and yellow shading areas in fig 8 respectively therefore our reconstructed data in the data gaps show an equivalent precision with other data to underline the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps we observed the hydrological drought in australia using grace based tws deficits the tws deficits were defined as the negative residuals after subtracting the grace climatology from the grace twsa time series thomas et al 2014 a hydrological drought event is designated as any instance where the tws deficits last three or more consecutive months thomas et al 2014 as shown in fig 9 based on our reconstructed tws deficits we observed five hydrological drought events in australia from april 2002 to july 2019 the quantification of these droughts occurrence and severity is referred to in table s1 additionally we found that the last drought event occurs in april 2018 and lasted until july 2019 in other words the grace grace fo data cannot be used to analyze the australian drought in april and may 2018 therefore to fully track the spatiotemporal evolution of the drought in australia in 2018 2019 bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions is necessary it should be pointed out that this study focused on how to fill the grace grace fo data gaps the characterization and reason of these hydrological drought events are beyond the scope of our study and these issues will be discussed in the following research 5 4 reconstruction of continuous twsa in nine australian drainage divisions to evaluate the universality of our proposed approach for reconstructing the continuous grace grace fo twsa we also reconstructed the twsa in nine hydrological regions over australia these hydrological regions have different areas and average annual rainfall table 1 which resulted in different tws changes fig 10 additionally besides climate changes the twsa trends in some regions were also influenced by other uncertain factors for instance the declining twsa trend in the northwest plateau fig 4 has been primarily caused by natural variability but the influence of human mining activities is also possibly contributed rodell et al 2018 therefore the tws changes in these hydrological regions are good representatives of the twsa in other world regions as shown in fig 10 the twsa simulated by hgd in nine hydrological regions indicates similar changes with those derived from jpl and csr however besides in south west coast swc the twsa agreements between hgd and jpl in all hydrological regions are lower than those between jpl and csr fig 11 therefore the performance of hgd does not meet the requirement of our reconstruction requirement in these regions it is interesting to note that the twsa agreement between jpl and csr over swc is lower than that between hgd and jpl fig 11 which can be related to the fact that the 3 spatial resolution of grace is insufficient for monitoring the weaker twsa changes in the smaller regions scanlon et al 2016 for swc its area is only 326 000 km2 table 1 and its twsa magnitude is smaller than 5 cm fig 10 i in other words the continuous twsa simulated by hgd can directly be used to fill the data gaps between the grace grace fo data in swc based on the reconstruction approach presented in the present study we reconstructed the continuous twsa in nine hydrological regions based on the long term trend and piecewise trends respectively fig 10 as illustrated in fig 11 the reconstructed data based on the long term trend indicate a closer twsa agreement with jpl than hgd however except for north east coast nec and swc the twsa agreements between these reconstructed data and jpl are lower than those between jpl and csr in other drainage divisions by comparison the reconstructed data depended on the piecewise trends show similar or even higher twsa agreement with jpl than csr in all drainage divisions fig 11 additionally the influence of the missing data on calculating the piecewise trends in these nine divisions can also be ignored figs s3 s11 and the twsa differences between these rec data and the awra model in the data gaps are consistent with the adjacent data fig s12 therefore the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends meet the performance of our reconstruction requirement and can be applied to bridge the data gaps between the grace and grace fo solutions in these nine australian drainage divisions obviously our reconstruction method is universal and effective 5 5 uncertainty of the reconstruction twsa according to our reconstruction process eq 7 the uncertainties of the reconstructed data are mainly caused by the measurement and leakage errors in the grace grace fo data the calibration errors in hgd and the uncertainties in estimating twsa trends however the estimation of these errors is not trivial considering that the data continuity between grace and grace fo boergens et al 2020 landerer et al 2020 and the calibration of hgd was only based on the grace data humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the grace fo observation provides a straightforward and unique measurement to estimate the uncertainties of the reconstructed twsa li et al 2021 similar to the evaluation metric used in li et al 2021 we applied the rmse between the reconstructed data and grace fo measurements as the criterion for the uncertainty estimates table 3 summarizes the uncertainties of our reconstructed twsa in australia and its nine drainage divisions in general these uncertainties are limited within a reasonable error range 0 34 1 39 cm and lower than the rmse values between jpl and csr table s2 therefore our reconstruction method presents a reliable alternative for filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions 5 6 comparison with previous studies besides humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 sun et al 2020b and li et al 2021 also have provided publicly accessible reconstructed twsa referred to as hgd sun and li respectively which are related to the australian environment unlike hgd which was applied a linear regression model calibrated with the grace measurements to reconstruct the global climate driven twsa sun and li were trained ml methods using the grace data and climate forcing data to generate the reconstructed data additionally the generation of hgd sun and li compared in the current study were conducted with different grace mascon solutions and periods i e hgd was generated with jpl from april 2002 to july 2019 sun was produced with jpl for the period from april 2002 to august 2018 and li was created with csr over the period april 2002 to june 2020 therefore we compared the twsa agreement between these reconstructed data and the corresponding grace data for the same periods figs 12 and 14 to keep consistent with the generation of li was calibrated by csr we took advantage of the agreements in de trended twsa between csr and hgd similar to those between jpl and hgd fig 6 b s13 and s14 and used the de trended hgd and the piecewise trends of csr to generate the reconstructed data it should be noted that the generation of these reconstructed data was not rigorous but this simple replacement already satisfies our comparison requirements furthermore hgd was compared in sections 5 1 hence we focused on comparing sun and li in this section as shown in fig 12 although the generation of sun was based on the advanced and complex ml methods it shows lower twsa agreements with jpl than our reconstructed data in australia and its nine hydrological regions fig 13 this underestimation is mainly caused by sun underestimates the grace grace fo derived twsa trends sun et al 2020b on the contrary our reconstructed data ultimately reserve the grace derived trends in other words our reconstructed data indicate better performance than sun compared with sun the generation of li is also used the ml approach but it shows closer twsa agreement with the grace grace fo data fig 14 this improvement is mainly attributed to li retaining all grace grace fo born trends li et al 2021 however our reconstructed data also demonstrate higher twsa agreement with csr than li in all compared regions except plibara gasconyne pg and south west coast swc fig 13 which have low signal to noise ratios fig 14 i g therefore our reconstructed method not only retain the grace grace fo derived trends but also limits the error in the generation process of the reconstructed data 6 conclusions filling the data gaps is the first question to be solved when the grace and grace fo observations are used to monitor tws changes for hydrological applications continuously in the current study we present a simple and robust method based on time series decomposition to reconstruct the continuous grace grace fo twsa that is we used the least squares to decompose the twsa time series into the trend seasonality and residual components then we verified the data continuity between the grace and grace fo missions and the de trended twsa consistency between the grace grace fo solutions and humphrey and gudmundsson s datasets hgd eventually we combined the twsa trends derived from grace grace fo including the long term trend and piecewise trends respectively with the de trended twsa simulated by hgd to reconstruct the continuous twsa this reconstruction approach is systematically assessed over the australian continent and its nine drainage divisions using various evaluation metrics the comparison result indicates that the reconstructed data based on the piecewise trends indicate excellent twsa agreement with the grace grace fo solutions and outperforms previous researches additionally we observed the hydrology drought event in australia during the 11 month gap based on our reconstructed twsa this demonstrates the importance of filling the grace grace fo data gaps in general our reconstructed approach can be a good alternative to filling the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions compared to the multiple linear regression methods or the machine learning techniques for reconstructing continuous twsa major strengths of our presented approach include 1 the implementation is straightforward and reliable with high accuracy and efficiency 2 the capability to retain the impacts of climate changes and human activities on twsa and reasonably limit the error in the generation process of the reconstructed data due to our reconstruction approach is based on the grace derived twsa trend hence this method does not hindcast or predict twsa however it presents an alternative for bridging the data gaps between the grace and grace fo missions this reconstruction method could also have potential

handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of daniele penna associate editor cryogenic vacuum extraction cve is the most widely used method for obtaining soil water for water stable isotope 2h and 18o analysis however recent studies have shown that it may result in biased isotopic compositions here we presented a method to correct the cve biases and to assess the influence of the corrections on the conclusions from three different soil water isotope applications in hydrology four soil samples with different textures were oven dried at 205 c wetted to varying water contents 0 05 0 30 g g 1 with reference water of known isotope composition and then subjected to cve for water extraction the isotopic differences biases between the reference and extracted water were related to the soil textures and water contents then the relationship was used to assess how the cryogenic extraction biases potentially influence soil water isotope applications based on data from three previous studies the results showed that the biases for 84 cve samples were more than twice the standard errors of currently available isotope analyzers and biases increased significantly with increasing clay and decreasing water contents correction equations for cve obtained δ2h and δ18o were established r2 0 84 p 0 01 and r2 0 60 p 0 01 respectively when these corrections were applied to three different scenarios they led to conclusions significantly different from those established with uncorrected values this study provides a correction method for soil water vacuum extraction bias to improve the effectiveness of 2h and 18o applications in soil hydrology we suggest that cryogenic extraction biases should be considered seriously for quantitative analysis under low water contents and with a narrow spread of isotopic compositions among the potential end members keywords soil water cryogenic vacuum extraction stable isotope bias water content clay content correction equation 1 introduction in recent decades stable isotopes 2h and 18o in water have become powerful tools for investigating soil hydrological processes including groundwater recharge mechanisms root water uptake patterns and evapotranspiration partitioning beyer and penna 2021 bowen et al 2019 sprenger et al 2016a no isotopic fractionation during the extraction of water from the soil for isotope analysis is the premise for the applications mentioned above to date a variety of soil water extraction techniques have been developed among which cryogenic vacuum extraction cve is the most widely used sprenger et al 2015 and is considered to be the standard method for pretreatment before isotope analyses millar et al 2018 however recent studies have shown that soil physicochemical properties and extraction conditions can lead to isotope bias of the extracted water thus the cve accuracy has been questioned adams et al 2020 araguás araguás et al 1995 meisner et al 2014 oerter et al 2014 orlowski 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 von freyberg et al 2020 with rapid developments in mass spectrometry and laser technology it is no longer difficult to accurately measure 2h and 18o isotope ratios however the disadvantage of soil water sampling or extraction has become a limiting factor in stable isotope applications west et al 2006 nevertheless cve has been used in soil and eco hydrology for a long time despite its limitations orlowski et al 2016b and is still used as an important method for water extraction awaiting the development of more reasonable and economical technologies in the future in this context it is urgent to improve the accuracy of soil water isotopic composition obtained by cve so that it can be robustly applied in a variety of soil hydrology processes two potential options can be used to improve the accuracy of the cve first the cryogenic vacuum bias may be minimized or even eliminated using optimized cve systems and extraction conditions second cve biases can be compensated if errors are sufficiently predictable by comparing cve systems in 26 laboratories around the world orlowski et al 2018 concluded that it is challenging to establish a standardized vacuum extraction procedure and suggested optimizing individual extraction conditions for each soil according to orlowski et al 2018 and tsuruta et al 2019 temperatures of 90 100 c and pressures lower than 100 pa are the most widely used among laboratories in addition orlowski et al 2016a reviewed the factors influencing cve for soil water isotope analysis and found that clay and water contents are important factors leading to isotope deviations however these studies only presented causes of isotopic deviations qualitatively while quantitative relationships between isotopic biases and influencing factors remained unassessed in addition to simple qualitative applications water isotope data have been used to obtain quantitative information on a specific hydrological process in recent years as the volume and accessibility of soil water isotope data have increased quantitative tools supporting the investigation of sources and destinations of soil water have improved bowen et al 2019 combined with modeling isotopes can be used to estimate transit times in soil profiles brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2016b ascertain the contribution of soil water to plants jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2019 recharge to groundwater hao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 scanlon et al 2006 and evaluate soil evaporation benettin et al 2018 mahindawansha et al 2020 ogle et al 2016 sprenger et al 2017 recent research has shown that extraction bias when studying plant water needs to be corrected or it can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding plant water sources allen and kirchner 2021 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2020 corrected for plant samples based on relative water content however the source of extraction biases of soil is different from that of the plant and the magnitude of the biases depends on the soil water and clay contents it remains uncertain whether correction of cve induced bias would improve the performance of water isotope applications therefore this study aimed at improving the cve accuracy for soil water isotope analysis more specifically the aims of the study were to 1 determine how water and clay contents affect cryogenic vacuum bias for soil water 2 establish correction equations between cve induced isotopic bias or offset δδ2h and δδ18o and the influencing factors and 3 evaluate bias correction effects on soil water stable isotope applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and spiking experiment four soil samples with different clay contents were collected from the chinese loess plateau air dried and then passed through a 2 mm sieve soil particle composition was measured using the pipette method gee and or 2002 and characterized according to the united states department of agriculture system which defines soil particles as sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm the soil texture information is presented in table 1 about 20 g of soil packed in a glass tube was dried at 205 c to a constant weight in an oven the oven dried soils were immediately transported into a desiccator to cool down to room temperature then reference water with known isotopic composition δ2h 69 28 δ18o 10 34 were added into the soil samples to form soil water mixtures at five gravimetric water contents 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g g 1 five replicates were set for each treatment resulting in a total of 100 samples the rewetted soil samples were capped sealed with parafilm and equilibrated in a refrigerator at 4 c for two weeks soil water was extracted using a cve system li 2000 lica china with a system pressure of less than 0 01 kpa and soil heating temperature of 95 c for more than 3 h during the extraction processes the extracted water was then collected in a 10 ml glass bottle and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before isotope analysis the stable isotopic compositions of soil water were determined with an isotopic liquid water analyzer lgr liwa 45ep usa and were expressed in as craig 1961 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 where r is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes 2h h or 18o 16o the δ values are reported relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water the precision of δ2h and δ18o measured by the instrument was 1 0 and 0 2 respectively 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 cryogenic vacuum extraction bias we assume that the measured soil water isotopes are always positive for incomplete extraction by the cve then the measured soil water isotope offset relative to the reference water can be defined as 2 δ δ δ m δ r where δ m and δ r represent the δ2h or δ18o of extracted soil water and reference water respectively z scores show how far the extracted water differed from the reference water 3 z δ δ s d where sd is the target standard deviation precision of the isotopic analysis instrument the absolute value of z scores reflects the acceptability of the isotopic composition of the extracted water orlowski et al 2016b therefore the obtained z scores of δ2h and δ18o were cross plotted to illustrate acceptable z 2 questionable 2 z 5 and unacceptable z 5 performance patterns with z scores closer to zero being nearer to the reference water 2 2 2 correction function we randomly divided the 100 cryogenically extracted soil water samples into two groups 70 samples for deriving the cve bias correction function and the remaining 30 samples to validate the correction functions simple multiple linear regression mlr was performed to establish the quantitative relationship between δδ2h or δδ18o and potential factors the generic equation of the mlr is as follows 4 y y ε a 0 i 1 n a i x i ε where y and y represent the measured and predicted variables respectively ε is the error term a 0 is the intercept ai is the regression coefficient xi is the i th independent variable and n is the number of independent variables in the regression equation by combining eqs 2 and 4 the correction equation for cve caused isotopic bias can be obtained as follows 5 δ t δ m δ δ where δ t is the true value of the bulk soil water isotope and δ m represents the isotopic composition of the water extracted by cve 2 2 3 prediction performance evaluation the predictive performance of the correction functions was evaluated by three indices the adjusted r2 adj r2 the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse defined as lu et al 2021 6 r 2 c o v y i y i 2 var y i v a r y i 7 a d j r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n p 1 8 m e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i and y i represent the i th measured and predicted values respectively where i 1 2 n further n and p are the numbers of samples and variables respectively the adjusted r2 a modified version of the r2 after considering the number of predictors reflects the predictive capacities and represents the fraction of the total variance that is explained by the prediction me quantifies the systematic bias of the predictive function and rmse evaluates the standard deviation of the overall error in the prediction a good model has a higher adjusted r2 and smaller me and rmse values in addition since the correction equations are established based on the measured data the predicted δδ itself will have uncertainty the uncertainty of δδ is primarily introduced by regression coefficients which can be calculated by the first order perturbation analysis of eq 4 10 s e δ δ i 0 n δ t a i s e a i 2 2 3 statistical analysis two way analyses of variance were conducted to compare the individual effects and combined interactions of variables i e water and clay contents stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the significant variables and to establish correction functions for δδ the student s t test was used to analyze the difference between two means with unequal variances where a statistically significant difference was indicated by t 1 96 p 0 05 all analyses were performed using spss software ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 0 3 results 3 1 isotope acceptability of extracted water across plots of the δ2h and δ18o z scores showed that all samples fell in the third quadrant fig 1 indicating that both 2h and 18o in extracted water were depleted relative to the reference water for all samples only 16 of the extracted samples fell within the acceptable range with the remainder in questionable or unacceptable categories this suggests that the bias caused by cve cannot be ignored generally low water content and high clay content cause a greater drift in δ2h or δ18o for samples with 0 05 g g 1 water content the z score results plotted farthest from the origin all within the unacceptable range fig 1 3 2 influencing factors on cryogenic extraction biases a two way analysis of variance anova indicated that water and clay contents significantly affected the isotopic bias δδ for both 2h and 18o p 0 01 table 2 however the interaction between water and clay contents was not statistically significant as shown in fig 2 δδ2h and δδ18o for samples with varying water and clay contents were all significantly smaller than 0 and isotopic biases were positively and negatively correlated with clay and water contents respectively in addition the water content had a stronger influence on δδ the unit water content decrease 1 led to 0 21 and 0 02 depletion in 2h and 18o respectively while unit clay content increase resulted in 0 06 and 0 009 depletion in 2h and 18o respectively these results indicate that the water and clay contents are important factors that control the isotopic bias in cve extracted soil water 3 3 correction functions for cryogenic vacuum bias cve associated isotopic bias δδ correction functions were established for soil water and clay contents as significant variables and δδ can be expressed as 11 δ δ a 0 a 1 c c a 2 w c where wc is the water content g g 1 and cc is the clay content g g 1 we developed prediction functions for δδ2h and δδ18o using training datasets all regression coefficients were significantly different from zero table 3 the adjusted r2 was 0 84 and 0 60 for δδ2h and δδ18o prediction models indicating that the two factors explained 84 and 60 of the total δδ2h and δδ18o variance respectively the me values for δδ2h and δδ18o were both close to zero the rmses for δδ2h and δδ18o were 0 660 and 0 123 respectively which are both smaller than the instrument lgr measurement precision 1 0 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o table 3 the predictive performance was evaluated using validating datasets for the δδ2h and δδ18o prediction models there were little differences between the adjusted r2 me and rmse in the training and testing datasets table 3 implying a robust and stable predictive performance this can also be seen in fig 3 as the scattered points of training and validating datasets both clustered around the 1 1 line of measured versus predicted δδ and most points were located within the scope of instrument precision shadow area in addition the maximum standard error occurred at the water content of 0 25 g g 1 and clay content of 0 32 g g 1 were 1 15 for predicted δδ2h and 0 21 for predicted δδ18o eq 10 which is similar to the uncertainty of the water isotope analysis instrumentation 3 4 potential effects of cryogenic extraction biases on soil water isotope application in the following section we assess how cryogenic extraction biases for soil water could potentially alter the conclusions of previous studies we selected three cases from china loess plateau clp 1 estimation of groundwater recharge based on the cve extracted soil water isotopic composition xiang et al 2019 2 calculation of long term evaporation loss from deep soil water isotopic composition xiang et al 2021 and 3 plant water sourced from different soil layers ma et al 2019 we used eq 5 for extraction bias correction and fully replicated the original calculations we also considered the bias prediction uncertainties when evaluating the potential effects on cve obtained soil water isotope applications we compared the corrected and original data and the conclusions 3 4 1 case a groundwater recharge estimation assuming that stable isotopes from soil water and precipitation can be used to represent the isotopic signatures of the piston and preferential flows respectively xiang et al 2019 quantified dual recharge mechanisms in deep unsaturated zones their calculation was based on data average deep soil δ18o 9 80 0 03 and δ2h 73 5 0 25 where the uncertainty is expressed as sd the contributions of the piston and preferential flows through mixsiar were 62 8 and 38 8 respectively we corrected the measured stable isotopes from soil water based on the clay content of 0 21 g g 1 and average soil water content of 0 23 g g 1 lu et al 2019 the resulting corrected isotopic composition of soil water δ18o 9 55 0 19 and δ2h 70 8 1 06 was significantly higher than the respective uncorrected data p 0 05 therefore the isotopic composition of soil water deviated further from groundwater δ18o 10 15 δ2h 72 72 fig 4 than previously reported the outputs of the mixsiar model using corrected soil water isotopes showed that recharge contributions from the piston and preferential flows were 52 7 and 48 7 respectively which were significantly different from the results with uncorrected data this suggests that less piston flow but more preferential flow contributed to groundwater recharge than that reported by xiang et al 2019 3 4 2 case b soil evaporation estimation xiang et al 2021 used water stable isotopes from deep soils to estimate the regional scale long term evaporation loss at 20 sites in the clp we corrected the cryogenically extracted soil water using the average water content fig 5 a and clay content mean value of 0 15 g g 1 in deep soil and then recalculated the soil evaporation loss fraction f for all 20 sites our results showed that mean δ2h and δ18o of deep soil water had significantly changed compared to those presented by xiang et al 2021 across the study region δδ2h 3 4 1 0 and δ18o 0 3 0 1 p 0 05 based on the corrected data the line conditioned excess lc excess as defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 ranged between 12 7 and 3 2 the soil evaporation loss fraction f was calculated according to the method of xiang et al 2021 with other conditions unchanged the resulting average f ranging from 3 0 to 13 6 fig 5a was significantly smaller than that reported by xiang et al 2021 4 6 15 4 and the difference between the evaporation loss fraction δf from corrected and uncorrected soil water isotopes was significantly correlated with soil water content fig 5b 3 4 3 case c plant water source inference ma et al 2019 analyzed xylem water from apple trees as a mixture of soil water from different layers in the changwu highland 35 28 n 107 88 e where soil water is the only water source because groundwater is inaccessible to plants soil and plant water were extracted using the li 2000 system based on an average clay content of 0 23 g g 1 and water content for each layer reported in table 4 we reanalyzed the soil water isotope composition using eq 5 corrected δ2h in each soil layer differed significantly from those uncorrected p 0 05 with values changing from 54 52 to 51 89 at 0 1 m 64 86 to 62 23 at 1 2 m and 66 65 to 62 53 at 2 5 m in addition there was no significant difference in the corrected δ2h between depths at 1 2 m and 2 5 m table 4 we also increased the plant xylem water δ2h values by 8 to correct for the average bias between cryogenically extracted xylem water and source water as suggested by chen et al 2020 the corrected xylem water was consistent with that extracted by centrifugation and the value was used as true xylem water to analyze the influence of soil water isotope bias on plant water sources correction for presumed cryogenic extraction biases led to contributions of 38 32 and 30 from the three soil layers to plant water table 4 which was significantly different from those uncorrected p 0 05 with relative errors ranging from 25 to 33 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 why are water and clay contents selected to correct cryogenic extraction biases cryogenic extraction facilitates the removal of liquid water from the soil by changing the phase state of water evaporation condensation ingraham and shadel 1992 theoretically the amount of water and isotope signature added to oven dried soil should be recovered by cve if the soil water is completely extracted however recent studies have shown that extracted water represents varying degrees of depletion relative to reference water koeniger et al 2011 meisner et al 2014 orlowski et al 2016a orlowski et al 2013 walker et al 1994 which was confirmed by our results fig 1 notably residual water in the soil after oven drying inevitably alters the extracted water isotopic signature in all spiking tests adams et al 2020 newberry et al 2017 however we used 205 c as the oven dry temperature to release all bulk water with a residual water content equal to zero therefore the influence of residual water could have been removed extraction conditions are one of the most important factors for cve in soil water isotope analysis orlowski et al 2016a the heating temperature and pressure determine the evaporation capacity of the extraction system at present the heating temperature and pressure used worldwide mostly range from 90 to 115 c and between 0 1 pa and 1 kpa orlowski et al 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 however 100 c was demonstrated as insufficient to remove all bulk soil water adams et al 2020 gaj et al 2017 wang et al 2011 although low pressure can improve the evaporation capacity to a certain extent extracting water completely from the soil by heating at approximately 100 c may still be a difficult task guggenheim et al 2006 note that in our study the cve was carried out at a temperature of 95 c and air pressure of 0 01 kpa thus incomplete extraction may be an important reason for the depletion of extracted water wen et al 2021 gaj et al 2017 suggested applying 200 300 c for clay water extraction however the excessive temperature may lead to soil structure damage or water rock isotope exchange clark and fritz 1997 which could cause additional fractionation of the extracted water in addition high temperatures can cause a release of water by oxidation of organics and dihydroxylation of hydroxide containing minerals and the co extraction of organics interferes with isotope analysis orlowski et al 2018 hence it is challenging to modify conditions to match the extraction capability for recovering water completely without fractionation and to define any sort of standard extraction procedure applicable across laboratories orlowski et al 2018 beyond extraction conditions physicochemical properties of soil such as water content and texture are other important factors impacting extracted water isotopic biases the energy and properties of water depend on the distance to the mineral soil particle surface etzler 1983 and water nearest to the surface has a low matric potential or strong binding energy bogdan et al 1996 kleinberg and griffin 2005 thus more energy is needed to remove the water bounded nearest to the soil particle surface schuttlefield et al 2007 white and pichler 1959 a soil with a finer texture has a larger specific surface area and more strongly bound water under the same water content conditions in general a lower soil water content or higher clay content result in a substantial proportion of thin film water to bulk soil water and low matric potentials for a cve system limited extraction capacity induces different extraction efficiencies with varying soil water and clay contents wen et al 2021 consequently the measured isotopic depletion varied with water and clay contents fig 2 specifically increasing clay content and decreasing water content generally increased the bias δδ except for soils with clay contents between 27 and 32 fig 2a and 2c the exception may be because the specific surface area of the soil with 27 clay content was larger than that of the soil with 32 clay content as the former contains more silt than the latter table 1 water content was significantly correlated with cryogenic extraction biases fig 2b and 2d the higher the soil water content the closer the extracted water to the reference water and the more likely the measured water isotopes fall within the acceptable range in contrast the lower the soil water content the more likely the measured soil water isotopic compositions fall in the unacceptable range fig 1 this may be because for a soil with a certain soil texture the unextractable bound water content is fixed the lower the water content the larger the proportion of unextractable water to bulk water the more depleted the measured 2h and 18o from the extracted soil water in short the key to extracting bulk water from the soil is to reach a perfect balance between the evaporating energy and the adsorbing energy of soil to water cve has limited extraction capacity and unextractable bound water leads to biases although increasing the heating temperature is an effective way to improve the extraction capacity additional isotopic fractionation induced by high temperature outweighs the benefits previous research and this study showed that biases were significantly correlated with soil clay and water contents because the cryogenic vacuum extraction bias for soil water isotopes was sufficiently predictable correction equations were established based on soil water and clay contents table 3 in addition high adjusted r2 small me and rmspe values in the testing datasets showed that cve bias correction functions had a robust and stable predictive performance table 3 fig 3 although the data driven correction equation will bring uncertainty to the predicted values the maximum uncertainty of the predicted isotope bias calculated by eq 10 is similar to the uncertainty of the water isotope analyzer these results clearly suggest that the developed correction functions could provide robust predictions for cve associated soil water isotopic bias therefore correcting the cryogenic extraction biases with the water and clay contents is an effective way to improve the cve 4 2 how to consider the potential effects of vacuum extraction biases on soil water isotope application our spiking experiment results showed that 84 of the cryogenically extracted water samples fell out of the acceptable range fig 1 this means that most of the extracted water from soils inherits some cryogenic associated artifacts potentially resulting in uncertainties related to the soil water isotope inferences to show how cve bias may influence soil water isotope applications three cases were reanalyzed using bias corrected data in the three cases soil water was extracted via the same cve system li 2000 lica china as the spiking experiments in this study and soil water isotope data were used as quantitative tools to support the analysis of soil hydrological processes isotopic data of different endmembers are often used in linear endmember mixing models to quantify hydrological processes the simplest case of a linear endmember mixing model that uses one isotope ratio e g δ2h to differentiate between the relative contributions x of two sources 1 δ 1 and 2 δ 2 to a mixture δ mix is expressed as phillips and gregg 2001 12 x 1 δ mix δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 assuming negligible measurement and sampling errors the standard error se in x 1 can be calculated by gaussian error propagation with known uncertainties of the individual endmembers phillips and gregg 2001 13 s e x 1 1 δ 1 δ 2 2 se δ mix 2 x 1 2 s e δ 1 2 1 x 1 2 s e δ 2 2 however if one end member e g soil water measurement e g δ 1 is biased the estimated value can be expressed as δ 1 δ 1 δ δ where δδ represents the cve bias the resulting estimate x 1 and its se can be derived as 14 x 1 δ mix δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 15 s e x 1 1 δ 1 δ 2 2 se δ mix 2 x 1 2 s e δ 1 2 1 x 1 2 s e δ 2 2 x 1 2 se δ δ 2 note that the estimated contribution of soil water and its uncertainty both depend on the soil water isotopic bias δδ if other end members remain unchanged more specifically if soil water bias correction increases the difference between the two sources δ 1 and δ 2 the estimated x 1 will be smaller but the se may increase or decrease for instance in case a soil water and precipitation were two sources of groundwater recharge in the catchment of changwu tableland in the clp because of the vacuum extraction biases corrected soil water isotopes δ18o 9 55 0 19 δ2h 70 80 1 06 were farther away from the other source precipitation δ18o 10 07 0 88 δ2h 75 00 6 77 fig 3 this resulted in the interpretation that less recharge contribution originated from piston flow in deep soil 52 7 10 change decrease but the uncertainty was similar to the result by xiang et al 2019 62 8 this is mainly because the mean differences among groundwater deep soil water and precipitation are small 2 3 for δ2h and 0 9 δ18o but the mean biases caused by cve were much greater δδ2h 2 7 δδ18o 0 26 thus resulting in a remarkable difference from the original conclusions this interpretation is also supported by allen and kirchner 2021 they pointed out that large stem water cve bias relative to the spread in isotopic compositions among the potential end members may substantially alter plant water source implications otherwise the impact of cryogenic extraction biases may be less pronounced therefore the relative relationship between cve bias and the isotopic range among the potential end members determines the potential effects of soil water cve bias on its applications the stable isotopic compositions of water source pools and plant water provide important information on water sources and water uptake patterns ehleringer and dawson 1992 often marked differences in the isotopic composition of various water bodies make it easier to pinpoint the water source yang et al 2010 for case c plant water was sourced from three sampling depths that had a gradient of mostly decreasing δ2h values and water contents table 4 low water content in deep layers means larger cryogenic vacuum bias and bias correction elevated δ2h by 2 63 4 12 along the soil profile and significant change in soil water isotopic compositions and their contributions to plant water table 4 these results imply that the extraction of soil water from dry soils could lead to a large error in the measured isotopic composition walker et al 1994 necessitating cve bias correction in addition a recent study found that the vacuum extraction bias for plant water though negligible for δ18o is even greater for δ2h with a mean value of 8 chen et al 2020 compared with cve biases δδ2h ranges from 2 to 6 for soil water the measurement error in the isotopic composition of plant water δ2h brings greater uncertainty allen and kirchner 2021 in short isotopic bias caused by cve for both soil water and xylem water should be taken seriously in isotope based plant water source inference especially under low water conditions in addition to tracing water transport storage and mixing as conservative tracers in the vadose zone soil stable water isotopes also reflect evaporation losses through the progressive enrichment in 18o and 2h in the remaining liquid evaporation leaves a characteristic signature on the isotopic composition of soil water water undergoes fractionation by evaporation and in dual isotope space it plots below the local meteoric water line resulting in a negative lc conditioned excess based on precipitation and deep soil water isotopes case b estimated the long term soil evaporation loss fraction f at 20 sites across the clp combining an isotope mass balance model with lc excess the study region covers semi arid and arid climates with mean deep soil water contents ranging from 6 to 22 fig 4 which was similar to the soil water content range 5 to 25 determined in our experiment our results showed that low water content led to a large cve bias for measured soil water isotopes up to 6 7 for δ2h and 0 8 for δ18o we assumed that all soil water isotope biases due to cve can be corrected using eq 5 the correction resulted in significantly more enriched soil water isotopic compositions but less negative lc excess than for the uncorrected ones evaporation loss f estimated using corrected soil water isotopes ranged from 3 0 to 13 6 fig 5a which was significantly smaller than those reported by xiang et al 2021 furthermore lower soil water content led to greater cve bias effects on the evaporation calculation fig 5b these results suggest that cve bias is critical for estimating soil evaporation loss and particular caution should be taken for calculations involving low soil water content conditions evaluation of bias correction effects in three studies of soil water isotope based quantitative implications on clp indicated that cve induced bias may lead to significantly different results although soil water cryogenic extraction biases depend on their physicochemical properties e g water content and texture uncertainties may be exaggerated within models we suggest that soil physicochemical properties e g water content and texture and wide ranges among different end members should be investigated when cve is applied for soil water isotope analysis as is known clay and water content are the key factors controlling the amount of bound or unextractable water in the soil wen et al 2021 and soil water isotopic fractionation is mainly due to incomplete extraction at 95 c in cve system thus our bias correction equations were established based on clay and water content for a cve system with heating temperature at 95 c because of the widely used extraction heating temperature around 95 c and two easy to measure soil properties the bias correction equation developed in this study should have wide utility however previous studies have shown that mineral composition of soil may affect the fractionation of soil water isotope especially on 18o for example oerter et al 2014 found that k ca2 mg2 led to weak oxygen fractionation of soil water besides water rock isotopic exchange could occur in high temperature system clark and fritz 1997 leading to 18o drift in water and high temperature 200 c is recently adopted by some laboratories to improve the soil water extraction however high temperature may lead to organic matter decomposition thus additional effects of organics and minerals on isotopic fractionation need to be considered for soils with high organic matter content and for cve systems using excessive heating temperature 5 conclusions consistent with previous studies we demonstrated that cryogenically extracted soil water is depleted compared to reference water and water and clay contents are the main factors for extraction biases we established correction functions for cryogenic extraction biases and evaluated their potential effects on soil water isotope applications the main conclusions are as follows 1 cryogenic vacuum extraction at 95 c and 0 01 kpa led to different degrees of depletion for extracted water relative to reference water with 84 of the extracted water samples falling outside the acceptable range 2 the water and clay contents significantly altered the extracted soil water isotopic composition relative to the reference water the lower the water content and the higher the clay content the larger the extraction biases for soil water the biases can be corrected through an established relationship with water and clay contents 3 cryogenic extraction biases significantly affected the interpretation of soil water isotope compositions regarding the estimation of groundwater recharge soil evaporation loss and plant water sources this study developed a correction method for cve induced biases for soil water stable isotopic compositions and provides guidance for future work this method could potentially alleviate the bias induced by cve effectively widening the application of water stable isotopes in soils however it may be necessary to consider the potential effects of extraction biases in the context of soil properties and isotopic differences among potential endmembers when cryogenic vacuum extraction is used as a pre treatment before isotope analysis credit authorship contribution statement mingyi wen conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology validation

handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of daniele penna associate editor cryogenic vacuum extraction cve is the most widely used method for obtaining soil water for water stable isotope 2h and 18o analysis however recent studies have shown that it may result in biased isotopic compositions here we presented a method to correct the cve biases and to assess the influence of the corrections on the conclusions from three different soil water isotope applications in hydrology four soil samples with different textures were oven dried at 205 c wetted to varying water contents 0 05 0 30 g g 1 with reference water of known isotope composition and then subjected to cve for water extraction the isotopic differences biases between the reference and extracted water were related to the soil textures and water contents then the relationship was used to assess how the cryogenic extraction biases potentially influence soil water isotope applications based on data from three previous studies the results showed that the biases for 84 cve samples were more than twice the standard errors of currently available isotope analyzers and biases increased significantly with increasing clay and decreasing water contents correction equations for cve obtained δ2h and δ18o were established r2 0 84 p 0 01 and r2 0 60 p 0 01 respectively when these corrections were applied to three different scenarios they led to conclusions significantly different from those established with uncorrected values this study provides a correction method for soil water vacuum extraction bias to improve the effectiveness of 2h and 18o applications in soil hydrology we suggest that cryogenic extraction biases should be considered seriously for quantitative analysis under low water contents and with a narrow spread of isotopic compositions among the potential end members keywords soil water cryogenic vacuum extraction stable isotope bias water content clay content correction equation 1 introduction in recent decades stable isotopes 2h and 18o in water have become powerful tools for investigating soil hydrological processes including groundwater recharge mechanisms root water uptake patterns and evapotranspiration partitioning beyer and penna 2021 bowen et al 2019 sprenger et al 2016a no isotopic fractionation during the extraction of water from the soil for isotope analysis is the premise for the applications mentioned above to date a variety of soil water extraction techniques have been developed among which cryogenic vacuum extraction cve is the most widely used sprenger et al 2015 and is considered to be the standard method for pretreatment before isotope analyses millar et al 2018 however recent studies have shown that soil physicochemical properties and extraction conditions can lead to isotope bias of the extracted water thus the cve accuracy has been questioned adams et al 2020 araguás araguás et al 1995 meisner et al 2014 oerter et al 2014 orlowski 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 von freyberg et al 2020 with rapid developments in mass spectrometry and laser technology it is no longer difficult to accurately measure 2h and 18o isotope ratios however the disadvantage of soil water sampling or extraction has become a limiting factor in stable isotope applications west et al 2006 nevertheless cve has been used in soil and eco hydrology for a long time despite its limitations orlowski et al 2016b and is still used as an important method for water extraction awaiting the development of more reasonable and economical technologies in the future in this context it is urgent to improve the accuracy of soil water isotopic composition obtained by cve so that it can be robustly applied in a variety of soil hydrology processes two potential options can be used to improve the accuracy of the cve first the cryogenic vacuum bias may be minimized or even eliminated using optimized cve systems and extraction conditions second cve biases can be compensated if errors are sufficiently predictable by comparing cve systems in 26 laboratories around the world orlowski et al 2018 concluded that it is challenging to establish a standardized vacuum extraction procedure and suggested optimizing individual extraction conditions for each soil according to orlowski et al 2018 and tsuruta et al 2019 temperatures of 90 100 c and pressures lower than 100 pa are the most widely used among laboratories in addition orlowski et al 2016a reviewed the factors influencing cve for soil water isotope analysis and found that clay and water contents are important factors leading to isotope deviations however these studies only presented causes of isotopic deviations qualitatively while quantitative relationships between isotopic biases and influencing factors remained unassessed in addition to simple qualitative applications water isotope data have been used to obtain quantitative information on a specific hydrological process in recent years as the volume and accessibility of soil water isotope data have increased quantitative tools supporting the investigation of sources and destinations of soil water have improved bowen et al 2019 combined with modeling isotopes can be used to estimate transit times in soil profiles brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2016b ascertain the contribution of soil water to plants jasechko et al 2013 wang et al 2019 recharge to groundwater hao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 scanlon et al 2006 and evaluate soil evaporation benettin et al 2018 mahindawansha et al 2020 ogle et al 2016 sprenger et al 2017 recent research has shown that extraction bias when studying plant water needs to be corrected or it can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding plant water sources allen and kirchner 2021 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2020 corrected for plant samples based on relative water content however the source of extraction biases of soil is different from that of the plant and the magnitude of the biases depends on the soil water and clay contents it remains uncertain whether correction of cve induced bias would improve the performance of water isotope applications therefore this study aimed at improving the cve accuracy for soil water isotope analysis more specifically the aims of the study were to 1 determine how water and clay contents affect cryogenic vacuum bias for soil water 2 establish correction equations between cve induced isotopic bias or offset δδ2h and δδ18o and the influencing factors and 3 evaluate bias correction effects on soil water stable isotope applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and spiking experiment four soil samples with different clay contents were collected from the chinese loess plateau air dried and then passed through a 2 mm sieve soil particle composition was measured using the pipette method gee and or 2002 and characterized according to the united states department of agriculture system which defines soil particles as sand 2 0 05 mm silt 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 0 002 mm the soil texture information is presented in table 1 about 20 g of soil packed in a glass tube was dried at 205 c to a constant weight in an oven the oven dried soils were immediately transported into a desiccator to cool down to room temperature then reference water with known isotopic composition δ2h 69 28 δ18o 10 34 were added into the soil samples to form soil water mixtures at five gravimetric water contents 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g g 1 five replicates were set for each treatment resulting in a total of 100 samples the rewetted soil samples were capped sealed with parafilm and equilibrated in a refrigerator at 4 c for two weeks soil water was extracted using a cve system li 2000 lica china with a system pressure of less than 0 01 kpa and soil heating temperature of 95 c for more than 3 h during the extraction processes the extracted water was then collected in a 10 ml glass bottle and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c before isotope analysis the stable isotopic compositions of soil water were determined with an isotopic liquid water analyzer lgr liwa 45ep usa and were expressed in as craig 1961 1 δ r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d r s t a n d a r d 1000 where r is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes 2h h or 18o 16o the δ values are reported relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water the precision of δ2h and δ18o measured by the instrument was 1 0 and 0 2 respectively 2 2 data analysis 2 2 1 cryogenic vacuum extraction bias we assume that the measured soil water isotopes are always positive for incomplete extraction by the cve then the measured soil water isotope offset relative to the reference water can be defined as 2 δ δ δ m δ r where δ m and δ r represent the δ2h or δ18o of extracted soil water and reference water respectively z scores show how far the extracted water differed from the reference water 3 z δ δ s d where sd is the target standard deviation precision of the isotopic analysis instrument the absolute value of z scores reflects the acceptability of the isotopic composition of the extracted water orlowski et al 2016b therefore the obtained z scores of δ2h and δ18o were cross plotted to illustrate acceptable z 2 questionable 2 z 5 and unacceptable z 5 performance patterns with z scores closer to zero being nearer to the reference water 2 2 2 correction function we randomly divided the 100 cryogenically extracted soil water samples into two groups 70 samples for deriving the cve bias correction function and the remaining 30 samples to validate the correction functions simple multiple linear regression mlr was performed to establish the quantitative relationship between δδ2h or δδ18o and potential factors the generic equation of the mlr is as follows 4 y y ε a 0 i 1 n a i x i ε where y and y represent the measured and predicted variables respectively ε is the error term a 0 is the intercept ai is the regression coefficient xi is the i th independent variable and n is the number of independent variables in the regression equation by combining eqs 2 and 4 the correction equation for cve caused isotopic bias can be obtained as follows 5 δ t δ m δ δ where δ t is the true value of the bulk soil water isotope and δ m represents the isotopic composition of the water extracted by cve 2 2 3 prediction performance evaluation the predictive performance of the correction functions was evaluated by three indices the adjusted r2 adj r2 the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse defined as lu et al 2021 6 r 2 c o v y i y i 2 var y i v a r y i 7 a d j r 2 1 1 r 2 n 1 n p 1 8 m e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 9 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i and y i represent the i th measured and predicted values respectively where i 1 2 n further n and p are the numbers of samples and variables respectively the adjusted r2 a modified version of the r2 after considering the number of predictors reflects the predictive capacities and represents the fraction of the total variance that is explained by the prediction me quantifies the systematic bias of the predictive function and rmse evaluates the standard deviation of the overall error in the prediction a good model has a higher adjusted r2 and smaller me and rmse values in addition since the correction equations are established based on the measured data the predicted δδ itself will have uncertainty the uncertainty of δδ is primarily introduced by regression coefficients which can be calculated by the first order perturbation analysis of eq 4 10 s e δ δ i 0 n δ t a i s e a i 2 2 3 statistical analysis two way analyses of variance were conducted to compare the individual effects and combined interactions of variables i e water and clay contents stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the significant variables and to establish correction functions for δδ the student s t test was used to analyze the difference between two means with unequal variances where a statistically significant difference was indicated by t 1 96 p 0 05 all analyses were performed using spss software ibm spss statistics for windows version 22 0 3 results 3 1 isotope acceptability of extracted water across plots of the δ2h and δ18o z scores showed that all samples fell in the third quadrant fig 1 indicating that both 2h and 18o in extracted water were depleted relative to the reference water for all samples only 16 of the extracted samples fell within the acceptable range with the remainder in questionable or unacceptable categories this suggests that the bias caused by cve cannot be ignored generally low water content and high clay content cause a greater drift in δ2h or δ18o for samples with 0 05 g g 1 water content the z score results plotted farthest from the origin all within the unacceptable range fig 1 3 2 influencing factors on cryogenic extraction biases a two way analysis of variance anova indicated that water and clay contents significantly affected the isotopic bias δδ for both 2h and 18o p 0 01 table 2 however the interaction between water and clay contents was not statistically significant as shown in fig 2 δδ2h and δδ18o for samples with varying water and clay contents were all significantly smaller than 0 and isotopic biases were positively and negatively correlated with clay and water contents respectively in addition the water content had a stronger influence on δδ the unit water content decrease 1 led to 0 21 and 0 02 depletion in 2h and 18o respectively while unit clay content increase resulted in 0 06 and 0 009 depletion in 2h and 18o respectively these results indicate that the water and clay contents are important factors that control the isotopic bias in cve extracted soil water 3 3 correction functions for cryogenic vacuum bias cve associated isotopic bias δδ correction functions were established for soil water and clay contents as significant variables and δδ can be expressed as 11 δ δ a 0 a 1 c c a 2 w c where wc is the water content g g 1 and cc is the clay content g g 1 we developed prediction functions for δδ2h and δδ18o using training datasets all regression coefficients were significantly different from zero table 3 the adjusted r2 was 0 84 and 0 60 for δδ2h and δδ18o prediction models indicating that the two factors explained 84 and 60 of the total δδ2h and δδ18o variance respectively the me values for δδ2h and δδ18o were both close to zero the rmses for δδ2h and δδ18o were 0 660 and 0 123 respectively which are both smaller than the instrument lgr measurement precision 1 0 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o table 3 the predictive performance was evaluated using validating datasets for the δδ2h and δδ18o prediction models there were little differences between the adjusted r2 me and rmse in the training and testing datasets table 3 implying a robust and stable predictive performance this can also be seen in fig 3 as the scattered points of training and validating datasets both clustered around the 1 1 line of measured versus predicted δδ and most points were located within the scope of instrument precision shadow area in addition the maximum standard error occurred at the water content of 0 25 g g 1 and clay content of 0 32 g g 1 were 1 15 for predicted δδ2h and 0 21 for predicted δδ18o eq 10 which is similar to the uncertainty of the water isotope analysis instrumentation 3 4 potential effects of cryogenic extraction biases on soil water isotope application in the following section we assess how cryogenic extraction biases for soil water could potentially alter the conclusions of previous studies we selected three cases from china loess plateau clp 1 estimation of groundwater recharge based on the cve extracted soil water isotopic composition xiang et al 2019 2 calculation of long term evaporation loss from deep soil water isotopic composition xiang et al 2021 and 3 plant water sourced from different soil layers ma et al 2019 we used eq 5 for extraction bias correction and fully replicated the original calculations we also considered the bias prediction uncertainties when evaluating the potential effects on cve obtained soil water isotope applications we compared the corrected and original data and the conclusions 3 4 1 case a groundwater recharge estimation assuming that stable isotopes from soil water and precipitation can be used to represent the isotopic signatures of the piston and preferential flows respectively xiang et al 2019 quantified dual recharge mechanisms in deep unsaturated zones their calculation was based on data average deep soil δ18o 9 80 0 03 and δ2h 73 5 0 25 where the uncertainty is expressed as sd the contributions of the piston and preferential flows through mixsiar were 62 8 and 38 8 respectively we corrected the measured stable isotopes from soil water based on the clay content of 0 21 g g 1 and average soil water content of 0 23 g g 1 lu et al 2019 the resulting corrected isotopic composition of soil water δ18o 9 55 0 19 and δ2h 70 8 1 06 was significantly higher than the respective uncorrected data p 0 05 therefore the isotopic composition of soil water deviated further from groundwater δ18o 10 15 δ2h 72 72 fig 4 than previously reported the outputs of the mixsiar model using corrected soil water isotopes showed that recharge contributions from the piston and preferential flows were 52 7 and 48 7 respectively which were significantly different from the results with uncorrected data this suggests that less piston flow but more preferential flow contributed to groundwater recharge than that reported by xiang et al 2019 3 4 2 case b soil evaporation estimation xiang et al 2021 used water stable isotopes from deep soils to estimate the regional scale long term evaporation loss at 20 sites in the clp we corrected the cryogenically extracted soil water using the average water content fig 5 a and clay content mean value of 0 15 g g 1 in deep soil and then recalculated the soil evaporation loss fraction f for all 20 sites our results showed that mean δ2h and δ18o of deep soil water had significantly changed compared to those presented by xiang et al 2021 across the study region δδ2h 3 4 1 0 and δ18o 0 3 0 1 p 0 05 based on the corrected data the line conditioned excess lc excess as defined by landwehr and coplen 2006 ranged between 12 7 and 3 2 the soil evaporation loss fraction f was calculated according to the method of xiang et al 2021 with other conditions unchanged the resulting average f ranging from 3 0 to 13 6 fig 5a was significantly smaller than that reported by xiang et al 2021 4 6 15 4 and the difference between the evaporation loss fraction δf from corrected and uncorrected soil water isotopes was significantly correlated with soil water content fig 5b 3 4 3 case c plant water source inference ma et al 2019 analyzed xylem water from apple trees as a mixture of soil water from different layers in the changwu highland 35 28 n 107 88 e where soil water is the only water source because groundwater is inaccessible to plants soil and plant water were extracted using the li 2000 system based on an average clay content of 0 23 g g 1 and water content for each layer reported in table 4 we reanalyzed the soil water isotope composition using eq 5 corrected δ2h in each soil layer differed significantly from those uncorrected p 0 05 with values changing from 54 52 to 51 89 at 0 1 m 64 86 to 62 23 at 1 2 m and 66 65 to 62 53 at 2 5 m in addition there was no significant difference in the corrected δ2h between depths at 1 2 m and 2 5 m table 4 we also increased the plant xylem water δ2h values by 8 to correct for the average bias between cryogenically extracted xylem water and source water as suggested by chen et al 2020 the corrected xylem water was consistent with that extracted by centrifugation and the value was used as true xylem water to analyze the influence of soil water isotope bias on plant water sources correction for presumed cryogenic extraction biases led to contributions of 38 32 and 30 from the three soil layers to plant water table 4 which was significantly different from those uncorrected p 0 05 with relative errors ranging from 25 to 33 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 why are water and clay contents selected to correct cryogenic extraction biases cryogenic extraction facilitates the removal of liquid water from the soil by changing the phase state of water evaporation condensation ingraham and shadel 1992 theoretically the amount of water and isotope signature added to oven dried soil should be recovered by cve if the soil water is completely extracted however recent studies have shown that extracted water represents varying degrees of depletion relative to reference water koeniger et al 2011 meisner et al 2014 orlowski et al 2016a orlowski et al 2013 walker et al 1994 which was confirmed by our results fig 1 notably residual water in the soil after oven drying inevitably alters the extracted water isotopic signature in all spiking tests adams et al 2020 newberry et al 2017 however we used 205 c as the oven dry temperature to release all bulk water with a residual water content equal to zero therefore the influence of residual water could have been removed extraction conditions are one of the most important factors for cve in soil water isotope analysis orlowski et al 2016a the heating temperature and pressure determine the evaporation capacity of the extraction system at present the heating temperature and pressure used worldwide mostly range from 90 to 115 c and between 0 1 pa and 1 kpa orlowski et al 2018 tsuruta et al 2019 however 100 c was demonstrated as insufficient to remove all bulk soil water adams et al 2020 gaj et al 2017 wang et al 2011 although low pressure can improve the evaporation capacity to a certain extent extracting water completely from the soil by heating at approximately 100 c may still be a difficult task guggenheim et al 2006 note that in our study the cve was carried out at a temperature of 95 c and air pressure of 0 01 kpa thus incomplete extraction may be an important reason for the depletion of extracted water wen et al 2021 gaj et al 2017 suggested applying 200 300 c for clay water extraction however the excessive temperature may lead to soil structure damage or water rock isotope exchange clark and fritz 1997 which could cause additional fractionation of the extracted water in addition high temperatures can cause a release of water by oxidation of organics and dihydroxylation of hydroxide containing minerals and the co extraction of organics interferes with isotope analysis orlowski et al 2018 hence it is challenging to modify conditions to match the extraction capability for recovering water completely without fractionation and to define any sort of standard extraction procedure applicable across laboratories orlowski et al 2018 beyond extraction conditions physicochemical properties of soil such as water content and texture are other important factors impacting extracted water isotopic biases the energy and properties of water depend on the distance to the mineral soil particle surface etzler 1983 and water nearest to the surface has a low matric potential or strong binding energy bogdan et al 1996 kleinberg and griffin 2005 thus more energy is needed to remove the water bounded nearest to the soil particle surface schuttlefield et al 2007 white and pichler 1959 a soil with a finer texture has a larger specific surface area and more strongly bound water under the same water content conditions in general a lower soil water content or higher clay content result in a substantial proportion of thin film water to bulk soil water and low matric potentials for a cve system limited extraction capacity induces different extraction efficiencies with varying soil water and clay contents wen et al 2021 consequently the measured isotopic depletion varied with water and clay contents fig 2 specifically increasing clay content and decreasing water content generally increased the bias δδ except for soils with clay contents between 27 and 32 fig 2a and 2c the exception may be because the specific surface area of the soil with 27 clay content was larger than that of the soil with 32 clay content as the former contains more silt than the latter table 1 water content was significantly correlated with cryogenic extraction biases fig 2b and 2d the higher the soil water content the closer the extracted water to the reference water and the more likely the measured water isotopes fall within the acceptable range in contrast the lower the soil water content the more likely the measured soil water isotopic compositions fall in the unacceptable range fig 1 this may be because for a soil with a certain soil texture the unextractable bound water content is fixed the lower the water content the larger the proportion of unextractable water to bulk water the more depleted the measured 2h and 18o from the extracted soil water in short the key to extracting bulk water from the soil is to reach a perfect balance between the evaporating energy and the adsorbing energy of soil to water cve has limited extraction capacity and unextractable bound water leads to biases although increasing the heating temperature is an effective way to improve the extraction capacity additional isotopic fractionation induced by high temperature outweighs the benefits previous research and this study showed that biases were significantly correlated with soil clay and water contents because the cryogenic vacuum extraction bias for soil water isotopes was sufficiently predictable correction equations were established based on soil water and clay contents table 3 in addition high adjusted r2 small me and rmspe values in the testing datasets showed that cve bias correction functions had a robust and stable predictive performance table 3 fig 3 although the data driven correction equation will bring uncertainty to the predicted values the maximum uncertainty of the predicted isotope bias calculated by eq 10 is similar to the uncertainty of the water isotope analyzer these results clearly suggest that the developed correction functions could provide robust predictions for cve associated soil water isotopic bias therefore correcting the cryogenic extraction biases with the water and clay contents is an effective way to improve the cve 4 2 how to consider the potential effects of vacuum extraction biases on soil water isotope application our spiking experiment results showed that 84 of the cryogenically extracted water samples fell out of the acceptable range fig 1 this means that most of the extracted water from soils inherits some cryogenic associated artifacts potentially resulting in uncertainties related to the soil water isotope inferences to show how cve bias may influence soil water isotope applications three cases were reanalyzed using bias corrected data in the three cases soil water was extracted via the same cve system li 2000 lica china as the spiking experiments in this study and soil water isotope data were used as quantitative tools to support the analysis of soil hydrological processes isotopic data of different endmembers are often used in linear endmember mixing models to quantify hydrological processes the simplest case of a linear endmember mixing model that uses one isotope ratio e g δ2h to differentiate between the relative contributions x of two sources 1 δ 1 and 2 δ 2 to a mixture δ mix is expressed as phillips and gregg 2001 12 x 1 δ mix δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 assuming negligible measurement and sampling errors the standard error se in x 1 can be calculated by gaussian error propagation with known uncertainties of the individual endmembers phillips and gregg 2001 13 s e x 1 1 δ 1 δ 2 2 se δ mix 2 x 1 2 s e δ 1 2 1 x 1 2 s e δ 2 2 however if one end member e g soil water measurement e g δ 1 is biased the estimated value can be expressed as δ 1 δ 1 δ δ where δδ represents the cve bias the resulting estimate x 1 and its se can be derived as 14 x 1 δ mix δ 2 δ 1 δ 2 15 s e x 1 1 δ 1 δ 2 2 se δ mix 2 x 1 2 s e δ 1 2 1 x 1 2 s e δ 2 2 x 1 2 se δ δ 2 note that the estimated contribution of soil water and its uncertainty both depend on the soil water isotopic bias δδ if other end members remain unchanged more specifically if soil water bias correction increases the difference between the two sources δ 1 and δ 2 the estimated x 1 will be smaller but the se may increase or decrease for instance in case a soil water and precipitation were two sources of groundwater recharge in the catchment of changwu tableland in the clp because of the vacuum extraction biases corrected soil water isotopes δ18o 9 55 0 19 δ2h 70 80 1 06 were farther away from the other source precipitation δ18o 10 07 0 88 δ2h 75 00 6 77 fig 3 this resulted in the interpretation that less recharge contribution originated from piston flow in deep soil 52 7 10 change decrease but the uncertainty was similar to the result by xiang et al 2019 62 8 this is mainly because the mean differences among groundwater deep soil water and precipitation are small 2 3 for δ2h and 0 9 δ18o but the mean biases caused by cve were much greater δδ2h 2 7 δδ18o 0 26 thus resulting in a remarkable difference from the original conclusions this interpretation is also supported by allen and kirchner 2021 they pointed out that large stem water cve bias relative to the spread in isotopic compositions among the potential end members may substantially alter plant water source implications otherwise the impact of cryogenic extraction biases may be less pronounced therefore the relative relationship between cve bias and the isotopic range among the potential end members determines the potential effects of soil water cve bias on its applications the stable isotopic compositions of water source pools and plant water provide important information on water sources and water uptake patterns ehleringer and dawson 1992 often marked differences in the isotopic composition of various water bodies make it easier to pinpoint the water source yang et al 2010 for case c plant water was sourced from three sampling depths that had a gradient of mostly decreasing δ2h values and water contents table 4 low water content in deep layers means larger cryogenic vacuum bias and bias correction elevated δ2h by 2 63 4 12 along the soil profile and significant change in soil water isotopic compositions and their contributions to plant water table 4 these results imply that the extraction of soil water from dry soils could lead to a large error in the measured isotopic composition walker et al 1994 necessitating cve bias correction in addition a recent study found that the vacuum extraction bias for plant water though negligible for δ18o is even greater for δ2h with a mean value of 8 chen et al 2020 compared with cve biases δδ2h ranges from 2 to 6 for soil water the measurement error in the isotopic composition of plant water δ2h brings greater uncertainty allen and kirchner 2021 in short isotopic bias caused by cve for both soil water and xylem water should be taken seriously in isotope based plant water source inference especially under low water conditions in addition to tracing water transport storage and mixing as conservative tracers in the vadose zone soil stable water isotopes also reflect evaporation losses through the progressive enrichment in 18o and 2h in the remaining liquid evaporation leaves a characteristic signature on the isotopic composition of soil water water undergoes fractionation by evaporation and in dual isotope space it plots below the local meteoric water line resulting in a negative lc conditioned excess based on precipitation and deep soil water isotopes case b estimated the long term soil evaporation loss fraction f at 20 sites across the clp combining an isotope mass balance model with lc excess the study region covers semi arid and arid climates with mean deep soil water contents ranging from 6 to 22 fig 4 which was similar to the soil water content range 5 to 25 determined in our experiment our results showed that low water content led to a large cve bias for measured soil water isotopes up to 6 7 for δ2h and 0 8 for δ18o we assumed that all soil water isotope biases due to cve can be corrected using eq 5 the correction resulted in significantly more enriched soil water isotopic compositions but less negative lc excess than for the uncorrected ones evaporation loss f estimated using corrected soil water isotopes ranged from 3 0 to 13 6 fig 5a which was significantly smaller than those reported by xiang et al 2021 furthermore lower soil water content led to greater cve bias effects on the evaporation calculation fig 5b these results suggest that cve bias is critical for estimating soil evaporation loss and particular caution should be taken for calculations involving low soil water content conditions evaluation of bias correction effects in three studies of soil water isotope based quantitative implications on clp indicated that cve induced bias may lead to significantly different results although soil water cryogenic extraction biases depend on their physicochemical properties e g water content and texture uncertainties may be exaggerated within models we suggest that soil physicochemical properties e g water content and texture and wide ranges among different end members should be investigated when cve is applied for soil water isotope analysis as is known clay and water content are the key factors controlling the amount of bound or unextractable water in the soil wen et al 2021 and soil water isotopic fractionation is mainly due to incomplete extraction at 95 c in cve system thus our bias correction equations were established based on clay and water content for a cve system with heating temperature at 95 c because of the widely used extraction heating temperature around 95 c and two easy to measure soil properties the bias correction equation developed in this study should have wide utility however previous studies have shown that mineral composition of soil may affect the fractionation of soil water isotope especially on 18o for example oerter et al 2014 found that k ca2 mg2 led to weak oxygen fractionation of soil water besides water rock isotopic exchange could occur in high temperature system clark and fritz 1997 leading to 18o drift in water and high temperature 200 c is recently adopted by some laboratories to improve the soil water extraction however high temperature may lead to organic matter decomposition thus additional effects of organics and minerals on isotopic fractionation need to be considered for soils with high organic matter content and for cve systems using excessive heating temperature 5 conclusions consistent with previous studies we demonstrated that cryogenically extracted soil water is depleted compared to reference water and water and clay contents are the main factors for extraction biases we established correction functions for cryogenic extraction biases and evaluated their potential effects on soil water isotope applications the main conclusions are as follows 1 cryogenic vacuum extraction at 95 c and 0 01 kpa led to different degrees of depletion for extracted water relative to reference water with 84 of the extracted water samples falling outside the acceptable range 2 the water and clay contents significantly altered the extracted soil water isotopic composition relative to the reference water the lower the water content and the higher the clay content the larger the extraction biases for soil water the biases can be corrected through an established relationship with water and clay contents 3 cryogenic extraction biases significantly affected the interpretation of soil water isotope compositions regarding the estimation of groundwater recharge soil evaporation loss and plant water sources this study developed a correction method for cve induced biases for soil water stable isotopic compositions and provides guidance for future work this method could potentially alleviate the bias induced by cve effectively widening the application of water stable isotopes in soils however it may be necessary to consider the potential effects of extraction biases in the context of soil properties and isotopic differences among potential endmembers when cryogenic vacuum extraction is used as a pre treatment before isotope analysis credit authorship contribution statement mingyi wen conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology validation

4058,bathymetric mapping for an accurate estimation of stored water volume in drying lakes is a key information for an effective monitoring of their recession or restoration status extraction of bathymetry in shallow saline lakes using remote sensing techniques has always been challenging due to the complex influences imposed by the physical properties of substrate and the spatial variability of salinity in this study we developed a machine learning based model to quantify the implicit non linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance by leveraging extensive in situ data and high resolution satellite imagery we trained and tested the learning model in the hyper saline lake urmia lu which faced catastrophic drying over the past two decades to this end we used landsat 8 imagery and 32 984 hydrography data points surveyed by the urmia lake restoration program ulrp from 2017 to 2020 during six stages to enhance the model accuracy we tuned the model inputs by optimizing the spectral information and clustering in situ data from stages with similar meteorological conditions into three classes the results demonstrated the high accuracy of the developed intelligent model as evidenced by r2 0 8 0 9 and rmse 7 8 17 9 cm for the three models we found that the average water depth in the lu was increased from 0 43 m in september 2018 to 2 00 m in may 2020 in particular the lake water volume in may 2020 was 3 6 times greater than that in february 2019 which marks a remarkable shift in the lu restoration dynamic bathymetric maps also witnessed considerable salt dissolution taking place across the lake during this period finally we extracted the lu level area relationship by processing 172 landsat images between 1984 and 2020 which was validated against the field data surveyed along the lake water boundary in 2019 the results indicated that the level area relationship follows a dual linear relationship separated at the water level of 1271 31 m keywords

activities such as extensive agriculture development than climate variability have witnessed a much greater contribution to the drying of these lakes wurtsbaugh et al 2017 having caused serious adverse impacts on water quality bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 human health sadeghi bazargani et al 2019 and biota diversity stenger kovács et al 2014 implementation of restoration activities is indispensable to guarantee the long term sustainability of these environments continuous monitoring of water storage in a reviving lake is the most reliable tool to assess the success of the employed restoration plans estimating water balance components i e direct precipitation on the lake evaporation rate and inflows from and outflows to surface and groundwater can yield the change in water storage however this is often challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating these variables by empirical relationships or numerical models using ground measurements and or space borne data gronewold et al 2020 winter 1981 alternatively we can directly estimate the stored water volume of an aquatic system from its geometry given the underlying bed topography called bathymetry the bathymetry of saline lakes can be highly dynamic in both space and time due to the fluctuating rates of salt precipitation and dissolution as such recursive bathymetric delineation of these environments is necessary for an appropriate estimation of their stored water volume over time we can derive bathymetric maps traditionally by shipboard acoustic echo sounding using single or multi beam sonar despite its high accuracy this technique is costly time consuming and labor intensive especially for surveying shallow waters due to the decreased swath width dierssen and theberge 2014 instead active and passive remote sensing rs contextualized into imaging and non imaging methods have been widely used to extract bathymetric maps e g bian et al 2018 cahalane et al 2019 gao 2009 stewart et al 2016 in contrast to traditional approaches rs has facilitated a fast low cost and extended spatial coverage over areas that may not be accessible for ground measurements the most common sensing techniques for bathymetry derivation are based on optical rs i e multispectral or hyperspectral imagery e g klonowski 2007 ma et al 2020 pacheco et al 2015 light detection and ranging lidar e

have been developed for deriving bathymetry information using rs data captured by the above techniques in particular the models based on optical rs e g the lyzenga model lyzenga 1978 lyzenga 1985 lyzenga et al 2006 the jupp model jupp 1988 and the stumpf model stumpf et al 2003 hold the most frequent applications over a variety of water bodies former extensive studies have shown that the accuracy of water depth h estimation from these algorithms depends strongly on the heterogeneity in water turbidity reflective properties of substrate and water depth variation see jawak et al 2015 and referenced therein for a comprehensive review of the accuracy advantages drawbacks and the domain of applicability of these models here we further argue that in addition to the underlying assumptions of the above models their simple linear or ratio transform structure cannot adequately explain the integrated influence of the physical properties of water and substrate across an image extent in addition these algorithms typically use a fraction of spectral information available from airborne data to tackle these limitations we can leverage fine tuned machine learning algorithms to develop non linear relationships between multi spectral data and in situ measurements of water depth under a wide range of conditions these algorithms include but are not limited to artificial neural networks ann ceyhun and yalçın 2010 gholamalifard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 moses et al 2013 sandidge and holyer 1998 random forest manessa et al 2016 sagawa et al 2019 yunus et al 2019 support vector machine misra et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and ensemble regression trees using bootstrap aggregation and least squares boosting mohamed et al 2017 the findings of these studies unanimously demonstrate that machine learning based algorithms show an improved performance in deriving bathymetric maps as compared to those obtained by other traditional approaches in this study we developed a learning based model to decipher the dynamics of bathymetry in the reviving hyper saline shallow lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that leveraged the most recent extensive in situ hydrography measurements to derive bathymetric maps between 2017 and 2020 regarding the outdated bathymetry being currently used to monitor the lake water volume the new findings yield a more reliable insight into evaluating the restoration status of lu over the recent years we further present the most updated level area relationship in the lu by extracting the lake surface area with the aid of high resolution satellite imagery between 1984 and 2020 we validated the employed classification algorithm against the lake boundary data surveyed at multiple traces in 2019 in contrast to previous studies the developed level area volume relationship describes the most dry and wet conditions of the lake during the last 50 years the rest of this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the study area and describes the in situ measurements and rs data used for the purpose of this study in this section we also outline the methodology to map bathymetry section 3 presents the results and section 4 discusses the findings by focusing on i the revisited level area volume relationship in the lu ii the influence of bathymetry and rs data quality on the accuracy of the water depth prediction model and iii the dynamics of salt precipitation and dissolution in the lu finally section 5 concludes with the study findings 2 methods and data 2 1 study area lu is located in the northwest of iran 37 04 n to 38 16 n 45 02 e to 46 00 e which receives freshwater from several rivers draining twelve sub basins in the 52 000 km2 lake urmia basin fig 1 a registered as a protected area 1967 a national park 1971 a ramsar site 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 lu is recognized as one of the wetlands of international importance it is also well known for its hyper salinity where the salt concentration has recorded fluctuations between 140 g l and 380 g l zeinoddini et al 2009 recent field investigations of the lake sedimentology reveal salt deposits on the lake bottom fig 1e ranging a few centimeters in the south up to three meters in the north lahijani et al 2020 lu is partly separated by the 15 km kalantari causeway and bridge fig 1b which has intervened the water circulation and mixing between the northern and southern parts the intra annual variation of salinity across the lu demonstrates two patterns of salinity distribution while the distribution of salinity concentration in the southern and northern parts becomes distinct in high flow months a relatively uniform distribution is observed during dry months across the whole lu bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 historical record of the lu water level h indicates that the lake lost about eight meters of water between 1996 and 2016 fig 1f which was equivalent to a loss of 33 bcm of water several former studies have pointed out the major reasons for the drastic decline of lu they include intensive agricultural development the imbalance between water supply and demand decreased environmental flow by the improper operation of reservoirs illegal withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources and low irrigation efficiency in the lake urmia basin this mostly human made shrinkage led to a wide range of environmental and socioeconomic problems such as desertification increased soil salinity in the agricultural areas near the lake disturbance in the ecological condition of the lake biota e g artemia and increased unemployment rate due to recession in agricultural activities see danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 and references therein to cease the drying trend of lu urmia lake restoration national committee has planned and implemented several basin management practices to increase inflow into the lu since 2013 reducing agriculture water allocation stream dredging to increase the delivering capacity of the rivers feeding the lake fig 1c and artificial channelization in the southern sub basins of the lake which provide more than 50 of the lake annual inflow fig 1d are among such actions urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2018 as a result the streamflow rate into the lake is supposed to increase and cause enhanced sediment yield accordingly which is spatially variable depending on the sediment rating curve of each river flowing into the lake moreover the increased volume of freshwater flow leads to salt dissolution in high flow seasons especially near the inlet zones while salt precipitation dominates in the dry seasons with spatiotemporally different rates the interplay between sedimentation salt precipitation and salt dissolution processes makes the lakebed topography dynamic which clearly changes the lake level volume relationship over time 2 2 hydrography data we used hydrography data collected from six surveys that were carried out by multiple sources between september 2017 and may 2020 table 1 gives the date location and source of the surveyed data the iranian institute of space research mechanics isrc carried out the first to fifth surveys during september 23 october 22 2017 march 6 april 20 2018 july 7 september 9 2018 september 23 december 21 2018 and february 24 march 16 2019 respectively in which water depth at 4894 6273 684 1629 and 8485 points were surveyed using a combination of echo sounder and rtk gps the first second and fourth surveys were conducted along 12 paths of 10 km separated by 500 m centered on the kalantari causeway in the third and fifth surveys data were collected along 12 and 24 paths with different lengths across the whole lake respectively the sixth survey was operated by the darya naghsheh consulting engineers during may 17 may 27 2020 by which 11 019 points were surveyed by an echo sounder across the whole lake we received the raw hydrography data mentioned above from the urmia lake restoration program ulrp to compute the lakebed elevation from the measured h data we used daily h data recorded by a hydrostatic recording gauge at the golmankhaneh station this station was originally located on the midwestern shore of the lu 37 36 03 n 45 15 31 e gs1 in fig 1a however due to the lake level fall the station was relocated to the lake center near the kalantari bridge 37 47 26 n 45 22 07 e in august 2008 gs2 in fig 1a 2 3 satellite data we used landsat 4 5 tm collection 2 level 2 and landsat 8 oli tirs collection 2 level 2 products to delineate the lu surface area from 1984 to 2020 we derived the bathymetric maps from 2017 to 2020 using landsat 8 imagery level 2 products give surface reflectance values that already corrects the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption landsat collection 2 2021 for each period during which hydrography data were collected we downloaded a satellite image from usgs earth explorer if a cloud free image was not available in a survey period we used the closest image to that period window as such satellite images recorded on september 14 2017 april 26 2018 september 17 2018 december 22 2018 february 24 2019 and may 17 2020 were used for the first to sixth periods respectively we used the ultra blue 0 43 0 45 µm blue 0 45 0 51 µm green 0 53 0 59 µm and red 0 64 0 67 µm bands of landsat 8 for the analysis explained in section 2 6 2 4 extraction of lake water body to derive the bathymetric maps at multiple times as well as to update the lake level area volume relationship we first needed to determine the water boundary of the lake at the time of satellite image being used to this end we used the k means clustering which is an unsupervised learning algorithm for a quick classification of an image into a desired number of feature classes likas et al 2003 the k means clustering groups a dataset ω comprised of n vectors of v i 1 i n into a k number of clusters defined by the user each vector v i represents a pixel and each element of v i vi ω 1 ω m carries a characteristic of the pixel to cluster ω this method first chooses k arbitrary vectors cl c 1 c k as the centroids of the k clusters similar to v i each cl c consists of m characteristics denoted as clc ω 1 ω m each pixel in ω is then assigned to one of the k clusters based on the minimum euclidean distance between the pixel s characteristics and the cluster centroids the euclidean distance ed between the vector v i and the cluster centroid cl c is computed as alfakih 2018 1 e d v i c l c v i 1 cl c 1 2 v i 2 cl c 2 2 v i m cl c m 2 when the first clustering of all pixels is complete the centroid of each cluster is updated and the iterative relocation is repeated until the centroid of each cluster is insignificantly different from its previous value data from multiple bands or their combination such as normalized difference water index ndwi modified normalized difference water index mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi automated water extraction index awei and albedo α can be used as the training input to the classification algorithm while former studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of water body detection to the above indices feyisa et al 2014 mcfeeters 1996 xu 2006 the accuracy is case specific due to the impact of water constituents and substrate characteristics on the reflected energy from the water surface sun et al 2017 as such we tested different combinations of the above indices with different numbers of k means clusters to extract the water body that best describes the true water body boundaries using the surveyed lake boundary data due to the presence of some natural or artificial features in the lu buffer zone such as artificial channels the extracted water body identifies these features as water pixels too to exclude these features from the lake water body we implemented a square shaped sliding median filter of window size 11 11 on a given classified image by moving the filter across the image each pixel s value was replaced by the median value of its adjacent pixels this process would assign a zero value to those water pixels that are dominantly surrounded by non water pixels thus confining the lake s true water body given the extracted water bodies from 1984 to 2020 the time series of lu surface area was computed based on the image pixel size which was 30 m for the landsat images used in this study 2 5 survey data on the lake boundary to validate the approach adopted in section 2 4 for delineating the lu water boundary we conducted three field surveys on july 15 and july 17 2019 in which the geographic location of 765 points along the lake water boundary was surveyed by the garmin etrex vista hcx handheld gps device the device positioning error is smaller than 10 m the maximum error of this device is one third of the landsat s spatial resolution i e 30 m hence the device accuracy was enough for tracing the lu water boundary we chose the above survey timeframe 1 to minimize the lag time between data collection and the pass of landsat 8 satellite over the lu on july 18 2019 and 2 to ensure a cloud free condition based on the weather forecast fig 2 a c depict the three surveyed paths mapped on a true color image from landsat 8 on july 18 2019 we surveyed the 1 67 km path 1 in red and 1 41 km path 2 in green on the eastern shore of the lu from mid to north and south respectively path 3 in yellow was surveyed by 1 63 km on the western shoreline towards the south 2 6 lake bathymetry derivation in this section we present the framework used for the derivation of bathymetric maps in the lu the proposed methodology is not restricted to lu and can be employed in other environments of interest in section 2 6 1 we outline the procedure for pre processing of the surveyed bathymetry data in section 2 6 2 we briefly describe the developed ann model which builds the relationship between water depth and water surface reflectance given a number of reflectance data at different bands from satellite imagery the proposed approach for finding the optimum input band combination is described in section 2 6 3 finally in section 2 6 4 we further explain how different sets of hydrography data were clustered as the training data of the machine learning model to improve estimation accuracy 2 6 1 pre processing of hydrography data we performed a thorough pre processing on the surveyed hydrography data to identify inappropriate data and exclude them from the training and testing dataset used in the machine learning model we mainly considered two types of data as inappropriate data first given the water body extent from section 2 4 there is a possibility that some surveyed points near the lake shoreline fall beyond the extracted water boundary this can be due to 1 the error in the classification results at very shallow water depths 2 the time gap between hydrography survey and satellite image acquisition and 3 the error in recording the field data in either cases these points were identified and excluded from the rest of the analysis second we examined the existence of any outliers in the remaining data to this end we used the concept of mahalanobis distance and computed it for each observation in a given survey as 2 md y μ t s 1 y μ where md denotes the mahalanobis distance between the multivariate observation y and its mean μ and s represents the covariance matrix of y for each data point y includes the measured water depth as well as reflectance values from the selected satellite bands since md 2 has a chi square distribution we considered those data with p value 0 001 in the chi square test as outlier and excluded them from the dataset several former studies have suggested this approach as a robust and reliable method for the detection of outliers in multivariate parameters e g li and jain 2009 2 6 2 artificial neural network ann model architecture training and testing ann is a supervised machine learning model that distributes data on inter neuronal links to find the relationship between the model input and output da silva et al 2017 a neural network architecture is composed of an input layer hidden layer s and an output layer fig 3 shows the structure of the ann model developed in this study which includes two hidden layers each layer of the neural network is made up of units called neurons the neurons in the input layer first hidden layer second hidden layer and the output layer are denoted by p 1 p p m 1 m m n 1 n n and q 1 q q respectively where p m n and q are the total number of neurons in the input layer first hidden layer second hidden layer and the output layer respectively p equals to the number of input variables which is the number of spectral bands in this study and q 1 for the network shown in fig 3 the input variables to the neural network i e reflectance values from different bands are multiplied by certain relating weights and are then treated as the inputs of the neurons in the first hidden layer this process can be expressed as 3 i m h 1 p w p m h 1 b l x p b m where i m h 1 is the input variable to neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 w p m h 1 is the weight of the link that connects neuron p in the input layer to neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 b l x p is the reflectance value from band l 1 l l at locations x xg 1 g g that enters neuron p l equals to the total number of bands xg is the location of pixel g in a given satellite image g is the total number of pixels in the image and b m is a constant value belonging to neuron m each neuron m in the first hidden layer applies a non linear activation function to the input according to the following equation 4 o m h 1 1 1 e x p i m h 1 where o m h 1 is the output value of neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 the above function known as the sigmoid function is one of the most widely used activation functions in the context of multilayer perceptron neural network e g choudhary et al 2010 although the activation function is a key parameter in a neural network functioning if the developed ann model is trained successfully with appropriate sufficient inputs different activation functions are not expected to impose significant influence on the accuracy of the outcome feng and lu 2019 similar to the first hidden layer the input to the second hidden layer h 2 can be written as 5 i n h 2 m w m n h 2 o m h 1 b n where i n h 2 is the input variable to neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 w m n h 2 is the weight of the link that connects neuron m in the first hidden layer to neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 and b n is a constant value belonging to neuron n each neuron n in the second hidden layer applies the same activation function to its input which ultimately gives 6 o n h 2 1 1 e x p i n h 2 where o n 2 is the output of neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 finally the input of the output layer which is indeed the output of the neural network can be written as 7 d x pred n w n q h 2 o n h 2 ε where d x pred is the predicted water depth at locations x w n q h 2 is the weight of the link that connects neuron n in the second hidden layer to neuron q 1 in the output layer and ε is a constant value relating to the output layer s neuron from the above formulation we observe that the developed ann model contains six parameters i e w p m h 1 w m n h 2 w n q h 2 b m b n and ε these parameters were calibrated such that the following objective function is minimized 8 min g 1 g d x g pred d x g obs 2 where d x g obs is the measured water depth at location x g we used the back propagation algorithm to train the ann model this technique is a common approach for training an ann structure the main advantage of this scheme is the low computational cost for the training process and its reliable accuracy in most of the applications chauvin and rumelhart 1995 to determine the optimum structure of the ann we adopted the forward selection approach through a serious of monte carlo simulations han et al 2011 to this end we first considered one hidden layer and found the best number of neurons in the first layer by testing a relatively wide range of neurons after setting the number of optimum neurons in the first layer we added a new hidden layer and found the optimum number of neurons for the new layer by testing different number of neurons the above process was repeated until adding a new layer with any number of neurons did not increase the prediction accuracy significantly in addition we employed the k fold cross validation method with ten folds for the model training and testing purposes han et al 2011 this method yields a more realistic model accuracy by using different parts of the training data as compared to those approaches that select a random portion of data for training and the rest for model testing to implement the k fold cross validation method we first divided the training data into 10 seeds where data from the nine seeds were used to train the model and data in the tenth seed were used to test the model the training and testing processes were then repeated 10 times such that in each iteration a unique combination of the nine seeds for training and one seed for testing were utilized this guarantees the consideration of all non repetitive combinations for model training and testing after completing each process the model accuracy for training and testing was recorded separately finally the average accuracy of 10 training and 10 testing processes was considered as the final accuracy of the model in the training and testing respectively here we note that the uncertainty of prediction may be remarkable in the very shallow water depths near the lake water boundary or near the isolated land features within the lake body to avoid the issue of masking the results we filtered the model outputs based on the following criteria given the hydrography points surveyed in each period we extracted the albedo of every point from landsat 8 and plotted albedo against water depth the relationship between these two quantities has a declining trend with more scattering in smaller water depths for each period we determined the water depth below which albedo showed a very narrow variation given these thresholds of water depth and albedo we filtered those model outputs with water depth and albedo larger than their relating thresholds this filtering ensures eliminating the wrong estimation of large water depths in very shallow areas 2 6 3 finding the optimum input band combination the optimum input band combination is defined as the combination that gives the largest accuracy in estimating water depth using the developed ann model various compositions of mainly ultra blue ub blue green and red bands have been used in similar previous studies to extract bathymetric maps using optical sensors e g kabiri 2017 karimi and bagheri 2016 knudby et al 2016 pacheco et al 2015 yunus et al 2019 however we performed a comprehensive analysis via a series of monte carlo simulations to take into account all possible band compositions as the input of the ann model to this end we considered different combinations of the first seven bands of landsat 8 as the alternative inputs to the model which included 127 different inputs for each set the error of the ann model in the testing process was calculated and finally the band composition resulted in the least error was used as optimum input to derive the bathymetric maps 2 6 4 clustering the training dataset to improve water depth prediction to improve water depth prediction we clustered the hydrography data from all six surveys into three groups the first group includes data of the first and third surveys at the end of summer and early autumn the second group includes data of the second and sixth surveys in late winter and early spring and the third group includes data of the fourth and fifth surveys in autumn and early winter the basis of this clustering was the similarity of atmospheric conditions as well as the angle of sunlight for each group which diminishes the variation in the reflectance values table 2 shows the average air temperature as a surrogate for the angle of sunlight average pressure and average relative humidity during the hydrography surveys we observe that those periods aggregated into one category have a similar condition in terms of the above meteorological characteristics we acknowledge that several other factors besides the angle of sunlight also influence the surface temperature however since the angle of sunlight is one determining factor of the energy reaching the earth s surface the proximity of air temperature can be considered as the proximity of the angle of solar radiation in each data category 3 results 3 1 the accuracy of extracted water bodies having tested different numbers of clusters in the k means algorithm we found that three clusters yielded the most accurate results in delineating the lake water body we also observed that the combined use of mndwi and albedo could successfully delineate the lake water boundary as contrasted against the three surveyed paths see fig 2 the euclidean distance between the extracted lake water boundary and the surveyed paths is 26 m 17 m and 4 m for paths 1 to 3 respectively which is smaller than the image pixel size visual inspection of the extracted water body on july 18 2019 against the relating rgb satellite image further confirms that the k means algorithm could precisely extract the lake water body we note that the euclidean distance from the k mean clustering for path 3 is smaller than that for path 1 and path 2 we attribute such different accuracies to a few possible causes first the location of the lake water boundary is different between the time of field data collection and the satellite image acquisition indeed there was a three day gap between the time of surveyed water boundary along paths 1 and 2 i e july 15 2019 and the satellite passage i e july 18 2019 while it was only 1 day gap for path 3 which was surveyed on july 17 2019 regarding the lake fluctuation in h from 1271 69 m on july 15 2019 to 1271 67 m on july 18 2019 we expect a smaller difference between the observed and extracted water boundaries along path 3 as compared to the other two paths we also noticed a windy condition on july 15 2019 which further contributed to larger fluctuations along the lake shoreline on this day second high soil moisture near saturation condition left by diurnal lake water recession can be another source of error third the lakebed topography has a milder slope in the eastern than the western side of the lake therefore a small rising or falling of the lake level can project into a larger progression or recession in the shore zone here we note that using ndwi thresholding as a reduced complexity approach is also very common for distinguishing water from non water pixels nevertheless since the lu water depth is very shallow near the boundaries and the salt deposits nearby the shoreline are almost saturated it is expected that accurate delineation of the lake boundary from this approach would be challenging and might lead to unrealistic results to examine this issue we used the average ndwi of all pixels along the three surveyed paths as the threshold to extract the water body extent we found that the extracted lake water body was significantly larger than reality especially in the southwestern part of the lake we further performed the same analysis at other multiple instances with different lake surface extent which yielded the same conclusion therefore using the same ndwi threshold for the extraction of water body at different times does not yield appropriate results particularly in shallow environments this highlights the necessity to tune the appropriate value of the ndwi threshold for each given image which would be very time consuming given the number of images to be processed in a long term study period 3 2 a threshold behavior in the lake urmia level area relationship fig 4 a shows the developed relationship between the lu surface area a and h obtained from processing 172 satellite images i e 75 images from landsat 4 5 and 97 images from landsat 8 we observe that two linear relationships with different slopes hold between a and h which are expressed as 9 a 2306 5 h 2930000 h 1271 31 m 10 a 351 65 h 443346 h 1271 31 m where a is in km2 and h is in m above the mean sea level both relationships are statistically significant with the coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 99 the two fitted lines intersect at h 1271 31 m the mean absolute error mae of the first and second relationship is 55 46 and 48 82 km2 respectively which is equivalent to 3 21 and 1 07 of the average a below and above h 1271 31 m respectively the root mean square error rmse of a estimates from equations 9 and 10 is 73 64 and 69 45 km2 which is equivalent to 3 57 and 1 45 of the average a below and above h 1271 31 m respectively here we observe that for h level less than 1271 31 m a changes in a sharper rate with h while this rate is milder for h larger than this threshold this observation motivates the hypothesis that the east west profiles of the lakebed are comprised of two trapezoids intersecting at the elevations close to 1271 31 m our preliminary investigations of some cross sectional profiles computed from the hydrography data support this hypothesis however since the available hydrography data do not include complete profiles across the entire lake we are far from making a general conclusion about this observation and further exploration is left for future research fig 4b compares the results of the present study with the results obtained by the single fourth order polynomial a l relationship developed by karimi and bagheri 2016 as h 4 14 a 4 5 10 a 3 2 6 a 2 0 0042 a 1267 we observe that the former relationship overestimates and underestimates a at h values smaller and larger than 1270 74 m respectively as compared to equations 9 and 10 as h increases the difference between the results decreases until they become negligible near h 1278 m on average the difference between the results of two studies is about 10 7 which can be attributed to i the source of satellite images and ii the approaches employed for the extraction of the lake water body utilization of landsat imagery with a much finer spatial resolution in the present study as compared to avhrr and modis imagery with 1000 m and 500 m spatial resolution respectively used in karimi and bagheri 2016 resulted in a much improved delineation of the lake water body in addition the former relationship was obtained by examining 78 images from 1972 to 2014 while the present study used 172 images from 1984 to 2020 including data from those years when the lake surface was minimum due to the dramatic drying finally unlike the former study our extracted water body in the lu was validated against the field data which adds confidence in the computed surface areas 3 3 spatial distribution of measured water depth having filtered the raw surveyed hydrography data table 3 gives the average minimum and maximum of the remaining measured water depth in each survey for the whole lake northern half and southern half separately we observe that after screening the raw data there is still a sufficient set of data i e 32 984 data points from all surveys which could be effectively used to build the predictive model of water depth it is also noteworthy that the average measured water depth in the sixth survey is remarkably larger than that in the other five surveys we will investigate this observation in further details in section 3 6 3 4 the ann model accuracy for estimating water depth table 4 presents the ann model accuracy for some selected input band combinations that yielded the most accurate results by using the first group of processed hydrography data described in section 2 6 4 as the training data we observe that the combination of ub blue green and red bands resulted in the highest accuracy in estimating the water depth mae 3 6 cm the results not shown here obtained by using the second and third group of hydrography data yielded the same conclusion table 4 also reveals that if only one band is used as the model input the green band gives the highest accuracy mae 9 1 cm this can be attributed to the lu greenish color in most months which results in a high reflection of electromagnetic waves in this band as compared to the other visible bands in the case of selecting two bands as the model input the blue and green bands as compared to other two band combinations give the most accurate results in expressing the lu water depth changes mae 7 6 cm finally three band combination of ub blue and green gives the least mae equal to 6 6 cm a couple of points are worth mentioning here first increasing the number of selected bands does not necessarily lead to enhanced accuracy of water depth estimation for instance selection of all landsat 8 satellite bands non thermal bands provided less accuracy than the selection of the first four bands also selection of the green band alone provided higher accuracy than the selection of the main two band combinations second in many previous studies e g kabiri 2017 pacheco et al 2015 yunus et al 2019 the blue band has been proposed in combination with other bands to estimate water depth while we found the green band more effective in our study area this indicates that in the rs of aquatic environments there is no optimal band combination that necessarily applies to all water bodies the presence of different solutes or suspended substances plays an important role in differentiating the optimal properties of water from one aquatic system to another using the band combination of ub blue green and red as the input of the ann model the final three models were built for the three groups of hydrography data separately table 5 gives the accuracy of the models in the training and testing processes we observe that the highest accuracy was obtained from the first group of data that were collected at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn the mae of the testing process for the first second and third groups of data is 3 3 cm 9 7 cm and 12 1 cm respectively the rmse in the same process for the first second and third groups of data is 7 7 cm 15 6 cm and 17 9 cm respectively all statistical measures confirm the high accuracy of the developed models the in situ data clustering approach used in this study witnessed the high accuracy of water depth prediction alternatively other approaches could also be employed to use the hydrography data for training and testing the prediction model for instance we could use the data collected in each period to train the ann model for that period and generate the relating bathymetric map this approach suffers a couple of drawbacks first at some data collection periods i e the first second and fourth surveys the collected data were concentrated around the causeway regarding the lu s approximate length of 130 km in april 2019 and its large area it is expected that the variability of lakebed topography and chemical properties of the lake water induce considerable impact on the spectral properties of the lake water from north to south therefore the spectral behavior of the lake around the causeway cannot be attributed to the whole lake indeed when a neural network model is trained using any of the data from the first second and fourth surveys the output of the model learns the relationship between spectral behavior and water depth in only the same period consequently by applying each trained model to extract water depth or bathymetric maps in the whole lake we cannot expect appropriate estimations in other places than near the causeway the second drawback of this approach is that the depth data collected in some survey periods may only cover a certain range of depths for instance the minimum depth measured in the sixth survey was 118 cm hence it can be expected that a model developed solely using data from the sixth survey cannot estimate the shallow depths especially near the lake shoreline considering the above issues it can be concluded that the approach of using data from each period to extract the water depth map of the same period is not suitable and cannot properly describe the whole lake condition the second possible approach was to combine data from all six surveys and develop a single model to generate bathymetric maps for each period this approach has also limitations because at different times of a year spectral patterns change in a water body indeed since the angle and intensity of the sun s illumination change over time different radiations can be received by the satellite sensor for the same water depth in addition changes in the air humidity and the constituent particles of the atmosphere in different seasons of a year further influence the amount of reflection received by satellite therefore using the second approach to build a single model for the whole year can also impose remarkable errors in deriving the bathymetric maps 3 5 dynamics of water depth change in lake urmia fig 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of estimated water depth in the lu on september 14 2017 april 26 2018 september 17 2018 december 22 2018 february 24 2019 and may 17 2020 table 6 further gives the average and the coefficient of variation cv of water depth in the whole lake the northern half and southern half separately comparing the lake maps between the third and sixth stages as the driest and wettest stages in the study period respectively indicates a considerable increase in the lake surface area in 2020 when the two islands in the south were surrounded by the lake water the results indicate that the average water depth in the lu was 0 62 m 0 57 m 0 43 m 0 53 m 0 86 m and 2 00 m in the survey stages one to six respectively h at the relating periods was 1270 32 m 1270 75 m 1270 27 m 1270 54 m 1270 82 m and 1271 91 m respectively this indicates that in general the average water depth in the lake increases with the increase in h the exception to this observation is the change of water depth in between surveys one and two when the lake level increased by 0 43 m while the average lake water depth changed very slightly according to table 6 the average water depth in the south half was increased during this period while the opposite took place in the north half together with the decreased cv of water depth in the whole lake it seems that the lakebed topography became uniform during this period which is also evident in fig 5b we also observe that the average water depth in the northern half is larger than that in the southern half in the survey periods one two and six while the reserve holds in the survey periods three and five in the fourth period there is a negligible difference between the average water depths in the two halves which implies that the variability of water depth across the whole lake has a similar pattern this is confirmed by the cv of water depth which is almost the same in the north and south halves and thus the whole lake we further note that the cv of water depth with respect to the whole lake changed from 0 80 in the first survey period to 0 32 in the sixth survey period such a considerable decrease in cv is concurrent with the increase of 1 59 m in h which implies that by increasing the volume of inflow to the lake the spatial variability of water depth decreases indeed in the sixth period when the lake recorded the highest level since 2010 there is a slight difference between the cv of water depth across the lake i e 0 28 for the northern half and 0 32 for the southern half in contrast in the first period when the lake experienced one of its historically lowest levels the cv of water depth is considerably different between the northern and southern halves as evidenced by 0 77 against 0 47 respectively this is mainly because of the diminished flow exchange between the two halves in this period which was due to the significant reduction in the lake inflow from the southern feeding rivers the impact of increased flow velocity on the lakebed local scouring in the vicinity of the kalantari bridge is also clear in all water depth maps fig 5h indicates a zoomed in image of the lake water depth at the location of the bridge where water exchange between the northern and southern halves takes place it is seen that the extent of the local scoured area in the south north direction is about 3 km while the width of the scour is about 1 3 km and 2 4 km in the northern and southern sides of the bridge respectively we explored the scour region in all the other maps and found similar observations given the counter clockwise direction of flow in the lu safavi et al 2020 we observe that the return flow from north to south could scour the lakebed in the transverse direction to a larger extent than that caused by the south north flow in fig 5g we further show the spatial variability of salinity concentration around the bridge in march 2019 bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 as a cross reference for the lake dynamics in this region it is obviously seen how the saltier water from the north concentrates the lake water in the scoured zone we note that the spatial scale of the zone shown in fig 5g is larger than that in fig 5h due to the other processes that influence salt dispersion given the water depth maps we can derive the bathymetric maps by subtracting each map from the relating lake water elevation we refused to report the derived bathymetric maps as their spatial variation is the same as that for the water depth maps however we discuss how they can be used to study the dynamics of salt precipitation and dissolution in section 4 3 3 6 water level vs stored volume in lake urmia fig 6 shows h versus stored water volume in the lu between 2017 and 2020 the six color points on this plot relate to the volumes that were estimated from the bathymetric maps derived in section 3 5 the dotted blue curve shows the predictive relationship between the h and volume as proposed by the former and only relevant study in the lu water research institute 2015 which was derived for the lake s very dry condition we estimated the lake volume in surveys one to six as 0 77 bcm 1 27 bcm 0 45 bcm 0 79 bcm 1 96 bcm and 7 0 bcm respectively while the predictive relationship gives 1 14 bcm 2 01 bcm 1 23 bcm 1 56 bcm 2 18 bcm and 5 25 bcm respectively both results witness that the lake volume during survey six may 2020 was significantly larger than that in survey five february 2019 this is because of the lake restoration with the aid of a large inflow from the feeding rivers in this period the inset of fig 6 further shows the time series of h in lu between 2017 and 2020 which indicates that h increased by 1 09 from february 24 2019 to may 17 2020 the absolute difference between our results and the former predictive relationship in surveys one to six is 0 37 bcm 32 3 0 74 bcm 36 6 0 78 bcm 63 2 0 77 bcm 49 4 0 23 bcm 10 3 and 1 7 bcm 33 4 respectively with respect to the water volume magnitudes estimated from the bathymetric maps the former predictive relationship overestimates the lake volume in survey periods one to five while it largely underestimates the lake volume in survey period six in particular our results indicate that in may 2020 lu had 1 7 bcm of water more than what is believed based on the former predictive relationship this is an important observation as it can be used to assess the degree of lake restoration regardless of the source of water provided by storm rainfalls or basin management practices 4 discussion 4 1 revisiting the level area volume relationship in lake urmia currently ulrp uses the former predictive a h and v h relationships developed by karimi and bagheri 2016 to estimate the lake area and lake volume at a desired time given the h measured at a ground station we demonstrated that the difference between the formerly developed a l relationship and that obtained in the present study i e equations 9 and 10 is not significant nevertheless we showed that there is a remarkable difference between the predicted volumes from the formerly developed relationship and our estimates based on the intensive hydrography data surveyed between 2017 and 2020 we argue that the reason for such a notable difference arises from some major issues in the study of karimi and bagheri 2016 first they developed a multi linear regression model to construct the relationship between the measured water depth and multi spectral reflectance data however the employed multi linear regression model cannot adequately capture the complexity in the relationship between water depth and reflectance the superiority of intelligent learning models over the traditional approaches like linear regression has been already demonstrated by former studies e g liu et al 2018 mohamed et al 2016 sagawa et al 2019 second the measured hydrography data to calibrate the multi linear regression model included 640 points that all were surveyed only in the north half of the lu regarding the large variability of the bed topography as well as water depth across the lu surface area those measurements could not appropriately describe the whole lake condition and were merely representative of the bathymetric changes in the north half third they used a single bathymetric map of the lu derived in 2015 to estimate the lake volume at other times to map the topography of dried areas beyond the lake water body they first classified landsat images to determine the edge of the water body at different elevations then they fitted a digital elevation model to the distance between these edges and the playa edge along the golmankhaneh station as a reference point karimi and bagheri 2016 water research institute 2015 this process clearly imposes large uncertainty in the estimated volumes as it does not take into account the impact of lakebed fluctuations due to salt precipitation and dissolution on the estimated lake volume at other times than september 2015 according to our results in fig 5 and table 6 the bed elevation in the lu is highly dynamic in time hence an appropriate prediction of the lake volume at a given time must be conducted by using the bathymetric map of the same time therefore the level volume relationship developed in 2015 to predict the lake volume in a range of h s between 1267 m and 1278 m ignores any changes in the lakebed elevation imposed by salt precipitation and dissolution as such we conclude that no single level volume relationship can be proposed for the lu or any other saline lake to represent the lake condition over time this is further demonstrated in fig 7 where for each of the bathymetric maps derived in section 3 5 we extracted the relating level volume relationship the maximum h for each curve is the maximum bed elevation in the relating bathymetric map the wide range of relationships in this plot clearly reflects the influence of the lakebed fluctuations due to salt precipitation and dissolution on the level volume relationship we note that sima and tajrishy 2013 also attempted to derive the level volume relationship in the lu by i integrating the level area relationship within the range of lake altimetry data and ii calibrating a couple of analytical models for the lake geometry i e nilsson s power function model nilsson et al 2008 and simple truncated pyramid model assuming the integration approach gives the most accurate results as compared to the other two models the applicability of the derived fourth order polynomial relationship is still limited this is because the estimation of the lake volume at a given h requires the knowledge of the lake volume at a reference h used as the minimum bound of the integration the so called reference volume can be only determined from in situ hydrography data and it also changes in time i e different reference volumes can be observed at the same h therefore the proposed level volume relationship cannot express the lake geometry changes in time and may yield large errors within a certain range of h the above pieces of evidence underline the necessity of timely hydrography data collection in the lu to monitor the lake dynamics and to estimate the lake volume appropriately an accurate bathymetry also helps study other physical processes taking place in the lu one of the poorly understood issues in the study area has been the lake saltwater exchange with the surrounding aquifer using limited hydrochemistry and isotopic field data amiri et al 2016a 2016b 2016c found that the sediment deposits on the lakebed act as a barrier preventing the chemical interaction between the lake and groundwater and thus minimizing the saltwater intrusion from the lake see also mehr et al 2019 for similar conclusions however a few other studies tourian et al 2015 vaheddoost et al 2015 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 reported a significant correlation between the lake water fluctuation and groundwater level by analyzing sparse groundwater data recorded by observation wells in the region javadzadeh et al 2020 further conducted a comprehensive analysis on the cross correlation between the lake and groundwater level using data recorded from 797 observation wells in 17 adjacent aquifers between 2001 and 2018 they also found a significant correlation between these two quantities where the direction of correlation changes spatially depending on whether the lake is losing or gaining regarding the statistical nature of the above studies sheibani et al 2020 have extended this exploration through a series of numerical simulations considering the impacts on saltwater intrusion by the lakebed sediment layer thickness lakebed sediment hydraulic conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity however they set up the geometry of their numerical model based on the sparse hydrography data isrc 2018 but not the bathymetric map of the whole lake due to its unavailability it is seen that the lack of updated information about the dynamics of bathymetry in the lu has been a missing component for this and other relevant studies in the region e g abbaspour et al 2012 arabsahebi et al 2020 saemian et al 2020 safavi et al 2020 sharifi et al 2018 therefore the results of the present study can be leveraged by future researches for analysis and synthesis purposes as it provides the most comprehensive information on the lu bathymetric changes over a long period 4 2 the interplay between the quality of field data and remotely sensed imagery in controlling the accuracy of water depth prediction the results of the ann model accuracy indicated that the prediction accuracy of water depth for the first data group was better than that for the second group followed by accuracy for the third group this observation was not expected regarding the impressive size of hydrography data in the third group and its spatially uniform distribution we investigated the reason s for this finding by exploring the possible impact of atmospheric condition on the quality of data retrieved from satellite images the average relative humidity and air temperature in the period corresponding to the first group of data were 34 and 29 c respectively these measures were 48 5 and 18 8 c for the second group of data respectively and were 83 1 and 5 1 c for the third dataset respectively it is interesting to observe that the model error is positively and negatively proportional to relative humidity and air temperature respectively indeed under the higher relative humidity the absorption and diffusion of electromagnetic waves by the water particles in the air reduce the useful information received by a satellite sensor from the ground despite using atmospherically corrected images we note that the advantage of high quality training data obtained from the field measurements could not overcome the impact of remaining noise in the satellite data on the accuracy of water depth estimation we also note that even though manaffar et al 2020 assessed the turbidity of lu and concluded the governance of relatively low turbidity in the majority of the lu surface area we cannot extend this conclusion to the results of this study due to the lack of relevant data in our study period nevertheless the order of estimation accuracy obtained in this study is much smaller than that expected in turbid water cases which highlights the acceptable validity of our results 4 3 dynamics of salt dissolution and precipitation in the lake urmia changes in the lakebed elevation are expected to happen due to salt dissolution or precipitation considering the hyper salinity of the lu intuitively it is expected that salt dissolution and precipitation take place by the lake wetting and drying respectively however the state of lake replenishment versus depletion is not the only factor in determining whether salt dissolution or precipitation dominates in the lake this is because under a similar change of water volume salt precipitation can take place in both cases of lake recession and progression in the former case the loss of water increases the salt concertation in the lake which can precipitate if the saturation degree is reached in the latter case the salt concentration of the progressive water also increases as it dissolves the lakebed salts that were deposited during the former lake recessions therefore the direction of change in the lake water volume cannot solely describe the relative degree of salt precipitation and dissolution instead we suggest that the interplay between i the volume of freshwater flow into the lake and ii the extent of lakebed inundation or drying area determines the degree of salt precipitation or dissolution in the lake the relative influence of the above two quantities can be expressed as the ration δv δa where δv and δa is the change in the lake volume and surface area in a given period respectively larger δv δa indicates that a variation in the water volume projects into a larger change of the lake level than the surface area the state of salt precipitation and dissolution is determined by the sign of δv or δa that is positive and negative δv or δa indicates dissolution and precipitation respectively if the lake receives a significant freshwater inflow that increases the lake volume at a greater rate than the lake surface area dissolution dominates due to a couple of major reasons first the impact of freshwater in diluting the lake water dominates the rate of concentration by dissolving lakebed salts second the inflow can circulate faster throughout the lake which facilitates salt dissolution across a large extent of the lake the reverse condition i e salt precipitation can occur under the same magnitude of δv δa but with opposite sign and at different absolute magnitudes of δv and δa this situation holds during the lake recession when the loss rate of water volume is much larger than the lake area shrinkage we note that in general δv δa cannot be accounted as a surrogate for the change in the average water depth depending on the geometry of the lake bathymetry and the state of h δv δa may take a large value but the change in the average water depth remains mild given the above context we hypothesize that a negative correlation holds between the salt precipitation rate and δv δa i e by shifting from smaller to larger δv δa magnitudes between two consecutive periods the lake condition is switched from precipitation to dissolution according to fig 6 since lu has experienced multiple wetting and drying episodes during the study period we could examine the above hypothesis by studying the amount of salt precipitation and dissolution given the changes in the lake surface area stored water volume and bathymetry nevertheless we could not conduct this analysis due to the lack of elevation data on the terrestrial portion of the lu indeed the extent of the derived bathymetric maps was confined to the boundary of the lake water body which changes from one time to another as such if the objective is to compute the amount of salt precipitation and dissolution from e g stage one to stage two see fig 5 we need to know the bed elevation in the region beyond the overlapping area between the bathymetric maps of the aforementioned stages therefore the difference between two consecutive bathymetric maps only provides information about the lakebed changes within the overlapped surface area of the maps and thus misses any information about the lakebed changes in the nearby areas this limitation poses a quest to plan for a comprehensive and timely data compilation on the lakebed elevation with the aid of both field data and rs 4 4 limitations and caveats despite the advantages of the employed modeling framework this study carries some challenges and limitations as table 1 shows some hydrography surveys were conducted over a long period while limited satellite images i e one or two were available during the relating period for further research we suggest using data from other satellites such as sentinel 2 to receive more images at a finer temporal resolution especially during the high lake inflow seasons when the lakebed is remarkably dynamic furthermore we had to use a single h value for the whole period of each survey this was particularly evident in the third and fourth survey periods when the change in h was considerable therefore the water surface elevation at the time of satellite image acquisition could be different from that at the time of hydrography data collection unfortunately we could not resolve this issue because the hydrography data provided from ulrp did not include daily information on the collected data over these periods the other challenge of this work was rooted in using a single value of h for the whole lake in a given day as described in section 2 2 ground measurement of h is available only from one station in the lake which does not describe diurnal fluctuation in h across the whole lake the difference in h between the northern and southern halves becomes distinct during the lake dryer conditions when the segregation of the two halves occurs at low water surface elevations under these circumstances the water surface elevation in the two halves cannot be considered the same as that measured at the golmankhaneh station the use of single lake water elevation is further projected into the computation of bathymetric maps as well as the lake level volume and level area relationships finally we acknowledge that the surveyed hydrography data at some periods did not have a uniform spatial distribution across the lake given the fact that physical characteristics of water and substrate impose a remarkable influence on the relationship between water depth and surface reflectance sufficient and uniformly distributed hydrography data is necessary for an appropriate estimation of water depth across the whole lake we attempted to tackle this issue by clustering data from all survey periods into specific groups which greatly improved the predictive model performance the clustering operation further facilitated model training over the whole spectrum of the lake water depth at a time of interest however the above consideration should be taken into account in future data collection in the lu to smoothen the process of water depth modeling and to provide hydrography data that include the smallest to largest possible water depths to measure also since the spatial variability in the lake water chemistry influences the spectral properties of pixels with the same water depth the hydrography data collection can be better guided by classifying the lake water based on a given water quality measure to ensure that data collection takes place at all classes with distinct quality characteristics 4 5 final remarks using rs data in water bodies is challenging mainly due to i the high amount of electromagnetic absorption which masks the information carried by water physicochemical characteristics ii the impact of turbidity on water leaving reflectance iii the contrasting accuracy of many atmospheric correction methods developed for the calculation of surface reflectance while the above challenges are related to all water bodies rs of shallow water environments is further subjected to the radiometric interaction of water and substrate nevertheless a few points are worth mentioning here first the signal to noise ratio snr is supposed to be higher in bright and shallow waters due to the lower electromagnetic absorption as compared to that in deep waters kutser et al 2020 second given the substrate influence on water leaving reflectance particularly near shorelines this impact over a range of similar water depths would be uniformly distributed in water bodies with a uniform bed composition such as the lu with salty bed this would in turn diminish water depth estimation bias from machine learning algorithms that are capable of deciphering non linear relations between water depth and surface reflectance if sufficient well distributed in situ data are employed third the literature witnesses that rs of turbid waters has been less successful as compared to that in non turbid waters because high turbidity could strongly mask the spectral information of water matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 in turbid waters also known as case ii waters containing high amounts of optically active substances oas e g suspended solids phytoplankton and colored dissolved organic matters high absorption of the electromagnetic spectrum by oas reduces the decipherable information from the water spectral signature also due to the complex optical interactions between oas components we may not be able to derive a unique spectral pattern for a variable of interest e g water depth across a whole water body shen et al 2010 as such the significance of a careful selection of suitable atmospheric correction method is more critical in turbid waters as compared to that in non turbid waters caballero and stumpf 2020 wei et al 2018 in such cases the atmospheric correction schemes specifically developed for water environments e g seadas and acolite are recommended ilori et al 2019 vanhellemont 2019 vanhellemont and ruddick 2014 regarding the above challenges and opportunities it is concluded that the proposed framework in this study can be employed effectively to extract the bathymetric map of a water body of interest to this end the availability of proper information on the physicochemical characteristics of the water body is necessary as a prerequisite for adopting appropriate input data processing tools also the input satellite bands and the ann structure i e the number of hidden layers and neurons should be optimized locally in the desired study area to make sure reliable estimation of water depth and boundary with small uncertainty is reached 5 conclusions the catastrophic drying of the hyper saline lake urmia lu has been recognized as one of the most serious environmental issues of international interest over the past decade sustainable restoration of the lake relies heavily on an appropriate understanding of the lake dynamics which should be monitored continuously to decipher the causal relationship between the lake water volume and its controlling processes in this study we used extensive hydrography data and high resolution satellite imagery to derive three dimensional water depth and bathymetric maps in the lu at multiple instances between 2017 and 2020 to this end we developed a machine learning based model to derive the complex non linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance the hydrography data included 32 984 points surveyed via six campaigns from september 2017 to may 2010 by the urmia lake restoration program ulrp by processing 172 landsat images between 1984 and 2020 we further developed the level area relationship that describes the driest and wettest conditions of the lu in the past 50 years we found that by clustering in situ hydrography data and optimizing the number of satellite bands required for the model training purposes the model accuracy improved significantly the testing process yielded errors that were much smaller than the lake averaged water depth as evidence by rmse 7 8 17 9 cm we also observed that two different linear relationships hold between h and a in the lu with a threshold behavior at h 1271 31 m our results indicated that no single relationship could describe the changes of lake water volume versus h over a long period the derived bathymetric maps witnessed remarkable changes in the lakebed topography due to salt precipitation and dissolution during the episodes of lake drying and wetting given the highly dynamic relationship between h and volume the findings of this study highlight the necessity of continuous and frequent bathymetric mapping in the lu we finally observed that the lu water volume in may 2020 was 3 6 times larger than that in february 2019 indicating a remarkable increase in the rate of lake restoration during this period credit authorship

4058,bathymetric mapping for an accurate estimation of stored water volume in drying lakes is a key information for an effective monitoring of their recession or restoration status extraction of bathymetry in shallow saline lakes using remote sensing techniques has always been challenging due to the complex influences imposed by the physical properties of substrate and the spatial variability of salinity in this study we developed a machine learning based model to quantify the implicit non linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance by leveraging extensive in situ data and high resolution satellite imagery we trained and tested the learning model in the hyper saline lake urmia lu which faced catastrophic drying over the past two decades to this end we used landsat 8 imagery and 32 984 hydrography data points surveyed by the urmia lake restoration program ulrp from 2017 to 2020 during six stages to enhance the model accuracy we tuned the model inputs by optimizing the spectral information and clustering in situ data from stages with similar meteorological conditions into three classes the results demonstrated the high accuracy of the developed intelligent model as evidenced by r2 0 8 0 9 and rmse 7 8 17 9 cm for the three models we found that the average water depth in the lu was increased from 0 43 m in september 2018 to 2 00 m in may 2020 in particular the lake water volume in may 2020 was 3 6 times greater than that in february 2019 which marks a remarkable shift in the lu restoration dynamic bathymetric maps also witnessed considerable salt dissolution taking place across the lake during this period finally we extracted the lu level area relationship by processing 172 landsat images between 1984 and 2020 which was validated against the field data surveyed along the lake water boundary in 2019 the results indicated that the level area relationship follows a dual linear relationship separated at the water level of 1271 31 m keywords

activities such as extensive agriculture development than climate variability have witnessed a much greater contribution to the drying of these lakes wurtsbaugh et al 2017 having caused serious adverse impacts on water quality bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 human health sadeghi bazargani et al 2019 and biota diversity stenger kovács et al 2014 implementation of restoration activities is indispensable to guarantee the long term sustainability of these environments continuous monitoring of water storage in a reviving lake is the most reliable tool to assess the success of the employed restoration plans estimating water balance components i e direct precipitation on the lake evaporation rate and inflows from and outflows to surface and groundwater can yield the change in water storage however this is often challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating these variables by empirical relationships or numerical models using ground measurements and or space borne data gronewold et al 2020 winter 1981 alternatively we can directly estimate the stored water volume of an aquatic system from its geometry given the underlying bed topography called bathymetry the bathymetry of saline lakes can be highly dynamic in both space and time due to the fluctuating rates of salt precipitation and dissolution as such recursive bathymetric delineation of these environments is necessary for an appropriate estimation of their stored water volume over time we can derive bathymetric maps traditionally by shipboard acoustic echo sounding using single or multi beam sonar despite its high accuracy this technique is costly time consuming and labor intensive especially for surveying shallow waters due to the decreased swath width dierssen and theberge 2014 instead active and passive remote sensing rs contextualized into imaging and non imaging methods have been widely used to extract bathymetric maps e g bian et al 2018 cahalane et al 2019 gao 2009 stewart et al 2016 in contrast to traditional approaches rs has facilitated a fast low cost and extended spatial coverage over areas that may not be accessible for ground measurements the most common sensing techniques for bathymetry derivation are based on optical rs i e multispectral or hyperspectral imagery e g klonowski 2007 ma et al 2020 pacheco et al 2015 light detection and ranging lidar e

have been developed for deriving bathymetry information using rs data captured by the above techniques in particular the models based on optical rs e g the lyzenga model lyzenga 1978 lyzenga 1985 lyzenga et al 2006 the jupp model jupp 1988 and the stumpf model stumpf et al 2003 hold the most frequent applications over a variety of water bodies former extensive studies have shown that the accuracy of water depth h estimation from these algorithms depends strongly on the heterogeneity in water turbidity reflective properties of substrate and water depth variation see jawak et al 2015 and referenced therein for a comprehensive review of the accuracy advantages drawbacks and the domain of applicability of these models here we further argue that in addition to the underlying assumptions of the above models their simple linear or ratio transform structure cannot adequately explain the integrated influence of the physical properties of water and substrate across an image extent in addition these algorithms typically use a fraction of spectral information available from airborne data to tackle these limitations we can leverage fine tuned machine learning algorithms to develop non linear relationships between multi spectral data and in situ measurements of water depth under a wide range of conditions these algorithms include but are not limited to artificial neural networks ann ceyhun and yalçın 2010 gholamalifard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 moses et al 2013 sandidge and holyer 1998 random forest manessa et al 2016 sagawa et al 2019 yunus et al 2019 support vector machine misra et al 2018 wang et al 2019 and ensemble regression trees using bootstrap aggregation and least squares boosting mohamed et al 2017 the findings of these studies unanimously demonstrate that machine learning based algorithms show an improved performance in deriving bathymetric maps as compared to those obtained by other traditional approaches in this study we developed a learning based model to decipher the dynamics of bathymetry in the reviving hyper saline shallow lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that leveraged the most recent extensive in situ hydrography measurements to derive bathymetric maps between 2017 and 2020 regarding the outdated bathymetry being currently used to monitor the lake water volume the new findings yield a more reliable insight into evaluating the restoration status of lu over the recent years we further present the most updated level area relationship in the lu by extracting the lake surface area with the aid of high resolution satellite imagery between 1984 and 2020 we validated the employed classification algorithm against the lake boundary data surveyed at multiple traces in 2019 in contrast to previous studies the developed level area volume relationship describes the most dry and wet conditions of the lake during the last 50 years the rest of this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the study area and describes the in situ measurements and rs data used for the purpose of this study in this section we also outline the methodology to map bathymetry section 3 presents the results and section 4 discusses the findings by focusing on i the revisited level area volume relationship in the lu ii the influence of bathymetry and rs data

2 1 study area lu is located in the northwest of iran 37 04 n to 38 16 n 45 02 e to 46 00 e which receives freshwater from several rivers draining twelve sub basins in the 52 000 km2 lake urmia basin fig 1 a registered as a protected area 1967 a national park 1971 a ramsar site 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 lu is recognized as one of the wetlands of international importance it is also well known for its hyper salinity where the salt concentration has recorded fluctuations between 140 g l and 380 g l zeinoddini et al 2009 recent field investigations of the lake sedimentology reveal salt deposits on the lake bottom fig 1e ranging a few centimeters in the south up to three meters in the north lahijani et al 2020 lu is partly separated by the 15 km kalantari causeway and bridge fig 1b which has intervened the water circulation and mixing between the northern and southern parts the intra annual variation of salinity across the lu demonstrates two patterns of salinity distribution while the distribution of salinity concentration in the southern and northern parts becomes distinct in high flow months a relatively uniform distribution is observed during dry months across the whole lu bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 historical record of the lu water level h indicates that the lake lost about eight meters of water between 1996 and 2016 fig 1f which was equivalent to a loss of 33 bcm of water several former studies have pointed out the major reasons for the drastic decline of lu they include intensive agricultural development the imbalance between water supply and demand decreased environmental flow by the improper operation of reservoirs illegal withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources and low irrigation efficiency in the lake urmia basin this mostly human made shrinkage led to a wide range of environmental and socioeconomic problems such as desertification increased soil salinity in the agricultural areas near the lake disturbance in the ecological condition of the lake biota e g artemia and increased unemployment rate due to recession in agricultural activities see danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 and references therein to cease the drying trend of lu urmia lake restoration national committee has planned and implemented several basin management practices to increase inflow into the lu since 2013 reducing agriculture water allocation stream dredging to increase the delivering capacity of the rivers feeding the lake fig 1c and artificial channelization in the southern sub basins of the lake which provide more than 50 of the lake annual inflow fig 1d are among such actions urmia lake restoration program ulrp 2018 as a result the streamflow rate into the lake is supposed to increase and cause enhanced sediment yield accordingly which is spatially variable depending on the sediment rating curve of each river flowing into the lake moreover the increased volume of freshwater flow leads to salt dissolution in high flow seasons especially near the inlet zones while salt precipitation dominates in the dry seasons with spatiotemporally different rates the interplay between sedimentation salt precipitation and salt dissolution processes makes the lakebed topography dynamic which clearly changes the lake level volume relationship over time 2 2 hydrography data we used hydrography data collected from six surveys that were carried out by multiple sources between september 2017 and may 2020 table 1 gives the date location and source of the surveyed data the iranian institute of space research mechanics isrc carried out the first to fifth surveys during september 23 october 22 2017 march 6 april 20 2018 july 7 september 9 2018 september 23 december 21 2018 and february 24 march 16 2019 respectively in which water depth at 4894 6273 684 1629 and 8485 points were surveyed using a combination of echo sounder and rtk gps the first second and fourth surveys were conducted along 12 paths of 10 km separated by 500 m centered on the kalantari causeway in the third and fifth surveys data were collected along 12 and 24 paths with different lengths across the whole lake respectively the sixth survey was operated by the darya naghsheh consulting engineers during may 17 may 27 2020 by which 11 019 points were surveyed by an echo sounder across the whole lake we received the raw hydrography data mentioned above from the urmia lake restoration program ulrp to compute the lakebed elevation from the measured h data we used daily h data recorded by a hydrostatic recording gauge at the golmankhaneh station this station was originally located on the midwestern shore of the lu 37 36 03 n 45 15 31 e gs1 in fig 1a however due to the lake level fall the station was relocated to the lake center near the kalantari bridge 37 47 26 n 45 22 07 e in august 2008 gs2 in fig 1a 2 3 satellite data we used landsat 4 5 tm collection 2 level 2 and landsat 8 oli tirs collection 2 level 2 products to delineate the lu surface area from 1984 to 2020 we derived the bathymetric maps from 2017 to 2020 using landsat 8 imagery level 2 products give surface reflectance values that already corrects the effects of atmospheric scattering and absorption landsat collection 2 2021 for each period during which hydrography data were collected we downloaded a satellite image from usgs earth explorer if a cloud free image was not available in a survey period we used the closest image to that period window as such satellite images recorded on september 14 2017 april 26 2018 september 17 2018 december 22 2018 february 24 2019 and may 17 2020 were used for the first to sixth periods respectively we used the ultra blue 0 43 0 45 µm blue 0 45 0 51 µm green 0 53 0 59 µm and red 0 64 0 67 µm bands of landsat 8 for the analysis explained in section 2 6 2 4 extraction of lake water body to derive the bathymetric maps at multiple times as well as to update the lake level area volume relationship we first needed to determine the water boundary of the lake at the time of satellite image being used to this end we used the k means clustering which is an unsupervised learning algorithm for a quick classification of an image into a desired number of feature classes likas et al 2003 the k means clustering groups a dataset ω comprised of n vectors of v i 1 i n into a k number of clusters defined by the user each vector v i represents a pixel and each element of v i vi ω 1 ω m carries a characteristic of the pixel to cluster ω this method first chooses k arbitrary vectors cl c 1 c k as the centroids of the k clusters similar to v i each cl c consists of m characteristics denoted as clc ω 1 ω m each pixel in ω is then assigned to one of the k clusters based on the minimum euclidean distance between the pixel s characteristics and the cluster centroids the euclidean distance ed between the vector v i and the cluster centroid cl c is computed as alfakih 2018 1 e d v i c l c v i 1 cl c 1 2 v i 2 cl c 2 2 v i m cl c m 2 when the first clustering of all pixels is complete the centroid of each cluster is updated and the iterative relocation is repeated until the centroid of each cluster is insignificantly different from its previous value data from multiple bands or their combination such as normalized difference water index ndwi modified normalized difference water index mndwi normalized difference vegetation index ndvi automated water extraction index awei and albedo α can be used as the training input to the classification algorithm while former studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of water body detection to the above indices feyisa et al 2014 mcfeeters 1996 xu 2006 the accuracy is case specific due to the impact of water constituents and substrate characteristics on the reflected energy from the water surface sun et al 2017 as such we tested different combinations of the above indices with different numbers of k means clusters to extract the water body that best describes the true water body boundaries using the surveyed lake boundary data due to the presence of some natural or artificial features in the lu buffer zone such as artificial channels the extracted water body identifies these features as water pixels too to exclude these features from the lake water body we implemented a square shaped sliding median filter of window size 11 11 on a given classified image by moving the filter across the image each pixel s value was replaced by the median value of its adjacent pixels this process would assign a zero value to those water pixels that are dominantly surrounded by non water pixels thus confining the lake s true water body given the extracted water bodies from 1984 to 2020 the time series of lu surface area was computed based on the image pixel size which was 30 m for the landsat images used in this study 2 5 survey data on the lake boundary to validate the approach adopted in section 2 4 for delineating the lu water boundary we conducted three field surveys on july 15 and july 17 2019 in which the geographic location of 765 points along the lake water boundary was surveyed by the garmin etrex vista hcx handheld gps device the device positioning error is smaller than 10 m the maximum error of this device is one third of the landsat s spatial resolution i e 30 m hence the device accuracy was enough for tracing the lu water boundary we chose the above survey timeframe 1 to minimize the lag time between data collection and the pass of landsat 8 satellite over the lu on july 18 2019 and 2 to ensure a cloud free condition based on the weather forecast fig 2 a c depict the three surveyed paths mapped on a true color image from landsat 8 on july 18 2019 we surveyed the 1 67 km path 1 in red and 1 41 km path 2 in green on the eastern shore of the lu from mid to north and south respectively path 3 in yellow was surveyed by 1 63 km on the western shoreline towards the south 2 6 lake bathymetry derivation in this section we present the framework used for the derivation of bathymetric maps in the lu the proposed methodology is not restricted to lu and can be employed in other environments of interest in section 2 6 1 we outline the procedure for pre processing of the surveyed bathymetry data in section 2 6 2 we briefly describe the developed ann model which builds the relationship between water depth and water surface reflectance given a number of reflectance data at different bands from satellite imagery the proposed approach for finding the optimum input band combination is described in section 2 6 3 finally in section 2 6 4 we further explain how different sets of hydrography data were clustered as the training data of the machine learning model to improve estimation accuracy 2 6 1 pre processing of hydrography data we performed a thorough pre processing on the surveyed hydrography data to identify inappropriate data and exclude them from the training and testing dataset used in the machine learning model we mainly considered two types of data as inappropriate data first given the water body extent from section 2 4 there is a possibility that some surveyed points near the lake shoreline fall beyond the extracted water boundary this can be due to 1 the error in the classification results at very shallow water depths 2 the time gap between hydrography survey and satellite image acquisition and 3 the error in recording the field data in either cases these points were identified and excluded from the rest of the analysis second we examined the existence of any outliers in the remaining data to this end we used the concept of mahalanobis distance and computed it for each observation in a given survey as 2 md y μ t s 1 y μ where md denotes the mahalanobis distance between the multivariate observation y and its mean μ and s represents the covariance matrix of y for each data point y includes the measured water depth as well as reflectance values from the selected satellite bands since md 2 has a chi square distribution we considered those data with p value 0 001 in the chi square test as outlier and excluded them from the dataset several former studies have suggested this approach as a robust and reliable method for the detection of outliers in multivariate parameters e g li and jain 2009 2 6 2 artificial neural network ann model architecture training and testing ann is a supervised machine learning model that distributes data on inter neuronal links to find the relationship between the model input and output da silva et al 2017 a neural network architecture is composed of an input layer hidden layer s and an output layer fig 3 shows the structure of the ann model developed in this study which includes two hidden layers each layer of the neural network is made up of units called neurons the neurons in the input layer first hidden layer second hidden layer and the output layer are denoted by p 1 p p m 1 m m n 1 n n and q 1 q q respectively where p m n and q are the total number of neurons in the input layer first hidden layer second hidden layer and the output layer respectively p equals to the number of input variables which is the number of spectral bands in this study and q 1 for the network shown in fig 3 the input variables to the neural network i e reflectance values from different bands are multiplied by certain relating weights and are then treated as the inputs of the neurons in the first hidden layer this process can be expressed as 3 i m h 1 p w p m h 1 b l x p b m where i m h 1 is the input variable to neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 w p m h 1 is the weight of the link that connects neuron p in the input layer to neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 b l x p is the reflectance value from band l 1 l l at locations x xg 1 g g that enters neuron p l equals to the total number of bands xg is the location of pixel g in a given satellite image g is the total number of pixels in the image and b m is a constant value belonging to neuron m each neuron m in the first hidden layer applies a non linear activation function to the input according to the following equation 4 o m h 1 1 1 e x p i m h 1 where o m h 1 is the output value of neuron m in the first hidden layer h 1 the above function known as the sigmoid function is one of the most widely used activation functions in the context of multilayer perceptron neural network e g choudhary et al 2010 although the activation function is a key parameter in a neural network functioning if the developed ann model is trained successfully with appropriate sufficient inputs different activation functions are not expected to impose significant influence on the accuracy of the outcome feng and lu 2019 similar to the first hidden layer the input to the second hidden layer h 2 can be written as 5 i n h 2 m w m n h 2 o m h 1 b n where i n h 2 is the input variable to neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 w m n h 2 is the weight of the link that connects neuron m in the first hidden layer to neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 and b n is a constant value belonging to neuron n each neuron n in the second hidden layer applies the same activation function to its input which ultimately gives 6 o n h 2 1 1 e x p i n h 2 where o n 2 is the output of neuron n in the second hidden layer h 2 finally the input of the output layer which is indeed the output of the neural network can be written as 7 d x pred n w n q h 2 o n h 2 ε where d x pred is the predicted water depth at locations x w n q h 2 is the weight of the link that connects neuron n in the second hidden layer to neuron q 1 in the output layer and ε is a constant value relating to the output layer s neuron from the above formulation we observe that the developed ann model contains six parameters i e w p m h 1 w m n h 2 w n q h 2 b m b n and ε these parameters were calibrated such that the following objective function is minimized 8 min g 1 g d x g pred d x g obs 2 where d x g obs is the measured water depth at location x g we used the back propagation algorithm to train the ann model this technique is a common approach for training an ann structure the main advantage of this scheme is the low computational cost for the training process and its reliable accuracy in most of the applications chauvin and rumelhart 1995 to determine the optimum structure of the ann we adopted the forward selection approach through a serious of monte carlo simulations han et al 2011 to this end we first considered one hidden layer and found the best number of neurons in the first layer by testing a relatively wide range of neurons after setting the number of optimum neurons in the first layer we added a new hidden layer and found the optimum number of neurons for the new layer by testing different number of neurons the above process was repeated until adding a new layer with any number of neurons did not increase the prediction accuracy significantly in addition we employed the k fold cross validation method with ten folds for the model training and testing purposes han et al 2011 this method yields a more realistic model accuracy by using different parts of the training data as compared to those approaches that select a random portion of data for training and the rest for model testing to implement the k fold cross validation method we first divided the training data into 10 seeds where data from the nine seeds were used to train the model and data in the tenth seed were used to test the model the training and testing processes were then repeated 10 times such that in each iteration a unique combination of the nine seeds for training and one seed for testing were utilized this guarantees the consideration of all non repetitive combinations for model training and testing after completing each process the model accuracy for training and testing was recorded separately finally the average accuracy of 10 training and 10 testing processes was considered as the final accuracy of the model in the training and testing respectively here we note that the uncertainty of prediction may be remarkable in the very shallow water depths near the lake water boundary or near the isolated land features within the lake body to avoid the issue of masking the results we filtered the model outputs based on the following criteria given the hydrography points surveyed in each period we extracted the albedo of every point from landsat 8 and plotted albedo against water depth the relationship between these two quantities has a declining trend with more scattering in smaller water depths for each period we determined the water depth below which albedo showed a very narrow variation given these thresholds of water depth and albedo we filtered those model outputs with water depth and albedo larger than their relating thresholds this filtering ensures eliminating the wrong estimation of large water depths in very shallow areas 2 6 3 finding the optimum input band combination the optimum input band combination is defined as the combination that gives the largest accuracy in estimating water depth using the developed ann model various compositions of mainly ultra blue ub blue green and red bands have been used in similar previous studies to extract bathymetric maps using optical sensors e g kabiri 2017 karimi and bagheri 2016 knudby et al 2016 pacheco et al 2015 yunus et al 2019 however we performed a comprehensive analysis via a series of monte carlo simulations to take into account all possible band compositions as the input of the ann model to this end we considered different combinations of the first seven bands of landsat 8 as the alternative inputs to the model which included 127 different inputs for each set the error of the ann model in the testing process was calculated and finally the band composition resulted in the least error was used as optimum input to derive the bathymetric maps 2 6 4 clustering the training dataset to improve water depth prediction to improve water depth prediction we clustered the hydrography data from all six surveys into three groups the first group includes data of the first and third surveys at the end of summer and early autumn the second group includes data of the second and sixth surveys in late winter and early spring and the third group includes data of the fourth and fifth surveys in autumn and early winter the basis of this clustering was the similarity of atmospheric conditions as well as the angle of sunlight for each group which diminishes the variation in the reflectance values table 2 shows the average air temperature as a surrogate for the angle of sunlight average pressure and average relative humidity during the hydrography surveys we observe that those periods aggregated into one category have a similar condition in terms of the above meteorological characteristics we acknowledge that several other factors besides the angle of sunlight also influence the surface temperature however since the angle of sunlight is one determining factor of the energy reaching the earth s surface the proximity of air temperature can be considered as the proximity of the angle of solar radiation in each data category 3 results 3 1 the accuracy of extracted water bodies having tested different numbers of clusters in the k means algorithm we found that three clusters yielded the most accurate results in delineating the lake water body we also observed that the combined use of mndwi and albedo could successfully delineate the lake water boundary as contrasted against the three surveyed paths see fig 2 the euclidean distance between the extracted lake water boundary and the surveyed paths is 26 m 17 m and 4 m for paths 1 to 3 respectively which is smaller than the image pixel size visual inspection of the extracted water body on july 18 2019 against the relating rgb satellite image further confirms that the k means algorithm could precisely extract the lake water body we note that the euclidean distance from the k mean clustering for path 3 is smaller than that for path 1 and path 2 we attribute such different accuracies to a few possible causes first the location of the lake water boundary is different between the time of field data collection and the satellite image acquisition indeed there was a three day gap between the time of surveyed water boundary along paths 1 and 2 i e july 15 2019 and the satellite passage i e july 18 2019 while it was only 1 day gap for path 3 which was surveyed on july 17 2019 regarding the lake fluctuation in h from 1271 69 m on july 15 2019 to 1271 67 m on july 18 2019 we expect a smaller difference between the observed and extracted water boundaries along path 3 as compared to the other two paths we also noticed a windy condition on july 15 2019 which further contributed to larger fluctuations along the lake shoreline on this day second high soil moisture near saturation condition left by diurnal lake water recession can be another source of error third the lakebed topography has a milder slope in the eastern than the western side of the lake therefore a small rising or falling of the lake level can project into a larger progression or recession in the shore zone here we note that using ndwi thresholding as a reduced complexity approach is also very common for distinguishing water from non water pixels nevertheless since the lu water depth is very shallow near the boundaries and the salt deposits nearby the shoreline are almost saturated it is expected that accurate delineation of the lake boundary from this approach would be challenging and might lead to unrealistic results to examine this issue we used the average ndwi of all pixels along the three surveyed paths as the threshold to extract the water body extent we found that the extracted lake water body was significantly larger than reality especially in the southwestern part of the lake we further performed the same analysis at other multiple instances with different lake surface extent which yielded the same conclusion therefore using the same ndwi threshold for the extraction of water body at different times does not yield appropriate results particularly in shallow environments this highlights the necessity to tune the appropriate value of the ndwi threshold for each given image which would be very time consuming given the number of images to be processed in a long term study period 3 2 a threshold behavior in the lake urmia level area relationship fig 4 a shows the developed relationship between the lu surface area a and h obtained from processing 172 satellite images i e 75 images from landsat 4 5 and 97 images from landsat 8 we observe that two linear relationships with different slopes hold between a and h which are expressed as 9 a 2306 5 h 2930000 h 1271 31 m 10 a 351 65 h 443346 h 1271 31 m where a is in km2 and h is in m above the mean sea level both relationships are statistically significant with the coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 99 the two fitted lines intersect at h 1271 31 m the mean absolute error mae of the first and second relationship is 55 46 and 48 82 km2 respectively which is equivalent to 3 21 and 1 07 of the average a below and above h 1271 31 m respectively the root mean square error rmse of a estimates from equations 9 and 10 is 73 64 and 69 45 km2 which is equivalent to 3 57 and 1 45 of the average a below and above h 1271 31 m respectively here we observe that for h level less than 1271 31 m a changes in a sharper rate with h while this rate is milder for h larger than this threshold this observation motivates the hypothesis that the east west profiles of the lakebed are comprised of two trapezoids intersecting at the elevations close to 1271 31 m our preliminary investigations of some cross sectional profiles computed from the hydrography data support this hypothesis however since the available hydrography data do not include complete profiles across the entire lake we are far from making a general conclusion about this observation and further exploration is left for future research fig 4b compares the results of the present study with the results obtained by the single fourth order polynomial a l relationship developed by karimi and bagheri 2016 as h 4 14 a 4 5 10 a 3 2 6 a 2 0 0042 a 1267 we observe that the former relationship overestimates and underestimates a at h values smaller and larger than 1270 74 m respectively as compared to equations 9 and 10 as h increases the difference between the results decreases until they become negligible near h 1278 m on average the difference between the results of two studies is about 10 7 which can be attributed to i the source of satellite images and ii the approaches employed for the extraction of the lake water body utilization of landsat imagery with a much finer spatial resolution in the present study as compared to avhrr and modis imagery with 1000 m and 500 m spatial resolution respectively used in karimi and bagheri 2016 resulted in a much improved delineation of the lake water body in addition the former relationship was obtained by examining 78 images from 1972 to 2014 while the present study used 172 images from 1984 to 2020 including data from those years when the lake surface was minimum due to the dramatic drying finally unlike the former study our extracted water body in the lu was validated against the field data which adds confidence in the computed surface areas 3 3 spatial distribution of measured water depth having filtered the raw surveyed hydrography data table 3 gives the average minimum and maximum of the remaining measured water depth in each survey for the whole lake northern half and southern half separately we observe that after screening the raw data there is still a sufficient set of data i e 32 984 data points from all surveys which could be effectively used to build the predictive model of water depth it is also noteworthy that the average measured water depth in the sixth survey is remarkably larger than that in the other five surveys we will investigate this observation in further details in section 3 6 3 4 the ann model accuracy for estimating water depth table 4 presents the ann model accuracy for some selected input band combinations that yielded the most accurate results by using the first group of processed hydrography data described in section 2 6 4 as the training data we observe that the combination of ub blue green and red bands resulted in the highest accuracy in estimating the water depth mae 3 6 cm the results not shown here obtained by using the second and third group of hydrography data yielded the same conclusion table 4 also reveals that if only one band is used as the model input the green band gives the highest accuracy mae 9 1 cm this can be attributed to the lu greenish color in most months which results in a high reflection of electromagnetic waves in this band as compared to the other visible bands in the case of selecting two bands as the model input the blue and green bands as compared to other two band combinations give the most accurate results in expressing the lu water depth changes mae 7 6 cm finally three band combination of ub blue and green gives the least mae equal to 6 6 cm a couple of points are worth mentioning here first increasing the number of selected bands does not necessarily lead to enhanced accuracy of water depth estimation for instance selection of all landsat 8 satellite bands non thermal bands provided less accuracy than the selection of the first four bands also selection of the green band alone provided higher accuracy than the selection of the main two band combinations second in many previous studies e g kabiri 2017 pacheco et al 2015 yunus et al 2019 the blue band has been proposed in combination with other bands to estimate water depth while we found the green band more effective in our study area this indicates that in the rs of aquatic environments there is no optimal band combination that necessarily applies to all water bodies the presence of different solutes or suspended substances plays an important role in differentiating the optimal properties of water from one aquatic system to another using the band combination of ub blue green and red as the input of the ann model the final three models were built for the three groups of hydrography data separately table 5 gives the accuracy of the models in the training and testing processes we observe that the highest accuracy was obtained from the first group of data that were collected at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn the mae of the testing process for the first second and third groups of data is 3 3 cm 9 7 cm and 12 1 cm respectively the rmse in the same process for the first second and third groups of data is 7 7 cm 15 6 cm and 17 9 cm respectively all statistical measures confirm the high accuracy of the developed models the in situ data clustering approach used in this study witnessed the high accuracy of water depth prediction alternatively other approaches could also be employed to use the hydrography data for training and testing the prediction model for instance we could use the data collected in each period to train the ann model for that period and generate the relating bathymetric map this approach suffers a couple of drawbacks first at some data collection periods i e the first second and fourth surveys the collected data were concentrated around the causeway regarding the lu s approximate length of 130 km in april 2019 and its large area it is expected that the variability of lakebed topography and chemical properties of the lake water induce considerable impact on the spectral properties of the lake water from north to south therefore the spectral behavior of the lake around the causeway cannot be attributed to the whole lake indeed when a neural network model is trained using any of the data from the first second and fourth surveys the output of the model learns the relationship between spectral behavior and water depth in only the same period consequently by applying each trained model to extract water depth or bathymetric maps in the whole lake we cannot expect appropriate estimations in other places than near the causeway the second drawback of this approach is that the depth data collected in some survey periods may only cover a certain range of depths for instance the minimum depth measured in the sixth survey was 118 cm hence it can be expected that a model developed solely using data from the sixth survey cannot estimate the shallow depths especially near the lake shoreline considering the above issues it can be concluded that the approach of using data from each period to extract the water depth map of the same period is not suitable and cannot properly describe the whole lake condition the second possible approach was to combine data from all six surveys and develop a single model to generate bathymetric maps for each period this approach has also limitations because at different times of a year spectral patterns change in a water body indeed since the angle and intensity of the sun s illumination change over time different radiations can be received by the satellite sensor for the same water depth in addition changes in the air humidity and the constituent particles of the atmosphere in different seasons of a year further influence the amount of reflection received by satellite therefore using the second approach to build a single model for the whole year can also impose remarkable errors in deriving the bathymetric maps 3 5 dynamics of water depth change in lake urmia fig 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of estimated water depth in the lu on september 14 2017 april 26 2018 september 17 2018 december 22 2018 february 24 2019 and may 17 2020 table 6 further gives the average and the coefficient of variation cv of water depth in the whole lake the northern half and southern half separately comparing the lake maps between the third and sixth stages as the driest and wettest stages in the study period respectively indicates a considerable increase in the lake surface area in 2020 when the two islands in the south were surrounded by the lake water the results indicate that the average water depth in the lu was 0 62 m 0 57 m 0 43 m 0 53 m 0 86 m and 2 00 m in the survey stages one to six respectively h at the relating periods was 1270 32 m 1270 75 m 1270 27 m 1270 54 m 1270 82 m and 1271 91 m respectively this indicates that in general the average water depth in the lake increases with the increase in h the exception to this observation is the change of water depth in between surveys one and two when the lake level increased by 0 43 m while the average lake water depth changed very slightly according to table 6 the average water depth in the south half was increased during this period while the opposite took place in the north half together with the decreased cv of water depth in the whole lake it seems that the lakebed topography became uniform during this period which is also evident in fig 5b we also observe that the average water depth in the northern half is larger than that in the southern half in the survey periods one two and six while the reserve holds in the survey periods three and five in the fourth period there is a negligible difference between the average water depths in the two halves which implies that the variability of water depth across the whole lake has a similar pattern this is confirmed by the cv of water depth which is almost the same in the north and south halves and thus the whole lake we further note that the cv of water depth with respect to the whole lake changed from 0 80 in the first survey period to 0 32 in the sixth survey period such a considerable decrease in cv is concurrent with the increase of 1 59 m in h which implies that by increasing the volume of inflow to the lake the spatial variability of water depth decreases indeed in the sixth period when the lake recorded the highest level since 2010 there is a slight difference between the cv of water depth across the lake i e 0 28 for the northern half and 0 32 for the southern half in contrast in the first period when the lake experienced one of its historically lowest levels the cv of water depth is considerably different between the northern and southern halves as evidenced by 0 77 against 0 47 respectively this is mainly because of the diminished flow exchange between the two halves in this period which was due to the significant reduction in the lake inflow from the southern feeding rivers the impact of increased flow velocity on the lakebed local scouring in the vicinity of the kalantari bridge is also clear in all water depth maps fig 5h indicates a zoomed in image of the lake water depth at the location of the bridge where water exchange between the northern and southern halves takes place it is seen that the extent of the local scoured area in the south north direction is about 3 km while the width of the scour is about 1 3 km and 2 4 km in the northern and southern sides of the bridge respectively we explored the scour region in all the other maps and found similar observations given the counter clockwise direction of flow in the lu safavi et al 2020 we observe that the return flow from north to south could scour the lakebed in the transverse direction to a larger extent than that caused by the south north flow in fig 5g we further show the spatial variability of salinity concentration around the bridge in march 2019 bayati and danesh yazdi 2021 as a cross reference for the lake dynamics in this region it is obviously seen how the saltier water from the north concentrates the lake water in the scoured zone we note that the spatial scale of the zone shown in fig 5g is larger than that in fig 5h due to the other processes that influence salt dispersion given the water depth maps we can derive the bathymetric maps by subtracting each map from the relating lake water elevation we refused to report the derived bathymetric maps as their spatial variation is the same as that for the water depth maps however we discuss how they can be used to study the dynamics of salt precipitation and dissolution in section 4 3 3 6 water level vs stored volume in lake urmia fig 6 shows h versus stored water volume in the lu between 2017 and 2020 the six color points on this plot relate to the volumes that were estimated from the bathymetric maps derived in section 3 5 the dotted blue curve shows the predictive relationship between the h and volume as proposed by the former and only relevant study in the lu water research institute 2015 which was derived for the lake s very dry condition we estimated the lake volume in surveys one to six as 0 77 bcm 1 27 bcm 0 45 bcm 0 79 bcm 1 96 bcm and 7 0 bcm respectively while the predictive relationship gives 1 14 bcm 2 01 bcm 1 23 bcm 1 56 bcm 2 18 bcm and 5 25 bcm respectively both results witness that the lake volume during survey six may 2020 was significantly larger than that in survey five february 2019 this is because of the lake restoration with the aid of a large inflow from the feeding rivers in this period the inset of fig 6 further shows the time series of h in lu between 2017 and 2020 which indicates that h increased by 1 09 from february 24 2019 to may 17 2020 the absolute difference between our results and the former predictive relationship in surveys one to six is 0 37 bcm 32 3 0 74 bcm 36 6 0 78 bcm 63 2 0 77 bcm 49 4 0 23 bcm 10 3 and 1 7 bcm 33 4 respectively with respect to the water volume magnitudes estimated from the bathymetric maps the former predictive relationship overestimates the lake volume in survey periods one to five while it largely underestimates the lake volume in survey period six in particular our results indicate that in may 2020 lu had 1 7 bcm of water more than what is believed based on the former predictive relationship this is an important observation as it can be used to assess the degree of lake restoration regardless of the source of water provided by storm rainfalls or basin management practices 4 discussion 4 1 revisiting the level area volume relationship in lake urmia currently ulrp uses the former predictive a h and v h relationships developed by karimi and bagheri 2016 to estimate the lake area and lake volume at a desired time given the h measured at a ground station we demonstrated that the difference between the formerly developed a l relationship and that obtained in the present study i e equations 9 and 10 is not significant nevertheless we showed that there is a remarkable difference between the predicted volumes from the formerly developed relationship and our estimates based on the intensive hydrography data surveyed between 2017 and 2020 we argue that the reason for such a notable difference arises from some major issues in the study of karimi and bagheri 2016 first they developed a multi linear regression model to construct the relationship between the measured water depth and multi spectral reflectance data however the employed multi linear regression model cannot adequately capture the complexity in the relationship between water depth and reflectance the superiority of intelligent learning models over the traditional approaches like linear regression has been already demonstrated by former studies e g liu et al 2018 mohamed et al 2016 sagawa et al 2019 second the measured hydrography data to calibrate the multi linear regression model included 640 points that all were surveyed only in the north half of the lu regarding the large variability of the bed topography as well as water depth across the lu surface area those measurements could not appropriately describe the whole lake condition and were merely representative of the bathymetric changes in the north half third they used a single bathymetric map of the lu derived in 2015 to estimate the lake volume at other times to map the topography of dried areas beyond the lake water body they first classified landsat images to determine the edge of the water body at different elevations then they fitted a digital elevation model to the distance between these edges and the playa edge along the golmankhaneh station as a reference point karimi and bagheri 2016 water research institute 2015 this process clearly imposes large uncertainty in the estimated volumes as it does not take into account the impact of lakebed fluctuations due to salt precipitation and dissolution on the estimated lake volume at other times than september 2015 according to our results in fig 5 and table 6 the bed elevation in the lu is highly dynamic in time hence an appropriate prediction of the lake volume at a given time must be conducted by using the bathymetric map of the same time therefore the level volume relationship developed in 2015 to predict the lake volume in a range of h s between 1267 m and 1278 m ignores any changes in the lakebed elevation imposed by salt precipitation and dissolution as such we conclude that no single level volume relationship can be proposed for the lu or any other saline lake to represent the lake condition over time this is further demonstrated in fig 7 where for each of the bathymetric maps derived in section 3 5 we extracted the relating level volume relationship the maximum h for each curve is the maximum bed elevation in the relating bathymetric map the wide range of relationships in this plot clearly reflects the influence of the lakebed fluctuations due to salt precipitation and dissolution on the level volume relationship we note that sima and tajrishy 2013 also attempted to derive the level volume relationship in the lu by i integrating the level area relationship within the range of lake altimetry data and ii calibrating a couple of analytical models for the lake geometry i e nilsson s power function model nilsson et al 2008 and simple truncated pyramid model assuming the integration approach gives the most accurate results as compared to the other two models the applicability of the derived fourth order polynomial relationship is still limited this is because the estimation of the lake volume at a given h requires the knowledge of the lake volume at a reference h used as the minimum bound of the integration the so called reference volume can be only determined from in situ hydrography data and it also changes in time i e different reference volumes can be observed at the same h therefore the proposed level volume relationship cannot express the lake geometry changes in time and may yield large errors within a certain range of h the above pieces of evidence underline the necessity of timely hydrography data collection in the lu to monitor the lake dynamics and to estimate the lake volume appropriately an accurate bathymetry also helps study other physical processes taking place in the lu one of the poorly understood issues in the study area has been the lake saltwater exchange with the surrounding aquifer using limited hydrochemistry and isotopic field data amiri et al 2016a 2016b 2016c found that the sediment deposits on the lakebed act as a barrier preventing the chemical interaction between the lake and groundwater and thus minimizing the saltwater intrusion from the lake see also mehr et al 2019 for similar conclusions however a few other studies tourian et al 2015 vaheddoost et al 2015 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 reported a significant correlation between the lake water fluctuation and groundwater level by analyzing sparse groundwater data recorded by observation wells in the region javadzadeh et al 2020 further conducted a comprehensive analysis on the cross correlation between the lake and groundwater level using data recorded from 797 observation wells in 17 adjacent aquifers between 2001 and 2018 they also found a significant correlation between these two quantities where the direction of correlation changes spatially depending on whether the lake is losing or gaining regarding the statistical nature of the above studies sheibani et al 2020 have extended this exploration through a series of numerical simulations considering the impacts on saltwater intrusion by the lakebed sediment layer thickness lakebed sediment hydraulic conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity however they set up the geometry of their numerical model based on the sparse hydrography data isrc 2018 but not the bathymetric map of the whole lake due to its unavailability it is seen that the lack of updated information about the dynamics of bathymetry in the lu has been a missing component for this and other relevant studies in the region e g abbaspour et al 2012 arabsahebi et al 2020 saemian et al 2020 safavi et al 2020 sharifi et al 2018 therefore the results of the present study can be leveraged by future researches for analysis and synthesis purposes as it provides the most comprehensive information on the lu bathymetric changes over a long period 4 2 the interplay between the quality of field data and remotely sensed imagery in controlling the accuracy of water depth prediction the results of the ann model accuracy indicated that the prediction accuracy of water depth for the first data group was better than that for the second group followed by accuracy for the third group this observation was not expected regarding the impressive size of hydrography data in the third group and its spatially uniform distribution we investigated the reason s for this finding by exploring the possible impact of atmospheric condition on the quality of data retrieved from satellite images the average relative humidity and air temperature in the period corresponding to the first group of data were 34 and 29 c respectively these measures were 48 5 and 18 8 c for the second group of data respectively and were 83 1 and 5 1 c for the third dataset respectively it is interesting to observe that the model error is positively and negatively proportional to relative humidity and air temperature respectively indeed under the higher relative humidity the absorption and diffusion of electromagnetic waves by the water particles in the air reduce the useful information received by a satellite sensor from the ground despite using atmospherically corrected images we note that the advantage of high quality training data obtained from the field measurements could not overcome the impact of remaining noise in the satellite data on the accuracy of water depth estimation we also note that even though manaffar et al 2020 assessed the turbidity of lu and concluded the governance of relatively low turbidity in the majority of the lu surface area we cannot extend this conclusion to the results of this study due to the lack of relevant data in our study period nevertheless the order of estimation accuracy obtained in this study is much smaller than that expected in turbid water cases which highlights the acceptable validity of our results 4 3 dynamics of salt dissolution and precipitation in the lake urmia changes in the lakebed elevation are expected to happen due to salt dissolution or precipitation considering the hyper salinity of the lu intuitively it is expected that salt dissolution and precipitation take place by the lake wetting and drying respectively however the state of lake replenishment versus depletion is not the only factor in determining whether salt dissolution or precipitation dominates in the lake this is because under a similar change of water volume salt precipitation can take place in both cases of lake recession and progression in the former case the loss of water increases the salt concertation in the lake which can precipitate if the saturation degree is reached in the latter case the salt concentration of the progressive water also increases as it dissolves the lakebed salts that were deposited during the former lake recessions therefore the direction of change in the lake water volume cannot solely describe the relative degree of salt precipitation and dissolution instead we suggest that the interplay between i the volume of freshwater flow into the lake and ii the extent of lakebed inundation or drying area determines the degree of salt precipitation or dissolution in the lake the relative influence of the above two quantities can be expressed as the ration δv δa where δv and δa is the change in the lake volume and surface area in a given period respectively larger δv δa indicates that a variation in the water volume projects into a larger change of the lake level than the surface area the state of salt precipitation and dissolution is determined by the sign of δv or δa that is positive and negative δv or δa indicates dissolution and precipitation respectively if the lake receives a significant freshwater inflow that increases the lake volume at a greater rate than the lake surface area dissolution dominates due to a couple of major reasons first the impact of freshwater in diluting the lake water dominates the rate of concentration by dissolving lakebed salts second the inflow can circulate faster throughout the lake which facilitates salt dissolution across a large extent of the lake the reverse condition i e salt precipitation can occur under the same magnitude of δv δa but with opposite sign and at different absolute magnitudes of δv and δa this situation holds during the lake recession when the loss rate of water volume is much larger than the lake area shrinkage we note that in general δv δa cannot be accounted as a surrogate for the change in the average water depth depending on the geometry of the lake bathymetry and the state of h δv δa may take a large value but the change in the average water depth remains mild given the above context we hypothesize that a negative correlation holds between the salt precipitation rate and δv δa i e by shifting from smaller to larger δv δa magnitudes between two consecutive periods the lake condition is switched from precipitation to dissolution according to fig 6 since lu has experienced multiple wetting and drying episodes during the study period we could examine the above hypothesis by studying the amount of salt precipitation and dissolution given the changes in the lake surface area stored water volume and bathymetry nevertheless we could not conduct this analysis due to the lack of elevation data on the terrestrial portion of the lu indeed the extent of the derived bathymetric maps was confined to the boundary of the lake water body which changes from one time to another as such if the objective is to compute the amount of salt precipitation and dissolution from e g stage one to stage two see fig 5 we need to know the bed elevation in the region beyond the overlapping area between the bathymetric maps of the aforementioned stages therefore the difference between two consecutive bathymetric maps only provides information about the lakebed changes within the overlapped surface area of the maps and thus misses any information about the lakebed changes in the nearby areas this limitation poses a quest to plan for a comprehensive and timely data compilation on the lakebed elevation with the aid of both field data and rs 4 4 limitations and caveats despite the advantages of the employed modeling framework this study carries some challenges and limitations as table 1 shows some hydrography surveys were conducted over a long period while limited satellite images i e one or two were available during the relating period for further research we suggest using data from other satellites such as sentinel 2 to receive more images at a finer temporal resolution especially during the high lake inflow seasons when the lakebed is remarkably dynamic furthermore we had to use a single h value for the whole period of each survey this was particularly evident in the third and fourth survey periods when the change in h was considerable therefore the water surface elevation at the time of satellite image acquisition could be different from that at the time of hydrography data collection unfortunately we could not resolve this issue because the hydrography data provided from ulrp did not include daily information on the collected data over these periods the other challenge of this work was rooted in using a single value of h for the whole lake in a given day as described in section 2 2 ground measurement of h is available only from one station in the lake which does not describe diurnal fluctuation in h across the whole lake the difference in h between the northern and southern halves becomes distinct during the lake dryer conditions when the segregation of the two halves occurs at low water surface elevations under these circumstances the water surface elevation in the two halves cannot be considered the same as that measured at the golmankhaneh station the use of single lake water elevation is further projected into the computation of bathymetric maps as well as the lake level volume and level area relationships finally we acknowledge that the surveyed hydrography data at some periods did not have a uniform spatial distribution across the lake given the fact that physical characteristics of water and substrate impose a remarkable influence on the relationship between water depth and surface reflectance sufficient and uniformly distributed hydrography data is necessary for an appropriate estimation of water depth across the whole lake we attempted to tackle this issue by clustering data from all survey periods into specific groups which greatly improved the predictive model performance the clustering operation further facilitated model training over the whole spectrum of the lake water depth at a time of interest however the above consideration should be taken into account in future data collection in the lu to smoothen the process of water depth modeling and to provide hydrography data that include the smallest to largest possible water depths to measure also since the spatial variability in the lake water chemistry influences the spectral properties of pixels with the same water depth the hydrography data collection can be better guided by classifying the lake water based on a given water quality measure to ensure that data collection takes place at all classes with distinct quality characteristics 4 5 final remarks using rs data in water bodies is challenging mainly due to i the high amount of electromagnetic absorption which masks the information carried by water physicochemical characteristics ii the impact of turbidity on water leaving reflectance iii the contrasting accuracy of many atmospheric correction methods developed for the calculation of surface reflectance while the above challenges are related to all water bodies rs of shallow water environments is further subjected to the radiometric interaction of water and substrate nevertheless a few points are worth mentioning here first the signal to noise ratio snr is supposed to be higher in bright and shallow waters due to the lower electromagnetic absorption as compared to that in deep waters kutser et al 2020 second given the substrate influence on water leaving reflectance particularly near shorelines this impact over a range of similar water depths would be uniformly distributed in water bodies with a uniform bed composition such as the lu with salty bed this would in turn diminish water depth estimation bias from machine learning algorithms that are capable of deciphering non linear relations between water depth and surface reflectance if sufficient well distributed in situ data are employed third the literature witnesses that rs of turbid waters has been less successful as compared to that in non turbid waters because high turbidity could strongly mask the spectral information of water matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 in turbid waters also known as case ii waters containing high amounts of optically active substances oas e g suspended solids phytoplankton and colored dissolved organic matters high absorption of the electromagnetic spectrum by oas reduces the decipherable information from the water spectral signature also due to the complex optical interactions between oas components we may not be able to derive a unique spectral pattern for a variable of interest e g water depth across a whole water body shen et al 2010 as such the significance of a careful selection of suitable atmospheric correction method is more critical in turbid waters as compared to that in non turbid waters caballero and stumpf 2020 wei et al 2018 in such cases the atmospheric correction schemes specifically developed for water environments e g seadas and acolite are recommended ilori et al 2019 vanhellemont 2019 vanhellemont and ruddick 2014 regarding the above challenges and opportunities it is concluded that the proposed framework in this study can be employed effectively to extract the bathymetric map of a water body of interest to this end the availability of proper information on the physicochemical characteristics of the water body is necessary as a prerequisite for adopting appropriate input data processing tools also the input satellite bands and the ann structure i e the number of hidden layers and neurons should be optimized locally in the desired study area to make sure reliable estimation of water depth and boundary with small uncertainty is reached 5 conclusions the catastrophic drying of the hyper saline lake urmia lu has been recognized as one of the most serious environmental issues of international interest over the past decade sustainable restoration of the lake relies heavily on an appropriate understanding of the lake dynamics which should be monitored continuously to decipher the causal relationship between the lake water volume and its controlling processes in this study we used extensive hydrography data and high resolution satellite imagery to derive three dimensional water depth and bathymetric maps in the lu at multiple instances between 2017 and 2020 to this end we developed a machine learning based model to derive the complex non linear relationship between water depth and surface reflectance the hydrography data included 32 984 points surveyed via six campaigns from september 2017 to may 2010 by the urmia lake restoration program ulrp by processing 172 landsat images between 1984 and 2020 we further developed the level area relationship that describes the driest and wettest conditions of the lu in the past 50 years we found that by clustering in situ hydrography data and optimizing the number of satellite bands required for the model training purposes the model accuracy improved significantly the testing process yielded errors that were much smaller than the lake averaged water depth as evidence by rmse 7 8 17 9 cm we also observed that two different linear relationships hold between h and a in the lu with a threshold behavior at h 1271 31 m our results indicated that no single relationship could describe the changes of lake water volume versus h over a long period the derived bathymetric maps witnessed remarkable changes in the lakebed topography due to salt precipitation and dissolution during the episodes of lake drying and wetting given the highly dynamic relationship between h and volume the findings of this study highlight the necessity of continuous and frequent bathymetric mapping in the lu we finally observed that the lu water volume in may 2020 was 3 6 times larger than that in february 2019 indicating a remarkable increase in the rate of lake restoration during this period credit authorship

4059,water quality in lowland rivers is sensitive to changes in flow during summer dry periods when high temperatures and low pollutant dilution are problematic and may reduce oxygen concentrations to levels of ecological concern a 10 year period of monitoring data was collated for a typical small lowland uk river two hourly resolution applications of a process based water quality model questor were made with and without local knowledge to establish whether specific information on stream channel hydraulics is an essential precursor to successful simulation results showed this information to be necessary with considerably better goodness of fit statistics obtained when the local knowledge was used in this regard mean improvements in nash sutcliffe efficiency across all monitoring sites were from 0 33 to 0 18 and from 0 24 to 0 78 for dissolved oxygen and water temperature respectively percent bias was within 10 for the local model the 10 year record also allowed a detailed characterisation of how changes in flow as described by a comprehensive range of indicators of hydrological alteration relate to the water quality determinants analysis revealed these dynamics were also captured more realistically when the model was driven by local knowledge the research concludes that river dissolved oxygen simulations driven by national level information are of some value as

intelligence e g csabragi et al 2017 these can perform well using nationally extensive low frequency water quality and runoff data but as underlying mechanisms are not represented correct sensitivity

components to stream metabolism additional to those controlled by primary producers being related to organic carbon characteristics and sediment properties estimation of these additional heterotrophic respiration fluxes has despite recent technical advances largely eluded research effort even if now known this information is limited and spatio temporally sporadic secondly accurate simulation of the variability of reaeration within river networks needs detailed characterisation of river hydraulics although rough approximations can be made using information derived from climate and topography 1 d models based on such data sources cannot capture local hydraulic variation drawbacks related to insufficient segmentation of river stretches when treated as sequences of well mixed compartments are recognised warren et al 2005 detailed information about channel heterogeneities and the dimensions and operation of flow control structures and site specific data and analysis represents local knowledge this local contextual information is unlikely to be held in national databases and only accessible through local stakeholder interaction and site visits to put the likely level of need for local knowledge in context the implications of some key structural aspects of water quality models used for large scale application are highlighted the method of model spatial discretisation

successful water temperature simulations using process based approaches including those incorporating energy balance calculations are achievable dugdale et al 2017 and can greatly benefit water quality simulation in particular for modelling do at daily or sub daily timesteps to demonstrate the unique challenges of achieving spatially extensive yet detailed and accurate simulations of water temperature and do in river networks we present a case study of the river deben a small lowland river in east anglia uk the river suffers from periodically chronic do depletion due to oxygen demand in bed sediments related to biotic activity parr and mason 2003 our objectives are to simulate hourly water quality dynamics over a 10 year period at successive sites along a river profile using the pseudo 1 d questor river eutrophication model pathak et al 2021 we hypothesise that do dynamics can be simulated satisfactorily using data and information stored in national level datasets to test the hypothesis we run the model twice with and without local knowledge beyond what is readily available online if supported this would suggest that spatially extensive simulation of do and prediction of its response to future change is achievable the river hydrological regime is a primary control on water quality and is very sensitive to drivers of natural and anthropogenic variability and change by considering relations between simulated water quality and indices of hydrological alteration iha richter et al 1996 we then compare with observed water quality to explore the extent to which the two models are correctly sensitive to hydrologically induced change over the 10 year period by comparison with observed data in light of model performance we consider wider implications through discussing the extent to which local knowledge is necessary for successful model application structurally first we describe the questor model and the case study river and we define questor applications and derivation and use of ihas section 2 then in section 3 we present results and summarise key findings interpretation of the findings follows in section 4 reflecting on the value of local knowledge discussing the importance of correctly representing water quality in low flow conditions and identifying priority areas for model improvement 2 method 2 1 model description questor quality evaluation and simulation tool for river systems is a 1 d model of the river network representing processes controlling eutrophication and the consequences thereof hutchins et al 2016 it consists of a set of

include plants and benthic algae diffuse inputs are represented by observations process based rainfall runoff diffuse pollution models or simple statistical models solar radiation inputs control water temperature and primary production 2 2 site description and model setup the river deben in suffolk uk fig 1 drains a small lowland catchment of 163 km2 as defined at naunton hall gauging station nrfa id 35002 national grid reference 6322 2534 the catchment is predominant arable 79 of low relief maximum altitude 66 mod and overlays a mixture of moderately permeable clay and permeable chalk bedrock the questor model of the river deben comprises a 27 7 km slow flowing stretch of river between the a1120 road bridge a few kilometres downstream of the town of debenham and ufford bridge split into 13 reaches along this stretch there are five sites with flow and or water quality observations notable amongst these are the flow gauging stations at naunton hall and brandeston 3 3 and 20 8 km upstream of ufford bridge respectively and the continuous water quality monitoring site at sanctuary bridge letheringham 16 1 km upstream of ufford bridge seven surface water tributaries are represented of these the main influences from tributaries are the main deben and the earl soham tributary which are both influenced by sewage effluent discharge and augmentation to flow from a borehole in the upper reaches and potsford brook and byng brook data to support modelling were supplied for 2010 2019 from national environment agency ea monitoring programmes the monitoring shows the river to be vulnerable to low do during summer of 71 observations at brandeston 6 fell below 6 mg do l 1 the earlier part of the period 2010 15 had relatively more comprehensive data coverage in tributaries and along the river from grab sampling solar radiation was obtained from the nearby wattisham station and moderated by estimates of riparian canopy coverage the estimates of riparian shade have been made using google earth imagery as shown to be realistic in other questor studies e g bachiller jareno et al 2019 waylett et al 2013 apart from flow and water temperature which did not require calibration the model was fitted using a process of sequential downstream site by site calibration for the 2010 2013 period and tested for 2014 2019 model performance was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage error in mean pbias the model was applied at hourly resolution a description of model determinants processes and equations is provided in appendix a a biological component based on assumption of phytoplankton biomass being dominated by cool water diatoms equation a1 was chosen as it gives good performance in relation to hourly data from the lower river thames pathak et al 2021 2 3 model applications using the above information section 2 2 as a basis on which to form the bounds and data supply for the model two applications were set up the methods and supporting data sources described below are summarised in a table appendix a table a1 a first application basic model was made without the benefit of the local knowledge as the local knowledge related primarily to definition of channel morphological characteristics known to have a strong bearing on determinants directly related to consequences of eutrophication do bod chlorophyll a only those biogeochemical parameters related to nitrogen and phosphorus species underwent site by site calibration other questor modelling studies of similar sized rivers in lowland uk hutchins et al 2020 pathak et al 2021 were used to help inform river hydraulic parameters and to estimate i the ratio of rates of water column to benthic respiration ii parameters related to phytoplankton dynamics total heterotrophic respiration was estimated in two alternative ways basic a by assuming rates typical of the other similar sized rivers 0 5 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 for water column and benthic respiration respectively and basic b based on fitting in the calibration period the pbias for data aggregated across all sites fractional light penetration fp values were based on aerial photographic estimates of occupancy by riparian canopies assumed to block 100 of direct sunlight a second application local model was set up with the benefit of local knowledge used to provide additional information to guide the process continuous water quality monitoring by local ea staff at sanctuary bridge was made available for part of the validation period 2018 2019 and therefore aided model testing due to the influence of the chalk aquifer on catchment hydrology and water resources groundwater discharge contributions were included in the middle reaches river hydraulic parameters were defined using satellite imagery dtm river level data photographs of control structures and qualitative observations of channel condition in late spring agricultural abstraction and sewage treatment works effluent were included and characterised using local ea records canopy fractional penetration fp estimates were modified upward based on local photographic observations suggesting significant light penetration to the water surface 2 4 indicators of hydrological alteration for each of the two flow gauging stations there are three data sets of water flow they are observed flow and simulated flow from both basic models and the local model for better understanding the flow regime and the environmental flow we applied the indicators of hydrological alteration iha to describe the variation of discharge these biological related hydrological indicators were proposed by richter et al 1996 for assessing hydrological alteration in river networks and accepted world wide for making linkages with water quality and ecological influences olden poff 2003 schneider et al 2013 guo et al 2020 valerio et al 2021 iha contain five hydrological dimensions of parameters which characterize the flow regime from its magnitude frequency rate of change duration and timing in this study we computed two kinds of iha average daily flows were used as a basis for calculating the indicators the first matrix of 67 indicators annual iha was exported from the iha software developed by the nature conservancy 2009 covering monthly mean flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow timing of annual extreme events frequency and duration of high and low pulses and rate and frequency of flow condition changes appendix b table b1 the second matrix of indicators short term iha was modified from the annual set in order that flow events happening in defined periods i e 3 7 14 21 days before each specific water quality sampling date can be emphasized together 17 hydrological parameters appendix b table b2 cover the three dimensions of flow regime magnitude of flow events frequency of flow events and rate of change in flow events 3 results 3 1 model performance optimised parameters are listed for the two models appendix c table c1 when using default values for heterotrophic respiration taken from similar sized lowland rivers the basic a model gave very poor performance greatly overestimating the low do values for all sites 19 pbias 22 the alternative approach to parameter estimation b was therefore adopted for the remaining analysis from now on referred to as the basic model as pbias and nse were much improved fig 2 for two months in spring 2011 the river was incorrectly simulated to dry up a consequence of not using local knowledge to inform setup data from this period were omitted from all analysis whilst both models simulated river discharge comparably local knowledge informing hydraulic representation greatly influences river residence time and water level fluctuations over a 29 month period commencing in august 2017 median and 10th percentile water levels at letheringham mill 14 5 km upstream of ufford bridge were 0 73 and 0 67 m respectively this small variation was reflected by both the local model 0 45 and 0 40 m respectively for median and 10th percentile and the basic model 0 13 and 0 10 m respectively for median and 10th percentile it was to be expected that water level observations would be higher than simulated estimates due to substantial submerged macrophyte presence which are not accounted for in the model however although the local model appears to simulate acceptable water levels the basic model simulations are clearly unrealistically low the local model also performed considerably better than the basic model for all water quality determinants appendix c table c2 and simulated most water quality determinants with little bias overall levels of nitrate ammonium do and temperature were modelled acceptably pbias 20 at all sites in contrast the basic model had overall tendency for underestimation the exception is srp which was substantially overestimated at all sites by both models local model pbias 13 121 the largest mismatches were in the autumn reliable chlorophyll a data were not available and could only be inferred indirectly from nutrient oxygen and bod dynamics the local model correctly simulated depletion of nutrients in the early summer and simulated bod at brandeston over a 6 year period 300 measurements with minimal bias pbias 0 5 in comparison the basic model greatly underestimated bod pbias value of 82 or 52 under the basic a application at brandeston and gave much greater overestimation of srp pbias 146 330 in summary in terms of mean levels across all monitoring sites the percentage improvement in pbias gained over the 10 year period by invoking the local model was 18 55 66 and 47 for temperature nitrate srp and do respectively in terms of pbias and nse criteria the benefits gained by including local knowledge and how the level of improvement varies along the river is shown for water temperature and concentrations of nitrate and dissolved oxygen fig 2 the basic model does not provide values of nse above zero for do suggesting that based on nationally available data alone the model cannot provide an adequate simulation in systems of this type the inclusion of local knowledge resulted in much better representation of time series response nse for temperature and do there was also improvement for nitrate although this was only moderate as the basic model shows good performance in this respect whilst overestimation of srp was more acute in upstream reaches performance of the local model generally declined slightly downstream possibly due to increasing uncertainty in local knowledge in particular regarding volumetric contributions to river flow differences between the performance of the two models and its variation between sites is shown for do and water temperature fig 3 for temperature compared to the basic model there is less scatter in local model performance at naunton hall there is less bias i e less underestimation the basic model failed to represent variation in do either sufficiently or correctly a shortcoming less apparent for the local model 3 2 detailed assessment of response in data and models the differences in model performance as evaluated by comparison with hourly data at sanctuary bridge show the local model to perform better than the basic model fig 4 the local model better captures the extent of diurnal cycling both models have a tendency to underestimate late summer and autumn water temperatures the oxygen holding capacity of water is reduced under increasing water temperature and theoretically this will lead to inverse relationships in natural river waters whilst this appears the overriding control at brandeston bridge as represented in the basic model it does not reflect observations fig 5 a more complex relationship is revealed by the data suggesting the influence of other factors on do concentration not related to temperature this subtlety is only captured in the local model at brandeston bridge and naunton hall where flow data from gauging stations are available water quality response temperature and do was assessed in terms of indicators of hydrological alteration iha the degree to which the two models capture relationships at an annual level between iha and typical summer water temperatures 90th percentile is shown fig 6 for the local model there is better agreement with observations for the majority of indicators as demonstrated by many points plotting much closer to the 1 1 line than for the basic model there were insufficient do data in addition short term response was investigated a set of short term ihas were each regressed in turn against instantaneous water temperatures and do concentrations and the strength of relationships analysed statistically these relationships were compared between those derived from observed data and from simulations at all corresponding time points using both basic and local models the types of relationship observed between iha and water temperature are clearly better reproduced by the local model fig 7 and the correlation coefficients are in closer agreement the process when repeated for do revealed similar results although there are fewer observed data at naunton hall the majority of iha indicators result in disagreement in the direction of relationship between observed and basic model simulation opposite sign of r value when using the local model there is much better agreement 4 discussion 4 1 improvements in model performance achieved through local knowledge comparison of results from the basic and local models with observations demonstrates the improved performance gained for a range of determinants by including local knowledge in model setup almost exclusively manifested in terms of a more realistic representation of river hydraulics of the sources of local knowledge previously outlined table a1 those that have specifically enabled better model performance are as follows groundwater modelling environment agency 2019 and british geological survey monitoring shand et al 2007 informed estimation of groundwater discharges and water quality signatures in middle reaches flowing through areas underlain by chalk local information about water use for agriculture and groundwater pumping to augment river flow provide more informed estimates of abstractions along the river channel and tributary flow estimates respectively geo referenced photographs of weirs and mill gates allowed artificial influences on reaeration to be estimated more accurately typically basic modelling can only include default values for an incomplete subset of all structures that are included on os digital data sets continuous water level data provided by local ea staff which allowed better specification of river hydraulic parameters photographs of river condition enabled a better specification on a reach specific basis of widths roughness and hydraulic parameters alongside better estimation of light penetration through riparian tree canopies applying local knowledge has resulted in better simulation of water temperature a variable fundamental in controlling water quality dynamics the considerable mismatches in the basic model as demonstrated by scatter in fig 3 is considerably reduced when using the local model with local knowledge good fits are achieved in november to april periods whereas without it there is underestimation underestimation is still apparent during the summer for which the reasons are unclear but could be attributable to model input uncertainties concerning either shading effects or estimated groundwater temperature by achieving a more realistic representation of the response of water level to change in flow inputs and consequent representation of velocity the local model reflects diurnal temperature fluctuations well fig 4 the basic model greatly overestimates such fluctuations there is uncertainty in autotroph response in the deben system due to lack of representative chlorophyll a data observations of bod at brandeston bridge in the first half of the study period when coupled with do give indirect evidence of phytoplankton growth and decay consequently the local model application achieved bod simulations with minimal bias whereas the basic model greatly underestimated bod concentration of nitrogen species were largely simulated acceptably by both models table c2 fig 2 overestimation of srp was apparent throughout the network especially in upper reaches most acutely in late summer and by both local and basic models table c2 as sources are comprehensively accounted for in the local model the implication is that in channel uptake fluxes not represented in model structure are important plausible mechanisms of in channel uptake are abiotic co precipitation with calcite or adsorption to sediment or biotic macrophyte uptake significant abiotic srp uptake has not been consistently identified from a synthesis of river modelling studies jackson blake et al 2017 photographic evidence shows macrophytes to be plentiful in the upstream deben but quantifying their impact on nutrient levels is not straightforward due to difficulties in making representative biomass estimation simulation of do is improved when using local knowledge table c2 fig 2 notably the basic model fails to represent the apparent complexity of influences on do beyond the fundamental temperature control fig 5 in this respect the local model provides clear improvement yet whilst levels are generally simulated acceptably it is clear that the variation in do not captured by the basic model is still not represented sufficiently or accurately fig 3 at sanctuary bridge do is overestimated pbias 29 especially in summer see section 4 3 although the overestimation of srp might imply problematic consequences in terms of overall water quality simulation do is not directly affected by srp in the deben here observed srp are above a level where it becomes limiting for phytoplankton growth which would have consequences for do other studies of systems transitioning from heterotrophic to autotrophic control have found do response to be insensitive to phosphorus using boosted regression tree approaches in the thames pathak et al 2021 found primary productivity and eutrophication impacts to be insensitive to nutrients likewise wang et al 2018 made similar conclusions from process based model sensitivity analysis in situations of excess nutrient supply 4 2 the importance of understanding flow controls on water quality in dry periods water quality in lowland river systems such as the deben is especially sensitive to changes in flow during dry periods mosley 2015 in this context environmental regulators recognise the fine balance needed between river quality considerations maintaining groundwater resources and supporting agricultural activity defra 2019 consequently much focus is given to the implications of river flow augmentation and inter basin transfers therefore relationships between the suite of ihas and measures of water quality response provide important contextual information of the mechanisms operating in these systems realistic capture of relationships between determinants represents a fundamental measure of the worth of the respective model applications from the interpretation of correlation coefficients based on multi year datasets figs 6 and 7 it is clearly demonstrated that the local model better represents strength of correlations between water quality and hydrological indicators than the basic model this finding is consistent and robust across a range of ihas both for individual short term iha and aggregated annual iha categories as ihas were normalised between the categories it is noteworthy that ihas relating to flow magnitude are more strongly correlated with water temperature at an aggregated level than at an individual level frequency related ihas show higher correlations at the individual level rate of change ihas rarely show high correlation the analysis was performed for fundamental integrated indicators namely water temperature and do whose inter relationships are clearly also better represented by the local model fig 5 however it is also clear there is still considerable mismatch and possibilities for rectifying these problems are explored below 4 3 needs for and prospects for further improving do simulation at sanctuary bridge very low oxygen levels were observed from a continuous monitoring system 10th percentile do values of 2 83 and 1 12 mg l in 2018 and 2019 respectively various possible reasons why both models overestimated these low values which could potentially be rectified within the existing structure were investigated 1 much lower levels of do in groundwater than suggested by shand et al 2007 2 accelerated benthic algal and macrophyte growth throughout reaches which could reconcile the srp overestimation and through undesirable eutrophic consequences deplete the do 3 slower flowing deeper river channel by making appropriate model adjustments the first two were shown to have no discernible effect whereas the third only reduced mismatch if waters were implausibly slow flowing and deep 5m other potentially plausible explanations exist but their exploration extends beyond the specific issues at sanctuary bridge and also beyond the overall scope of the questor model they thereby also cover wider considerations beyond the case study and highlight both shortcomings and opportunities for further improving water quality models sluice controlled damming of rivers can result in flow stagnation and periods of low do in specific locations localised abundant submergent vegetation can contribute to reduction in flow velocity and a supply of bod towards the end of the growing season reaches with elevated macrophyte biomass may show higher gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration er than elsewhere alnoee et al 2021 in the deben however although sanctuary bridge do data implies high er there is no evidence of elevated gpp assumptions underpinning simple 1 d model structures may lead to difficulty representing the hydraulic conditions to which water quality is very sensitive allowance should be made that rather than reflecting the main channel measurements may represent dead zones of markedly reduced flow conveyance such areas of limited main channel mixing are possibly influenced by anoxic bed sediment environments in addition to supply from upstream sewage effluent solids very high levels of benthic respiration may locally arise from abundant overhanging vegetation supplying organic matter in the deben application high levels were nevertheless inferred in the local model and a further increase revealed little additional reduction in simulated do quantifying benthic respiration is highly uncertain due to difficulties in measurement hutchins et al 2020 novel methods incorporating aquatic eddy covariance berg et al 2003 can provide a step change in understanding at a local level but are time consuming and an expensive investment with sufficient access to local knowledge many of these challenges can likely be overcome using 2 d approaches e g knightes et al 2019 alternatively aggregated dead zone models employed to improve simulation of pollutant dispersion e g lees et al 2000 might be adapted to better capture local variability in do 5 conclusions evidence from a modelling study of the river deben uk suggests that although a process based water quality model questor driven solely by national level data sources can likely simulate nutrient concentrations acceptably in such environments it cannot achieve satisfactory results for do a clear improvement in performance is obtained when specific local knowledge of hydrology and flow routing is included to inform the model application improvements were shown to arise from efforts to identify i dam operations ii dead zones whose significance can be pinpointed from detailed meta data from the monitoring programme and iii macrophyte prevalence the implications of the study are wide ranging in shallow slow flowing rivers in dry lowland areas of flat terrain processes controlling water temperature and do are very sensitive to changes in flow regime during low flow periods in summer the deben is typical of such a river found in south eastern uk and as is often the case the challenges are exacerbated by macrophyte overgrowth in channels and flow regulation unsurprisingly findings from the deben study reveal patchy model performance section 4 1 poorer than that achieved by questor in larger lowland rivers such as the thames pathak et al 2021 and an inability to fully reconcile changes in flow with changes in water quality section 4 2 the findings demonstrate that insufficient contextual information behind water quality observations can still hamper model performance and the observations necessary to support improvements can remain elusive for investigating do response challenges associated with characterising river hydraulics representing benthic environments and quantifying the influence of macrophytes mean that national scale water quality model structures are best used as screening tools greater caution is needed for more detailed simulation which would benefit from the considerations and recommendations outlined in section 4 3 overall detailed local knowledge leads to better water quality simulation and can support model improvements and lead to improved process understanding whilst this provides greater insights and confidence for management decisions the greater information requirements are challenging for conducting national scale assessments frameworks that facilitate screening and increasingly refined modelling proportional to local problems allow more

4059,water quality in lowland rivers is sensitive to changes in flow during summer dry periods when high temperatures and low pollutant dilution are problematic and may reduce oxygen concentrations to levels of ecological concern a 10 year period of monitoring data was collated for a typical small lowland uk river two hourly resolution applications of a process based water quality model questor were made with and without local knowledge to establish whether specific information on stream channel hydraulics is an essential precursor to successful simulation results showed this information to be necessary with considerably better goodness of fit statistics obtained when the local knowledge was used in this regard mean improvements in nash sutcliffe efficiency across all monitoring sites were from 0 33 to 0 18 and from 0 24 to 0 78 for dissolved oxygen and water temperature respectively percent bias was within 10 for the local model the 10 year record also allowed a detailed characterisation of how changes in flow as described by a comprehensive range of indicators of hydrological alteration relate to the water quality determinants analysis revealed these dynamics were also captured more realistically when the model was driven by local knowledge the research concludes that river dissolved oxygen simulations driven by national level information are of some value as

id 35002 national grid reference 6322 2534 the catchment is predominant arable 79 of low relief maximum altitude 66 mod and overlays a mixture of moderately permeable clay and permeable chalk bedrock the questor model of the river deben comprises a 27 7 km slow flowing stretch of river between the a1120 road bridge a few kilometres downstream of the town of debenham and ufford bridge split into 13 reaches along this stretch there are five sites with flow and or water quality observations notable amongst these are the flow gauging stations at naunton hall and brandeston 3 3 and 20 8 km upstream of ufford bridge respectively and the continuous water quality monitoring site at sanctuary bridge letheringham 16 1 km upstream of ufford bridge seven surface water tributaries are represented of these the main influences from tributaries are the main deben and the earl soham tributary which are both influenced by sewage effluent discharge and augmentation to flow from a borehole in the upper reaches and potsford brook and byng brook data to support modelling were supplied for 2010 2019 from national environment agency ea monitoring programmes the monitoring shows the river to be vulnerable to low do during summer of 71 observations at brandeston 6 fell below 6 mg do l 1 the earlier part of the period 2010 15 had relatively more comprehensive data coverage in tributaries and along the river from grab sampling solar radiation was obtained from the nearby wattisham station and moderated by estimates of riparian canopy coverage the estimates of riparian shade have been made using google earth imagery as shown to be realistic in other questor studies e g bachiller jareno et al 2019 waylett et al 2013 apart from flow and water temperature which did not require calibration the model was fitted using a process of sequential downstream site by site calibration for the 2010 2013 period and tested for 2014 2019 model performance was assessed using the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percentage error in mean pbias the model was applied at hourly resolution a description of model determinants processes and equations is provided in appendix a a biological component based on assumption of phytoplankton biomass being dominated by cool water diatoms equation a1 was chosen as it gives good performance in relation to hourly data from the lower river thames pathak et al 2021 2 3 model applications using the above information section 2 2 as a basis on which to form the bounds and data supply for the model two applications were set up the methods and supporting data sources described below are summarised in a table appendix a table a1 a first application basic model was made without the benefit of the local knowledge as the local knowledge related primarily to definition of channel morphological characteristics known to have a strong bearing on determinants directly related to consequences of eutrophication do bod chlorophyll a only those biogeochemical parameters related to nitrogen and phosphorus species underwent site by site calibration other questor modelling studies of similar sized rivers in lowland uk hutchins et al 2020 pathak et al 2021 were used to help inform river hydraulic parameters and to estimate i the ratio of rates of water column to benthic respiration ii parameters related to phytoplankton dynamics total heterotrophic respiration was estimated in two alternative ways basic a by assuming rates typical of the other similar sized rivers 0 5 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 for water column and benthic respiration respectively and basic b based on fitting in the calibration period the pbias for data aggregated across all sites fractional light penetration fp values were based on aerial photographic estimates of occupancy by riparian canopies assumed to block 100 of direct sunlight a second application local model was set up with the benefit of local knowledge used to provide additional information to guide the process continuous water quality monitoring by local ea staff at sanctuary bridge was made available for part of the validation period 2018 2019 and therefore aided model testing due to the influence of the chalk aquifer on catchment hydrology and water resources groundwater discharge contributions were included in the middle reaches river hydraulic parameters were defined using satellite imagery dtm river level data photographs of control structures and qualitative observations of channel condition in late spring agricultural abstraction and sewage treatment works effluent were included and characterised using local ea records canopy fractional penetration fp estimates were modified upward based on local photographic observations suggesting significant light penetration to the water surface 2 4 indicators of hydrological alteration for each of the two flow gauging stations there are three data sets of water flow they are observed flow and simulated flow from both basic models and the local model for better understanding the flow regime and the environmental flow we applied the indicators of hydrological alteration iha to describe the variation of discharge these biological related hydrological indicators were proposed by richter et al 1996 for assessing hydrological alteration in river networks and accepted world wide for making linkages with water quality and ecological influences olden poff 2003 schneider et al 2013 guo et al 2020 valerio et al 2021 iha contain five hydrological dimensions of parameters which characterize the flow regime from its magnitude frequency rate of change duration and timing in this study we computed two kinds of iha average daily flows were used as a basis for calculating the indicators the first matrix of 67 indicators annual iha was exported from the iha software developed by the nature conservancy 2009 covering monthly mean flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme flow timing of annual extreme events frequency and duration of high and low pulses and rate and frequency of flow condition changes appendix b table b1 the second matrix of indicators short term iha was modified from the annual set in order that flow events happening in defined periods i e 3 7 14 21 days before each specific water quality sampling date can be emphasized together 17 hydrological parameters appendix b table b2 cover the three dimensions of flow regime magnitude of flow events frequency of flow events and rate of change in flow events 3 results 3 1 model performance optimised parameters are listed for the two models appendix c table c1 when using default values for heterotrophic respiration taken from similar sized lowland rivers the basic a model gave very poor performance greatly overestimating the low do values for all sites 19 pbias 22 the alternative approach to parameter estimation b was therefore adopted for the remaining analysis from now on referred to as the basic model as pbias and nse were much improved fig 2 for two months in spring 2011 the river was incorrectly simulated to dry up a consequence of not using local knowledge to inform setup data from this period were omitted from all analysis whilst both models simulated river discharge comparably local knowledge informing hydraulic representation greatly influences river residence time and water level fluctuations over a 29 month period commencing in august 2017 median and 10th percentile water levels at letheringham mill 14 5 km upstream of ufford bridge were 0 73 and 0 67 m respectively this small variation was reflected by both the local model 0 45 and 0 40 m respectively for median and 10th percentile and the basic model 0 13 and 0 10 m respectively for median and 10th percentile it was to be expected that water level observations would be higher than simulated estimates due to substantial submerged macrophyte presence which are not accounted for in the model however although the local model appears to simulate acceptable water levels the basic model simulations are clearly unrealistically low the local model also performed considerably better than the basic model for all water quality determinants appendix c table c2 and simulated most water quality determinants with little bias overall levels of nitrate ammonium do and temperature were modelled acceptably pbias 20 at all sites in contrast the basic model had overall tendency for underestimation the exception is srp which was substantially overestimated at all sites by both models local model pbias 13 121 the largest mismatches were in the autumn reliable chlorophyll a data were not available and could only be inferred indirectly from nutrient oxygen and bod dynamics the local model correctly simulated depletion of nutrients in the early summer and simulated bod at brandeston over a 6 year period 300 measurements with minimal bias pbias 0 5 in comparison the basic model greatly underestimated bod pbias value of 82 or 52 under the basic a application at brandeston and gave much greater overestimation of srp pbias 146 330 in summary in terms of mean levels across all monitoring sites the percentage improvement in pbias gained over the 10 year period by invoking the local model was 18 55 66 and 47 for temperature nitrate srp and do respectively in terms of pbias and nse criteria the benefits gained by including local knowledge and how the level of improvement varies along the river is shown for water temperature and concentrations of nitrate and dissolved oxygen fig 2 the basic model does not provide values of nse above zero for do suggesting that based on nationally available data alone the model cannot provide an adequate simulation in systems of this type the inclusion of local knowledge resulted in much better representation of time series response nse for temperature and do there was also improvement for nitrate although this was only moderate as the basic model shows good performance in this respect whilst overestimation of srp was more acute in upstream reaches performance of the local model generally declined slightly downstream possibly due to increasing uncertainty in local knowledge in particular regarding volumetric contributions to river flow differences between the performance of the two models and its variation between sites is shown for do and water temperature fig 3 for temperature compared to the basic model there is less scatter in local model performance at naunton hall there is less bias i e less underestimation the basic model failed to represent variation in do either sufficiently or correctly a shortcoming less apparent for the local model 3 2 detailed assessment of response in data and models the differences in model performance as evaluated by comparison with hourly data at sanctuary bridge show the local model to perform better than the basic model fig 4 the local model better captures the extent of diurnal cycling both models have a tendency to underestimate late summer and autumn water temperatures the oxygen holding capacity of water is reduced under increasing water temperature and theoretically this will lead to inverse relationships in natural river waters whilst this appears the overriding control at brandeston bridge as represented in the basic model it does not reflect observations fig 5 a more complex relationship is revealed by the data suggesting the influence of other factors on do concentration not related to temperature this subtlety is only captured in the local model at brandeston bridge and naunton hall where flow data from gauging stations are available water quality response temperature and do was assessed in terms of indicators of hydrological alteration iha the degree to which the two models capture relationships at an annual level between iha and typical summer water temperatures 90th percentile is shown fig 6 for the local model there is better agreement with observations for the majority of indicators as demonstrated by many points plotting much closer to the 1 1 line than for the basic model there were insufficient do data in addition short term response was investigated a set of short term ihas were each regressed in turn against instantaneous water temperatures and do concentrations and the strength of relationships analysed statistically these relationships were compared between those derived from observed data and from simulations at all corresponding time points using both basic and local models the types of relationship observed between iha and water temperature are clearly better reproduced by the local model fig 7 and the correlation coefficients are in closer agreement the process when repeated for do revealed similar results although there are fewer observed data at naunton hall the majority of iha indicators result in disagreement in the direction of relationship between observed and basic model simulation opposite sign of r value when using the local model there is much better agreement 4 discussion 4 1 improvements in model performance achieved through local knowledge comparison of results from the basic and local models with observations demonstrates the improved performance gained for a range of determinants by including local knowledge in model setup almost exclusively manifested in terms of a more realistic representation of river hydraulics of the sources of local knowledge previously outlined table a1 those that have specifically enabled better model performance are as follows groundwater modelling environment agency 2019 and british geological survey monitoring shand et al 2007 informed estimation of groundwater discharges and water quality signatures in middle reaches flowing through areas underlain by chalk local information about water use for agriculture and groundwater pumping to augment river flow provide more informed estimates of abstractions along the river channel and tributary flow estimates respectively geo referenced photographs of weirs and mill gates allowed artificial influences on reaeration to be estimated more accurately typically basic modelling can only include default values for an incomplete subset of all structures that are included on os digital data sets continuous water level data provided by local ea staff which allowed better specification of river hydraulic parameters photographs of river condition enabled a better specification on a reach specific basis of widths roughness and hydraulic parameters alongside better estimation of light penetration through riparian tree canopies applying local knowledge has resulted in better simulation of water temperature a variable fundamental in controlling water quality dynamics the considerable mismatches in the basic model as demonstrated by scatter in fig 3 is considerably reduced when using the local model with local knowledge good fits are achieved in november to april periods whereas without it there is underestimation underestimation is still apparent during the summer for which the reasons are unclear but could be attributable to model input uncertainties concerning either shading effects or estimated groundwater temperature by achieving a more realistic representation of the response of water level to change in flow inputs and consequent representation of velocity the local model reflects diurnal temperature fluctuations well fig 4 the basic model greatly overestimates such fluctuations there is uncertainty in autotroph response in the deben system due to lack of representative chlorophyll a data observations of bod at brandeston bridge in the first half of the study period when coupled with do give indirect evidence of phytoplankton growth and decay consequently the local model application achieved bod simulations with minimal bias whereas the basic model greatly underestimated bod concentration of nitrogen species were largely simulated acceptably by both models table c2 fig 2 overestimation of srp was apparent throughout the network especially in upper reaches most acutely in late summer and by both local and basic models table c2 as sources are comprehensively accounted for in the local model the implication is that in channel uptake fluxes not represented in model structure are important plausible mechanisms of in channel uptake are abiotic co precipitation with calcite or adsorption to sediment or biotic macrophyte uptake significant abiotic srp uptake has not been consistently identified from a synthesis of river modelling studies jackson blake et al 2017 photographic evidence shows macrophytes to be plentiful in the upstream deben but quantifying their impact on nutrient levels is not straightforward due to difficulties in making representative biomass estimation simulation of do is improved when using local knowledge table c2 fig 2 notably the basic model fails to represent the apparent complexity of influences on do beyond the fundamental temperature control fig 5 in this respect the local model provides clear improvement yet whilst levels are generally simulated acceptably it is clear that the variation in do not captured by the basic model is still not represented sufficiently or accurately fig 3 at sanctuary bridge do is overestimated pbias 29 especially in summer see section 4 3 although the overestimation of srp might imply problematic consequences in terms of overall water quality simulation do is not directly affected by srp in the deben here observed srp are above a level where it becomes limiting for phytoplankton growth which would have consequences for do other studies of systems transitioning from heterotrophic to autotrophic control have found do response to be insensitive to phosphorus using boosted regression tree approaches in the thames pathak et al 2021 found primary productivity and eutrophication impacts to be insensitive to nutrients likewise wang et al 2018 made similar conclusions from process based model sensitivity analysis in situations of excess nutrient supply 4 2 the importance of understanding flow controls on water quality in dry periods water quality in lowland river systems such as the deben is especially sensitive to changes in flow during dry periods mosley 2015 in this context environmental regulators recognise the fine balance needed between river quality considerations maintaining groundwater resources and supporting agricultural activity defra 2019 consequently much focus is given to the implications of river flow augmentation and inter basin transfers therefore relationships between the suite of ihas and measures of water quality response provide important contextual information of the mechanisms operating in these systems realistic capture of relationships between determinants represents a fundamental measure of the worth of the respective model applications from the interpretation of correlation coefficients based on multi year datasets figs 6 and 7 it is clearly demonstrated that the local model better represents strength of correlations between water quality and hydrological indicators than the basic model this finding is consistent and robust across a range of ihas both for individual short term iha and aggregated annual iha categories as ihas were normalised between the categories it is noteworthy that ihas relating to flow magnitude are more strongly correlated with water temperature at an aggregated level than at an individual level frequency related ihas show higher correlations at the individual level rate of change ihas rarely show high correlation the analysis was performed for fundamental integrated indicators namely water temperature and do whose inter relationships are clearly also better represented by the local model fig 5 however it is also clear there is still considerable mismatch and possibilities for rectifying these problems are explored below 4 3 needs for and prospects for further improving do simulation at sanctuary bridge very low oxygen levels were observed from a continuous monitoring system 10th percentile do values of 2 83 and 1 12 mg l in 2018 and 2019 respectively various possible reasons why both models overestimated these low values which could potentially be rectified within the existing structure were investigated 1 much lower levels of do in groundwater than suggested by shand et al 2007 2 accelerated benthic algal and macrophyte growth throughout reaches which could reconcile the srp overestimation and through undesirable eutrophic consequences deplete the do 3 slower flowing deeper river channel by making appropriate model adjustments the first two were shown to have no discernible effect whereas the third only reduced mismatch if waters were implausibly slow flowing and deep 5m other potentially plausible explanations exist but their exploration extends beyond the specific issues at sanctuary bridge and also beyond the overall scope of the questor model they thereby also cover wider considerations beyond the case study and highlight both shortcomings and opportunities for further improving water quality models sluice controlled damming of rivers can result in flow stagnation and periods of low do in specific locations localised abundant submergent vegetation can contribute to reduction in flow velocity and a supply of bod towards the end of the growing season reaches with elevated macrophyte biomass may show higher gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration er than elsewhere alnoee et al 2021 in the deben however although sanctuary bridge do data implies high er there is no evidence of elevated gpp assumptions underpinning simple 1 d model structures may lead to difficulty representing the hydraulic conditions to which water quality is very sensitive allowance should be made that rather than reflecting the main channel measurements may represent dead zones of markedly reduced flow conveyance such areas of limited main channel mixing are possibly influenced by anoxic bed sediment environments in addition to supply from upstream sewage effluent solids very high levels of benthic respiration may locally arise from abundant overhanging vegetation supplying organic matter in the deben application high levels were nevertheless inferred in the local model and a further increase revealed little additional reduction in simulated do quantifying benthic respiration is highly uncertain due to difficulties in measurement hutchins et al 2020 novel methods incorporating aquatic eddy covariance berg et al 2003 can provide a step change in understanding at a local level but are time consuming and an expensive investment with sufficient access to local knowledge many of these challenges can likely be overcome using 2 d approaches e g knightes et al 2019 alternatively aggregated dead zone models employed to improve simulation of pollutant dispersion e g lees et al 2000 might be adapted to better capture local variability in do 5 conclusions evidence from a modelling study of the river deben uk suggests that although a process based water quality model questor driven solely by national level data sources can likely simulate nutrient concentrations acceptably in such environments it cannot achieve satisfactory results for do a clear improvement in performance is obtained when specific local knowledge of hydrology and flow routing is included to inform the model application improvements were shown to arise from efforts to identify i dam operations ii dead zones whose significance can be pinpointed from detailed meta data from the monitoring programme and iii macrophyte prevalence the implications of the study are wide ranging in shallow slow flowing rivers in dry lowland areas of flat terrain processes controlling water temperature and do are very sensitive to changes in flow regime during low flow periods in summer the deben is typical of such a river found in south eastern uk and as is often the case the challenges are exacerbated by macrophyte overgrowth in channels and flow regulation unsurprisingly findings from the deben study reveal patchy model performance section 4 1 poorer than that achieved by questor in larger lowland rivers such as the thames pathak et al 2021 and an inability to fully reconcile changes in flow with changes in water quality section 4 2 the findings demonstrate that insufficient contextual information behind water quality observations can still hamper model performance and the observations necessary to support improvements can remain elusive for investigating do response challenges associated with characterising river hydraulics representing benthic environments and quantifying the influence of macrophytes mean that national scale water quality model structures are best used as screening tools greater caution is needed for more detailed simulation which would benefit from the considerations and recommendations outlined in section 4 3 overall detailed local knowledge leads to better water quality simulation and can support model improvements and lead to improved process understanding whilst this provides greater insights and confidence for management decisions the greater information requirements are challenging for conducting national scale assessments frameworks that facilitate screening and increasingly refined modelling proportional to local problems allow more
