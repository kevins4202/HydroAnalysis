12955,recently biochar is receiving increased attention as an alternative filter medium for enhanced stormwater management this study attempted to recycle plants harvested from the upper green infrastructure gi component for reuse in the lower gi component as a filter medium dawn redwood dr and bridal wreath bw were harvested and converted to biochar leaves and branches of each plant species were pyrolyzed at 300 and 500 c and the prepared biochars were characterized and evaluated for their adsorption capacity of pyrene one of the major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in urban stormwater runoff the biochar made from dr leaf at 300 c showed the highest pyrene adsorption efficiency and was well fitted with pseudo second order kinetics and freundlich isotherm the first biochar regeneration cycle demonstrated that both thermal and solvent extraction showed high pyrene adsorption efficiency recovery with values of 98 8 and 98 0 respectively the relationships between surface properties and adsorption capacities of biochar for pahs and heavy metals the two major toxic stormwater pollutants were further investigated using data pooled from the existing studies the literature data analysis showed that biochars produced at a lower pyrolysis temperature 300 c can efficiently remove pahs and heavy metals due to higher hydrophobic interactions and higher cationic exchange capacity respectively this study suggests the potential feasibility of closed loop recycling of gi plants for sustainable stormwater treatment and carbon sequestration graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar green infrastructure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons stormwater runoff heavy metals 1 introduction environmental risks have increased as a result of expanding urbanization leading to water quality deterioration aquatic habitat degradation and increased flood risk 1 particularly urban stormwater pollution has been considered one of the major contributors to water quality deterioration 2 urban stormwater contains various non point source pollutants that have additive and synergistic effects on the water quality of receiving water bodies particulate matter nutrients microbial pathogens heavy metals e g pb zn cu and cd and inorganic and persistent organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are among the pollutants present in urban stormwater 3 6 among the pollutants found in urban stormwater the influx of pahs and heavy metals into aquatic habitats has been a rising concern regarding human health and environmental toxicity 7 prolonged human exposure to pahs may result in liver and skin tumors 8 lung cancer 9 cardiovascular illness and reproductive system issues 10 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has developed restrictions for congesting pyrene by eating drinking or inhaling no 0 03 mg of pyrene per kilogram of body weight 7 pahs are a wide class of chemical compounds consisting of two or more fused aromatic carbon rings and are generated by incomplete combustion of organic matter such as fossil fuels wood coal and petroleum products 1 11 several studies have observed a positive correlation between traffic activities and increased pah levels in urban stormwater such as in parking lots and highways 6 12 14 previous observations on urban stormwater runoff indicated a high contribution of 3 4 ring pahs originating from incomplete combustion of fuels 15 where pyrene in particular has been recognized as the most dominant pah congener 5 6 14 16 17 heavy metals have long been recognized as the major toxic pollutants found in urban stormwater runoff and are greatly associated with pavement degradation tire wear and auto parts 18 19 the acute and chronic ecotoxicological effects of heavy metals from urban activities have been widely reported in many previous studies 20 21 to mitigate urban stormwater pollution green infrastructure gi is increasingly introduced for integrated urban stormwater management gi is a nature based technology that mimics natural infiltration and evapotranspiration processes thereby protecting water quality and reducing flood risk the types of gi vary widely depending on site specific conditions and system goals and popularly used gi technologies include bio retention ponds rain gardens vegetated rooftops rain barrels tree box filters pervious pavement filter strips vegetative swales and infiltration trenches 22 despite the different gi types most gi facilities consist of two components underground filter media lower component and above ground vegetation upper component the lower and upper components of a gi promote groundwater recharge and carbon sequestration respectively 23 inorganic materials such as sand zeolite and gravel are conventionally used in the lower component of a gi to permeate water and remove contaminants compost peat woodchip and mulch are examples of organic filter media incorporated in a gi that supports vegetation and are frequently used in a biological gi 1 24 because a conventional gi is typically designed as an engineered sand based filtration system to effectively reduce surface runoff and remove particulate matter it greatly suffers from low removal efficiency of dissolved forms of pollutants 3 25 26 as an alternative to the conventional filter media in gi facilities biochar is receiving increased attention to enhance pollutant removal biochar is produced by pyrolysis which is a thermal decomposition process of biomass under oxygen deficient conditions the removal of volatiles by pyrolysis creates a carbon dense and highly porous structure providing better sorption properties to biochar than regular peat and compost which are typically used in biological gis for the removal of dissolved contaminants 1 biochar has accumulated a substantial amount of literature on environmental management because of its low cost recyclable feedstock carbon sequestration capacity soil remediation and properties that allow excellent adsorption of heavy metals and dissolved organic pollutants from wastewater 27 29 biochar has a high potential to be sustainably used in a gi facility that can resolve the insufficient remediation of stormwater in the current systems 30 while a large volume of literature on biochar as a heavy metal adsorbent exists there are few studies focusing on organic contaminant removal using biochar previous research shows that biochar made from wheat straw 31 32 aspen wood fibers 33 enteromorpha prolifera algae 34 and sterculia foetida tree 35 are effective for adsorbing pah species such as acenaphthene fluoranthene naphthalene benzo a pyrene pyrene and phenanthrene however only a few studies have investigated the removal of pyrene in an aqueous solution using biochar biochar made from pine sawdust 36 sewage sludge 37 enteromorpha prolifera algae 38 and corn stover residues 39 as feedstocks this study included an experimental work and a literature data analysis aiming to assess the potential performance of biochar made from gi plants in removing two major toxic pollutants in urban stormwater pahs and heavy metals the experimental work as the main part of this study dedicated to characterizing the gi plant derived biochar and its adsorption performance of pyrene a representative pah congener in urban stormwater runoff the plants selected for the experimental study were dawn redwood spiraea prunifolia var simpliciflora dr planted in a rain garden and bridal wreath metasequoia glyptostroboides bw planted in a tree box filter ideally the use of the biochars derived from these gi plants may allow for closed loop recycling of a gi system as the plant harvested from the upper component of the gi is recycled back to its bottom component we investigated the best production conditions for the biochar derived from gi plants focusing on pyrolysis temperature and plant types in the literature data analysis the overall performance of biochar in removing stormwater pollutants was assessed using biochar performance data pooled from existing literature focusing on the correlation between pyrolysis temperature biochar physical properties and adsorption capacities for pahs acenaphthene phenanthrene pyrene and naphthalene and heavy metals ni cd and pb 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation dr and bw planted in a rain garden and a tree box filter respectively were harvested and used as raw feedstocks to produce biochar the raw feedstocks were separated into leaves and branches and broken into pieces measuring approximately 1 1 cm the four types of prepared biomass dawn redwood leaf drl dawn redwood branch drb bridal wreath leaf bwl and bridal wreath branch bwb were dried in an air forced oven at 105 c for 18 h a standard tube furnace lindberg blue m tf55030a 1 thermo scientific usa with a custom made tube 2 5 cm diameter 60 cm length was used for biochar pyrolysis to maintain oxygen deficient conditions during pyrolysis the tube was flushed with n2 gas at a rate of 100 ml min 1 for 30 min approximately 1 g of each plant sample was loaded into a 100 mm 15 mm quartz crucible and placed at the center of the tube the tube furnace containing the plant sample was then heated from room temperature approximately 22 c to the target pyrolysis temperature tp at a rate of 20 c min 1 the achieved pyrolysis temperature was maintained for 2 h in this study two pyrolysis temperatures 300 c and 500 c were used for comparison the samples after pyrolysis were pulverized with a mortar and then sieved to obtain a particle size of 200 μm each biochar produced was designated as plant species plant part and pyrolysis temperature for example drl300 stands for dawn redwood leaf at 300 c pyrolysis temperature 2 2 biochar characterization the yields y of biochars prepared at 300 c bc300s and 500 c bc500s were calculated by the difference between the biomass weight before and after pyrolysis the ph of the developed biochar was measured 24 h after preparing a 1 10 w v biochar deionized water suspension using a digital ph meter st300 ohaus usa the yield and ph of each biochar were measured in triplicate and the average values were obtained to determine the zeta potential of the biochars a 5 mg sample was suspended in 20 ml of deionized water and measured using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk analyzer the surface physical morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope eds sem hitachi s 3000 n hitachi instruments japan the specific surface area of the biochar was determined by branauer emmet teller bet through n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and barret joyner halenda bjh surface analysis using a bet analyzer micromeritics usa micropores 20 å were characterized by the bet surface area sbet and the t plot micropore surface area smicro moreover meso micropores 1 3000 å were characterized by bjh surface area sbjh pore volume vbjh and pore diameter size dbjh functional groups were examined using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in a scanning range of 500 to 4000 cm 1 nicolet 6700 thermo scientific usa 2 3 adsorption experiments for pyrene batch adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the equilibrium adsorption kinetics and isotherms of pyrene on the biochars the pyrene stock solutions 1000 μg ml 1 were prepared in acetonitrile and then diluted with deionized water to prepare solutions with required pyrene concentrations the flask containing 30 ml pyrene solution with 15 mg of biochar were shaken at 25 0 5 c and ph 7 in a horizontal motion water bath shaker swb25 series chosun south korea with a mixing speed of 150 m 1 the pyrene adsorption experiments were conducted for 2 to 6 h of agitation time after equilibration the aqueous and solid phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 min 1 for 2 min adsorption kinetics were examined using an initial pyrene concentration of 1 μg ml 1 and 15 mg of biochar with varying time intervals of measurement 0 25 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 12 h data for isotherms were obtained at a fixed amount of biochar 15 mg with a varying pyrene concentration range of 0 25 10 0 μg ml 1 this concentration range was based on the level of pahs in urban stormwater runoff 5 the required equilibrium times were obtained from the kinetic experiments and were 2 h and 6 h for bc300s and bc500s respectively all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods for pyrene after centrifugation pyrene was extracted from the aliquot solution using envi 18 dsk spe disk 47 mm sigma aldrich steinheim germany according to the us epa 3535a solid phase extraction spe method 39 chromatographic measurements were performed using agilent 6890 n gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid the analytical column used during chromatography was hp 5 30 m 5 phenyl 95 dimethylpolysiloxane agilent j w gc columns santa clara ca usa helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 108 ml min 1 the column inlet was set to the splitless injection mode at 250 c with an injection volume of 1 μl the method detection limit mdl 0 0774 μg ml 1 was determined from the calibration plot using the 3 3σ method and considering sample extraction experimentation and instrument factors 40 2 5 adsorption models the pyrene concentration q e mg g 1

volume of aqueous solution l m is the biochar mass g c 0 is the initial pyrene concentration in aqueous solution mg l 1 and c e is the pyrene concentration at equilibrium in an aqueous solution mg l 1 adsorption kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo first order equation eq 3 41 and the pseudo second order equation eq 4 42 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t and q e mg

adsorption capacity n f represents the adsorption favorability 44 the dubinin radushkevich isotherm is based on the assumption that the adsorption mechanism is greatly correlated with the physical porous structure of the adsorbent 45 2 6 biochar regeneration after prolonged operation under field conditions the performance of the biochar filter media in the gi deteriorates requiring maintenance such as media regeneration to achieve the desired effluent quality to evaluate the adsorption stability and regeneration effectiveness of biochar produced from gi plants two cycles of serial saturation regeneration experiments were conducted previous studies have used various methods to regenerate biochar including thermal regeneration inorganic or organic solvent extraction regeneration and microwave irradiation regeneration 34 46 47 among others thermal regeneration is considered one of the most cost effective methods because of its low temperature requirement i e 100 300 c 47 48 in this study two different methods were compared in their regeneration efficiencies 1 thermal regeneration at 200 c for 3 h and 2 solvent regeneration using 10 ml of acetonitrile solution in a water bath shaker for 30 min thermal regeneration at 200 c was used since it has been proven that increasing the regeneration temperature results in higher regeneration efficiency but it should not exceed the initial pyrolysis temperature due to excess weight loss 34 based on the literature the application of diluted acids and salts as a solvent may not always allow for the complete recovery of pollutants and subsequent regeneration of biochar 49 in this study solvent regeneration was performed using acetonitrile as a medium polarity solvent that is miscible with water and organic compounds to compare its performance with that of thermal regeneration after equilibration of the aqueous solution of spent biochar and acetonitrile solvent biochar was retrieved by centrifuging and filtering the solution using a 0 47 μm membrane filter the same procedure performed with the initial adsorption experiment was used for the following saturation regeneration cycle for consistency the regeneration methods were evaluated in terms of regeneration efficiency from two saturation regeneration cycles regeneration efficiency η n is the term used to determine the reusability of adsorbents as follows 34 8 η n q n q o 100 where q n is the adsorption capacity of pyrene on the regenerated biochar mg g 1 q o is the adsorption capacity of pyrene on the fresh biochar mg g 1 and n is the number of regenerations 2 7 retrieval of literature data on biochar properties and adsorption for pahs and heavy metals the general relationship of the physical properties of biochar with pyrolysis temperature was investigated using data retrieved from the literature pyrolysis temperature and heating time as well as particle pore size are all important parameters influencing the structure and physical properties of biochar which have an impact on the adsorption mechanism such as the pore filling mechanism of heavy metals 50 the physical properties of biochar investigated in this study were the specific surface area pore volume micropore volume mesopore volume and pore diameter data were also collected on the adsorption capacity of pahs and heavy metals on the biochars we obtained a total of 40 reviewed articles published between 2004 and 2021 the reference list is provided in supplementary materials the detailed 145 data sets for biochar properties are provided in the supplementary materials table s1 several feedstocks including crop residues wood biomass animal litter and solid wastes have been used to produce biochar by slow to intermediate pyrolysis processes the pyrolysis temperature in these studies varied from 100 to 700 c with heating rates ranging from 7 to 65 c min 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of biochar table 1 shows the biochar yield and physicochemical properties of the gi plant derived biochars including ph zeta potential surface areas and pore size characteristics generally biochars produced at tp 500 c bc500s had low yields ranging from 28 57 to 37 49 as compared to those produced at tp 300 c bc300s ranging from 36 20 to 48 43 the strong inverse correlation between pyrolysis temperature and biochar yield has also been reported in previous studies 51 55 the higher loss of moisture volatile matter and non condensable gases co2 co ch4 and h2 from the feedstock at a higher pyrolysis temperature contributed to a lower biochar yield 53 when different plant species were compared dr generally resulted in higher yields than bw with a smaller difference at a higher pyrolysis temperature the yields at tp 300 c averaged across the two plant parts were 45 8 and 39 8 for dr and bw respectively while those at tp 500 c were 31 7 and 29 5 for dr and bw respectively for both plant species branches consistently resulted in lower yields than leaves at tp 300 c the yield of the branch derived biochar ranged from 36 2 to 41 9 while that of the leaf derived biochar ranged from 43 5 to 48 4 at tp 500 c the yield of the branch derived biochar ranged from 28 6 to 28 7 while that of the leaf derived biochar ranged from 29 2 to 37 5 the lower yield of the branch derived biochar is probably due to the higher lignin and cellulose decomposition of the branch as it contains a high lignin content compared to leaves 56 the ph values were always higher in bc500s 8 78 9 32 than in bc300s 7 29 8 56 which may be attributed to the fact that alkali salts are better separated from the organic components in the feedstock at a higher pyrolysis temperature 53 57 furthermore a higher pyrolysis temperature produces a greater amount of ash components resulting in a higher biochar ph 53 bw generally resulted in a higher ph than dr for both plant species the leaf derived biochars had higher ph values than the branch derived biochars the zeta potential measured in an organic medium can be roughly equated to the surface potential 58 the zeta potentials of the biochar samples were all negative and the values generally decreased with increasing ph for the dr and bw biochars which agrees with existing studies 59 60 the ph and zeta potential of biochar influence the adsorption process by altering the surface charge of biochar which can affect the electrostatic interaction of the adsorption process however for organic adsorption of pahs hydrophobic interaction dominates as the primary force of interaction rather than electrostatic interaction 34 35 61 compared to bc300s bc500s resulted in high sbet values specifically for drb500 and bwb500 with surface areas of 214 3 and 178 9 m2g 1 respectively sbjh values were also high in drb500 and bwb500 compared to the other biochars with smicro values of 202 8 and 170 2 m2g 1 respectively the dbjh value of the biochars ranged from 11 81 to 28 6 nm which further demonstrates that the mesopores rather than the micropores of the biochar accounted for the majority a larger pore surface area is beneficial if the main mechanism of adsorption is a pore filling mechanism 62 however this is not always the case for adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants using in particular organic adsorbents because the chemical interaction between the biochar and adsorbate surfaces may be greater than the physical pore filling the surface morphology of both plant species was cylindrical with a porous and rough surface as shown in the sem images fig s1 of the supplementary materials although there were little prominent differences in structural morphologies between biochars made from different plant species and plant parts bc500s had a more roughly clustered surface and fragmented pores than bc300s in addition the fissures and splintering of the biochar surface were found to be prominent in bc500s compared to bc300s the biochar s tubular surface structure deforms as the pyrolysis temperature increases and it may event collapse resulting in micropore blockage 63 the dr biochar had sharper and thinner wall structure of the pores than the bw biochar reflecting the distinct original cell structures of these two different plant species the ftir spectra of the eight biochars are shown in fig 1 the peak assignments in the spectra represent hydroxyl oh stretching compounds 3370 cm 1 methylene ch2 stretching 2927 cm 1 aromatic c c c and carbonyl group c o 1615 cm 1 and out of plane bending of aromatic ch 875 cm 1 the spectra of the biochars at two different pyrolysis temperatures reflected a significant difference in the 1315 1615 cm 1 bands strong peaks in the band intensities at 1615 cm 1 aromatic c c c and co and 2927 cm 1 ch2 were identified in bc300s conversely a low medium peak was observed in bc500s for functional groups of aromatic c c c and co resulting from the higher degradation of the biomass lignin at the higher pyrolysis temperature 64 65 according to previous literature the co band tends to diminish as the pyrolysis temperature increases due to the loss of acidic and basic groups in biochar 66 the peaks for the weak stretching vibrations of hydroxyl oh groups at 3370 cm 1 decreased slightly for bc500s than for bc300s due to moisture loss 67 the peaks of the stretching vibration of aliphatic methylene groups ch2 at 2927 cm 1 were weak in bc500s due to the higher decomposition of cellulose at higher pyrolysis temperature the aromatic cores formed by the lignin fractions are removed to a greater extent at bc500s due to thermal degradation of cellulose ester co aliphatic alkyl and c c c and oh groups however there was little difference in the overall shape of the spectra among the plant species and parts 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherm for pyrene fig 2 shows the concentration of pyrene adsorbed on biochar and in water with respect to contact time for different biochars and pyrolysis temperatures for bc300s the adsorbed pyrene concentration rapidly increased at the beginning of adsorption with a removal efficiency from the liquid phase 50 during the first 15 min the rapid adsorption rate in the initial adsorption stage is due to the excessive amount of active sites on the surface of biochars the pyrene adsorption equilibrium was achieved after approximately 1 h of the reaction for all bc300s the highest pyrene adsorption capacity after 4 h was of drl300 with 1909 81 μg g 1 for bc500s drl500 showed the highest pyrene adsorption capacity 1765 μg g 1 and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved after 6 h of contact time these results imply that the higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a lower pyrene adsorption capacity with a longer time required for equilibrium several studies also reported that pah adsorption favors low pyrolysis temperature for organic adsorption 34 68 for example qiao et al 35 reported a lower adsorption efficiency of pahs on biochars at 600 c than at 500 c and 400 c with a suggested reason of lower essential functional groups on the biochar surface such as cc and co at higher pyrolysis temperature the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fitted to the experimental data are shown in table 2 the pseudo second order model fitted the data better for both bc300s and bc500s r2 0 9777 0 99998 than the pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 8942 0 9686 the better representation of the adsorption kinetics by the pseudo second order model indicates a predominance of hydrophobic interactions for pyrene adsorption 34 among the three nonlinear isotherm models langmuir freundlich and dubinin rabdushkevich the freundlich isotherm model best fitted the adsorption data of pyrene for both bc300s r2 0 9572 0 9886 and bc500s r2 0 9653 0 9875 fig s2 and table s2 the best fit of the experimental adsorption data with the freundlich model has also been reported by other researchers who tested pyrene in biochars made from wood char pine sawdust corn stover and sewage sludge 36 38 69 3 3 adsorption mechanism and removal efficiency for pyrene the fitted freundlich parameters and re were compared between the different biochars in table 3 the leaf derived biochars at tp 300 c had higher re 79 28 and 76 15 for drl300 and bwl300 respectively than those at tp 500 c 72 38 and 73 06 for drl500 and bwl500 respectively an opposite relationship between tp and re was found for the branch derived biochars where the re value was higher for bc500s than for bc300s the significantly larger surface areas of the branch derived biochars at tp 500 c than those of the other biochars may be the reason of the higher re comparing the leaf and branch parts for a given plant species higher re values were obtained for all the leaf derived biochars than for the branch derived biochars for a given plant part and pyrolysis temperature no significant trend in re was found between the two plant species when averaged over the two plant parts the re of the different plant species dr compared to bw were lower by 1 and higher by 1 8 at tp 300 c and tp 500 c respectively properties influencing the adsorption efficiency of organic contaminants on biochar include specific surface area sbet porosity pore diameter dbjh and pore volume vbjh and surface chemistry such as polarity and presence of functional groups 37 70 the kf and re values shown in table 3 were higher in the biochars produced at a lower tp bc300s than the biochars produced at a higher tp bc500s similar observations were reported in previous studies on the adsorption of phenanthrene and pyrene using biochars derived from sewage sludge 37 and enteromorpha prolifera algae 34 according to previous studies the primary mechanism and representative isotherm for the adsorption of pahs on biochar vary depending on the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature 34 for organic organic adsorption processes it has been described in previous studies that physical adsorption and chemisorption mechanisms are present in adsorption 71 pyrene adsorption e g re was found to have little correlation with the surface characteristics of biochar such as sbet smicro sbjh dbjh vbjh ph and zeta potential table 1 the absence of association with specific surface area sbet sbjh pore diameter dbjh and pore volume vbjh reveals that pyrene molecules do not have complete access to the micropore and mesopore interior because pyrene molecules are larger in size compared to the micro and mesoporous sites of biochar 37 71 the result of this experiment suggests that the key mechanism of pyrene adsorption is not pore filling interaction at a pyrolysis temperature below 400 c the feedstock was partly carbonized and the non carbonized group remained providing sites for surface interaction between the biochar and organic compounds 71 in this study the higher biochar yield at 300 c by 30 than at 500 c suggests a lower degree of carbonization resulting in a low surface area less than 30 m2 g 1 71 72 further removal of aromatic cores from the feedstock at high pyrolysis temperatures can enlarge the surface area and pore volume which is beneficial for pore filling adsorption of inorganic adsorbates such as heavy metals 71 organic pollutants with a planar molecular structure such as pahs were found to have stronger chemisorption on soot like biochar materials due to the planarity effect which refers to the overlapping π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction between the planar aromatic sorbate and the sorbent surface 73 the mechanisms responsible for the interaction of pahs with biochar include 1 hydrophobic interaction 2 eda interaction 3 and physical adsorption through pore filling 70 it was suggested that the aromatic groups in biochar favor hydrophobic and π π interactions with organic compounds 37 70 as shown in fig 1 the ftir spectra of bc300s presented a greater amount of aromatic co and cc bands absorbance at 1615 cm 1 aromatic aliphatic and phenolic groups were found to be the most common functional groups within the gi plant derived biochars in this study according to the ftir analysis the pyrolysis temperature had a substantial impact on the density of functional groups a higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a higher degree of i dehydration of cellulosic and ligneous components 3500 cm 1 to 2500 cm 1 and ii decrease of homocyclic and aromatic co and cc bonds of ketones and quinones when lignin and cellulose transformation products were produced 1500 cm 1 to 1250 cm 1 increasing the pyrolysis temperature can increase the degree of condensation of aromatic organic carbon compounds that can decrease the π π stacking interaction with the planar pollutant such as pahs 77 the greater pyrene removal by bc300s than bc500s can be explained by the greater degree of π π interactions between the aromatic groups of the biochars and pyrene in this study drl300 resulted in the highest kf and re values among the tested feedstock materials compared to other reported biochars table s3 the gi plant derived biochars were quite competitive in terms of equilibrium adsorption capacity and equilibrium time 3 4 biochar reusability adsorbent reusability was evaluated from two regeneration cycles in triplicate thermal regeneration resulted in a slightly higher regeneration efficiency η n after the first regeneration cycle with a value of η 1 98 81 than the solvent extraction of η 1 98 0 figs s4 and s5 however after the second regeneration the efficiencies of both thermal and solvent methods dropped significantly to η 2 56 and η 2 60 3 respectively notably the regeneration efficiency decreased with consecutive reuses of the biochars the pyrene removal efficiency of the gi plant derived biochar decreased as the number of regenerations increased due to weight losses during the regeneration process and accompanied by the loss of aromatic groups in the biochar repeated thermal treatment could reduce not only the total mass of the biochar but also the hydrophobic binding sites for pahs as revealed by the lower pyrene removal efficiency using the thermally pretreated biochar it is also important to account for the biochar weight loss after the regeneration cycle as it influences the adsorption capacity specifically for large scale applications after the second regeneration cycle the weight loss of biochar was approximately 37 and 23 for thermal and solvent regeneration respectively fig s5 repeated high temperature treatment damages the structure and leads to a loss of biochar and its adsorption properties decreasing its efficiency 34 nevertheless green infrastructure or industrial application of the material without regeneration may be sufficient because the feedstock for biochar production can be continuously supplied without additional cost from the routine maintenance of the gi plants 3 5 literature data analysis biochar properties and adsorption characteristics for pahs and heavy metals fig 3 shows the boxplots and individual data points of the pyrolysis temperatures and physical properties of biochars collected from the literature table s1 the adsorbent s physical properties such as specific surface area and pore size distribution are important factors in the adsorption process 60 generally the higher the pyrolysis temperature the greater the surface area and pore volume of biochar in the pyrolysis temperature range from 100 to 600 c the greater surface area from the higher pyrolysis temperature is greatly related to the destruction of aliphatic alkyl and ester groups on the biochar surface however a decrease in surface area was found at a pyrolysis temperature greater than or equal to 700 c conversely pore diameter generally decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature when aliphatic and volatile components are removed during pyrolysis the number of micropores increases as does the pore volume and surface area this is mostly due to the formation of amorphous carbon structures which are responsible for the higher micropore volume and smaller pore diameter 54 the general adsorption characteristics of pahs and heavy metals on biochar were examined with respect to their physicochemical properties based on the experimental data reported in existing studies from a total of 84 independent cases of pahs adsorption experiments in the literature the freundlich isotherm was reported as the best model to describe the adsorption for most cases 74 cases the hydrophobic interaction between the biochar surface and pahs probably allows multilayered adsorption exhibiting the freundlich adsorption the data fig 4 show that the overall adsorption isotherm coefficient log kf decreases as the specific surface area sbet increases implying that the key adsorption mechanisms are hydrophobic interaction and partitioning at uncarbonized sites rather than pore filling this observation is consistent with the results of this study therefore biochars produced at low pyrolysis temperature could remove pahs better due to less carbonization resulting in a larger number of sites on the biochar available for pah adsorption for heavy metal adsorption of biochar a total of 411 cases independent of the adsorption experiment were identified from the literature and all these cases were reported to be best described by the langmuir isotherm fig 5a and b show the correlations of qm with sbet and cation exchange capacity cec respectively at ph 7 and a temperature ranging from 20 to 25 c plotted using the 24 data sets available in the literature in fig 5 langmuir adsorption capacity qm does not show a clear monotonic trend with respect to sbet although some large qm values are present at the lower sbet range while it has a measurable positive correlation with cec this indicates that the dominant adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on biochar is ion exchange and thus cec is a more critical factor in determining heavy metal adsorption than specific surface area low pyrolysis temperature e g 300 c leads to high cation exchange capacity which is beneficial for the removal of cationic pollutants such as heavy metals 30 75 however based on other literature high pyrolysis temperature e g 500 c also results in high adsorption of heavy metals due to the increased surface area of biochar 76 77 this contradiction is also found for organic pollutants where the hydrophobic interaction of biochar tends to increase as the pyrolysis temperature increases but is greatly influenced by the surface functional groups derived depending on the used feedstock resulting in an uneven trend of results 28 37 71 however according to our literature data analysis it can be concluded that low pyrolysis is a better condition for biochar production to better remove pahs without significantly compromising heavy metal removal resulting from low specific surface area 3 6 implications for practical application although there is no single solution suitable for mitigating stormwater runoff the choice of a stormwater control system with different types of green infrastructure infiltration techniques is critical high pollutant loads or fluxes must be managed to improve the quality of receiving waters and reduce flood risks for this purpose biochar can provide a greater efficiency than conventional gi filter media e g sand and gravel because of its higher sorption capabilities for various organic and inorganic compounds present in urban stormwater runoff this study contributes to the environmental community by proposing gi plant derived biochar as a potential filter media in green infrastructures focusing on pyrene adsorption as a representative pah found in stormwater runoff additionally our review and literature data suggest that low pyrolysis temperature 300 c could be the most suitable biochar production condition to effectively remove pahs and heavy metals present in urban stormwater runoff plant residues collected as biochar can adsorb pahs in an aqueous solution and can replace conventional filters installed in gi facilities to further improve the removal of dissolved pollutants the findings of this study can serve as a guide for selecting the optimal biochar characteristics or preparation method considering the target pollutants to control as important design parameters the equilibrium concentration of pyrene per gram of biochar in the aqueous and solid phases and the adsorption kinetics provided in this study may aid in further developing the design criteria for a biochar based gi filter media mitigation of different pah species and other chemicals using biochar derived from site specific gi plant species is generally still unclear thus more laboratory and in situ green infrastructure application studies are needed as the use of biochar in gi facilities increases it is critical to select the appropriate tailored filter media for stormwater management applications of biochar as filter media in stormwater treatment were reported in several studies in recent years 26 30 78 79 majority of the existing studies were on the assessment of biochar based on batch scale adsorption experimentation and a handful number of existing studies used continuous column experiments showing the superiority of biochar over sand in removing heavy metals cd cu pb and zn 80 it is suggested that future research should be directed toward determining the most efficient engineered filter media and sizing methods by on site experimentation and access to overall capabilities in terms of pollutant removal efficiency implementation cost and its reusability or service life furthermore environmental safety in using biochar as a gi filter media also needs to be explored in the future because fine particles of biochar containing high pah concentration can be transported through the porous soil polluting water bodies although many plant derived biochars contain relatively low level of pahs compared to urban soils 24 some biochars such as rice husk biochar have been reported to contain relatively high pah concentrations potentially becoming a source of pahs upon soil application 81 despite the growing concern regarding pah concentrations in biochar 81 the pahs concentration in stormwater runoff in high traffic regions 14 16 17 26 is incomparably high compared to biochar 81 82 additionally applying large gained biochar may help prevent the loss of biochar particles from a gi facility the biochar production conditions can be determined depending on the target chemicals of most concern or by trading off the removal efficiencies of inorganic and organic pollutants as they have different adsorption mechanisms 83 potentially requiring different optimal production conditions moreover multilayered media with biochars produced using different conditions can be applied to satisfy the required removal of different pollutants 4 conclusions this study provides a cost effective way of enhancing stormwater treatment by using gi harvested plants as biochar for adsorption of organics and potentially heavy metals which can resolve the insufficient remediation of current stormwater management facilities for effective pyrene adsorption biochar can be created from a variety of gi plant species hardwood and softwood and plant parts leaves and branches biochars produced at low pyrolysis temperatures were effective in removing pahs and heavy metals in urban stormwater runoff this preliminary study revealed the high potential of closed loop recycling within gi as it requires less regeneration and ensures a steady supply from gi maintenance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12955,recently biochar is receiving increased attention as an alternative filter medium for enhanced stormwater management this study attempted to recycle plants harvested from the upper green infrastructure gi component for reuse in the lower gi component as a filter medium dawn redwood dr and bridal wreath bw were harvested and converted to biochar leaves and branches of each plant species were pyrolyzed at 300 and 500 c and the prepared biochars were characterized and evaluated for their adsorption capacity of pyrene one of the major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in urban stormwater runoff the biochar made from dr leaf at 300 c showed the highest pyrene adsorption efficiency and was well fitted with pseudo second order kinetics and freundlich isotherm the first biochar regeneration cycle demonstrated that both thermal and solvent extraction showed high pyrene adsorption efficiency recovery with values of 98 8 and 98 0 respectively the relationships between surface properties and adsorption capacities of biochar for pahs and heavy metals the two major toxic stormwater pollutants were further investigated using data pooled from the existing studies the literature data analysis showed that biochars produced at a lower pyrolysis temperature 300 c can efficiently remove pahs and heavy metals due to higher hydrophobic interactions and higher cationic exchange capacity respectively this study suggests the potential feasibility of closed loop recycling of gi plants for sustainable stormwater treatment and carbon sequestration graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biochar green infrastructure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons stormwater runoff heavy metals 1 introduction environmental risks have increased as a result of expanding urbanization leading to water quality deterioration aquatic habitat degradation and increased flood risk 1 particularly urban stormwater pollution has been considered one of the major contributors to water quality deterioration 2 urban stormwater contains various non point source pollutants that have additive and synergistic effects on the water quality of receiving water bodies particulate matter nutrients microbial pathogens heavy metals e g pb zn cu and cd and inorganic and persistent organic chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are among the pollutants present in urban stormwater 3 6 among the pollutants found in urban stormwater the influx of pahs and heavy metals into aquatic habitats has been a rising concern regarding human health and environmental toxicity 7 prolonged human exposure to pahs may result in liver and skin tumors 8 lung cancer 9 cardiovascular illness and reproductive system issues 10 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has developed restrictions for congesting pyrene by eating drinking or inhaling no 0 03 mg of pyrene per kilogram of body weight 7 pahs are a wide class of chemical compounds consisting of two or more fused aromatic carbon rings and are generated by incomplete combustion of organic matter such as fossil fuels wood coal and petroleum products 1 11 several studies have observed a positive correlation between traffic activities and increased pah levels in urban stormwater such as in parking lots and highways 6 12 14 previous observations on urban stormwater runoff indicated a high contribution of 3 4 ring pahs originating from incomplete combustion of fuels 15 where pyrene in particular has been recognized as the most dominant pah congener 5 6 14 16 17 heavy metals have long been recognized as the major toxic pollutants found in urban stormwater runoff and are greatly associated with pavement degradation tire wear and auto parts 18 19 the acute and chronic ecotoxicological effects of heavy metals from urban activities have been widely reported in many previous studies 20 21 to mitigate urban stormwater pollution green infrastructure gi is increasingly introduced for integrated urban stormwater management gi is a nature based technology that mimics natural infiltration and evapotranspiration processes thereby protecting water quality and reducing flood risk the types of gi vary widely depending on site specific conditions and system goals and popularly used gi technologies include bio retention ponds rain gardens vegetated rooftops rain barrels tree box filters pervious pavement filter strips vegetative swales and infiltration trenches 22 despite the different gi types most gi facilities consist of two components underground filter media lower component and above ground vegetation upper component the lower and upper components of a gi promote groundwater recharge and carbon sequestration respectively 23 inorganic materials such as sand zeolite and gravel are conventionally used in the lower component of a gi to permeate water and remove contaminants compost peat woodchip and mulch are examples of organic filter media incorporated in a gi that supports vegetation and are frequently used in a biological gi 1 24 because a conventional gi is typically designed as an engineered sand based filtration system to effectively reduce surface runoff and remove particulate matter it greatly suffers from low removal efficiency of dissolved forms of pollutants 3 25 26 as an alternative to the conventional filter media in gi facilities biochar is receiving increased attention to enhance pollutant removal biochar is produced by pyrolysis which is a thermal decomposition process of biomass under oxygen deficient conditions the removal of volatiles by pyrolysis creates a carbon dense and highly porous structure providing better sorption properties to biochar than regular peat and compost which are typically used in biological gis for the removal of dissolved contaminants 1 biochar has accumulated a substantial amount of literature on environmental management because of its low cost recyclable feedstock carbon sequestration capacity soil remediation and properties that allow excellent adsorption of heavy metals and dissolved organic pollutants from wastewater 27 29 biochar has a high potential to be sustainably used in a gi facility that can resolve the insufficient remediation of stormwater in the current systems 30 while a large volume of literature on biochar as a heavy metal adsorbent exists there are few studies focusing on organic contaminant removal using biochar previous research shows that biochar made from wheat straw 31 32 aspen wood fibers 33 enteromorpha prolifera algae 34 and sterculia foetida tree 35 are effective for adsorbing pah species such as acenaphthene fluoranthene naphthalene benzo a pyrene pyrene and phenanthrene however only a few studies have investigated the removal of pyrene in an aqueous solution using biochar biochar made from pine sawdust 36 sewage sludge 37 enteromorpha prolifera algae 38 and corn stover residues 39 as feedstocks this study included an experimental work and a literature data analysis aiming to assess the potential performance of biochar made from gi plants in removing two major toxic pollutants in urban stormwater pahs and heavy metals the experimental work as the main part of this study dedicated to characterizing the gi plant derived biochar and its adsorption performance of pyrene a representative pah congener in urban stormwater runoff the plants selected for the experimental study were dawn redwood spiraea prunifolia var simpliciflora dr planted in a rain garden and bridal wreath metasequoia glyptostroboides bw planted in a tree box filter ideally the use of the biochars derived from these gi plants may allow for closed loop recycling of a gi system as the plant harvested from the upper component of the gi is recycled back to its bottom component we investigated the best production conditions for the biochar derived from gi plants focusing on pyrolysis temperature and plant types in the literature data analysis the overall performance of biochar in removing stormwater pollutants was assessed using biochar performance data pooled from existing literature focusing on the correlation between pyrolysis temperature biochar physical properties and adsorption capacities for pahs acenaphthene phenanthrene pyrene and naphthalene and heavy metals ni cd and pb 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation dr and bw planted in a rain garden and a tree box filter respectively were harvested and used as raw feedstocks to produce biochar the raw feedstocks were separated into leaves and branches and broken into pieces measuring approximately 1 1 cm the four types of prepared biomass dawn redwood leaf drl dawn redwood branch drb bridal wreath leaf bwl and bridal wreath branch bwb were dried in an air forced oven at 105 c for 18 h a standard tube furnace lindberg blue m tf55030a 1 thermo scientific usa with a custom made tube 2 5 cm diameter 60 cm length was used for biochar pyrolysis to maintain oxygen deficient conditions during pyrolysis the tube was flushed with n2 gas at a rate of 100 ml min 1 for 30 min approximately 1 g of each plant sample was loaded into a 100 mm 15 mm quartz crucible and placed at the center of the tube the tube furnace containing the plant sample was then heated from room temperature approximately 22 c to the target pyrolysis temperature tp at a rate of 20 c min 1 the achieved pyrolysis temperature was maintained for 2 h in this study two pyrolysis temperatures 300 c and 500 c were used for comparison the samples after pyrolysis were pulverized with a mortar and then sieved to obtain a particle size of 200 μm each biochar produced was designated as plant species plant part and pyrolysis temperature for example drl300 stands for dawn redwood leaf at 300 c pyrolysis temperature 2 2 biochar characterization the yields y of biochars prepared at 300 c bc300s and 500 c bc500s were calculated by the difference between the biomass weight before and after pyrolysis the ph of the developed biochar was measured 24 h after preparing a 1 10 w v biochar deionized water suspension using a digital ph meter st300 ohaus usa the yield and ph of each biochar were measured in triplicate and the average values were obtained to determine the zeta potential of the biochars a 5 mg sample was suspended in 20 ml of deionized water and measured using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk analyzer the surface physical morphology was examined using a scanning electron microscope eds sem hitachi s 3000 n hitachi instruments japan the specific surface area of the biochar

characterized by the bet surface area sbet and the t plot micropore surface area smicro moreover meso micropores 1 3000 å were characterized by bjh surface area sbjh pore volume vbjh and pore diameter

pyrene batch adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the equilibrium adsorption kinetics and isotherms of pyrene on the biochars the pyrene stock solutions 1000 μg ml 1 were prepared in acetonitrile and then diluted with deionized water to prepare solutions with required pyrene concentrations the flask containing 30 ml pyrene solution with 15 mg of biochar were shaken at 25 0 5 c and ph 7 in a horizontal motion water bath shaker swb25 series chosun south korea with a mixing speed of 150 m 1 the pyrene adsorption experiments were conducted for 2 to 6 h of agitation time after equilibration the aqueous and solid phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 min 1 for 2 min adsorption kinetics were examined using an initial pyrene concentration of 1 μg ml 1 and 15 mg of biochar with varying time intervals of measurement 0 25 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 12 h data for isotherms were obtained at a fixed amount of biochar 15 mg with a varying pyrene concentration range of 0 25 10 0 μg ml 1 this concentration range was based on the level of pahs in urban stormwater runoff 5 the required equilibrium times were obtained from the kinetic experiments and were 2 h and 6 h for bc300s and bc500s respectively all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 analytical methods for pyrene after centrifugation pyrene was extracted from the aliquot solution using envi 18 dsk spe disk 47 mm sigma aldrich steinheim germany according to the us epa 3535a solid phase extraction spe method 39 chromatographic measurements were performed using agilent 6890 n gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid the analytical column used during chromatography was hp 5 30 m 5 phenyl 95 dimethylpolysiloxane agilent j w gc columns santa clara ca usa helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 108 ml min 1 the column inlet was set to the splitless injection mode at 250 c with an injection volume of 1 μl the method detection limit mdl 0 0774 μg ml 1 was determined from the calibration plot using the 3 3σ method and considering sample extraction experimentation and instrument factors 40 2 5 adsorption models the pyrene concentration q e mg g 1

volume of aqueous solution l m is the biochar mass g c 0 is the initial pyrene concentration in aqueous solution mg l 1 and c e is the pyrene concentration at equilibrium in an aqueous solution mg l 1 adsorption kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo first order equation eq 3 41 and the pseudo second order equation eq 4 42 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q t and q e mg

porous structure of the adsorbent 45 2 6 biochar regeneration after prolonged operation under field conditions the performance of the biochar filter media in the gi deteriorates requiring maintenance such as media regeneration to achieve the desired effluent quality to evaluate the adsorption stability and regeneration effectiveness of biochar produced from gi plants two cycles of serial saturation regeneration experiments were conducted previous studies have used various methods to regenerate biochar including thermal regeneration inorganic or organic solvent extraction regeneration and microwave irradiation regeneration 34 46 47 among others thermal regeneration is considered one of the most cost effective methods because of its low temperature requirement i e 100 300 c 47 48 in this study two different methods were compared in their regeneration efficiencies 1 thermal regeneration at 200 c for 3 h and 2 solvent regeneration using 10 ml of acetonitrile solution in a water bath shaker for 30 min thermal regeneration at 200 c was used since it has been proven that increasing the regeneration temperature results in higher regeneration efficiency but it should not exceed the initial pyrolysis temperature due to excess weight loss 34 based on the literature the application of diluted acids and salts as a solvent may not always allow for the complete recovery of pollutants and subsequent regeneration of biochar 49 in this study solvent regeneration was performed using acetonitrile as a medium polarity solvent that is miscible with water and organic compounds to compare its performance with that of thermal regeneration after equilibration of the aqueous solution of spent biochar and acetonitrile solvent biochar was retrieved by centrifuging and filtering the solution using a 0 47 μm membrane filter the same procedure performed with the initial adsorption experiment was used for the following saturation regeneration cycle for consistency the regeneration methods were evaluated in terms of regeneration efficiency from two saturation regeneration cycles regeneration efficiency η n is the term used to determine the reusability of adsorbents as follows 34 8 η n q n q o 100 where q n is the adsorption capacity of pyrene on the regenerated biochar mg g 1 q o is the adsorption capacity of pyrene on the fresh biochar mg g 1 and n is the number of regenerations 2 7 retrieval of literature data on biochar properties and adsorption for pahs and heavy metals the general relationship of the physical properties of biochar with pyrolysis temperature was investigated using data retrieved from the literature pyrolysis temperature and heating time as well as particle pore size are all important parameters influencing the structure and physical properties of biochar which have an impact on the adsorption mechanism such as the pore filling mechanism of heavy metals 50 the physical properties of biochar investigated in this study were the specific surface area pore volume micropore volume mesopore volume and pore diameter data were also collected on the adsorption capacity of pahs and heavy metals on the biochars we obtained a total of 40 reviewed articles published between 2004 and 2021 the reference list is provided in supplementary materials the detailed 145 data sets for biochar properties are provided in the supplementary materials table s1 several feedstocks including crop residues wood biomass animal litter and solid wastes have been used to produce biochar by slow to intermediate pyrolysis processes the pyrolysis temperature in these studies varied from 100 to 700 c with heating rates ranging from 7 to 65 c min 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 characteristics of biochar table 1 shows the biochar yield and physicochemical properties of the gi plant derived biochars including ph zeta potential surface areas and pore size characteristics generally biochars produced at tp 500 c bc500s had low yields ranging from 28 57 to 37 49 as compared to those produced at tp 300 c bc300s ranging from 36 20 to 48 43 the strong inverse correlation between pyrolysis temperature and biochar yield has also been reported in previous studies 51 55 the higher loss of moisture volatile matter and non condensable gases co2 co ch4 and h2 from the feedstock at a higher pyrolysis temperature contributed to a lower biochar yield 53 when different plant species were compared dr generally resulted in higher yields than bw with a smaller difference at a higher pyrolysis temperature the yields at tp 300 c averaged across the two plant parts were 45 8 and 39 8 for dr and bw respectively while those at tp 500 c were 31 7 and 29 5 for dr and bw respectively for both plant species branches consistently resulted in lower yields than leaves at tp 300 c the yield of the branch derived biochar ranged from 36 2 to 41 9 while that of the leaf derived biochar ranged from 43 5 to 48 4 at tp 500 c the yield of the branch derived biochar ranged from 28 6 to 28 7 while that of the leaf derived biochar ranged from 29 2 to 37 5 the lower yield of the branch derived biochar is probably due to the higher lignin and cellulose decomposition of the branch as it contains a high lignin content compared to leaves 56 the ph values were always higher in bc500s 8 78 9 32 than in bc300s 7 29 8 56 which may be attributed to the fact that alkali salts are better separated from the organic components in the feedstock at a higher pyrolysis temperature 53 57 furthermore a higher pyrolysis temperature produces a greater amount of ash components resulting in a higher biochar ph 53 bw generally resulted in a higher ph than dr for both plant species the leaf derived biochars had higher ph values than the branch derived biochars the zeta potential measured in an organic medium can be roughly equated to the surface potential 58 the zeta potentials of the biochar samples were all negative and the values generally decreased with increasing ph for the dr and bw biochars which agrees with existing studies 59 60 the ph and zeta potential of biochar influence the adsorption process by altering the surface charge of biochar which can affect the electrostatic interaction of the adsorption process however for organic adsorption of pahs hydrophobic interaction dominates as the primary force of interaction rather than electrostatic interaction 34 35 61 compared to bc300s bc500s resulted in high sbet values specifically for drb500 and bwb500 with surface areas of 214 3 and 178 9 m2g 1 respectively sbjh values were also high in drb500 and bwb500 compared to the other biochars with smicro values of 202 8 and 170 2 m2g 1 respectively the dbjh value of the biochars ranged from 11 81 to 28 6 nm which further demonstrates that the mesopores rather than the micropores of the biochar accounted for the majority a larger pore surface area is beneficial if the main mechanism of adsorption is a pore filling mechanism 62 however this is not always the case for adsorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants using in particular organic adsorbents because the chemical interaction between the biochar and adsorbate surfaces may be greater than the physical pore filling the surface morphology of both plant species was cylindrical with a porous and rough surface as shown in the sem images fig s1 of the supplementary materials although there were little prominent differences in structural morphologies between biochars made from different plant species and plant parts bc500s had a more roughly clustered surface and fragmented pores than bc300s in addition the fissures and splintering of the biochar surface were found to be prominent in bc500s compared to bc300s the biochar s tubular surface structure deforms as the pyrolysis temperature increases and it may event collapse resulting in micropore blockage 63 the dr biochar had sharper and thinner wall structure of the pores than the bw biochar reflecting the distinct original cell structures of these two different plant species the ftir spectra of the eight biochars are shown in fig 1 the peak assignments in the spectra represent hydroxyl oh stretching compounds 3370 cm 1 methylene ch2 stretching 2927 cm 1 aromatic c c c and carbonyl group c o 1615 cm 1 and out of plane bending of aromatic ch 875 cm 1 the spectra of the biochars at two different pyrolysis temperatures reflected a significant difference in the 1315 1615 cm 1 bands strong peaks in the band intensities at 1615 cm 1 aromatic c c c and co and 2927 cm 1 ch2 were identified in bc300s conversely a low medium peak was observed in bc500s for functional groups of aromatic c c c and co resulting from the higher degradation of the biomass lignin at the higher pyrolysis temperature 64 65 according to previous literature the co band tends to diminish as the pyrolysis temperature increases due to the loss of acidic and basic groups in biochar 66 the peaks for the weak stretching vibrations of hydroxyl oh groups at 3370 cm 1 decreased slightly for bc500s than for bc300s due to moisture loss 67 the peaks of the stretching vibration of aliphatic methylene groups ch2 at 2927 cm 1 were weak in bc500s due to the higher decomposition of cellulose at higher pyrolysis temperature the aromatic cores formed by the lignin fractions are removed to a greater extent at bc500s due to thermal degradation of cellulose ester co aliphatic alkyl and c c c and oh groups however there was little difference in the overall shape of the spectra among the plant species and parts 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherm for pyrene fig 2 shows the concentration of pyrene adsorbed on biochar and in water with respect to contact time for different biochars and pyrolysis temperatures for bc300s the adsorbed pyrene concentration rapidly increased at the beginning of adsorption with a removal efficiency from the liquid phase 50 during the first 15 min the rapid adsorption rate in the initial adsorption stage is due to the excessive amount of active sites on the surface of biochars the pyrene adsorption equilibrium was achieved after approximately 1 h of the reaction for all bc300s the highest pyrene adsorption capacity after 4 h was of drl300 with 1909 81 μg g 1 for bc500s drl500 showed the highest pyrene adsorption capacity 1765 μg g 1 and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved after 6 h of contact time these results imply that the higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a lower pyrene adsorption capacity with a longer time required for equilibrium several studies also reported that pah adsorption favors low pyrolysis temperature for organic adsorption 34 68 for example qiao et al 35 reported a lower adsorption efficiency of pahs on biochars at 600 c than at 500 c and 400 c with a suggested reason of lower essential functional groups on the biochar surface such as cc and co at higher pyrolysis temperature the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fitted to the experimental data are shown in table 2 the pseudo second order model fitted the data better for both bc300s and bc500s r2 0 9777 0 99998 than the pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 8942 0 9686 the better representation of the adsorption kinetics by the pseudo second order model indicates a predominance of hydrophobic interactions for pyrene adsorption 34 among the three nonlinear isotherm models langmuir freundlich and dubinin rabdushkevich the freundlich isotherm model best fitted the adsorption data of pyrene for both bc300s r2 0 9572 0 9886 and bc500s r2 0 9653 0 9875 fig s2 and table s2 the best fit of the experimental adsorption data with the freundlich model has also been reported by other researchers who tested pyrene in biochars made from wood char pine sawdust corn stover and sewage sludge 36 38 69 3 3 adsorption mechanism and removal efficiency for pyrene the fitted freundlich parameters and re were compared between the different biochars in table 3 the leaf derived biochars at tp 300 c had higher re 79 28 and 76 15 for drl300 and bwl300 respectively than those at tp 500 c 72 38 and 73 06 for drl500 and bwl500 respectively an opposite relationship between tp and re was found for the branch derived biochars where the re value was higher for bc500s than for bc300s the significantly larger surface areas of the branch derived biochars at tp 500 c than those of the other biochars may be the reason of the higher re comparing the leaf and branch parts for a given plant species higher re values were obtained for all the leaf derived biochars than for the branch derived biochars for a given plant part and pyrolysis temperature no significant trend in re was found between the two plant species when averaged over the two plant parts the re of the different plant species dr compared to bw were lower by 1 and higher by 1 8 at tp 300 c and tp 500 c respectively properties influencing the adsorption efficiency of organic contaminants on biochar include specific surface area sbet porosity pore diameter dbjh and pore volume vbjh and surface chemistry such as polarity and presence of functional groups 37 70 the kf and re values shown in table 3 were higher in the biochars produced at a lower tp bc300s than the biochars produced at a higher tp bc500s similar observations were reported in previous studies on the adsorption of phenanthrene and pyrene using biochars derived from sewage sludge 37 and enteromorpha prolifera algae 34 according to previous studies the primary mechanism and representative isotherm for the adsorption of pahs on biochar vary depending on the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature 34 for organic organic adsorption processes it has been described in previous studies that physical adsorption and chemisorption mechanisms are present in adsorption 71 pyrene adsorption e g re was found to have little correlation with the surface characteristics of biochar such as sbet smicro sbjh dbjh vbjh ph and zeta potential table 1 the absence of association with specific surface area sbet sbjh pore diameter dbjh and pore volume vbjh reveals that pyrene molecules do not have complete access to the micropore and mesopore interior because pyrene molecules are larger in size compared to the micro and mesoporous sites of biochar 37 71 the result of this experiment suggests that the key mechanism of pyrene adsorption is not pore filling interaction at a pyrolysis temperature below 400 c the feedstock was partly carbonized and the non carbonized group remained providing sites for surface interaction between the biochar and organic compounds 71 in this study the higher biochar yield at 300 c by 30 than at 500 c suggests a lower degree of carbonization resulting in a low surface area less than 30 m2 g 1 71 72 further removal of aromatic cores from the feedstock at high pyrolysis temperatures can enlarge the surface area and pore volume which is beneficial for pore filling adsorption of inorganic adsorbates such as heavy metals 71 organic pollutants with a planar molecular structure such as pahs were found to have stronger chemisorption on soot like biochar materials due to the planarity effect which refers to the overlapping π π electron donor acceptor eda interaction between the planar aromatic sorbate and the sorbent surface 73 the mechanisms responsible for the interaction of pahs with biochar include 1 hydrophobic interaction 2 eda interaction 3 and physical adsorption through pore filling 70 it was suggested that the aromatic groups in biochar favor hydrophobic and π π interactions with organic compounds 37 70 as shown in fig 1 the ftir spectra of bc300s presented a greater amount of aromatic co and cc bands absorbance at 1615 cm 1 aromatic aliphatic and phenolic groups were found to be the most common functional groups within the gi plant derived biochars in this study according to the ftir analysis the pyrolysis temperature had a substantial impact on the density of functional groups a higher pyrolysis temperature resulted in a higher degree of i dehydration of cellulosic and ligneous components 3500 cm 1 to 2500 cm 1 and ii decrease of homocyclic and aromatic co and cc bonds of ketones and quinones when lignin and cellulose transformation products were produced 1500 cm 1 to 1250 cm 1 increasing the pyrolysis temperature can increase the degree of condensation of aromatic organic carbon compounds that can decrease the π π stacking interaction with the planar pollutant such as pahs 77 the greater pyrene removal by bc300s than bc500s can be explained by the greater degree of π π interactions between the aromatic groups of the biochars and pyrene in this study drl300 resulted in the highest kf and re values among the tested feedstock materials compared to other reported biochars table s3 the gi plant derived biochars were quite competitive in terms of equilibrium adsorption capacity and equilibrium time 3 4 biochar reusability adsorbent reusability was evaluated from two regeneration cycles in triplicate thermal regeneration resulted in a slightly higher regeneration efficiency η n after the first regeneration cycle with a value of η 1 98 81 than the solvent extraction of η 1 98 0 figs s4 and s5 however after the second regeneration the efficiencies of both thermal and solvent methods dropped significantly to η 2 56 and η 2 60 3 respectively notably the regeneration efficiency decreased with consecutive reuses of the biochars the pyrene removal efficiency of the gi plant derived biochar decreased as the number of regenerations increased due to weight losses during the regeneration process and accompanied by the loss of aromatic groups in the biochar repeated thermal treatment could reduce not only the total mass of the biochar but also the hydrophobic binding sites for pahs as revealed by the lower pyrene removal efficiency using the thermally pretreated biochar it is also important to account for the biochar weight loss after the regeneration cycle as it influences the adsorption capacity specifically for large scale applications after the second regeneration cycle the weight loss of biochar was approximately 37 and 23 for thermal and solvent regeneration respectively fig s5 repeated high temperature treatment damages the structure and leads to a loss of biochar and its adsorption properties decreasing its efficiency 34 nevertheless green infrastructure or industrial application of the material without regeneration may be sufficient because the feedstock for biochar production can be continuously supplied without additional cost from the routine maintenance of the gi plants 3 5 literature data analysis biochar properties and adsorption characteristics for pahs and heavy metals fig 3 shows the boxplots and individual data points of the pyrolysis temperatures and physical properties of biochars collected from the literature table s1 the adsorbent s physical properties such as specific surface area and pore size distribution are important factors in the adsorption process 60 generally the higher the pyrolysis temperature the greater the surface area and pore volume of biochar in the pyrolysis temperature range from 100 to 600 c the greater surface area from the higher pyrolysis temperature is greatly related to the destruction of aliphatic alkyl and ester groups on the biochar surface however a decrease in surface area was found at a pyrolysis temperature greater than or equal to 700 c conversely pore diameter generally decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature when aliphatic and volatile components are removed during pyrolysis the number of micropores increases as does the pore volume and surface area this is mostly due to the formation of amorphous carbon structures which are responsible for the higher micropore volume and smaller pore diameter 54 the general adsorption characteristics of pahs and heavy metals on biochar were examined with respect to their physicochemical properties based on the experimental data reported in existing studies from a total of 84 independent cases of pahs adsorption experiments in the literature the freundlich isotherm was reported as the best model to describe the adsorption for most cases 74 cases the hydrophobic interaction between the biochar surface and pahs probably allows multilayered adsorption exhibiting the freundlich adsorption the data fig 4 show that the overall adsorption isotherm coefficient log kf decreases as the specific surface area sbet increases implying that the key adsorption mechanisms are hydrophobic interaction and partitioning at uncarbonized sites rather than pore filling this observation is consistent with the results of this study therefore biochars produced at low pyrolysis temperature could remove pahs better due to less carbonization resulting in a larger number of sites on the biochar available for pah adsorption for heavy metal adsorption of biochar a total of 411 cases independent of the adsorption experiment were identified from the literature and all these cases were reported to be best described by the langmuir isotherm fig 5a and b show the correlations of qm with sbet and cation exchange capacity cec respectively at ph 7 and a temperature ranging from 20 to 25 c plotted using the 24 data sets available in the literature in fig 5 langmuir adsorption capacity qm does not show a clear monotonic trend with respect to sbet although some large qm values are present at the lower sbet range while it has a measurable positive correlation with cec this indicates that the dominant adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on biochar is ion exchange and thus cec is a more critical factor in determining heavy metal adsorption than specific surface area low pyrolysis temperature e g 300 c leads to high cation exchange capacity which is beneficial for the removal of cationic pollutants such as heavy metals 30 75 however based on other literature high pyrolysis temperature e g 500 c also results in high adsorption of heavy metals due to the increased surface area of biochar 76 77 this contradiction is also found for organic pollutants where the hydrophobic interaction of biochar tends to increase as the pyrolysis temperature increases but is greatly influenced by the surface functional groups derived depending on the used feedstock resulting in an uneven trend of results 28 37 71 however according to our literature data analysis it can be concluded that low pyrolysis is a better condition for biochar production to better remove pahs without significantly compromising heavy metal removal resulting from low specific surface area 3 6 implications for practical application although there is no single solution suitable for mitigating stormwater runoff the choice of a stormwater control system with different types of green infrastructure infiltration techniques is critical high pollutant loads or fluxes must be managed to improve the quality of receiving waters and reduce flood risks for this purpose biochar can provide a greater efficiency than conventional gi filter media e g sand and gravel because of its higher sorption capabilities for various organic and inorganic compounds present in urban stormwater runoff this study contributes to the environmental community by proposing gi plant derived biochar as a potential filter media in green infrastructures focusing on pyrene adsorption as a representative pah found in stormwater runoff additionally our review and literature data suggest that low pyrolysis temperature 300 c could be the most suitable biochar production condition to effectively remove pahs and heavy metals present in urban stormwater runoff plant residues collected as biochar can adsorb pahs in an aqueous solution and can replace conventional filters installed in gi facilities to further improve the removal of dissolved pollutants the findings of this study can serve as a guide for selecting the optimal biochar characteristics or preparation method considering the target pollutants to control as important design parameters the equilibrium concentration of pyrene per gram of biochar in the aqueous and solid phases and the adsorption kinetics provided in this study may aid in further developing the design criteria for a biochar based gi filter media mitigation of different pah species and other chemicals using biochar derived from site specific gi plant species is generally still unclear thus more laboratory and in situ green infrastructure application studies are needed as the use of biochar in gi facilities increases it is critical to select the appropriate tailored filter media for stormwater management applications of biochar as filter media in stormwater treatment were reported in several studies in recent years 26 30 78 79 majority of the existing studies were on the assessment of biochar based on batch scale adsorption experimentation and a handful number of existing studies used continuous column experiments showing the superiority of biochar over sand in removing heavy metals cd cu pb and zn 80 it is suggested that future research should be directed toward determining the most efficient engineered filter media and sizing methods by on site experimentation and access to overall capabilities in terms of pollutant removal efficiency implementation cost and its reusability or service life furthermore environmental safety in using biochar as a gi filter media also needs to be explored in the future because fine particles of biochar containing high pah concentration can be transported through the porous soil polluting water bodies although many plant derived biochars contain relatively low level of pahs compared to urban soils 24 some biochars such as rice husk biochar have been reported to contain relatively high pah concentrations potentially becoming a source of pahs upon soil application 81 despite the growing concern regarding pah concentrations in biochar 81 the pahs concentration in stormwater runoff in high traffic regions 14 16 17 26 is incomparably high compared to biochar 81 82 additionally applying large gained biochar may help prevent the loss of biochar particles from a gi facility the biochar production conditions can be determined depending on the target chemicals of most concern or by trading off the removal efficiencies of inorganic and organic pollutants as they have different adsorption mechanisms 83 potentially requiring different optimal production conditions moreover multilayered media with biochars produced using different conditions can be applied to satisfy the required removal of different pollutants 4 conclusions this study provides a cost effective way of enhancing stormwater treatment by using gi harvested plants as biochar for adsorption of organics and potentially heavy metals which can resolve the insufficient remediation of current stormwater management facilities for effective pyrene adsorption biochar can be created from a variety of gi plant species hardwood and softwood and plant parts leaves and branches biochars produced at low pyrolysis temperatures were effective in removing pahs and heavy metals in urban stormwater runoff this preliminary study revealed the high potential of closed loop recycling within gi as it requires less regeneration and ensures a steady supply from gi maintenance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12956,high performance graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go ncs materials were prepared at different temperatures 600 700 and 800 c by a one step carbonization method the electrosorption performances of go ncs for u vi were investigated the results showed that the specific surface area of go nc 700 was 266 3 m2 g 1 the doped nitrogen mainly existed in the form of pyridine n 6 pyridine n 5 and quaternary n n q the incorporation of nitrogen atoms and graphene oxide effectively improved the electrochemical performance of the material and the maximum specific capacitance of go nc 700 was 289 8 f g 1 at the same time nitrogen containing functional groups improved the selectivity to uranium and weakened the repulsive effect of coexisting ions therefore the removal efficiency of go nc 700 electrode structure can reach 98 63 at 1 2 v vs sce ph 5 the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 was 879 2 mg g 1 which was 4 times higher than that of simple adsorption 202 3 mg g 1 the material had good cycle performance and the capacity loss was less than 10 after 5 cycles the above results show that the go nc 700 electrode had special potential applications in removing uranium from aqueous solutions which provides a new and effective method for the treatment of uranium containing wastewater environmental implication graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go ncs can effectively separate uranium vi from the solution and reduce its threat to the environment and human body keywords nitrogen doped carbon graphene oxide composite electrosorption of uranium uranium pollution remediation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the global economy human society has an increasing demand for energy 1 traditional fossil energy mainly coal oil and natural gas not only has limited reserves but also emits a large amount of greenhouse gases during its use as a low carbon energy nuclear energy has great potential for development in recent years with the rapid development of nuclear energy uranium mining and the processing and utilization of uranium raw materials have produced a large amount of uranium containing water 2 if the uranium containing wastewater is directly discharged into the environment without treatment it will cause serious harm to human health and ecological environment 3 therefore how to effectively treat uranium containing wastewater has become a problem in front of people 4 at present researchers have developed various effective treatment techniques such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange redox and biological treatment methods 5 9 electrosorption technology est is a promising separation technology developed in recent years which can remove ions in solution with applied voltage it has attracted widespread attention due to its low energy consumption high efficiency easy regeneration and low cost 10 as the core part of the whole electrosorption device the electrode material has a decisive influence on the performance of the whole system carbon based materials are currently the most widely used and commercialized electrode materials due to their low production cost wide range of sources good electrical conductivity high specific surface area adjustable pore size and diverse morphologies 11 at present the main carbon materials used extensively include activated carbon 12 graphene 13 carbon nanotubes 14 and doped carbon 15 among them nitrogen doped carbon is a promising material and the performance is greatly improved by doping nitrogen in the internal structure of the porous carbon material nitrogen doped carbon not only has all the advantages of porous carbon materials but also has unique electrochemical performance nitrogen doped carbon prepared from various nitrogen containing precursors has excellent performance in efficient water desalination using capacitive deionization 15 17 at the same time it also has a good performance in the adsorption and catalytic decomposition of water pollutants 18 20 nitrogen doped carbon has also been studied in the adsorption of uranium song et al used polyacrylonitrile pan homopolymer and polyacrylonitrile block poly n butyl acrylate pan b pba block copolymer as precursors carbonized at 500 and 800 c to obtain nano nitrogen doped carbon theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of ctnc 500 on cr vi and u vi were 333 3 mg g 1 ph 2 and 17 2 mg g 1 ph 5 respectively 21 dong et al prepared nitrogen phosphorus co doped magnetic carbon spheres through a simple copolymer pyrolysis strategy and encapsulated well dispersed active iron nanocrystals fe p cn benefiting from heteroatom doping fe p cn 800 exhibited excellent u vi removal capacity of 306 76 mg g 1 surpassing nitrogen phosphorus co doped carbon spheres and nano zero valent iron 22 in order to further improve the adsorption performance of nitrogen doped carbon materials for uranium other materials including metal oxide and graphene can be compounded with nitrogen doped carbon 23 26 however this will make the preparation process of materials become complex and increase the cost which is not conducive to application when carbon materials are prepared as an electrode material its adsorption performance can be greatly improved by the action of an external electric field this has been verified by relevant studies 27 29 therefore this paper attempts to use sucrose and urea to directly prepare graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon materials through one step carbonization and makes them into electrodes to improve its adsorption performance for uranium by applying an external electric field the effects of potential initial ph of the solution and competing ions on the electrosorption of uranium were mainly investigated at the same time the cyclic regeneration performance of the electrode was studied and the electrosorption mechanism of uranium on the electrode was discussed 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents were purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd all reagents were of analytical reagent ar and solution was prepared with ultrapure water millipore 18 2 mω cm 2 2 preparation of graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go nc graphene oxide go was prepared preliminarily by a modified hummer s method 30 graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon was prepared by one step carbonization sucrose carbamide and graphene oxide were dissolved in deionized water with a mass ratio of 50 50 1 then the solution was sonicated for 30 min the solution was dried at 60 c for 2 h and then carbonized under nitrogen protection the materials obtained at different carbonization temperatures 600 c 700 c 800 c were marked as go nc 600 go nc 700 and go nc 800 respectively the carbon without graphene oxide was marked as nc 600 2 3 electrode preparation the electrodes were prepared by three main steps slurry preparation casting and drying to prepare electrode slurries active material conductive carbon black binder polyvinyl alcohol and porogen polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 with a mass ratio of 7 5 1 1 0 5 were mixed and grounded in agate mortar for 20 min with a certain amount of deionized water to form a uniform slurry then the slurries were cast on copper sheets into 1 2 cm rectangles through a mold and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c for 12 h to remove residual solvent the dried electrodes were soaked in deionized water for 6 h and then dried in vacuum oven at 80 c for another 12 h to remove porogen 2 4 characterization scanning electron microscope tests were performed by hitachi s 4800 fe sem with beam energies of 20 kv x ray diffraction xrd test adopted raxis rapid with cu kα radiation at 40 kv fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was tested using pe spectrum 100 and operated in attenuated total reflectance mode x ray photoelectron tests were using esclab 250xi and the binding energies ranged from 0 to 1400 ev the adsorption and desorption isotherms of nitrogen were measured by autosorb iq at 77 k the electrode performance test and relevant calculation formulas were detailed in our previous research 31 2 5 electrosorption experiment and calculation the electrosorption experiment was carried out in an electrolytic cell with a volume of 100 ml and the potential was controlled by electrochemical workstation the change of uranium concentration in the solution was tested by icp ms thermo fisher x2 and the adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency of the electrode were calculated by the following formulas 1 q c 0 c e v m 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 η is the adsorption efficiency c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentration of uranium element mg l 1 respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of electrode g in order to better describe the adsorption isotherm langmuir and freundlich models were used for fitting their expressions are as follows 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q e and q m are the equilibrium adsorption capacity and maximum capacity mg g 1 c e is the concentration of uranium in solution at equilibrium mg l 1 k l is langmuir constant related to surface adsorption active sites k f and n are constants related to temperature and system 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 electrochemical test as an electrode material its electrochemical performance was first tested the electrochemical test results of the materials prepared under different conditions are shown in fig 1 the cv test curves of four materials are shown in fig 1a it is obvious that all cv curves showed an approximate rectangular shape and the current increased and decreased steadily with the change of voltage and there were no obvious redox peaks this showed that the electrochemical process on the electrode surface was electric double layer capacitance compared with nc 600 the current density of materials doped with graphene oxide was larger this indicated that doping go effectively reduced the internal resistance of the material and made the charge transfer easier when the carbonization temperature rose to 700 c the higher temperature would further remove other elements in the material which increased the degree of graphitization and enhanced the electrical conductivity of the material resulting in an increase in current density however when the temperature was further increased to 800 c a large amount of nitrogen was removed which reduced the pseudocapacitance of the material and led to a decrease in current density 32 the cv curves of go nc 700 electrode at different scan rates were shown in fig 1b it can be seen from the figure that the current density gradually increased when the scan rate was changed from 5 mv s 1 to 100 mv s 1 the relationship between specific capacitance and scan rate is shown in fig 1d it can be clearly seen that the specific capacitances of the material doped with go were greatly improved when the scanning rate was 5 mv s 1 the specific capacitance of the nc 600 go nc 600 go nc 700 and go nc 800 were 110 6 222 9 289 8 and 264 6 f g 1 respectively similar to the rectangular curves of cv the gcd curves of go nc 700 were triangular like fig 1c when the current density was 1 a g 1 the curve bent at the top due to the pseudocapacitance caused by the chemical reaction fig 2a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of different electrodes it can be found that all the curves consisted of two parts the arc in the high frequency region corresponded to the charge transfer resistance the oblique line in the low frequency region represented the diffusion process of ions in the electrode the equivalent circuit diagram fitting results are shown in fig 2b and the results of the charge transfer resistance rct and the solution resistance rs are shown in table 1 with the incorporation of go and the increase of carbonization temperature rct of the electrode showed a decreasing trend the intercept on the real axis represents the solution resistance rs including the internal resistance of the electrolyte solution the internal resistance of the active material and the contact resistance of the interface between the active material and the current collector it can be seen that go nc 700 had the smallest solution resistance rs the above results showed that the go nc 700 electrode had excellent capacitive behavior small charge transfer resistance and solution resistance 3 1 2 ftir during the carbonization process other elements such as oxygen nitrogen in the material will be gradually removed and the functional groups on the surface of the material will continue to change therefore we tested the material by ftir the result is shown in fig 3 all materials had strong absorption between 1000 and 1700 cm 1 2700 3000 cm 1 and 3300 3700 cm 1 the broad peak at 3436 cm 1 in the figure was assigned to the stretching vibration peaks of free oh and nh bonds in the aromatic ring the peaks at 2961 2924 and 2850 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration peaks of ch3 and ch2 produced in the process of carbonization and the intensity of these peaks decreased with the increase of carbonization temperature 33 the shoulder peaks at 1730 and 1126 cm 1 were the stretching vibration absorption peak of co bond in carboxyl group which also weakened with the increase of carbonization temperature 34 the peak at 1630 cm 1 was considered as the cn stretching vibration absorption peak in the aromatic ring and the shoulder peak at 1280 cm 1 was considered the cn stretching vibration absorption peak in the aromatic ring and the peak near 1383 cm 1 was the characteristic peak of sp3c c single bond or sp2c c in the disordered graphite structure 35 the above results indicated that nitrogen atoms were doped into the carbon material during the carbonization process forming a partially graphitized structure partially substituted by nitrogen atoms 3 1 3 xrd fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of different materials according to fig 4 a broad diffraction peak can be seen at 2θ 24 5 representing the 002 crystal plane of the graphite structure indicating the formation of an amorphous carbon structure when the carbonization temperature was 600 c the diffraction peak of the 002 crystal plane was wide and weak at this time the degree of graphitization was low as the carbonization temperature increased it can be seen from the figure that the diffraction peak of the 002 crystal plane became sharper and the peak intensity increased indicating that the degree of graphitization increased accordingly 36 3 1 4 bet fig 5 shows the nitrogen adsorption and desorption test results of materials at different carbonization temperatures it can be seen from fig 5a that in the low pressure region the nitrogen adsorption amount increased slowly with the increase of pressure however in the high pressure region the increase was obvious and the adsorption hysteresis loop appeared at the same time which indicated that the material had a capillary condensation system in the porous adsorbent indicating that the sample had mesoporous characteristics the pore size analysis results fig 5b also demonstrated the existence of many mesopores and the mesopores had a positive effect on the charge and discharge of electric double layer when the carbonization temperature rose from 600 c to 800 c the specific surface area of go nc also increased from 227 1 to 327 6 m2 g 1 because high temperature promoted the further fracture of carbon chain in the material and expanded some micropores into mesopores while generating new micropores all of these eventually led to an increase in the specific surface area 3 1 5 tg fig 6 exhibits the thermogravimetric test results of materials with different carbonization temperatures the results were basically the same as expected all the four materials had obvious weight loss between 50 and 100 c which was mainly due to the volatilization of residual water in the materials the weight loss of four materials between 100 and 500 c was small when the temperature was higher than 500 nc 600 and go nc 600 had a relatively obvious weight loss process because the carbonization temperature of the two materials was low the carbonization reaction continued at high temperature and the elements such as oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen were further removed the weight loss curves of go nc 700 and go nc 800 were similar due to the lower carbonization temperature the final residual mass of go nc 700 was 88 8 which was lower than 90 6 of go nc 800 3 1 6 sem the surface morphologies of the go nc 700 electrode at different magnification 60 and 600 are shown in fig 7 obviously the electrodes had pores of different sizes after slurry coating fig 7a which provided channels for the solution to diffuse into the electrode meanwhile go nc 700 exhibits a wrinkled layered structure with a lateral dimension of tens of micrometers at the same time there were some carbon black nanoparticles and binder residues on the surface fig 7b the test results show that the added binder and pore forming agent can effectively increase the porosity of the electrode surface and improve the capacitance performance of the electrode the surface of the material did not change significantly after electrosorption and still maintained a loose and porous structure fig 7c d this provided favorable conditions for the subsequent recycling of the material in order to study the distribution state of uranium after electrosorption we used eds to analyze the surface of the material and the results are shown in fig 8 we selected two areas on the surface of the material and tested them respectively from the comparison of fig 8b and d the distribution of uranium on the surface was uneven the content of uranium was low in selected area 1 with an atomic percentage of only 0 21 however the atomic percentage of uranium was as high as 11 52 in full area 1 fig 8c this indicated that the good electrosorption properties of the material for uranium were mainly composed of two parts the first was the enhanced adsorption of uranium by the carbon electrode body under the action of the electric field and the second was the electroprecipitation in special areas of the electrode due to the strong electric field 3 1 7 xps the interaction mechanism between the go nc 700 and u vi was further analyzed by xps the full spectrum scanning results are shown in fig 9 there were three distinct characteristic peaks around 283 ev 399 ev and 531 ev for go nc 600 go nc 700 go nc 700 u and go nc 800 corresponding to c1s n1s and o1s respectively indicating that the electrode surface mainly contained c n and o the survey spectrum of the three materials was not significantly different the analysis results of element contents were shown in table 2 with the increase of carbonization temperature the c content of the material gradually increased and the content of n and o gradually decreased after adsorption of uranium the characteristic peak of u4f appeared near 382 ev the result of sub peak fitting is shown in fig 8b the convolution peaks of uranium were mainly composed of u4f5 2 at 392 79 ev and u4f7 2 at 381 92 36 at the same time we found that there were some characteristic peaks of u v this indicated that part of u vi was reduced to u v during the electrosorption process the n1s spectrum fig 9c showed that go nc 700 contained pyridine n 6 398 3 ev pyridine n 5 399 6 ev quaternary n n q 400 6 ev and pyridine n o p n o 402 7 ev the new peak at 406 2 ev after adsorption belonged to no3 among them n 6 and n 5 could provide electron cloud density for a pair of p electrons between graphite layers which promoted the formation of graphite interlayer co roller system n q originated from the substitution of n atoms for the c atoms in the six membered ring which was the most stable p n o was formed due to the oxidation of samples exposed to air among the different nitrogen types n 6 and n 5 can produce pseudocapacitance to improve the capacitive properties of electrode materials 3 1 8 mechanism analysis according to the above analysis and test results the electrosorption process of uranium on go ncs was shown in fig 10 under the action of the electric field the uranyl ions were accelerated to diffuse to the electrode surface enriched on the electrode surface and combined with the electrode electrosorption mainly included two parts one was the enhanced adsorption under the action of applied electric field and the other was the electroprecipitation in some special areas which led to the uneven distribution of uranium on the electrode surface fig 8 3 2 experiments on electrosorption performance of electrodes 3 2 1 effect of contact time the curve of adsorption capacity over time calculated from the concentration of uranium ions in the solution is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that go nc 700 had the best performance among the four materials and reached equilibrium in a relatively short time 150 min compared with nc 700 it had a greater lead in adsorption capacity and adsorption rate the equilibrium adsorption of go nc 700 capacity was 123 1 mg g 1 the performance improvement of go nc 700 was mainly attributed to the addition of graphene oxide and the increase of carbonization temperature the performance of go c 700 was between nc 700 and go nc 700 indicating that go could improve the performance of carbon materials more effectively than n the addition of graphene oxide reduced the internal resistance of the material and improved the electrical conductivity of the material 3 2 2 effect of electrode potential in order to study the effect of different applied potentials on the u vi electrosorption behavior of the four materials the properties of the materials were tested at different potentials 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 1 5 v fig 12 clearly shows a comparison of the electrosorption performance of the four electrodes at different applied potentials as can be seen from the figure all four electrodes had different degrees of adsorption to u vi without applied potential 0 v which indicated the existence of physicochemical adsorption among them nc 700 had the lowest physicochemical removal efficiency 27 5 and removal efficiency of go nc 800 was the highest 37 9 the removal efficiency continued to increase for all electrode pairs as the voltage was decreased from 0 v to 1 5 v indicating that the applied potential had a positive effect on the electrosorption performance specifically compared with the undoped nc 700 the properties of the three materials doping with go were greatly improved the optimal potential of these electrodes was 1 2 v which was lower than that of our previous study 37 because the electrode assembled by adhesive had greater internal resistance which required a larger negative potential 3 2 3 effect of ph the ph value affects the complexation form of ions in solution and has a significant effect on the adsorption process 38 as ph increases u vi will hydrolyze from uo2 2 to anions therefore the effect of initial ph on u vi adsorption at room temperature 25 c was investigated the results are shown in fig 13 the electrosorption 1 2 v had a higher removal efficiency at any ph and it was also more affected by ph the comparison between different materials can also be seen that go nc 700 showed all round advantages over nc 700 the optimal adsorption ph of electrosorption was around 5 under this condition the hydrogen ion concentration was low and the competition between cations was small 3 2 4 effect of competitive ion competing ions are inevitable in practical applications so we investigated the effects of different ions on the electrosorption of uranium on go nc 700 the six selected competing ions are k na ca2 mg2 fe2 and cu2 all ions were paired with uranium at the same concentration and their effect on uranium removal was investigated the test results are shown in fig 14 according to the effect on uranium removal efficiency the six ions can be divided into three categories the alkali metals na and k had little effect on the removal rate of uranium the alkaline earth metals mg2 and ca2 had a significant effect on the removal rate of uranium compared with the blank uranium solution the removal efficiency after adding mg2 and ca2 dropped to 86 5 and 82 1 the selectivity of electrosorption to ions was highly dependent on ion charge and ions with smaller hydration radius were more dominant when the charge was the same 11 unlike alkali metals transition metals fe2 cu2 had a very large impact on the removal rate of uranium because the two ions can undergo redox reactions at this site and cause precipitation to hinder the adsorption of uranium 3 2 5 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms fig 15 shows the effect of initial uranium concentration on electrosorption and simple adsorption by comparison it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of electrosorption had a great advantage over simple adsorption and go nc 700 had larger adsorption capacity than go nc 600 and go nc 800 at the same time with the increase of the initial concentration the material gradually reached saturation and the increase of the equilibrium adsorption capacity gradually slowed down the two adsorption processes were fitted by langmuir model and freundlich model respectively the results are shown in table 3 comparing the fitting results it can be found that the langmuir fitting results were better which indicated that it was a monolayer adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 electrosorption reached 879 2 mg g 1 which was 4 times that of simple adsorption 202 3 mg g 1 to further demonstrate the advantages of go nc 700 its adsorption capacity was compared with other similar works as shown in table 4 the qmax of go nc 700 in this work was significantly higher than other materials this suggested that electrosorption was an efficient method for separating uranium from solution 3 2 6 desorption and reusability studies in practical applications recycling through material analysis can effectively improve the economy therefore in this work we selected common acids and alkalis for adsorption and desorption experiments and the results are shown in fig 16 the performance of the acid eluent had obvious advantages compared with the alkaline eluents as the concentration of the eluent increased the single desorption efficiency of each eluent was improved when the concentration was 1 m the efficiency of the nitric acid was 99 2 however high concentration may cause damage to the material and affect the recycling of the electrode taking nitric acid as an example we studied the cyclic performance of the materials at different concentrations the results are shown in fig 17 when the eluent concentration was 0 01 m the elution efficiency was lower the material lost the most performance in the first adsorption desorption cycle and then slowly declined when the eluent concentration was 1 m the structure of the material was rapidly destroyed and the material could no longer be used after 5 cycles the most suitable eluent concentration was 0 1 m and the capacity can still reach more than 90 of the initial value after 5 cycles the results show that go nc 700 had good recycling performance at the same time the cost of the electrode was low which could effectively reduce the processing cost 4 conclusions the go ncs obtained by one step carbonization of sucrose urea and graphene oxide not only possessed good electrochemical performance but also exhibited excellent electrosorption performance for uranium the addition of graphene oxide can greatly improve the electrochemical properties of the materials there were a large number of functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen on the surface of the material the difference in electrical conductivity at different positions of the electrode resulted in uneven distribution of adsorbed uranium and a small amount of u vi was reduced to u v the equilibrium adsorption time of electrosorption was shorter 150 min and the adsorption rate was fast the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 was 879 2 mg g 1 using 0 1 m hno3 as the eluent the material property loss was less than 10 after 5 cycles under the complex ionic environment the electrosorption performance of the electrode for uranium decreased further modification was required in the follow up studies to improve the selective adsorption performance for uranium in general

12956,high performance graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go ncs materials were prepared at different temperatures 600 700 and 800 c by a one step carbonization method the electrosorption performances of go ncs for u vi were investigated the results showed that the specific surface area of go nc 700 was 266 3 m2 g 1 the doped nitrogen mainly existed in the form of pyridine n 6 pyridine n 5 and quaternary n n q the incorporation of nitrogen atoms and graphene oxide effectively improved the electrochemical performance of the material and the maximum specific capacitance of go nc 700 was 289 8 f g 1 at the same time nitrogen containing functional groups improved the selectivity to uranium and weakened the repulsive effect of coexisting ions therefore the removal efficiency of go nc 700 electrode structure can reach 98 63 at 1 2 v vs sce ph 5 the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 was 879 2 mg g 1 which was 4 times higher than that of simple adsorption 202 3 mg g 1 the material had good cycle performance and the capacity loss was less than 10 after 5 cycles the above results show that the go nc 700 electrode had special potential applications in removing uranium from aqueous solutions which provides a new and effective method for the treatment of uranium containing wastewater environmental implication graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go ncs can effectively separate uranium vi from the solution and reduce its threat to the environment and human body keywords nitrogen doped carbon graphene oxide composite electrosorption of uranium uranium pollution remediation 1 introduction with the rapid development of the global economy human society has an increasing demand for energy 1 traditional fossil energy mainly coal oil and natural gas not only has limited reserves but also emits a large amount of greenhouse gases during its use as a low carbon energy nuclear energy has great potential for development in recent years with the rapid development of nuclear energy uranium mining and the processing and utilization of uranium raw materials have produced a large amount of uranium containing water 2 if the uranium containing wastewater is directly discharged into the environment without treatment it will cause serious harm to human health and ecological environment 3 therefore how to effectively treat uranium containing wastewater has become a problem in front of people 4 at present researchers have developed various effective treatment techniques such as adsorption chemical precipitation ion exchange redox and biological treatment methods 5 9 electrosorption technology est is a promising separation technology developed in recent years which can remove ions in solution with applied voltage it has attracted widespread attention due to its low energy consumption high efficiency easy regeneration and low cost 10 as the core part of the whole electrosorption device the electrode material has a decisive influence on the performance of the whole system carbon based materials are currently the most widely used and commercialized electrode materials due to their low production cost wide range of sources good electrical conductivity high specific surface area adjustable pore size and diverse morphologies 11 at present the main carbon materials used extensively include activated carbon 12 graphene 13 carbon nanotubes 14 and doped carbon 15 among them nitrogen doped carbon is a promising material and the performance is greatly improved by doping nitrogen in the internal structure of the porous carbon material nitrogen doped carbon not only has all the advantages of porous carbon materials but also has unique electrochemical performance nitrogen doped carbon prepared from various nitrogen containing precursors has excellent performance in efficient water desalination using capacitive deionization 15 17 at the same time it also has a good performance in the adsorption and catalytic decomposition of water pollutants 18 20 nitrogen doped carbon has also been studied in the adsorption of uranium song et al used polyacrylonitrile pan homopolymer and polyacrylonitrile block poly n butyl acrylate pan b pba block copolymer as precursors carbonized at 500 and 800 c to obtain nano nitrogen doped carbon theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of ctnc 500 on cr vi and u vi were 333 3 mg g 1 ph 2 and 17 2 mg g 1 ph 5 respectively 21 dong et al prepared nitrogen phosphorus co doped magnetic carbon spheres through a simple copolymer pyrolysis strategy and encapsulated well dispersed active iron nanocrystals fe p cn benefiting from heteroatom doping fe p cn 800 exhibited excellent u vi removal capacity of 306 76 mg g 1 surpassing nitrogen phosphorus co doped carbon spheres and nano zero valent iron 22 in order to further improve the adsorption performance of nitrogen doped carbon materials for uranium other materials including metal oxide and graphene can be compounded with nitrogen doped carbon 23 26 however this will make the preparation process of materials become complex and increase the cost which is not conducive to application when carbon materials are prepared as an electrode material its adsorption performance can be greatly improved by the action of an external electric field this has been verified by relevant studies 27 29 therefore this paper attempts to use sucrose and urea to directly prepare graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon materials through one step carbonization and makes them into electrodes to improve its adsorption performance for uranium by applying an external electric field the effects of potential initial ph of the solution and competing ions on the electrosorption of uranium were mainly investigated at the same time the cyclic regeneration performance of the electrode was studied and the electrosorption mechanism of uranium on the electrode was discussed 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents all chemicals and reagents were purchased from aladdin chemistry co ltd all reagents were of analytical reagent ar and solution was prepared with ultrapure water millipore 18 2 mω cm 2 2 preparation of graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon go nc graphene oxide go was prepared preliminarily by a modified hummer s method 30 graphene oxide composite nitrogen doped carbon was prepared by one step carbonization sucrose carbamide and graphene oxide were dissolved in deionized water with a mass ratio of 50 50 1 then the solution was sonicated for 30 min the solution was dried at 60 c for 2 h and then carbonized under nitrogen protection the materials obtained at different carbonization temperatures 600 c 700 c 800 c were marked as go nc 600 go nc 700 and go nc 800 respectively the carbon without graphene oxide was marked as nc 600 2 3 electrode preparation the electrodes were prepared by three main steps slurry preparation casting and drying to prepare electrode slurries active material conductive carbon black binder polyvinyl alcohol and porogen polyvinylpyrrolidone k30 with a mass ratio of 7 5 1 1 0 5 were mixed and grounded in agate mortar for 20 min with a certain amount of deionized water to form a uniform slurry then the slurries were cast on copper sheets into 1 2 cm rectangles through a mold and then dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c for 12 h to remove residual solvent the dried electrodes were soaked in deionized water for 6 h and then dried in vacuum oven at 80 c for another 12 h to remove porogen 2 4 characterization scanning electron microscope tests were performed by hitachi s 4800 fe sem with beam energies of 20 kv x ray diffraction xrd test adopted raxis rapid with cu kα radiation at 40 kv fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was tested using pe spectrum 100 and operated in attenuated total reflectance mode x ray photoelectron tests were using esclab 250xi and the binding energies ranged from 0 to 1400 ev the adsorption and desorption isotherms of nitrogen were measured by autosorb iq at 77 k the electrode performance test and relevant calculation formulas were detailed in our previous research 31 2 5 electrosorption experiment and calculation the electrosorption experiment was carried out in an electrolytic cell with a volume of 100 ml and the potential was controlled by electrochemical workstation the change of uranium concentration in the solution was tested by icp ms thermo fisher x2 and the adsorption capacity and adsorption efficiency of the electrode were calculated by the following formulas 1 q c 0 c e v m 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where q is the adsorption capacity mg g 1 η is the adsorption efficiency c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentration of uranium element mg l 1 respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the mass of electrode g in order to better describe the adsorption isotherm langmuir and freundlich models were used for fitting their expressions are as follows 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 q e k f c e 1 n where q e and q m are the equilibrium adsorption capacity and maximum capacity mg g 1 c e is the concentration of uranium in solution at equilibrium mg l 1 k l is langmuir constant related to surface adsorption active sites k f and n are constants related to temperature and system 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 electrochemical test as an electrode material its electrochemical performance was first tested the electrochemical test results of the materials prepared under different conditions are shown in fig 1 the cv test curves of four materials are shown in fig 1a it is obvious that all cv curves showed an approximate rectangular shape and the current increased and decreased steadily with the change of voltage and there were no obvious redox peaks this showed that the electrochemical process on the electrode surface was electric double layer capacitance compared with nc 600 the current density of materials doped with graphene oxide was larger this indicated that doping go effectively reduced the internal resistance of the material and made the charge transfer easier when the carbonization temperature rose to 700 c the higher temperature would further remove other elements in the material which increased the degree of graphitization and enhanced the electrical conductivity of the material resulting in an increase in current density however when the temperature was further increased to 800 c a large amount of nitrogen was removed which reduced the pseudocapacitance of the material and led to a decrease in current density 32 the cv curves of go nc 700 electrode at different scan rates were shown in fig 1b it can be seen from the figure that the current density gradually increased when the scan rate was changed from 5 mv s 1 to 100 mv s 1 the relationship between specific capacitance and scan rate is shown in fig 1d it can be clearly seen that the specific capacitances of the material doped with go were greatly improved when the scanning rate was 5 mv s 1 the specific capacitance of the nc 600 go nc 600 go nc 700 and go nc 800 were 110 6 222 9 289 8 and 264 6 f g 1 respectively similar to the rectangular curves of cv the gcd curves of go nc 700 were triangular like fig 1c when the current density was 1 a g 1 the curve bent at the top due to the pseudocapacitance caused by the chemical reaction fig 2a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of different electrodes it can be found that all the curves consisted of two parts the arc in the high frequency region corresponded to the charge transfer resistance the oblique line in the low frequency region represented the diffusion process of ions in the electrode the equivalent circuit diagram fitting results are shown in fig 2b and the results of the charge transfer resistance rct and the solution resistance rs are shown in table 1 with the incorporation of go and the increase of carbonization temperature rct of the electrode showed a decreasing trend the intercept on the real axis represents the solution resistance rs including the internal resistance of the electrolyte solution the internal resistance of the active material and the contact resistance of the interface between the active material and the current collector it can be seen that go nc 700 had the smallest solution resistance rs the above results showed that the go nc 700 electrode had excellent capacitive behavior small charge transfer resistance and solution resistance 3 1 2 ftir during the carbonization process other elements such as oxygen nitrogen in the material will be gradually removed and the functional groups on the surface of the material will continue to change therefore we tested the material by ftir the result is shown in fig 3 all materials had strong absorption between 1000 and 1700 cm 1 2700 3000 cm 1 and 3300 3700 cm 1 the broad peak at 3436 cm 1 in the figure was assigned to the stretching vibration peaks of free oh and nh bonds in the aromatic ring the peaks at 2961 2924 and 2850 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration peaks of ch3 and ch2 produced in the process of carbonization and the intensity of these peaks decreased with the increase of carbonization temperature 33 the shoulder peaks at 1730 and 1126 cm 1 were the stretching vibration absorption peak of co bond in carboxyl group which also weakened with the increase of carbonization temperature 34 the peak at 1630 cm 1 was considered as the cn stretching vibration absorption peak in the aromatic ring and the shoulder peak at 1280 cm 1 was considered the cn stretching vibration absorption peak in the aromatic ring and the peak near 1383 cm 1 was the characteristic peak of sp3c c single bond or sp2c c in the disordered graphite structure 35 the above results indicated that nitrogen atoms were doped into the carbon material during the carbonization process forming a partially graphitized structure partially substituted by nitrogen atoms 3 1 3 xrd fig 4 shows the xrd patterns of different materials according to fig 4 a broad diffraction peak can be seen at 2θ 24 5 representing the 002 crystal plane of the graphite structure indicating the formation of an amorphous carbon structure when the carbonization temperature was 600 c the diffraction peak of the 002 crystal plane was wide and weak at this time the degree of graphitization was low as the carbonization temperature increased it can be seen from the figure that the diffraction peak of the 002 crystal plane became sharper and the peak intensity increased indicating that the degree of graphitization increased accordingly 36 3 1 4 bet fig 5 shows the nitrogen adsorption and desorption test results of materials at different carbonization temperatures it can be seen from fig 5a that in the low pressure region the nitrogen adsorption amount increased slowly with the increase of pressure however in the high pressure region the increase was obvious and the adsorption hysteresis loop appeared at the same time which indicated that the material had a capillary condensation system in the porous adsorbent indicating that the sample had mesoporous characteristics the pore size analysis results fig 5b also demonstrated the existence of many mesopores and the mesopores had a positive effect on the charge and discharge of electric double layer when the carbonization temperature rose from 600 c to 800 c the specific surface area of go nc also increased from 227 1 to 327 6 m2 g 1 because high temperature promoted the further fracture of carbon chain in the material and expanded some micropores into mesopores while generating new micropores all of these eventually led to an increase in the specific surface area 3 1 5 tg fig 6 exhibits the thermogravimetric test results of materials with different carbonization temperatures the results were basically the same as expected all the four materials had obvious weight loss between 50 and 100 c which was mainly due to the volatilization of residual water in the materials the weight loss of four materials between 100 and 500 c was small when the temperature was higher than 500 nc 600 and go nc 600 had a relatively obvious weight loss process because the carbonization temperature of the two materials was low the carbonization reaction continued at high temperature and the elements such as oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen were further removed the weight loss curves of go nc 700 and go nc 800 were similar due to the lower carbonization temperature the final residual mass of go nc 700 was 88 8 which was lower than 90 6 of go nc 800 3 1 6 sem the surface morphologies of the go nc 700 electrode at different magnification 60 and 600 are shown in fig 7 obviously the electrodes had pores of different sizes after slurry coating fig 7a which provided channels for the solution to diffuse into the electrode meanwhile go nc 700 exhibits a wrinkled layered structure with a lateral dimension of tens of micrometers at the same time there were some carbon black nanoparticles and binder residues on the surface fig 7b the test results show that the added binder and pore forming agent can effectively increase the porosity of the electrode surface and improve the capacitance performance of the electrode the surface of the material did not change significantly after electrosorption and still maintained a loose and porous structure fig 7c d this provided favorable conditions for the subsequent recycling of the material in order to study the distribution state of uranium after electrosorption we used eds to analyze the surface of the material and the results are shown in fig 8 we selected two areas on the surface of the material and tested them respectively from the comparison of fig 8b and d the distribution of uranium on the surface was uneven the content of uranium was low in selected area 1 with an atomic percentage of only 0 21 however the atomic percentage of uranium was as high as 11 52 in full area 1 fig 8c this indicated that the good electrosorption properties of the material for uranium were mainly composed of two parts the first was the enhanced adsorption of uranium by the carbon electrode body under the action of the electric field and the second was the electroprecipitation in special areas of the electrode due to the strong electric field 3 1 7 xps the interaction mechanism between the go nc 700 and u vi was further analyzed by xps the full spectrum scanning results are shown in fig 9 there were three distinct characteristic peaks around 283 ev 399 ev and 531 ev for go nc 600 go nc 700 go nc 700 u and go nc 800 corresponding to c1s n1s and o1s respectively indicating that the electrode surface mainly contained c n and o the survey spectrum of the three materials was not significantly different the analysis results of element contents were shown in table 2 with the increase of carbonization temperature the c content of the material gradually increased and the content of n and o gradually decreased after adsorption of uranium the characteristic peak of u4f appeared near 382 ev the result of sub peak fitting is shown in fig 8b the convolution peaks of uranium were mainly composed of u4f5 2 at 392 79 ev and u4f7 2 at 381 92 36 at the same time we found that there were some characteristic peaks of u v this indicated that part of u vi was reduced to u v during the electrosorption process the n1s spectrum fig 9c showed that go nc 700 contained pyridine n 6 398 3 ev pyridine n 5 399 6 ev quaternary n n q 400 6 ev and pyridine n o p n o 402 7 ev the new peak at 406 2 ev after adsorption belonged to no3 among them n 6 and n 5 could provide electron cloud density for a pair of p electrons between graphite layers which promoted the formation of graphite interlayer co roller system n q originated from the substitution of n atoms for the c atoms in the six membered ring which was the most stable p n o was formed due to the oxidation of samples exposed to air among the different nitrogen types n 6 and n 5 can produce pseudocapacitance to improve the capacitive properties of electrode materials 3 1 8 mechanism analysis according to the above analysis and test results the electrosorption process of uranium on go ncs was shown in fig 10 under the action of the electric field the uranyl ions were accelerated to diffuse to the electrode surface enriched on the electrode surface and combined with the electrode electrosorption mainly included two parts one was the enhanced adsorption under the action of applied electric field and the other was the electroprecipitation in some special areas which led to the uneven distribution of uranium on the electrode surface fig 8 3 2 experiments on electrosorption performance of electrodes 3 2 1 effect of contact time the curve of adsorption capacity over time calculated from the concentration of uranium ions in the solution is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from the figure that go nc 700 had the best performance among the four materials and reached equilibrium in a relatively short time 150 min compared with nc 700 it had a greater lead in adsorption capacity and adsorption rate the equilibrium adsorption of go nc 700 capacity was 123 1 mg g 1 the performance improvement of go nc 700 was mainly attributed to the addition of graphene oxide and the increase of carbonization temperature the performance of go c 700 was between nc 700 and go nc 700 indicating that go could improve the performance of carbon materials more effectively than n the addition of graphene oxide reduced the internal resistance of the material and improved the electrical conductivity of the material 3 2 2 effect of electrode potential in order to study the effect of different applied potentials on the u vi electrosorption behavior of the four materials the properties of the materials were tested at different potentials 0 0 3 0 6 0 9 1 2 1 5 v fig 12 clearly shows a comparison of the electrosorption performance of the four electrodes at different applied potentials as can be seen from the figure all four electrodes had different degrees of adsorption to u vi without applied potential 0 v which indicated the existence of physicochemical adsorption among them nc 700 had the lowest physicochemical removal efficiency 27 5 and removal efficiency of go nc 800 was the highest 37 9 the removal efficiency continued to increase for all electrode pairs as the voltage was decreased from 0 v to 1 5 v indicating that the applied potential had a positive effect on the electrosorption performance specifically compared with the undoped nc 700 the properties of the three materials doping with go were greatly improved the optimal potential of these electrodes was 1 2 v which was lower than that of our previous study 37 because the electrode assembled by adhesive had greater internal resistance which required a larger negative potential 3 2 3 effect of ph the ph value affects the complexation form of ions in solution and has a significant effect on the adsorption process 38 as ph increases u vi will hydrolyze from uo2 2 to anions therefore the effect of initial ph on u vi adsorption at room temperature 25 c was investigated the results are shown in fig 13 the electrosorption 1 2 v had a higher removal efficiency at any ph and it was also more affected by ph the comparison between different materials can also be seen that go nc 700 showed all round advantages over nc 700 the optimal adsorption ph of electrosorption was around 5 under this condition the hydrogen ion concentration was low and the competition between cations was small 3 2 4 effect of competitive ion competing ions are inevitable in practical applications so we investigated the effects of different ions on the electrosorption of uranium on go nc 700 the six selected competing ions are k na ca2 mg2 fe2 and cu2 all ions were paired with uranium at the same concentration and their effect on uranium removal was investigated the test results are shown in fig 14 according to the effect on uranium removal efficiency the six ions can be divided into three categories the alkali metals na and k had little effect on the removal rate of uranium the alkaline earth metals mg2 and ca2 had a significant effect on the removal rate of uranium compared with the blank uranium solution the removal efficiency after adding mg2 and ca2 dropped to 86 5 and 82 1 the selectivity of electrosorption to ions was highly dependent on ion charge and ions with smaller hydration radius were more dominant when the charge was the same 11 unlike alkali metals transition metals fe2 cu2 had a very large impact on the removal rate of uranium because the two ions can undergo redox reactions at this site and cause precipitation to hinder the adsorption of uranium 3 2 5 effect of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms fig 15 shows the effect of initial uranium concentration on electrosorption and simple adsorption by comparison it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of electrosorption had a great advantage over simple adsorption and go nc 700 had larger adsorption capacity than go nc 600 and go nc 800 at the same time with the increase of the initial concentration the material gradually reached saturation and the increase of the equilibrium adsorption capacity gradually slowed down the two adsorption processes were fitted by langmuir model and freundlich model respectively the results are shown in table 3 comparing the fitting results it can be found that the langmuir fitting results were better which indicated that it was a monolayer adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 electrosorption reached 879 2 mg g 1 which was 4 times that of simple adsorption 202 3 mg g 1 to further demonstrate the advantages of go nc 700 its adsorption capacity was compared with other similar works as shown in table 4 the qmax of go nc 700 in this work was significantly higher than other materials this suggested that electrosorption was an efficient method for separating uranium from solution 3 2 6 desorption and reusability studies in practical applications recycling through material analysis can effectively improve the economy therefore in this work we selected common acids and alkalis for adsorption and desorption experiments and the results are shown in fig 16 the performance of the acid eluent had obvious advantages compared with the alkaline eluents as the concentration of the eluent increased the single desorption efficiency of each eluent was improved when the concentration was 1 m the efficiency of the nitric acid was 99 2 however high concentration may cause damage to the material and affect the recycling of the electrode taking nitric acid as an example we studied the cyclic performance of the materials at different concentrations the results are shown in fig 17 when the eluent concentration was 0 01 m the elution efficiency was lower the material lost the most performance in the first adsorption desorption cycle and then slowly declined when the eluent concentration was 1 m the structure of the material was rapidly destroyed and the material could no longer be used after 5 cycles the most suitable eluent concentration was 0 1 m and the capacity can still reach more than 90 of the initial value after 5 cycles the results show that go nc 700 had good recycling performance at the same time the cost of the electrode was low which could effectively reduce the processing cost 4 conclusions the go ncs obtained by one step carbonization of sucrose urea and graphene oxide not only possessed good electrochemical performance but also exhibited excellent electrosorption performance for uranium the addition of graphene oxide can greatly improve the electrochemical properties of the materials there were a large number of functional groups containing nitrogen and oxygen on the surface of the material the difference in electrical conductivity at different positions of the electrode resulted in uneven distribution of adsorbed uranium and a small amount of u vi was reduced to u v the equilibrium adsorption time of electrosorption was shorter 150 min and the adsorption rate was fast the maximum adsorption capacity of go nc 700 was 879 2 mg g 1 using 0 1 m hno3 as the eluent the material property loss was less than 10 after 5 cycles under the complex ionic environment the electrosorption performance of the electrode for uranium decreased further modification was required in the follow up studies to improve the selective adsorption performance for uranium in general

12957,various methods exist for the recovery of volatile fatty acids from organic mixed waste effluents and among them the membrane filtration process holds a great promise over other recovery methods due to their simplicity sustainability and high efficiency hence in this study nanofiltration experiments were carried out using two commercial nanofiltration membranes of 200 300 da and 300 500 da under various ph 4 5 4 7 and 9 at constant pressure 15 bar and temperature of 20 21 c in order to achieve a higher amount of volatile fatty acids from the real mixed food waste based effluent results showed that solution ph plays an important role in the physicochemical parameters such as total solids removal rate was above 80 at ph 4 chemical oxygen demand ammonia and phosphorus removed to some extent at ph 9 subsequently the concentration and recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids increased with solution ph 9 in particular lower molecular weight cut off membrane i e 200 100 da appeared to be more effective with an increased concentration of total volatile fatty acids 16 94 g l 1 and recovery percentage above 90 at ph 9 membrane performance was also evaluated and correlated with recovery performance in terms of permeate flux reduction at lower ph an important finding of this study was the concentration and recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids reached around 96 after 3rd cycle by conducting a repeated sequencing nanofiltration process which was identified as a promising option to enhance the recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords waste biorefinery food waste circular economy anaerobic membrane bioreactor volatile fatty acids nanofiltration 1 introduction waste biorefinery models are one of the emerging concepts complying with the fundamentals of the circular economy while compassing the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations 1 5 among the organic waste streams of interest to be used in a waste based biorefinery food waste fw is considered one of the most available regardless of location rich in a mixture of carbohydrates proteins lipids and other nutrients and therefore a good candidate as a feedstock to a biorefinery 6 8 annually around 1 3 billion tons of food waste is generated worldwide as estimated by the food and agriculture organization fao 9 fw if not properly handled can cause negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions land air and water pollution conventionally food waste management was conducted through composting incineration and landfilling which are not the most praised strategies for resource efficiency and nutrient recovery environmental benefits 10 additionally these management processes face technological and compliance feasibility issues 11 12 thus selecting an environment friendly and economic oriented management approach to turn food waste into value added products is highly demanded 13 14 anaerobic digestion ad has been acknowledged as a sustainable and feasible organic waste valorization technique due to its high conversion efficiency cost effectiveness and technical viability 15 16 in the ad process food waste is loaded in an anaerobic digester where is four main successive stages of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in which organic matter is converted to biogas methane 53 70 carbon dioxide 30 50 other gaseous compounds and digestate however intermediate ad products such as volatile fatty acids vfas are of more market appeal and unit value than biogas 17 19 vfas are carboxylic acids acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid valeric acid and caproic acid containing six or fewer carbon atoms in their chain ad assisted waste derived vfas production is considered a sustainable platform compared to the currently achieved synthetic route i e fossil based sources 20 21 vfas have many industrial applications from bioplastics and biofuels to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 22 however in order to market vfas acquired from ad this should be effectively recovered separated collected in pure form from microorganism particle rich mixed effluent and concentrated to favorable levels 23 24 various technologies such as adsorption electrodialysis ion exchange and solvent extraction have been used to improve the vfas purity in ad fermentation liquid 25 above all membrane technology has proved to be a promising sustainable and energy efficient solely physical approach towards vfas recovery 26 27 due to mechanisms involved in permeate selectivity nanofiltration nf has attracted widespread attention in recent years having said that the nanofiltration process also faces some issues including more energy required than ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes are expensive pretreatments are needed in some cases of heavily polluted effluents and limitations on retention of salts and ions 28 however the pore sizes of the nanofiltration membranes lie between 1 and 10 nm which are beneficial for rejecting low molecular weight vfas the retention mechanism of the nf process is dominated by charged and size exclusion several works of literature have shown the ability of nf in vfas recovery for instance han et al 29 screened several nf membranes for acetic acid recovery from model solutions in addition zacharof et al 30 used the nf process to treat agricultural wastewater and 75 of vfas compounds including acetic and butyric acid were recovered regardless of the great interest in applying fw in a waste biorefinery and the complexity involved in waste generated vfas separation purification and concentration from fw digestate there is a lack of available information in the application of pressure driven membrane processes in this regard therefore in this study actual ultrafiltered vfas effluent was collected from a semi continuous microfiltration immersed membrane bioreactor set up for anaerobic digestion of food waste and then subjected to nf with alternation in defining parameters the effect of changes in the ph of the media and nf membrane pore size during the experimental work on vfas recovery percentage was investigated furthermore a two stage repeated filtration system was carried out to improve the vfas recovery performance the results acquired in this research work will present new insight into the essential role of pressure driven membranes in developing new generations of waste based biorefinery 2 experimental 2 1 materials and reagents for the nanofiltration

applied pressure of 15 bar through high pressure nitrogen a new membrane was flushed for 45 min with miliq water before loading the feed solution for every experimental run before starting each

permeate solution weight was recorded using for the measurement of permeate flux the ph of the vfas effluent obtained from the mbr was adjusted before nf to 4 5 4 7 and ph 9 for both membranes after

the flow diagram presented in fig 2 sequencing sq as the first approach was conducted with a feed solution volume of 200 ml aiming at the collection of 50 ml retentate and 150 ml permeate after each sq stage 10 ml solution was withdrawn from the retentate for further characterization and a fresh 160 ml feed solution was added in the 2nd this procedure was further applied in cycle 3 for recirculation rc experiments the same initial feed volume of 200 ml was used in 3 consecutive filtration cycles accordingly the 150 ml permeate was returned to the filtration tank after every filtration cycle and joined the retentate for another round of filtration 3 results and discussion this study explored the feasibility of nanofiltration for the recovery of vfas from real anaerobic digested food waste derived liquid streams clarifying the relationship between membrane and solution characteristics experiments were carried out with two synthetic commercial nanofiltration membranes ts 40 and xn 45 and four ranges of solution ph 4 5 4 7 and 9 at room temperature after that repeated nanofiltration tests were conducted with two successive stages namely sequencing and recirculation to develop a concentration and purification improved scheme for vfas the results that removal is the considered as compounds ending in permeate and retention as a measure of compound remained in the retentate 3 1 the effect of ph on the physicochemical parameters physicochemical parameters are regarded as one of the most important factors defining the quality of the aquatic environment quality the pre treated ultrafiltered solutions were subjected to a nanofiltration tables 2 and 3 as can be seen nf reduced the solid s content ts tss ds vs vss significantly for 200 300 da membrane table 2 the removal percentage of total solids was 63 3 17 to 1 17 g l 1 at the as received ph 5 4 but it increased to 85 3 17 to 0 46 g l 1 as the ph was reduced to 4 on the contrary when ph was increased to 7 and 9 the removal percentage reduced marginally to 83 78 the same trend was also noticed for 300 500 da membrane table 3 the results prove that better solid removal is obtained at lower ph ph 4 in the aforementioned nf membranes attributed to the generation of electrostatic attraction at low ph between negatively charged particles and positively charged membrane surfaces when electrostatic attraction occurs the membrane surface allows the passing of the particles from their pores and shows a higher removal rate 34 furthermore the larger amount of solids contents removal produces transparent permeate solutions and reduced absorbance values fig 3 a and b the cod contents are linearly decreased in the permeate solutions for both membranes at different ph as can be seen in table 2 the feed tcod concentration was 6 85 g l 1 whereas the permeate tcod concentration decreased to 4 7 g l 1 ph 4 3 g l 1 ph 5 4 1 15 g l 1 ph 7 and 0 5 g l 1 ph 9 as a result the removal efficiency of 31 38 increased to 92 70 when the ph value reached 9 on the other hand the corresponding tcod removal efficiency increased from 21 16 ph 4 to 76 64 ph 9 by 300 500 da membrane table 3 expectedly lower than that of the 200 300 da membrane moreover in both cases the removal percentage trend of scod was higher than tcod removal efficiency tables 2 and 3 the obtained results can be supported by the previous studies stating that the concentration of hydroxide ions is increased at higher ph thereby promoting the production of hydroxyl free radicals on a large scale contributes to a higher removal efficiency of tcod and scod in the permeate solution 35 36 given the characteristics of the nanofiltration process it has proven to be promising for nutrients such as nh4 n and po4 3 p recovery from fermentation broth 37 38 as can be seen for nh4 n the feed concentration was 145 mg l 1 while after filtration the retentate concentration reached 445 mg l 1 and 330 mg l 1 at ph 9 for 200 300 da membrane and 300 500 da membranes respectively tables 2 and 3 the reason could be that ammonium ions are converted to ammonia at higher ph resulting in such an increment in nh4 n concentration in the retentate solution 39 for all assessed membranes it can be noticed that when ph was adjusted to 4 the retention concentration of nh4 n was increased to 415 mg l 1 table 2 and 325 mg l 1 table 3 respectively which can be due to the carboxylic group s deprotonation behavior with the dense membrane in the nanofiltration process 40 for po4 3 p the ph has an apparent influence on the removal recovery percentage in the nanofiltration process the feed concentration of po4 3 p was 62 75 mg l 1 and after nano filtered with 200 300 da membrane the retentate solution concentrations were found to be around 178 and 173 25 mg l 1 for ph 4 and 5 4 respectively table 2 and for 300 500 da it appeared 126 and 112 mg l 1 table 3 whereas as the ph increased to 7 and 9 the retention solution concentrations decreased to 171 75 mg l 1 and 33 75 mg l 1 for 200 300 da table 2 however in the presence of 300 500 da the retention concentrations also reduced to 117 75 mg l 1 and 12 25 mg l 1 table 3 this means that lower ph increased recovery efficiency while higher ph improved the removal percentage of po4 3 p it could be explained by electrostatic attraction between negatively charged phosphate ions and positively charged nanofiltration membrane surface at lower ph thereby increasing the recovery efficiency and for higher ph vice versa 41 further this result agrees with previous studies dealing with po4 3 p rich effluents treatment by nanofiltration 42 43 3 2 the effect of ph on vfas recovery the nanofiltration process is an attractive choice for recovering chemical compounds such as vfas however it is observed that various operational parameters play a role in nf performance solution ph has been identified as one of the most influential parameters in compound retention during nf hence the concentrations and recovery percentages of individual vfas as a function of ph were investigated tables 4 and 5 as shown in table 4 for hac the recovery percentage increases from 65 to 98 as solution ph increases from 4 to 9 the same trends are noticed for hpr 55 93 hibu 31 98 hbu 53 96 hiva 32 83 hva 21 60 hca 48 96 and tvfas 50 91 when the solution ph increased from 4 to 9 it can be observed that concentrations and recovery percentages for all vfas increase when the solution ph increases except for hpr hibu hbu hva and hca which at ph 7 show higher recovery percentages than hac this phenomenon has been achieved due to the variations of molecular weight meaning that higher molecular weight represents a better recovery percentage xiong et al 44 also evaluated that at ph 7 acetic acid has a lower recovery percentage than butyric acid because of its lower molecular weight moreover the retention mechanism of the nanofiltration process can be described by the size and charged effect at ph 4 it can be found that a smaller amount of vfas compounds are recovered because of the size effect since vfas compounds are generally uncharged at ph 4 and they have lower molecular weights table 6 than the pore size mwco of the membrane thus leading to a low recovery percentage on the other hand when ph values of 5 4 7 and 9 are selected the recovery percentages are significantly increased this is mainly attributed to the charge effect vfas see pka values in table 6 and nanofiltration membranes are negatively charged at higher ph above isoelectric point therefore electrostatic repulsion occurs preventing vfas from passing through the membrane resulting in a higher recovery percentage several previous works have reported similar results regarding higher vfas recovery at higher ph in the nanofiltration process 45 48 nf membrane with a larger pore size 300 500 da was also applied for the recovery of vfas at different ph as shown in table 5 a similar increasing trend was observed for concentration and recovery percentages of vfa but the performance was distinctively poorer than that of the membrane with a lower mwco for hac the recovery percentage achieved at ph 9 was 90 reaching a concentration of 4 52 g l 1 while the recovery percentages were higher for hbu 93 and hca 94 also for ph 7 the recovery percentages of hbu 84 and hca 82 were higher than hac 76 however when the ph was adjusted to 4 and 5 4 the recovery percentage of hpr was dominant with 53 and 54 respectively it can be seen that the retention performance of hbu and hpr is favored over hac which may be achieved due to the higher molecular weight of the former compounds 49 50 overall to summarize the influence of ph on vfas concentration and recovery percentage it seems that lower pore size membrane ts 40 has shown better performance than higher pore size membrane xn 45 however ph 9 was found to be the best for both membranes therefore it can be concluded that ts 40 membrane at ph 9 for vfas recovery would be a feasible choice for nf of food waste based anaerobically digested liquid 3 3 membrane performance during nf the membrane performance was evaluated by recording the changes in the permeate flux during nanofiltration figs 4 and 5 show the flux time profile for 200 300 da and 300 500 da mwco membranes respectively for filtration conducted at different values of ph as can be seen the flux rate decreased with time which could be attributed to different fouling mechanisms in semi dead end filtration systems such as concentration polarization and gel layer formation on the membrane surface leading to a declining flux trend 51 the average permeates flux is calculated and presented in table 7 it was noticed that the highest flux occurred at ph 4 for both membranes used with xn 45 offering the highest rate of about 84 79 l m 2 h 1 table 7 on the contrary at ph 9 the permeate flux was considerably lower for all treatments with the smallest flux obtained for ts 40 at 52 91 l m 2 h 1 table 7 this can be potentially correlated with the maximum recovery percentage of vfas at ph 9 as a common phenomenon in a dead end nanofiltration system 46 52 53 it is observed that acidic conditions favored permeating flux through membranes which can be described by the neutralizing behavior of membranes as ph decreases the membrane s surface charge moves near the isoelectric point resulting in an increase in flux across the membranes 54 55 on the other hand alkali conditions reduce the flux through the membranes generally polyamide based nanofiltration membranes are strongly affected by solution ph the membrane morphology changes under alkali conditions as the surface layer swell as a hydration function decreasing liquid passage through the membrane pores and lowering the flux overall previous research fully supports the results acquired in this study regarding changes in permeate flux by ph 44 56 3 4 permeate recirculation and sequential filtration this part aimed to investigate the influence of recirculation and refiltration of permeate on vfas recovery percentage and the effect of stage wise batch reloading on vfas retention and accumulation for this purpose a two stage recycling process was designed including sequencing sq or recirculation rc of up to 3 cycles as presented in fig 2 as the results present when sequencing nf cycles were introduced fig 6a the concentration and recovery percentages of individual acids and total vfas inset were enhanced by the number of cycles each cycle added a fresh feed solution to the existing retentate solution among all vfas hac was dominant with an increased concentration from 1 25 to 9 36 g l 1 up to the 2nd cycle while in the 3rd cycle hbu turned to be the main recovered product with a concentration of 13 26 g l 1 interestingly total recovery of hbu hibu hiva hva and hca was achieved by the end of the 3rd cycle these results confirm that the higher molecular weight favored achieving better recovery percentages 49 therefore the effluent composition obtained from the microfiltered anaerobic mbr plays an important role in defining the final distribution of vfas after nf 17 33 57 moreover the concentration of total vfas has shown a significant jump from 4 65 to 41 42 g l 1 around 96 recovery at the 3rd cycle introducing nf as a promising approach for vfas recovery and concentration 26 58 the recirculation method was applied to the same effluent in order to investigate vfas build up behavior through recirculation of permeate the results of this stage are presented in fig 6b the experiments were repeated up to 3rd cycle using the previous cycles permeate as a feed solution into the existing retentate it was observed that the concentration and recovery percentages of individual acids experience a slight decrease by cycle addition for hac the concentration increased marginally 5 75 to 5 79 g l 1 for the 1st and 2nd cycle respectively however it reduced to 4 98 g l 1 by the 3rd cycle this trend was also observed for the rest vfas compounds in addition the recovery percentage dropped to 40 50 in each cycle for individual vfas this observation implied that the acids have not been in the liquid retentate but adsorbed in small amounts on the surface of the membrane because of limited adsorption sites available during the recirculation method 59 61 4 conclusion the current work adopts nanofiltration as a sustainable downstream procedure for recovering substantial quantities of vfas chemicals from anaerobically digested food waste based effluents two commercially available nanofiltration membranes of 200 300 da and 300 500 da mwco were used at varying solution ph 4 to 9 the nanofiltered permeate was an almost particle free solution 80 of solids substances eliminated plus 90 of cod was removed at ph 9 the recovered concentration of ammonia and nh4 n and po4 3 p recovery was increased at higher working ph 9 it was proven that at higher ph vfas recovery was enhanced with acetic acid exhibiting high recovery rates of up to 98 at a ph of 9 however in contradiction to lower ph ranges ph 4 increase in the ph came at the expense of a reduction in permeates flux 52 91 l m 2 h 1 for 200 300 da the electrostatic state of the membrane forms of acids and membrane pore size played defining roles during nf at different ph furthermore two approaches of nf sequencing and recirculation were applied to the feed solution where through sequencing complete recovery for butyric valeric and caproic acids was obtained by the 3rd cycle however the present study could only recover and concentrate vfas in a mixed form which needs to be sorted out to extend their commercial applications in the sense of individual formulation accordingly this research could be a foundation for future studies on recovering and concentrating sufficient amounts of the individual vfas from the mixed digester effluents in

12957,various methods exist for the recovery of volatile fatty acids from organic mixed waste effluents and among them the membrane filtration process holds a great promise over other recovery methods due to their simplicity sustainability and high efficiency hence in this study nanofiltration experiments were carried out using two commercial nanofiltration membranes of 200 300 da and 300 500 da under various ph 4 5 4 7 and 9 at constant pressure 15 bar and temperature of 20 21 c in order to achieve a higher amount of volatile fatty acids from the real mixed food waste based effluent results showed that solution ph plays an important role in the physicochemical parameters such as total solids removal rate was above 80 at ph 4 chemical oxygen demand ammonia and phosphorus removed to some extent at ph 9 subsequently the concentration and recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids increased with solution ph 9 in particular lower molecular weight cut off membrane i e 200 100 da appeared to be more effective with an increased concentration of total volatile fatty acids 16 94 g l 1 and recovery percentage above 90 at ph 9 membrane performance was also evaluated and correlated with recovery performance in terms of permeate flux reduction at lower ph an important finding of this study was the concentration and recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids reached around 96 after 3rd cycle by conducting a repeated sequencing nanofiltration process which was identified as a promising option to enhance the recovery percentages of volatile fatty acids graphical abstract

emerging concepts complying with the fundamentals of the circular economy while compassing the sustainable development goals sdgs adopted by the united nations 1 5 among the organic waste streams of interest to be used in a waste based biorefinery food waste fw is considered one of the most available regardless of location rich in a mixture of carbohydrates proteins lipids and other nutrients and therefore a good candidate as a feedstock to a biorefinery 6 8 annually around 1 3 billion tons of food waste is generated worldwide as estimated by the food and agriculture organization fao 9 fw if not properly handled can cause negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions land air and water pollution conventionally food waste management was conducted through composting incineration and landfilling which are not the most praised strategies for resource efficiency and nutrient recovery environmental benefits 10 additionally these management processes face technological and compliance feasibility issues 11 12 thus selecting an environment friendly and economic oriented management approach to turn food waste into value added products is highly demanded 13 14 anaerobic digestion ad has been acknowledged as a sustainable and feasible organic waste valorization technique due to its high conversion efficiency cost effectiveness and technical viability 15 16 in the ad process food waste is loaded in an anaerobic digester where is four main successive stages of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in which organic matter is converted to biogas methane 53 70 carbon dioxide 30 50 other gaseous compounds and digestate however intermediate ad products such as volatile fatty acids vfas are of more market appeal and unit value than biogas 17 19 vfas are carboxylic acids acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid valeric acid and caproic acid containing six or fewer carbon atoms in their chain ad assisted waste derived vfas production is considered a sustainable platform compared to the currently achieved synthetic route i e fossil based sources 20 21 vfas have many industrial applications from bioplastics and biofuels to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals 22 however in order to market vfas acquired from ad this should be effectively recovered separated collected in pure form from microorganism particle rich mixed effluent and concentrated to favorable levels 23 24 various technologies such as adsorption electrodialysis ion exchange and solvent extraction have been used to improve the vfas purity in ad fermentation liquid 25 above all membrane technology has proved to be a promising sustainable and energy efficient solely physical approach towards vfas recovery 26 27 due to mechanisms involved in permeate selectivity nanofiltration nf has attracted widespread attention in recent years having said that the nanofiltration process also faces some issues including more energy required than ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes are expensive pretreatments are needed in some cases of heavily polluted effluents and limitations on retention of salts and ions 28 however the pore sizes of the nanofiltration membranes lie between 1 and 10 nm which are beneficial for rejecting low molecular weight vfas the retention mechanism of the nf process is dominated by charged and size exclusion several works of literature have shown the ability of nf in vfas recovery for instance han et al 29 screened several nf membranes for acetic acid recovery from model solutions in addition zacharof et al 30 used the nf process to treat agricultural wastewater and 75 of vfas compounds including acetic and butyric acid were recovered regardless of the great interest in applying fw in a waste biorefinery and the complexity involved in waste generated vfas separation purification and concentration from fw digestate there is a lack of available information in the application of pressure driven membrane processes in this regard therefore in this study actual ultrafiltered vfas effluent was collected from a semi continuous microfiltration immersed membrane bioreactor set up for anaerobic digestion of food waste and then subjected to nf with alternation in defining parameters the effect of changes in the ph of the media and nf membrane pore size during the experimental work on vfas recovery percentage was investigated furthermore a two stage repeated filtration system was carried out to improve the vfas recovery performance the results acquired in this research work

than hac this phenomenon has been achieved due to the variations of molecular weight meaning that higher molecular weight represents a better recovery percentage xiong et al 44 also evaluated that at ph 7 acetic acid has a lower recovery percentage than butyric acid because of its lower molecular weight moreover the retention mechanism of the nanofiltration process can be described by the size and charged effect at ph 4 it can be found that a smaller amount of vfas compounds are recovered because of the size effect since vfas compounds are generally uncharged at ph 4 and they have lower molecular weights table 6 than the pore size mwco of the membrane thus leading to a low recovery percentage on the other hand when ph values of 5 4 7 and 9 are selected the recovery percentages are significantly increased this is mainly attributed to the charge effect vfas see pka values in table 6 and nanofiltration membranes are negatively charged at higher ph above isoelectric point therefore electrostatic repulsion occurs preventing vfas from passing through the membrane resulting in a higher recovery percentage several previous works have reported similar results regarding higher vfas recovery at higher ph in the nanofiltration process 45 48 nf membrane with a larger pore size 300 500 da was also applied for the recovery of vfas at different ph as shown in table 5 a similar increasing trend was observed for concentration and recovery percentages of vfa but the performance was distinctively poorer than that of the membrane with a lower mwco for hac the recovery percentage achieved at ph 9 was 90 reaching a concentration of 4 52 g l 1 while the recovery percentages were higher for hbu 93 and hca 94 also for ph 7 the recovery percentages of hbu 84 and hca 82 were higher than hac 76 however when the ph was adjusted to 4 and 5 4 the recovery percentage of hpr was dominant with 53 and 54 respectively it can be seen that the retention performance of hbu and hpr is favored over hac which may be achieved due to the higher molecular weight of the former compounds 49 50 overall to summarize the influence of ph on vfas concentration and recovery percentage it seems that lower pore size membrane ts 40 has shown better performance than higher pore size membrane xn 45 however ph 9 was found to be the best for both membranes therefore it can be concluded that ts 40 membrane at ph 9 for vfas recovery would be a feasible choice for nf of food waste based anaerobically digested liquid 3 3 membrane performance during nf the membrane performance was evaluated by recording the changes in the permeate flux during nanofiltration figs 4 and 5 show the flux time profile for 200 300 da and 300 500 da mwco membranes respectively for filtration conducted at different values of ph as can be seen the flux rate decreased with time which could be attributed to different fouling mechanisms in semi dead end filtration systems such as concentration polarization and gel layer formation on the membrane surface leading to a declining flux trend 51 the average permeates flux is calculated and presented in table 7 it was noticed that the highest flux occurred at ph 4 for both membranes used with xn 45 offering the highest rate of about 84 79 l m 2 h 1 table 7 on the contrary at ph 9 the permeate flux was considerably lower for all treatments with the smallest flux obtained for ts 40 at 52 91 l m 2 h 1 table 7 this can be potentially correlated with the maximum recovery percentage of vfas at ph 9 as a common phenomenon in a dead end nanofiltration system 46 52 53 it is observed that acidic conditions favored permeating flux through membranes which can be described by the neutralizing behavior of membranes as ph decreases the membrane s surface charge moves near the isoelectric point resulting in an increase in flux across the membranes 54 55 on the other hand alkali conditions reduce the flux through the membranes generally polyamide based nanofiltration membranes are strongly affected by solution ph the membrane morphology changes under alkali conditions as the surface layer swell as a hydration function decreasing liquid passage through the membrane pores and lowering the flux overall previous research fully supports the results acquired in this study regarding changes in permeate flux by ph 44 56 3 4 permeate recirculation and sequential filtration this part aimed to investigate the influence of recirculation and refiltration of permeate on vfas recovery percentage and the effect of stage wise batch reloading on vfas retention and accumulation for this purpose a two stage recycling process was designed including sequencing sq or recirculation rc of up to 3 cycles as presented in fig 2 as the results present when sequencing nf cycles were introduced fig 6a the concentration and recovery percentages of individual acids and total vfas inset were enhanced by the number of cycles each cycle added a fresh feed solution to the existing retentate solution among all vfas hac was dominant with an increased concentration from 1 25 to 9 36 g l 1 up to the 2nd cycle while in the 3rd cycle hbu turned to be the main recovered product with a concentration of 13 26 g l 1 interestingly total recovery of hbu hibu hiva hva and hca was achieved by the end of the 3rd cycle these results confirm that the higher molecular weight favored achieving better recovery percentages 49 therefore the effluent composition obtained from the microfiltered anaerobic mbr plays an important role in defining the final distribution of vfas after nf 17 33 57 moreover the concentration of total vfas has shown a significant jump from 4 65 to 41 42 g l 1 around 96 recovery at the 3rd cycle introducing nf as a promising approach for vfas recovery and concentration 26 58 the recirculation method was applied to the same effluent in order to investigate vfas build up behavior through recirculation of permeate the results of this stage are presented in fig 6b the experiments were repeated up to 3rd cycle using the previous cycles permeate as a feed solution into the existing retentate it was observed that the concentration and recovery percentages of individual acids experience a slight decrease by cycle addition for hac the concentration increased marginally 5 75 to 5 79 g l 1 for the 1st and 2nd cycle respectively however it reduced to 4 98 g l 1 by the 3rd cycle this trend was also observed for the rest vfas compounds in addition the recovery percentage dropped to 40 50 in each cycle for individual vfas this observation implied that the acids have not been in the liquid retentate but adsorbed in small amounts on the surface of the membrane because of limited adsorption sites available during the recirculation method 59 61 4 conclusion the current work adopts nanofiltration as a sustainable downstream procedure for recovering substantial quantities of vfas chemicals from anaerobically digested food waste based effluents two commercially available nanofiltration membranes of 200 300 da and 300 500 da mwco were used at varying solution ph 4 to 9 the nanofiltered permeate was an almost particle free solution 80 of solids substances eliminated plus 90 of cod was removed at ph 9 the recovered concentration of ammonia and nh4 n and po4 3 p recovery was increased at higher working ph 9 it was proven that at higher ph vfas recovery was enhanced with acetic acid exhibiting high recovery rates of up to 98 at a ph of 9 however in contradiction to lower ph ranges ph 4 increase in the ph came at the expense of a reduction in permeates flux 52 91 l m 2 h 1 for 200 300 da the electrostatic state of the membrane forms of acids and membrane pore size played defining roles during nf at different ph furthermore two approaches of nf sequencing and recirculation were applied to the feed solution where through sequencing complete recovery for butyric valeric and caproic acids was obtained by the 3rd cycle however the present study could only recover and concentrate vfas in a mixed form which needs to be sorted out to extend their commercial applications in the sense of individual formulation accordingly this research could be a foundation for future studies on recovering and concentrating sufficient amounts of the individual vfas from the mixed digester effluents in

performance may be appropriate the microfluidic device design can be modified to suit specific applications ultra pure water plays a crucial role for treatment of some patients such as those undergoing dialysis in which it is used for preparation of dialysis fluid it has been reported that adverse outcomes in dialysis patients are often caused by microbial sources either direct infection with pathogenic bacteria or as a result of bacterial endotoxin exposure 30 pseudomonas contamination represents the major source of endotoxin found in water used for dialysis fluid moreover most water supplies contain pseudomonas even after standard water treatment 31 32 reported outbreaks due to pyrogenic reactions have been linked to the use of water that did not meet purity standards which would be adequate to avoid these adverse outcomes 33 to meet ultrapure dialysate water standards the water leaving the treatment device should be 0 03 eu ml of endotoxin and validated to achieve 2 log

combination of temperature pressure and flow rate that would achieve the targeted reduction of 2 log eu ml 2 materials and methods 2 1 microfluidic pasteurizer design and modification the microchannel uht pasteurizer used in this study was previously developed by the school of mechanical industrial manufacturing engineering at oregon state university corvallis or 29 and utilizes a parallel microchannel architecture and counter flow fluid pathway design with streams of fluid flow in opposing directions facilitating heat exchange between the two streams fig 1 the pasteurizer is considered a multi functional device including a heater array a mixing and residence chamber and a heat exchanger which acts as a regenerative heating and cooling system the device architecture consists of multiple a and b side laminae stacked together in an alternating sequence fig 2 ambient temperature water entering the device through the inlet manifold is pre heated as it flows through side a laminae by hot water exiting the device through side b laminae the water continues to heat as it flows through jackets surrounding six cartridge heaters the water will continue to flow into the residence chamber at the targeted temperature before exiting the device through the side b laminae where heat transfer will lead to cooling several alterations were made to the pasteurizer from its original design 29 to support test system functionality for microbial and endotoxin testing modification included using alternating current ac cartridge heaters 120 v 1a 125 w mcmaster carr santa fe springs ca in place of the original direct current dc heaters and substituting a thermocouple k type amazon seattle wa for the original thermistor for temperature monitoring of water inside the mixing

compression fittings and ptfe water lines to facilitate pressurization of the system 2 2 sterilization of the microchannel uht pasteurizer test system prior to and after each experiment the test system was chemically sterilized by filling with a 4 bleach solution and allowing a contact time of 15 min the system was then emptied and refilled with sterile water that was recirculated for 15 min the system was then flushed with sterile water continuously flowing through the system and water samples were collected and tested for residual bleach using chlorine test strips top line test strips sanit taurant sanitizer test strips china until no residual bleach was detected in the flow water once the bleach was cleared the system was heated and pressurized while sterilized water continued to flow through the system once the test conditions temperature pressure were stable endotoxin contaminated water was delivered to the test system 2 3 endotoxin sample preparation and processing pseudomonas aeruginosa 10 endotoxin sigma st louis mo was dissolved in endotoxin free water 10 ml growcells irvine ca usa to achieve a stock concentration of 3 000 000 eu ml stock solutions were stored at 4 c and used within one month of preparation on the day of testing endotoxin stock solution was removed from refrigerated storage and vortexed for 15 min to ensure homogeneity the stock solution was diluted in 20 l of sterile endotoxin free water to achieve an initial endotoxin concentration of 300 eu ml control samples n 3 were collected from the source tank and or from a sample port prior to the heating stage of the heat exchanger treated samples 3 ml were collected from the sampling ports after the sample passed through the microchannel uht pasteurizer replicate samples n 3 of each processing treatment were collected approximately 30 s apart samples were cooled to 4 c and held for up to 18 h prior to endotoxin quantification 2 4 endotoxin quantification endotoxin concentration in water samples was determined using the pyrogent 5000 kinetic turbidimetric lal assay catalog n383 lonza basel switzerland according to manufacturer s instructions this kit is based on limulus amoebocyte lysate reaction in a 96 well plate format with measurements at 340 nm collected as a time series on a spectrophotometric plate reader filtermax f5 molecular devices san jose ca for samples with endotoxin concentrations exceeding the upper quantification limit 100 eu ml these were diluted 10 fold in endotoxin free water prior to analysis endotoxin concentrations were calculated with reference to the standard curve prepared on the same 96 well plate endotoxin concentrations were converted to log eu ml and reductions for a particular treatment were calculated by subtracting the log converted concentrations of the treated samples from the control samples 2 5 statistical analysis data were analyzed using jmp pro version 16 sas institute cary nc log reductions of endotoxin at different temperatures or different flow rates were analyzed using a one way anova tukey hsd procedure was used to determine the difference among mean values and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion this study was designed to evaluate whether a microchannel uht pasteurizer could be effective in medical devices that require strict sterility such as preparation of dialysate for dialysis treatments and during formulation of intravenous medications the original microchannel pasteurizer device design 29 was modified to be more cost effective and to improve its performance in the microscale range generally 1 mm and support processing at elevated temperatures up to 230 c and pressures up to 3 10 mpa and increased flow rates up to 400 ml min the advantage of these modifications are a function of the increased surface area to volume ratio these changes support reductions of several orders of magnitude in overall device size allowing for efficient packaging configurations reduced material costs and modularized and mobile devices previously constrained by size and weight limitations 35 36 pseudomonas endotoxin was used as the target for demonstrating efficacy of the pasteurization treatment it has been reported that endotoxin contamination may be used as a surrogate marker for the quality of ultra purified water as their presence is an indication for contamination with gram negative and other infectious agents 37 different temperature pressure and flow rate ranges were evaluated to identify the targeted combination that could achieve 2 log eu ml reduction of endotoxin in water initial studies targeted the impact of increasing temperature 150 200 c on endotoxin inactivation in water using the pressurized microfluidic heat exchanger table 1 at a flow rate of 300 ml min the pasteurization treatment achieved minimal endotoxin reduction 0 25 log eu ml at both 150 c and 167 c endotoxin inactivation increased to 0 53 log eu ml at 184 c however increasing the temperature to 200 c resulted in significantly improved endotoxin reduction 1 50 log eu ml p 0 05 the impact of flow rate 100 300 ml min on endotoxin reduction was evaluated at 200 c fig 3 increasing the flow rate at this temperature 200 c was inversely correlated with endotoxin reduction treatment of endotoxin containing water at 200 c 1 65 mpa using a flow rate of 100 ml min approached but did not achieve the 2 log eu ml reduction target of the endotoxins in treated water a further increase in the temperature pressure 230 c 3 10 mpa resulted in 3 8 log eu ml reduction of endotoxin activity after treatment at all flow rates 100 400 ml min endotoxins are generally considered heat stable as they are not destroyed by standard heat sterilization procedures moist heat sterilization 121 c 20 min results in minimal inactivation 1 log reduction of endotoxin in aqueous solutions 16 17 more extreme moist heat sterilization 145 c for 40 min 167 c for 10 min was required to achieve 3 log reduction of endotoxins in solutions 17 soft hydrothermal processing has been used by miyamoto et al 18 to achieve efficient inactivation of endotoxins 3 log reduction in aqueous solutions with treatments at 130 c for 60 min and at 140 c for 30 min with saturated steam these combinations of pressurized heat and extensive holding times suggest that thermal treatment for endotoxin destruction would be impractical for most high throughput or continuous flow applications however the microfluidic heat exchanger can efficiently and continuously process aqueous solutions at high temperatures pressures 230 c 3 10 mpa that achieves 3 log reduction with very short holding times 0 6 s for a flow rate 400 ml min a proposed explanation for the efficacy of pressurized pasteurization is a function of the reversible solvent properties of water under elevated temperature and pressure that may support reactions with the lipid a moiety of endotoxin leading to inactivation 38 findings from this study demonstrate the potential utility of a pressurized microfluidic pasteurizer to inactivate endotoxins in aqueous solutions using very short exposure times in a continuous flow system these findings are supported by a prior study by li et al 38 that determined and modeled e coli o113 h10 endotoxin inactivation kinetics in condensed high temperature water 210 270 c 6 2 mpa calculated decimal reduction values d values for e coli o113 h10 endotoxin were 0 67 s and 0 23 s at 230 c and 250 c respectively while the necessary dwell time to achieve sufficient endotoxin reduction is within seconds the current work reports increased endotoxin inactivation at 230 c this relative increase in endotoxin inactivation could be impacted by differences attributable to pressure and its impact on water properties equipment design and performance and or differences in specific endotoxin resistance additional research would be necessary to evaluate their relative impact on endotoxin inactivation 4 conclusion the efficacy of a pressurized microfluidic pasteurizer heat exchanger in achieving the sterility assurance level of dialysis water 2 log reduction of endotoxin was investigated results from this study revealed that endotoxins can be inactivated at temperatures of 200 c and higher at relatively high flow rates i e short exposure times at 200 c 1 65 mpa there was an inverse correlation between the flow rate and endotoxin reduction indicating the relevance of time as an important parameter at this temperature however at 230 c 3 10 mpa endotoxin inactivation 3 log eu ml was accomplished at all flow rates 100 400 ml min further supporting the critical importance of temperature this work demonstrated the potential of the pressurized

the log converted concentrations of the treated samples from the control samples 2 5 statistical analysis data were analyzed using jmp pro version 16 sas institute cary nc log reductions of endotoxin at different temperatures or different flow rates were analyzed using a one way anova tukey hsd procedure was used to determine the difference among mean values and differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion this study was designed to evaluate whether a microchannel uht pasteurizer could be effective in medical devices that require strict sterility such as preparation of dialysate for dialysis treatments and during formulation of intravenous medications the original microchannel pasteurizer device design 29 was modified to be more cost effective and to improve its performance in the microscale range generally 1 mm and support processing at elevated temperatures up to 230 c and pressures up to 3 10 mpa and increased flow rates up to 400 ml min the advantage of these modifications are a function of the increased surface area to volume ratio these changes support reductions of several orders of magnitude in overall device size allowing for efficient packaging configurations reduced material costs and modularized and mobile devices previously constrained by size and weight limitations 35 36 pseudomonas endotoxin was used as the target for demonstrating efficacy of the pasteurization treatment it has been reported that endotoxin contamination may be used as a surrogate marker for the quality of ultra purified water as their presence is an indication for contamination with gram negative and other infectious agents 37 different temperature pressure and flow rate ranges were evaluated to identify the targeted combination that could achieve 2 log eu ml reduction of endotoxin in water initial studies targeted the impact of increasing temperature 150 200 c on endotoxin inactivation in water using the pressurized microfluidic heat exchanger table 1 at a flow rate of 300 ml min the pasteurization treatment achieved minimal endotoxin reduction 0 25 log eu ml at both 150 c and 167 c endotoxin inactivation increased to 0 53 log eu ml at 184 c however increasing the temperature to 200 c resulted in significantly improved endotoxin reduction 1 50 log eu ml p 0 05 the impact of flow rate 100 300 ml min on endotoxin reduction was evaluated at 200 c fig 3 increasing the flow rate at this temperature 200 c was inversely correlated with endotoxin reduction treatment of endotoxin containing water at 200 c 1 65 mpa using a flow rate of 100 ml min approached but did not achieve the 2 log eu ml reduction target of the endotoxins in treated water a further increase in the temperature pressure 230 c 3 10 mpa resulted in 3 8 log eu ml reduction of endotoxin activity after treatment at all flow rates 100 400 ml min endotoxins are generally considered heat stable as they are not destroyed by standard heat sterilization procedures moist heat sterilization 121 c 20 min results in minimal inactivation 1 log reduction of endotoxin in aqueous solutions 16 17 more extreme moist heat sterilization 145 c for 40 min 167 c for 10 min was required to achieve 3 log reduction of endotoxins in solutions 17 soft hydrothermal processing has been used by miyamoto et al 18 to achieve efficient inactivation of endotoxins 3 log reduction in aqueous solutions with treatments at 130 c for 60 min and at 140 c for 30 min with saturated steam these combinations of pressurized heat and extensive holding times suggest that thermal treatment for endotoxin destruction would be impractical for most high throughput or continuous flow applications however the microfluidic heat exchanger can efficiently and continuously process aqueous solutions at high temperatures pressures 230 c 3 10 mpa that achieves 3 log reduction with very short holding times 0 6 s for a flow rate 400 ml min a proposed explanation for the efficacy of pressurized pasteurization is a function of the reversible solvent properties of water under elevated temperature and pressure that may support reactions with the lipid a moiety of endotoxin leading to inactivation 38 findings from this study demonstrate the potential utility of a pressurized microfluidic pasteurizer to inactivate endotoxins in aqueous solutions using very short exposure times in a continuous flow system these findings are supported by a prior study by li et al 38 that determined and modeled e coli o113 h10 endotoxin inactivation kinetics in condensed high temperature water 210 270 c 6 2 mpa calculated decimal reduction values d values for e coli o113 h10 endotoxin were 0 67 s and 0 23 s at 230 c and 250 c respectively while the necessary dwell time to achieve sufficient endotoxin reduction is within seconds the current work reports increased endotoxin inactivation at 230 c this relative increase in endotoxin inactivation could be impacted by differences attributable to pressure and its impact on water properties equipment design and performance and or differences in specific endotoxin resistance additional research would be necessary to evaluate their relative impact on endotoxin inactivation 4 conclusion the efficacy of a pressurized microfluidic pasteurizer heat exchanger in achieving the sterility assurance level of dialysis water 2 log reduction of endotoxin was investigated results from this study revealed that endotoxins can be inactivated at temperatures of 200 c and higher at relatively high flow rates i e short exposure times at 200 c 1 65 mpa there was an inverse correlation between the flow rate and endotoxin reduction indicating the relevance of time as an important parameter at this temperature however at 230 c 3 10 mpa endotoxin inactivation 3 log eu ml was accomplished at all flow rates 100 400 ml min further supporting the critical importance of temperature this work demonstrated the potential of the pressurized

12959,in this paper a special sandwich structure of the pan go sio2 microfiltration membrane was developed using the electrospinning electrospraying method for efficient oil water separation the results of morphological and structural studies confirmed that spraying sio2 nanoparticles nps to the outer surface of pan go nanofibers nfs increased the surface roughness and decreased the water contact angle value which is responsible for the improved hydrophilicity moreover the addition of sio2 nps to the middle layer enhanced the porosity and the membrane flux up to 78 and 423 7 7 1 l m2 h respectively the values of oil water rejections indicated the good performance of the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane results supported that the presence of sio2 nps with a hydrophilic nature led to

graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords electrospinning pan nanofibers graphene oxide oil water separation sio2 nanoparticles 1 introduction oily wastewater treatments play a key role in the environment and human health 1 oil contaminants in water have different categories in drop size among them nano and micro sized oil droplets named emulsified oil 20 μm have the most difficulty with separation from water using common separation methods 2 3 filtration by nanofibers has found a special place in emulsified oil water separation due to its ease of fabrication integrated morphological features and cost effectiveness compared to other water treatment methods 4 6 in recent decades the electrospinning technique has received much attention as an appropriate method to synthesize nfs with a high and effective specific surface 7 8 on the other hand contrary to all the methods employing mechanical force for extrusion electrospinning is considered because of the simplicity of using electrostatic force in the direct production of nfs from a polymer solution or melt 9 11 the produced nanofiber membranes can show high flux as well as low energy cost in emulsion separation 12 13 polyacrylonitrile pan is one of the most important synthetic polymeric nfs that has been extensively used as a high performance membrane for eliminating various pollutions from water 14 15 features such as lightweight high tensile strength and good resistance to external exposure and chemicals were interesting 16 17 however pure pan nfs are not very efficient at removing contaminants the oil fouling usually leads to a severe reduction in separation efficiency because oil blocks the membrane channels during oil water separation to solve this problem different strategies like mixing with nano materials using hydrophilic coating or surface modification have been developed 18 19 the addition of inorganic materials having the potential for surface modification can alter the surface properties of the membrane properties like wettability and roughness can be modified which are responsible for the enhanced hydrophilicity and less fouling during the separation process 2 to that end sio2 nanoparticles nps particularly for their low cost and ease of use can provide more hydrophilicity 20 and oil unfouling properties allowing the composite membrane to be benefited from the appropriate water flux and oil rejection 12 21 22 graphene oxide go and its derivatives are widely used in the fabrication of membranes for oil water separation 23 the integration of go into polymeric materials has several potential advantages including an increase in the mechanical strength permeability selectivity and antifouling properties 24 despite these properties pure go membranes usually have low flux levels and low stability during water treatment 25 which is undesirable in the separation and purification process to deal with this organic and inorganic species have been intercalated into the adjacent layers of the go membranes 26 27 thus many recent studies have focused on developing go based composite membranes 24 28 29 go based membranes involving nps with optimal pore structure and excellent surface properties are essential to increase their surface performance 30 because of its widespread use as a cost effective material in the fabrication of hydrophilic hydrophobic surfaces sio2 is placed at the center of special interest simultaneously the existence of sio2 nps acts as a reinforcing agent where the mechanical and thermal properties of the membranes can be modified as well 20 32 to meet the problem of membrane fouling the hydrophilic oleo phobic variant is beginning to receive a lot of attention from researchers where high hydrophilicity along with hierarchical surface morphology is the main cause of water passing through the membrane in the present study we have fabricated a new structure of pan sio2 go pan sio2 membrane with a flexible design of go sio2 and sio2 electrosprays which are layered as a special sandwich structure this can provide a further hierarchical structure to the excellent hydrophilic interface that increases the potential of enhancing the flux and antifouling performance of membranes steps for fabrication of the membrane were as follows first an electrospun layer of pan was prepared in the second stage the intercalation of go and sio2 nps was performed with the help of ultra sonication treatment and then electro spraying of go sio2 nano hybrid was carried out on the sublayer made from the previous stage in the third step a thin layer of pan was electrospun on the go sio2 substrate finally the decorated sio2 nps were created using the electrospray technique fig 1 shows an overview of what has been done in this work the fabricated nfs were used in water surfactant free and surfactant stabilized emulsified oil separation and high separation fluxes were obtained at low driving pressures along with the desired antifouling and reusability indicating promising utility for the next generation of energy saving water treatment systems 2 experimental section 2 1 materials pan pan mw of 150 000 was

mixture of hno3 and h2so4 1 3 v v at room temperature and stirred for 24 h the obtained slurry was heated to evaporated the acid the residual powder was dispersed in h2so4 in an ice bath followed by the slow addition of kmno4 6 g the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h then hydrogen peroxide solution 10 v v was added to the resulting mixture drop wise until the color of the mixture turned to light yellow finally the suspension was washed with deionized water several times until the ph of the suspended precipitates in pure water became neutral and dried in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature 2 3 preparation of go sio2 suspension 0 1 g of go and 0 1 g of sio2 nps 1 1 g g ratio were added to 2 5 ml dmf and sonicated for 2 h accordingly a homogenous electrospinning go sio2 precursor was obtained also a series of go sio2 suspensions in 3 1 and 1 3 g g ratios were prepared in dmf using the same way as mentioned earlier 2 4 fabrication of the membranes a solution of pan 9 wt in dmf was used for electrospinning as the base layer the syringe needle g19 was employed for electrospinning at a distance of 150 mm from the tip collector the working voltage of electrospinning feed rate fr and temperature were adjusted at 25 kv 0 8 ml h and 35 c respectively sio2 and go suspensions were prepared in dmf separately and then mixed together for the purpose of electrospray as the middle layer at this stage the applied voltage temperature tip collector distance and fr were 30 kv 35 c 100 mm and 2 ml h respectively the next layer in the membrane structure was deposited by electrospinning of pan solution with the same procedure as that of the first stage for 5 min to fabricate the final layer the dispersed sio2 nps in 2 5 ml of dmf and 0 5 ml of 9 wt pan solution were electrosprayed under the same electrospinning conditions as that of the second stage the assembled nfs were dried at 50 c for 1 day a schematic representation of the fabrication process was given in fig 1 it is worth mentioning that the electrospinning process was performed in relative humidity of 55 60 2 5 apparatus characterizations the uv vis spectrophotometer unico 4802 double beam was used to detect the concentration of residual oil in the permeate solution during the experiments the surface morphology of prepared nfs was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem mira iii czech and transmission electron microscopy tem the crystallographic structure of sio2 nps and go sheets were investigated using an x ray diffractometer xrd x pert pro philips holland and fourier transforms infrared spectrometry ftir 4300 shimatso japan also the carbon structures were characterized using raman spectroscopy handheld raman analyzer firstguard rigaku atomic force microscopy afm daulscope tm ds 95 was used to investigate surface topography and nanometric roughness the porosity of the go sio2 nanohybrid was measured via n2 adsorption desorption studies using a belsorp mini machine japan to this end 0 1 g of sample was placed in the special glass cell and degassed under vacuum in 104 c for 6 h dynamic light scattering dls malvern zetasizer nano s90 was used to determine the size distribution of oil droplets in the solutions an optical microscope optika b383pli italy was used to magnify the image of droplet size at last underwater oil contact angle uoca and water contact angle wca measurements were conducted using a jikan20 instrument iran to obtain the contact angle of oil drop underwater with a solid surface or water drop in the air through these analyses the degree of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity or tendency to absorb liquids other than water oil on the surface can be studied the mechanical properties of membrane were evaluated using a tensile test instrument stm 20 santam iran 2 6 the membrane porosity porosity is an important parameter for the characterization of membranes overall porosity of the membranes ɛ was measured using the gravimetric method according to the following equation 32 1 ε w 2 w 1 ρ w la 100 where w2 and w1 represent the weight of wet and dry membranes g ρw is water density 0 998 g cm3 the wet membrane is allowed to soak in water for 4 h l and a are the thickness cm and the effective surface area 28 cm2 respectively the mean pore size rm of the membranes was computed using guerout elford ferry equation 33 34 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 μlq εa p where μ represents the viscosity of water 8 9 10 4 pa s ɛ l and q are the porosity of the membranes thickness and the volume of permeated water per unit time cm3 s δp is the applied pressure 105 pa also the maximum pore size rmax was obtained from the bubble point method in this method the membrane was fitted to the testing setup after being immersed in distilled water for 4 h as shown in fig 8c with a gradual increase in pressure of nitrogen gas over time the first stable bubble flows into the liquid column and is recorded by substituting this pressure in eq 3 the diameter of the largest hole maximum pore size in the membrane was calculated 37 3 r max 2 σ cos θ p where σ θ and p represent the water surface tension 72 80 10 3 n m the water contact angle on the membrane and the minimum bubble point pressure respectively 2 7 oil water emulsion separation the surfactant free oil water solution 1000 ppm was stirred at 1200 rpm for 2 h to reach a steady state milky solution the emulsions including toluene water sunflower oil water and pump oil water were prepared separately and used as testing feeds sds and tween 80 were used 0 2 mg ml for preparing the surfactant stabilized oil water emulsions to produce homogeneous emulsions the prepared solutions were stirred at 1200 rpm for 2 h the conventional dead end cell was used for emulsion separation tests fig 1b to investigate the properties of hydraulic permeability the flux j was obtained using the following equation 35 4 j v a t where j shows pure water flux across the membrane and v a and δt represent the permeated water volume l membrane effective area 0 0028 m2 and time h respectively also to compute the separation efficiency of the oil water emulsions the following equation was used 36 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent the oil concentrations in the permeate and feed solutions analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy moreover the antifouling property of the membranes is indicated using flux recovery ratio frr 37 6 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw2 and jw1 are the pure water flux after membrane regenerating washed with hcl 0 1 m and pure water 3 times and before the oil removal experiment the filtration and flux measurement tests were repeated 3 times an analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the different results considering a p value 0 05 as significant 3 results discussion 3 1 chemical characterization of go sio2 fig 2a indicates the xrd patterns of go and go sio2 the xrd pattern of go exhibits a sharp peak at 2θ 8 3 d spacing of 0 53 nm and weak broad bond appeared at 2θ 20 which can be attributed to the short range order of go in the graphene like sheets go sio2 xrd pattern exhibited two peaks at 2θ 8 6 d spacing of 0 51 nm and 22 6 30 38 this confirms that the sio2 nps have been integrated into the layer of go nano sheets and that the interlayer spacing decreases when go transforms into go sio2 from 0 53 to 0 51 nm according to the ftir spectra fig 2c of go two characteristic peaks at 1747 and 3420 cm 1 can be recognized this verifies that different hydrophilic functional groups are attached to go 39 also the broad band at about 2929 1642 and 1050 cm 1 were due to ch and co stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group and co stretching vibration of the alkoxide group 40 several new peaks appeared at 1097 855 and 797 cm 1 which are associated with the si oh stretching vibrations symmetric si o si vibrations and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o c si o si with the addition of sio2 the intensity of carboxylic group vibration decreased however a significant increase is observed in the relative intensity of the band at 1050 cm 1 which is consistent with the co stretching vibration of the alkoxide group it should be noted that the vibrations of the carboxylic co stretching and the alkoxy co stretching observed in the ftir spectra are primarily because of the various functional groups located at the go sheet edges raman spectroscopy is a useful way to describe the carbon skeleton variations on the go as displayed in fig 2b the raman spectra of go and sio2 go display two characteristic peaks at 1366 and 1603 cm 1 which can be attributed to the presence of d band disordered sp3 carbon structure and defects within the hexagonal graphitic structure and g band deriving from sp2 characteristic of graphitic sheets structure in the synthesized nano hybrid 41 there are significant changes in the relative strength of the d and g bands for go go sio2 without changing their positions or deformation a larger id ig ratio indicates more defects in graphite structures which is due to the existence of sio2 nps similar results have been reported by the researchers 42 furthermore the increased relative intensity of the g band in the pan go sio2 system refers to the fact that go sio2 is deposited on pan surfaces through some non covalent bonds by considering the above observations a schematic representation of the solution path through the membrane layers is proposed in fig 2d 3 2 membranes morphology characterization electrospun nfs are characterized using fesem analysis fig 3 the images are taken from the surface and the cross section of nfs the average diameter of nfs is obtained by analyzing the images with an image analyzing software image j as a result the average diameter of produced electrospun nfs lie between 190 and 300 nm fig 3c shows the frequency of electrospun pan diameter fig 3f from the top vision of nfs show that pan go pan has a uniform and beadles structure and that the electrospray surface of pan sio2 go pan sio2 has the uniform distribution of nps on the desired surface fig 3i the cross sectional images fig 3d g that the electrospun fibers have uniform thickness and suitable porosity in their structures suggesting that the used fabrication procedure is an ideal method to produce pan based hybrid membranes also it can be implied that by adding sio2 nps to the middle layer the density of the layer is decreased on the other hand images taken from the top surface of nfs exhibit that electrospray sio2 on the surface increases the surface roughness which is an important character of a membrane for a more detailed study about the morphology of go sio2 nano hybrids tem images are obtained and presented in fig 4 in the tem images go sheets are seen as large crumpled thin plates with scattered nps the edx patterns confirm the existence of si o and n elements in the nfs fig 5 and demonstrate the successful incorporation of sio2 into pan sio2 go pan sio2 3 3 membranes topography afm analysis is used to investigate the surface topology and explore the effect of electrosprayed sio2 nps on the surface roughness fig 6 and fig s1 in the supporting information show the afm 3d images of pan sio2 go pan and pan sio2 go pan sio2 membranes by comparing the images the increase in valleys and peak height by adding the nps is considerable also according to the values of arithmetical mean deviation of profile ra and average roughness sa which are included in table 1 the average surface roughness of pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane 0 310 0 023 μm is higher than that of pan go sio2 pan 0 171 0 015 μm membrane it may be owing to the impact of sio2 electrospraying to enhance the surface protrusion that indeed improves hydrophilicity and wettability 20 43 this can decrease the adhesion of oil and improve the antifouling properties of the membrane resulting in efficient oil water separation 3 4 membranes wettability wca is considered to be one of the important quantities for measuring the wettability rate contact angle analysis is performed for the pan go pan pan go sio2 pan and pan go sio2 pan sio2 nfs the corresponding images from the wca tests are shown in fig 7 a it is demonstrated that adding sio2 to go increases the membrane s water affinity and hydrophilicity as expected the go sheets and sio2 nps are responsible for expelling oil droplets from the surface as confirmed by afm analysis the addition of sio2 nps to the outermost layer creates a hierarchical structure fig 7b shows the direct contact of oil droplets with the membranes underwater the inner underwater contact angle of the membrane is θ over 90 it means perfect filtration which is expected to be primarily higher since it permits a high operation pressure that is considered to be essential for raising the permeate flux 44 the hierarchical structure of the surface that is composed of fine nps sio2 allows for achieving high uoca in the membranes which permits water to remain inside the individual fibers this reduces the oil contact surface and reveals an oleophobicity nature fig 7b 2 43 3 5 porosity of the membranes membrane surface porosity is one of the most influential elements in the optimal final performance of the membranes accordingly the porosity and mean pore size have been calculated and the results are displayed in fig 8 fig 8a and table 2 show the go and go sio2 n2 adsorption desorption diagrams and details from the comparison of the graphs it can be seen that inclusion of sio2 to go increases the existing porosity and the amount of gas adsorbed additionally the porosity of all the membranes lies between 68 and 80 fig 8b the porosity of pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane is determined to be 78 while the corresponding value is 68 for pan go pan membrane this is assigned to the existence of sio2 nps in the middle layer the porosity and pore size information of the produced nfs are listed in table 3 the decreased porosity occurs with the addition of sio2 onto the surface since the total solid content increased on the other hand when sio2 nps are added to the surface a looser skin layer induced a decrease in bubble point pressure 45 3 6 mechanical properties the mechanical properties of pan sio2 go pan sio2 was investigated by tensile test furthermore the data were compared with those for pan and other reported electrospun nanofiber membranes used in oil water separation fig s2 and table s1 highlight the tensile behavior of the membranes according to fig s2 the pan sio2 go pan sio2 membrane has a much higher tensile strength compared to pristine pan the sio2 go middle layer improved tensile strength from 3 02 to 10 33 mpa however its elongation at break decreases and shows a brittle behavior compared to pan which results in increase in young s modulus table s1 3 7 evaluation of filtration performance the separation of oil water emulsion by the produced membranes is carried out under the force of gravity the filtration performance of pan go sio2 pan sio2 with different weight percentages of go sio2 with the same pan ratio in the passage of distilled water is presented in fig 9a by comparing the fluxes it can be observed that the 1 1 w w percent composition has the highest output flux of distilled water from the membrane 211 7 2 6 l m2 h this may be interpreted in terms of the go content when a larger amount of go than sio2 in a 3 1 ratio is used in the membrane composition it enables the go nano plates to stick together and reduce the flux moreover it causes some problems like inconsistency clogging of the syringe needle during electrospinning and phase separation during the electrospinning proses on the other hand a higher amount of sio2 than go in a 3 1 ratio is likely to clog pores which result in a reduced flux 21 0 0 5 l m2 h the efficiency of different membranes in separating various oils including toluene sunflower oil and pump oil is evaluated and the results are presented in fig 9b based on the comparison of oil rejection rates pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane showed high capability in oil rejection and had better performance for removing toluene in water 98 7 0 9 anova was carried out and shown that the membranes have significant performance in oils rejection table s2 as shown in fig 9c and compared to the non surfactant emulsion the rejection for toluene surfactant system is slightly decreased sds stabilized to 89 9 1 5 and tween80 stabilized to 93 99 1 2 this can be ascribed to the adsorption of surfactants on in the membranes and the surfactant micelles block the pores leading to the flux to be declined in this respect surfactants act as foulants during membrane filtration which can raise their resistance to water permeation 46 47 fig 10 shows the flux passing surfactant free stabilized oils through pan go pan pan go sio2 pan and pan go sio2 pan sio2 membranes the efficiency of the different membranes has been compared by obtaining the emulsified oil flux fig 10a according to the plots the pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane has a higher flux for passing toluene 423 7 7 1 l m2 h compared to the pan go sio2 pan membrane 118 5 3 5 l m2 h which is owing to the existence of hydrophilic sio2 nps on the membrane surface 48 also the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane showed better toluene flux than the pan go pan membrane 54 7 1 5 l m2 h this can be attributed to the inclusion of sio2 nps between go nano sheets table 4 reports the results specifically on flux obtained from the optimal membrane produced in this work with those reported in the literature the optimal membrane of pan go sio2 pan sio2 assembled in this study showed an acceptable oil water flux at low driving force and without external pressure compared to other membranes with similar compositions to evaluate the usability of the membranes the water flux test has been repeated after passing the oil water by comparing the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes fig 10b it is concluded that the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane has the best result 80 1 2 1 after toluene water separation also surfactant free emulsified toluene is used for 12 cycles after three cycles the membrane is washed with hcl 0 1 m and pure water three times and then used on the reverse surface for subsequent separation the results are represented in fig 10c according to the results the membrane showed a very low flux loss after 12 cycles indicating its good anti fouling and performance apparently sio2 nps prevent oil from contacting the surface by forming a hydrophilic thin layer on the membrane surface and making a hydration layer 43 44 in the fouling resistant mechanism water molecules prove closely bound to the hydrophilic surface creating a hydration layer that stops oil from contacting the surface and facilitates the release of adsorbed oil 44 49 therefore the membrane with better surface hydrophilicity has better regeneration properties and in turn a larger amount of frr 34 as fig 10d presented pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 shows a high flux for treating surfactant free emulsified toluene at the beginning and it has a reduction in 120 s because of the intermediate pore blocking during filtration oil particles are carried by the liquid towards the filter and then block in the pores of the membrane 50 51 on the other hand with prolonged filtration time more oil droplets accumulate on the membrane surface leading to the formation of a cake layer that can be densely packed and shows high resistance to water permeation by stirring the suspension above the membranes oil droplets in the cake layer become thermodynamically unstable and tend to coalesce 44 in some research the surface roughness of the membrane facilitates the formation of larger oil droplets that are more easily removed by stirring 52 53 therefore penetration through the membrane will be decreased and integration of oil droplets reduces the membrane fouling finally the toluene water suspension is sonicated for 15 min before passing through the membranes and after that optical microscopy images are collected to gain information about the droplet size fig 11a further details about the droplet size are also obtained using dls tests in dmf before and after separation and results presented in fig 11b as it can be seen in fig 11 the droplet size of toluene in water before separation is mainly distributed around 1 9 μm no oil droplets are observed in the electron microscopy image after separation the dls curve also confirms the disappearance of oil micro scale droplets these results indicate the excellent efficiency of the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane for the microscale oil droplets separation from water in the oily wastewater treatments 4 conclusions in summary special sandwich hydrophilic structure membranes based on pan electrospun substrates ultra thin go nanostructures and sio2 nps are screened for water oil treatment according to various morphological analyses such as fesem tem afm wca and uoca insights into the mechanism of solution passage through the interlayer nano channels of go sio2 nps are obtained in the antifouling mechanism of the membranes the molecules of water compose a hydration layer stopping oil from contacting the surface also based on oil rejection tests it is found that the type of oil and surfactant has an important impact on the separation performance the highest percentage of rejection belongs to free surfactant toluene emulsion r 98 finally a series of data is presented on the performance of membrane separation all data indicate good performance of pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane and the positive roles of go and sio2 nps on increasing oil flux and rejection declaration of competing

separation from water using common separation methods 2 3 filtration by nanofibers has found a special place in emulsified oil water separation due to its ease of fabrication integrated morphological features and cost effectiveness compared to other water treatment methods 4 6 in recent decades the electrospinning technique has received much attention as an appropriate method to synthesize nfs with a high and effective specific surface 7 8 on the other hand contrary to all the methods employing mechanical force for extrusion electrospinning is considered because of the simplicity of using electrostatic force in the direct production of nfs from a polymer solution or melt 9 11 the produced nanofiber membranes can show high flux as well as low energy cost in emulsion separation 12 13 polyacrylonitrile pan is one of the most important synthetic polymeric nfs that has been extensively used as a high performance membrane for eliminating various pollutions from water 14 15 features such as lightweight high tensile strength and good resistance to external exposure and chemicals were interesting 16 17 however pure pan nfs are not very efficient at removing contaminants the oil fouling usually leads to a severe reduction in separation efficiency because oil blocks the membrane channels during oil water separation to solve this problem different strategies like mixing with nano materials using hydrophilic coating or surface modification have been developed 18 19 the addition of inorganic materials having the potential for surface modification can alter the surface properties of the membrane properties like wettability and roughness can be modified which are responsible for the enhanced hydrophilicity and less fouling during the separation process 2 to that end sio2 nanoparticles nps particularly for their low cost and ease of use can provide more hydrophilicity 20 and oil unfouling properties allowing the composite membrane to be benefited from the appropriate water flux and oil rejection 12 21 22 graphene oxide go and its derivatives are widely used in the fabrication of membranes for oil water separation 23 the integration of go into polymeric materials has several potential advantages including an increase in the mechanical strength permeability selectivity and antifouling properties 24 despite these properties pure go membranes usually have low flux levels and low stability during water treatment 25 which is undesirable in the separation and purification process to deal with this organic and inorganic species have been intercalated into the adjacent layers of the go membranes 26 27 thus many recent studies have focused on developing go based composite membranes 24 28 29 go based membranes involving nps with optimal pore structure and excellent surface properties are essential to increase their surface performance 30 because of its widespread use as a cost effective material in the fabrication of hydrophilic hydrophobic surfaces sio2 is placed at the center of special interest simultaneously the existence of sio2 nps acts as a reinforcing agent where the mechanical and thermal properties of the membranes can be modified as well 20 32 to meet the problem of membrane fouling the hydrophilic oleo phobic variant is beginning to receive a lot of attention from researchers where high hydrophilicity along with hierarchical surface morphology is the main cause of water passing through the membrane in the present study we have fabricated a new structure of pan sio2 go pan sio2 membrane with a flexible design of go sio2 and sio2 electrosprays which are layered as a special sandwich structure this can provide a further hierarchical structure to the excellent hydrophilic interface that increases the potential of enhancing the flux and antifouling performance of membranes steps for fabrication of the membrane were as follows first an electrospun layer of pan was prepared in the second stage the intercalation of go and sio2 nps was performed with the help of ultra sonication treatment and then electro spraying of go sio2 nano hybrid was carried out on the sublayer made from the previous stage in the third step a thin layer of pan was electrospun on the go sio2 substrate finally the decorated sio2 nps were created using the electrospray technique fig 1 shows an overview of what has been done in this work the fabricated nfs were used in water surfactant free and surfactant stabilized emulsified oil separation and high separation fluxes were obtained at low driving pressures along with the desired antifouling and reusability indicating promising utility for the next generation of energy saving water treatment systems 2 experimental section 2 1 materials pan pan mw of 150 000 was

mixture of hno3 and h2so4 1 3 v v at room temperature and stirred for 24 h the obtained slurry was heated to evaporated the acid the residual powder was dispersed in h2so4 in an ice bath followed by the slow addition of kmno4 6 g the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h then hydrogen peroxide solution 10 v v was added to the resulting mixture drop wise until the color of the mixture turned to light yellow finally the suspension was washed with deionized water several times until the ph of the suspended precipitates in pure water became neutral and dried in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature 2 3 preparation of go sio2 suspension 0 1 g of go and 0 1 g of sio2 nps 1 1 g g ratio were added to 2 5 ml dmf and sonicated for 2 h accordingly a homogenous electrospinning go sio2 precursor was obtained also a series of go sio2 suspensions in 3 1 and 1 3 g g ratios were prepared in dmf using the same way as mentioned earlier 2 4 fabrication of the membranes a solution of pan 9 wt in dmf was used for electrospinning as the base layer the syringe needle g19 was employed for electrospinning at a distance of 150 mm from the tip collector the working voltage of electrospinning

and water contact angle wca measurements were conducted using a jikan20 instrument iran to obtain the contact angle of oil drop underwater with a solid surface or water drop in the air through these analyses the degree of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity or tendency to absorb liquids other than water oil on the surface can be studied the mechanical properties of membrane were evaluated using a tensile test instrument stm 20 santam iran 2 6 the membrane porosity porosity is an important parameter for the characterization of membranes overall porosity of the membranes ɛ was measured using the gravimetric method according to the following equation 32 1 ε w 2 w 1 ρ w la 100 where w2 and w1 represent the weight of wet and dry membranes g ρw is water density 0 998 g cm3 the wet membrane is allowed to soak in water for 4 h l and a are the thickness cm and the effective surface area 28 cm2 respectively the mean pore size rm of the membranes was computed using guerout elford ferry equation 33 34 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 μlq εa p where μ represents the viscosity of water 8 9 10 4 pa s ɛ l and q are the porosity of the membranes thickness and the volume of permeated water per unit time cm3 s δp is the applied pressure 105 pa also the maximum pore size rmax was obtained from the bubble point method in this method the membrane was fitted to the testing setup after being immersed in distilled water for 4 h as shown in fig 8c with a gradual increase in pressure of nitrogen gas over time the first stable bubble flows into the liquid column and is recorded by substituting this pressure in eq 3 the diameter of the largest hole maximum pore size in the membrane was calculated 37 3 r max 2 σ cos θ p where σ θ and p represent the water surface tension 72 80 10 3 n m the water contact angle on the membrane and the minimum bubble point pressure respectively 2 7 oil water emulsion separation the surfactant free oil water solution 1000 ppm was stirred at 1200 rpm for 2 h to reach a steady state milky solution the emulsions including toluene water sunflower oil water and pump oil water were prepared separately and used as testing feeds sds and tween 80 were used 0 2 mg ml for preparing the surfactant stabilized oil water emulsions to produce homogeneous emulsions the prepared solutions were stirred at 1200 rpm for 2 h the conventional dead end cell was used for emulsion separation tests fig 1b to investigate the properties of hydraulic permeability the flux j was obtained using the following equation 35 4 j v a t where j shows pure water flux across the membrane and v a and δt represent the permeated water volume l membrane effective area 0 0028 m2 and time h respectively also to compute the separation efficiency of the oil water emulsions the following equation was used 36 5 r 1 c p c f 100 where cp and cf represent the oil concentrations in the permeate and feed solutions analyzed by uv vis spectroscopy moreover the antifouling property of the membranes is indicated using flux recovery ratio frr 37 6 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 where jw2 and jw1 are the pure water flux after membrane regenerating washed with hcl 0 1 m and pure water 3 times and before the oil removal experiment the filtration and flux measurement tests were repeated 3 times an analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the different results considering a p value 0 05 as significant 3 results discussion 3 1 chemical characterization of go sio2 fig 2a indicates the xrd patterns of go and go sio2 the xrd pattern of go exhibits a sharp peak at 2θ 8 3 d spacing of 0 53 nm and weak broad bond appeared at 2θ 20 which can be attributed to the short range order of go in the graphene like sheets go sio2 xrd pattern exhibited two peaks at 2θ 8 6 d spacing of 0 51 nm and 22 6 30 38 this confirms that the sio2 nps have been integrated into the layer of go nano sheets and that the interlayer spacing decreases when go transforms into go sio2 from 0 53 to 0 51 nm according to the ftir spectra fig 2c of go two characteristic peaks at 1747 and 3420 cm 1 can be recognized this verifies that different hydrophilic functional groups are attached to go 39 also the broad band at about 2929 1642 and 1050 cm 1 were due to ch and co stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group and co stretching vibration of the alkoxide group 40 several new peaks appeared at 1097 855 and 797 cm 1 which are associated with the si oh stretching vibrations symmetric si o si vibrations and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o c si o si with the addition of sio2 the intensity of carboxylic group vibration decreased however a significant increase is observed in the relative intensity of the band at 1050 cm 1 which is consistent with the co stretching vibration of the alkoxide group it should be noted that the vibrations of the carboxylic co stretching and the alkoxy co stretching observed in the ftir spectra are primarily because of the various functional groups located at the go sheet edges raman spectroscopy is a useful way to describe the carbon skeleton variations on the go as displayed in fig 2b the raman spectra of go and sio2 go display two characteristic peaks at 1366 and 1603 cm 1 which can be attributed to the presence of d band disordered sp3 carbon structure and defects within the hexagonal graphitic structure and g band deriving from sp2 characteristic of graphitic sheets structure in the synthesized nano hybrid 41 there are significant changes in the relative strength of the d and g bands for go go sio2 without changing their positions or deformation a larger id ig ratio indicates more defects in graphite structures which is due to the existence of sio2 nps similar results have been reported by the researchers 42 furthermore the increased relative intensity of the g band in the pan go sio2 system refers to the fact that go sio2 is deposited on pan surfaces through some non covalent bonds by considering the above observations a schematic representation of the solution path through the membrane layers is proposed in fig 2d 3 2 membranes morphology characterization electrospun nfs are characterized using fesem analysis fig 3 the images are taken from the surface and the cross section of nfs the average diameter of nfs is obtained by analyzing the images with an image analyzing software image j as a result the average diameter of produced electrospun nfs lie between 190 and 300 nm fig 3c shows the frequency of electrospun pan diameter fig 3f from the top vision of nfs show that pan go pan has a uniform and beadles structure and that the electrospray surface of pan sio2 go pan sio2 has the uniform distribution of nps on the desired surface fig 3i the cross sectional images fig 3d g that the electrospun fibers have uniform thickness and suitable porosity in their structures suggesting that the used fabrication procedure is an ideal method to produce pan based hybrid membranes also it can be implied that by adding sio2 nps to the middle layer the density of the layer is decreased on the other hand images taken from the top surface of nfs exhibit that electrospray sio2 on the surface increases the surface roughness which is an important character of a membrane for a more detailed study about the morphology of go sio2 nano hybrids tem images are obtained and presented in fig 4 in the tem images go sheets are seen as large crumpled thin plates with scattered nps the edx patterns confirm the existence of si o and n elements in the nfs fig 5 and demonstrate the successful incorporation of sio2 into pan sio2 go pan sio2 3 3 membranes topography afm analysis is used to investigate the surface topology and explore the effect of electrosprayed sio2 nps on the surface roughness fig 6 and fig s1 in the supporting information show the afm 3d images of pan sio2 go pan and pan sio2 go pan sio2 membranes by comparing the images the increase in valleys and peak height by adding the nps is considerable also according to the values of arithmetical mean deviation of profile ra and average roughness sa which are included in table 1 the average surface roughness of pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane 0 310 0 023 μm is higher than that of pan go sio2 pan 0 171 0 015 μm membrane it may be owing to the impact of sio2 electrospraying to enhance the surface protrusion that indeed improves hydrophilicity and wettability 20 43 this can decrease the adhesion of oil and improve the antifouling properties of the membrane resulting in efficient oil water separation 3 4 membranes wettability wca is considered to be one of the important quantities for measuring the wettability rate contact angle analysis is performed for the pan go pan pan go sio2 pan and pan go sio2 pan sio2 nfs the corresponding images from the wca tests are shown in fig 7 a it is demonstrated that adding sio2 to go increases the membrane s water affinity and hydrophilicity as expected the go sheets and sio2 nps are responsible for expelling oil droplets from the surface as confirmed by afm analysis the addition of sio2 nps to the outermost layer creates a hierarchical structure fig 7b shows the direct contact of oil droplets with the membranes underwater the inner underwater contact angle of the membrane is θ over 90 it means perfect filtration which is expected to be primarily higher since it permits a high operation pressure that is considered to be essential for raising the permeate flux 44 the hierarchical structure of the surface that is composed of fine nps sio2 allows for achieving high uoca in the membranes which permits water to remain inside the individual fibers this reduces the oil contact surface and reveals an oleophobicity nature fig 7b 2 43 3 5 porosity of the membranes membrane surface porosity is one of the most influential elements in the optimal final performance of the membranes accordingly the porosity and mean pore size have been calculated and the results are displayed in fig 8 fig 8a and table 2 show the go and go sio2 n2 adsorption desorption diagrams and details from the comparison of the graphs it can be seen that inclusion of sio2 to go increases the existing porosity and the amount of gas adsorbed additionally the porosity of all the membranes lies between 68 and 80 fig 8b the porosity of pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane is determined to be 78 while the corresponding value is 68 for pan go pan membrane this is assigned to the existence of sio2 nps in the middle layer the porosity and pore size information of the produced nfs are listed in table 3 the decreased porosity occurs with the addition of sio2 onto the surface since the total solid content increased on the other hand when sio2 nps are added to the surface a looser skin layer induced a decrease in bubble point pressure 45 3 6 mechanical properties the mechanical properties of pan sio2 go pan sio2 was investigated by tensile test furthermore the data were compared with those for pan and other reported electrospun nanofiber membranes used in oil water separation fig s2 and table s1 highlight the tensile behavior of the membranes according to fig s2 the pan sio2 go pan sio2 membrane has a much higher tensile strength compared to pristine pan the sio2 go middle layer improved tensile strength from 3 02 to 10 33 mpa however its elongation at break decreases and shows a brittle behavior compared to pan which results in increase in young s modulus table s1 3 7 evaluation of filtration performance the separation of oil water emulsion by the produced membranes is carried out under the force of gravity the filtration performance of pan go sio2 pan sio2 with different weight percentages of go sio2 with the same pan ratio in the passage of distilled water is presented in fig 9a by comparing the fluxes it can be observed that the 1 1 w w percent composition has the highest output flux of distilled water from the membrane 211 7 2 6 l m2 h this may be interpreted in terms of the go content when a larger amount of go than sio2 in a 3 1 ratio is used in the membrane composition it enables the go nano plates to stick together and reduce the flux moreover it causes some problems like inconsistency clogging of the syringe needle during electrospinning and phase separation during the electrospinning proses on the other hand a higher amount of sio2 than go in a 3 1 ratio is likely to clog pores which result in a reduced flux 21 0 0 5 l m2 h the efficiency of different membranes in separating various oils including toluene sunflower oil and pump oil is evaluated and the results are presented in fig 9b based on the comparison of oil rejection rates pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane showed high capability in oil rejection and had better performance for removing toluene in water 98 7 0 9 anova was carried out and shown that the membranes have significant performance in oils rejection table s2 as shown in fig 9c and compared to the non surfactant emulsion the rejection for toluene surfactant system is slightly decreased sds stabilized to 89 9 1 5 and tween80 stabilized to 93 99 1 2 this can be ascribed to the adsorption of surfactants on in the membranes and the surfactant micelles block the pores leading to the flux to be declined in this respect surfactants act as foulants during membrane filtration which can raise their resistance to water permeation 46 47 fig 10 shows the flux passing surfactant free stabilized oils through pan go pan pan go sio2 pan and pan go sio2 pan sio2 membranes the efficiency of the different membranes has been compared by obtaining the emulsified oil flux fig 10a according to the plots the pan go sio2 pan sio2 membrane has a higher flux for passing toluene 423 7 7 1 l m2 h compared to the pan go sio2 pan membrane 118 5 3 5 l m2 h which is owing to the existence of hydrophilic sio2 nps on the membrane surface 48 also the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane showed better toluene flux than the pan go pan membrane 54 7 1 5 l m2 h this can be attributed to the inclusion of sio2 nps between go nano sheets table 4 reports the results specifically on flux obtained from the optimal membrane produced in this work with those reported in the literature the optimal membrane of pan go sio2 pan sio2 assembled in this study showed an acceptable oil water flux at low driving force and without external pressure compared to other membranes with similar compositions to evaluate the usability of the membranes the water flux test has been repeated after passing the oil water by comparing the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes fig 10b it is concluded that the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane has the best result 80 1 2 1 after toluene water separation also surfactant free emulsified toluene is used for 12 cycles after three cycles the membrane is washed with hcl 0 1 m and pure water three times and then used on the reverse surface for subsequent separation the results are represented in fig 10c according to the results the membrane showed a very low flux loss after 12 cycles indicating its good anti fouling and performance apparently sio2 nps prevent oil from contacting the surface by forming a hydrophilic thin layer on the membrane surface and making a hydration layer 43 44 in the fouling resistant mechanism water molecules prove closely bound to the hydrophilic surface creating a hydration layer that stops oil from contacting the surface and facilitates the release of adsorbed oil 44 49 therefore the membrane with better surface hydrophilicity has better regeneration properties and in turn a larger amount of frr 34 as fig 10d presented pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 shows a high flux for treating surfactant free emulsified toluene at the beginning and it has a reduction in 120 s because of the intermediate pore blocking during filtration oil particles are carried by the liquid towards the filter and then block in the pores of the membrane 50 51 on the other hand with prolonged filtration time more oil droplets accumulate on the membrane surface leading to the formation of a cake layer that can be densely packed and shows high resistance to water permeation by stirring the suspension above the membranes oil droplets in the cake layer become thermodynamically unstable and tend to coalesce 44 in some research the surface roughness of the membrane facilitates the formation of larger oil droplets that are more easily removed by stirring 52 53 therefore penetration through the membrane will be decreased and integration of oil droplets reduces the membrane fouling finally the toluene water suspension is sonicated for 15 min before passing through the membranes and after that optical microscopy images are collected to gain information about the droplet size fig 11a further details about the droplet size are also obtained using dls tests in dmf before and after separation and results presented in fig 11b as it can be seen in fig 11 the droplet size of toluene in water before separation is mainly distributed around 1 9 μm no oil droplets are observed in the electron microscopy image after separation the dls curve also confirms the disappearance of oil micro scale droplets these results indicate the excellent efficiency of the pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane for the microscale oil droplets separation from water in the oily wastewater treatments 4 conclusions in summary special sandwich hydrophilic structure membranes based on pan electrospun substrates ultra thin go nanostructures and sio2 nps are screened for water oil treatment according to various morphological analyses such as fesem tem afm wca and uoca insights into the mechanism of solution passage through the interlayer nano channels of go sio2 nps are obtained in the antifouling mechanism of the membranes the molecules of water compose a hydration layer stopping oil from contacting the surface also based on oil rejection tests it is found that the type of oil and surfactant has an important impact on the separation performance the highest percentage of rejection belongs to free surfactant toluene emulsion r 98 finally a series of data is presented on the performance of membrane separation all data indicate good performance of pan go sio2 1 1 pan sio2 membrane and the positive roles of go and sio2 nps on increasing oil flux and rejection declaration of competing
