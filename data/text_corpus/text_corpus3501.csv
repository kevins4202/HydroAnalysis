17505,removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from water through the use of various sorbents is often considered an economically viable way for supplementing conventional methods biochar has been widely studied for its potential adsorption capabilities for soluble n and p but the performance of different types of biochars can vary widely in this review we summarized the adsorption capacities of biochars in removing n nh4 n and no3 n and p po4 p based on the reported data and discussed the possible mechanisms and influencing factors in general the nh4 n adsorption capacity of unmodified biochars is relatively low at levels of less than 20 mg g this adsorption is mainly via ion exchange and or interactions with oxygen containing functional groups on biochar surfaces the affinity is even lower for no3 n because of electrostatic repulsion by negatively charged biochar surfaces precipitation of po4 p by metals metal oxides in biochar is the primary mechanism for po4 p removal biochars modified by metals have a significantly higher capacity to remove nh4 n no3 n and po4 p than unmodified biochar due to the change in surface charge and the increase in metal oxides on the biochar surface ambient conditions in the aqueous phase including temperature ph and co existing ions can significantly alter the adsorption of n and p by biochars indicating the importance of optimal processing parameters for n and p removal however the release of endogenous n and p from biochar to water can impede its performance and the presence of competing ions in water poses practical challenges for the use of biochar for nutrient removal this review demonstrates that progress is needed to improve the performance of biochars and overcome challenges before the widespread field application of biochar for n and p removal is realized graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar nutrient removal adsorption biochar modification water treatment clean water and sanitation 1 nutrients in water nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements required in the structure and functions of living organisms such as n in protein synthesis formation and p in genetic material cell membranes and energy transfer marschner and marschner 2012 however excessive inputs of anthropogenic nutrients into aquatic systems have led to the eutrophication in rivers lakes reservoirs and estuaries worldwide subsequently leading to algal blooms that threaten drinking water safety and the biodiversity of aqueous ecosystems conley et al 2009 woodward et al 2012 xia et al 2020 in the aqueous phase inorganic n and p which are the main drivers of eutrophication mainly exist in the form of ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 yin et al 2018a it is the simultaneous presence of n and p nh4 and po4 3 no3 and po4 3 that causes algal blooms while the presence of n alone nh4 and no3 does not lead to blooms zeng et al 2016 studies conducted as early as the 1970s suggest that p is the primary limiting nutrient schindler 1974 reducing p loading has been shown to inhibit eutrophication in lakes though it was unable to improve water quality in other water bodies such as estuaries and marine waters conley et al 2009 therefore a dual nutrient reduction strategy for controlling both p and n in water is necessary for eutrophication control conley et al 2009 massive amounts of n and p rich products are produced and used for industrial agricultural and domestic purposes excess n and p may be released into aqueous environments via industrial effluents agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater systems fig 1 although wastewater treatment plants wwtps remove the majority of n and p to lower their concentration below local standard guidelines before final discharge into natural waterways and bodies they are still recognized as one of the main sources of n and p in receiving natural waters in addition to the anthropogenic sources atmospheric precipitation biological nitrogen fixation and the decomposition of organic matter in sediments may also contribute to the total n and p loading in aquatic ecosystems many processes have been developed to remove nutrients from wastewater the modified ludzak ettinger mle process is a common process for biological nitrogen removal song et al 2015 in which ammonia in wastewater is converted into nitrate and subsequently gaseous nitrogen by nitrification and denitrification respectively processes based on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to convert ammonia with nitrite to nitrogen gas have been developed and applied zhang et al 2008 high ammonia concentration in wastewater inhibits the activities of microorganisms involved in nitrogen transformation which has led to the coupled adoption of physicochemical methods such as folding point chlorination magnesium ammonium phosphate map precipitation and the airstrip process zhang et al 2011 the biological process may also be adopted to remove phosphorus in wastewater involving phosphate accumulating organisms paos in the aerobic oxic a o process oehmen et al 2007 paos have the ability to store and release phosphate in response to cyclical environmental conditions nielsen et al 2019 moreover because phosphate can be precipitated by a variety of metals and metal oxides chemical precipitation processes may be an alternative or supplementary method to biological processes ye et al 2017 the sources and controls of anthropogenic n and p in the water environment are illustrated in fig 1 adsorption is an effective and rapid process for removing contaminants from the aqueous phase depending on adsorbent properties and ambient electrolyte conditions many adsorbents have been evaluated for their effectiveness in the removal of n and p from water systems including zeolites bentonite polymeric ion exchangers nanoparticles and aluminum oxides alshameri et al 2018 angar et al 2017 jorgensen and weatherley 2003 li et al 2017 niu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 zhang and gao 2013 biochar is a carbon c rich solid product formed through thermal decomposition of biomass including agricultural and forestry waste municipal sludge manure and other c rich materials ahmad et al 2014 the easy availability of feedstock and potentially low cost of production of biochar has made it a material of interest for environmental remediation in recent decades ahmad et al 2014 the features of biochar that make it feasible for sorption include but are not limited to the high specific surface area well developed pore structure high c content abundant oxygen containing functional groups and high cation exchange capacity ahmad et al 2014 the physical and chemical properties and the sorption selectivity and capacity of biochars has been shown to be related to both the feedstock and temperature of production hassan et al 2020 mukome et al 2013 furthermore metallic elements in biochar may also play an indispensable role in adsorption wang et al 2020b yin et al 2018a biochar applied in soil may bind nutrients like nh4 no3 and po4 3 through specific and non specific adsorption hale et al 2013 and therefore serve as a n or p enriched input spokas et al 2012 thus undesirable contaminants in aqueous environments can be transformed into desirable nutrients in the cropping system nutrient leaching in soil may also be mitigated through these processes additionally biochar has been shown to sequester ammonia in a stable form for at least 12 days during which it may be available for plant uptake taghizadeh toosi et al 2012 numerous studies have used biochar as an adsorbent for individually or simultaneously removing n nh4 no3 and p po4 3 from water afkhami et al 2007 chintala et al 2013 gai et al 2014 gao et al 2015 hale et al 2013 mizuta et al 2004 yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 reports reveal that nutrient removal efficiencies of biochars in water vary significantly as a function of the types and properties of biochars and the ambient conditions of the aqueous phase xiao and pignatello 2016 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 we search reported references in the database of web of science using the terms of adsorption or sorption and biochar or charcoal and ammonium or nitrate or phosphate as keywords there are several review papers focused on the use of biochar for the removal of contaminants including heavy metals anionic contaminants and organic contaminants from water ahmed et al 2016 rajapaksha et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge no systematic review has been conducted on the capabilities and mechanisms of biochar and modified biochar for n and p removal in water based on the data from the literature especially the maximum adsorption capacity q max as estimated by the langmuir isotherm model this review evaluates the performance and capacity of biochars for n and p removal and explores the corresponding mechanisms and critical factors that may affect adsorption for the purposes of comparison within this review q max data from individual references has been converted into mg n g or mg p g the aim is to guide the development and application of biochar based technology to remove various forms of n and p in aquatic environments of water systems 2 efficiencies of biochar for nutrient removal from water 2 1 ammonium removal by biochar 2 1 1 ammonium removal by unmodified biochar ammonium is one of the main inorganic forms of n in the aqueous phase and the interconversion between ammonium and ammonia is ph and temperature dependent emerson et al 1975 based on the calculation by emerson et al 1975 ammonium nh4 is the predominant form 90 over ammonia nh3 in most of the water environment with ph 8 2 and temperature 28 c extensive batch adsorption studies have been carried out to evaluate the removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n by biochars of diverse feedstocks and production temperatures for example the potential application in nh4 n adsorption has been evaluated for pine sawdust biochar wheat straw biochar yang et al 2017 peanut shell biochar corncob biochar cotton stalk biochar gao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 and giant reed biochar hou et al 2016 q max values of biochars for nh4 n vary widely throughout the literature with a mean value of 11 19 mg n g the q max values for nh4 n were 5 38 and 3 37 mg n g in pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c and 550 c respectively yang et al 2017 and 1 21 1 49 mg n g in giant reed biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c hou et al 2016 much higher q max values for nh4 n were observed for sesame straw biochars pyrolyzed at 300 700 c 14 81 26 84 mg g yin et al 2018b cui et al 2016 pyrolyzed biomass from 22 species of plants obtained from constructed wetlands at 500 c and carried out a single concentration 100 mg l nh4 n adsorption test the canna indica biochar performed the best with a q max value of 7 71 mg n g in general most reported nh4 n adsorption capacities of biochar were below 20 mg n g however a few exceptions with nh4 n adsorption capacities up to 133 mg n g have been observed fan et al 2019 kizito et al 2015 which are summarized in fig 2 detailed nh4 n q max vales of different biochars are listed in table s1 as supplementary material 2 1 2 ammonium removal by modified biochar in order to improve the adsorption capacities of biochars for ammonium attempts to increase cec enhance chemical precipitation or alter biochar surface functional groups have been undertaken for example the addition of materials with high cec into biochar feedstocks may significantly enhance the q max of ammonium such as montmorillonite chen et al 2017 and bentonite ismadji et al 2015 similarly the adsorption isotherms for nh4 by mg modified phragmites australis biochar were almost linear indicating unsaturated adsorption capacities with increasing nh4 n concentrations and a q max value of 32 mg n g within the tested concentration range gong et al 2017 authors attribute this to the cationic exchange between mg2 and nh4 as nh4 adsorption was positively correlated with the release of mg2 gong et al 2017 it has been suggested by fan et al 2019 that adsorption of nh4 by phosphate rich biochar was significantly enhanced in the presence mg2 through the precipitation of struvite mgnh4po4 while these studies provide new insight into modification strategies for enhancing biochar ammonium removal efficiency other modification methods such as mild oxidation of biochar by h2o2 wang et al 2015a were not shown to significantly improve the adsorption capacity fig 2 illustrates that the average and medium q max values of modified biochar for ammonium 22 79 mg n g and 13 85 mg n g repsectively are significantly higher than that of unmodified biochar 11 19 mg n g and 4 12 mg n g repsectively indicating modification may be an effective strategy to enhance the ammonium removal efficiency of biochars chandra et al 2020 2 2 nitrate removal by biochar in the aquatic phase nitrate is present in the anionic form no3 due to the full dissociation of hno3 in water in theory the electrostatic repulsion between nitrate and the negatively charged biochar surface constitutes one of the most significant barriers for nitrate adsorption on biochar in this section studies are reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of biochars as adsorbents for nitrate removal during wastewater treatment or remediation in natural waters 2 2 1 nitrate removal by unmodified biochar although biochars derived from a broad range of biomass feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions have been tested for their nitrate adsorption capacity fig 2 few biochars have been shown to effectively interact with nitrate these observations are in accordance with the theoretical assumption the majority of studies demonstrate that unmodified biochar had almost no or minimal adsorption capacity for nitrate for example no nitrate removal in aqueous solution was observed for 12 biochars derived from 3 feedstocks in batch adsorption tests among which some biochars even released rather than adsorbed nitrate gai et al 2014 similar results were also observed for biochars derived from corn stover and oak wood pyrolyzed at 300 450 c hollister et al 2013 cacao shell and corn cob pyrolyzed at 300 350 c hale et al 2013 and sugarcane bagasse peanut hull pepperwood and bamboo pyrolyzed at 300 450 c yao et al 2012 these negligible nitrate removal efficiencies are most likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged biochar surface and the nitrate anion limited nitrate adsorption by biochars has been observed in some studies kameyama et al 2012 evaluated the performance of sugarcane bagasse derived biochar and found that the adsorption isotherm best fit the freundlich adsorption model though adsorption was weak with values less than 0 8 mg n g at equilibrium concentrations above 100 mg n l yao et al 2012 found that biochars derived from sugarcane bagasse peanut hull pepperwood and bamboo can slightly adsorb nitrate when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 600 c similar values 1 25 mg n g were also achieved by bamboo powder biochar produced at 900 c mizuta et al 2004 3 27 mg n g by corncob biochar pyrolyzed at 600 c zhao et al 2018 and 2 02 mg n g by oak sawdust pyrolyzed at 600 c wang et al 2015b corn stover 8 68 mg n g ponderosa pinewood residue 2 58 mg n g and switchgrass 8 75 mg n g pyrolyzed at 650 c using the microwave chintala et al 2013 higher pyrolysis temperature 600 c may explain the adsorption capacity of these biochars as it can lead to altered physicochemical such as higher surface area and lower o containing functional groups ahmad et al 2014 increased surface area may also increase the number of biochar sorption sites while decreased o containing functional groups may reduce the electrostatic repulsion between biochar and nitrate however it should be noted that even where biochar nitrate sorption was observed values were fairly low with average q max value of 1 78 mg n g fig 2 table s1 indicating that unmodified biochar may not be an effective strategy for nitrate removal for aqueous environments 2 2 2 nitrate removal by modified biochar substantial modification of biochars may facilitate their nitrate adsorption capacity especially where modifications hinder the electrostatic repulsion between nitrate ions and biochar common modification strategies include protonation of negatively charged functional groups and metal metal oxide impregnation into biochar or biochar feedstocks for example treating biochar with concentrated hcl has been shown to effectively increase nitrate adsorption capacity of biochars chintala et al 2013 in that study the highest level of enhancement for nitrate adsorption was found in hcl modified ponderosa pinewood residue biochar which adsorbed 9 74 mg n g compared to 2 58 mg n g in the unmodified biochar authors hypothesize this enhanced adsorption to be the result of a significant increase in surface area 10x following hcl modification chintala et al 2013 biochar pyrolyzed from lanthanum la immersed sawdust was also found to significantly enhance the nitrate adsorption capacity of oak sawdust biochar from 2 02 mg n g unmodified to 22 58 mg n g the authors hypothesized that an increase of basic functional groups in la modified biochar is responsible for the enhancement of nitrate removal wang et al 2015b in another study mgo modified biochar nanocomposite by immersing biomass feedstocks into mgcl2 solution before pyrolysis elevated nitrate adsorption capacities as high as 95 mg n g zhang et al 2012 high resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the morphology of mgo modified biochar was altered with increased spaces of 2 to 4 nm between the mgo nano flakes which may have served as new adsorption sites for anions zhang et al 2012 the average q max of modified biochar for nitrate is 7 42 mg n g table s1 which is about 3 8x of unmodified biochar 2 3 phosphate removal by biochar 2 3 1 removal of phosphate by unmodified biochar the inorganic form of p po4 p in water presents in different anionic forms such as h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 depending on environmental ph consistent with the observations for no3 phosphate anions are usually repelled by the negatively charged surfaces of biochar as a result the adsorption capacities of unmodified biochars for inorganic p are generally low cui et al 2016 compared twenty two biochars derived from wetland plants for their sorption capability of po4 p and found that only 4 biochars exhibited positive po4 p removal from the aqueous phase indicating weak interactions between biochar and po4 p in addition the desorption of po4 p from biochars was observed rather than adsorption gong et al 2017 found that the biochar derived from phragmites australis 600 c had little impact on the total phosphorus tp levels in samples from a eutrophic lake and its inflow river the ability of biochar to adsorb po4 p also appears biomass dependent for example biochar derived from peanut shells 700 c had much greater capacity for po4 p removal 2 0 mg p g at 20 c than biochars pyrolyzed at 700 c derived from oak wood soybean and bamboo wood and the later two biomass derived biochar even released rather than adsorbed p jung et al 2015 the significant lower mg p and ca p ratios in these two biochars were hypothesized to be responsible for the p desorption as divalent cation bridging may be the primary binding mechanism for phosphorus on biochar jung et al 2015 higher po4 p removal efficiencies have been observed by corn biochar pyrolyzed at 300 450 and 600 c with q max values up to 190 mg p g fig 2 though no specific explanation was provided regarding this unusually high q max fang et al 2014 the q max of biochar for phosphate ranges from 1 37 to 193 mg p g with average value of 28 90 mg p g table s1 2 3 2 phosphate removal by modified biochar as with nitrate removal researchers have attempted to increase phosphate adsorption by adding metals and metal oxides to biochar feedstocks with mixed results ajmal et al 2020 chandra et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zeng et al 2013 fig 2 mg is the most widely studied as it can significantly promote the po4 p adsorption capacity of biochar due to the stong divalent cation bridging between mg and p jung et al 2015 wang et al 2020b intrinsic mg present in the tissues of biochar feedstocks has also been shown to promote p sorption for instance zeng et al 2013 found that biochar derived from a phytoremediation plant thalia dealbata has a higher po4 p adsorption capacity about 2 54 4 96 mg p g compared to three other phytoremediation plants with negligible p removal efficiencies authors hypothesize this to be the result of the higher mg content in thalia dealbata than other plants was believed to be the main reason yao et al 2013 found biochar derived from mg enriched tomato leaves capable of adsorbing high amounts of po4 p 100 mg po4 p g they also concluded that the p loaded biochar might potentially be used as a soil amendment or a slow release fertilizer as it contains more than 10 p these findings led to an interest in modifying biochar by adding mg to enhance its po4 p adsorption capacity while some investigations resulted in no significant increase of po4 p adsorption in mg modified biochar fang et al 2014 others found an extraordinary increase from almost 0 to nearly 109 mg po4 p g gong et al 2017 the highest level of po4 p retention 835 mg p g was from a mgo modified biochar pyrolyzed from mgcl2 immerged sugar beet tailing at 600 c zhang et al 2012 differences in the effect of mg modification on po4 p adsorption capacity may be attributed to many factors including differences in intrinsic biochar properties the concentration of added mg and pyrolysis conditions additional metals such as la and al have also been reported to be effective in enhancing biochar po4 p removal the po4 p adsorption capacity of oak sawdust biochar 500 c was enhanced from 10 44 mg p g by the untreated to 46 57 mg p g by la modified biochars wang et al 2015b novais et al 2018 found that biochar derived from poultry manure and sugarcane straw 350 c can adsorb significant amounts of al those al doped biochars then had extremely high q max values of 701 65 mg p g and 758 96 mg p g respectively the al doping process can effectively cover the negatively charged biochar surface while forming positive adsorption sites for po4 p functioning as al bridges between biochar and po4 p and facilitating the adsorption precipitation of p novais et al 2018 further evaluation is necessary for the application of al doped biochar in water treatment as al solubility and toxicity should also be considered in aqueous environments and particularly in natural water bodies it can be clearly shown in fig 2 and table s1 that biochar modification can significantly enhance the removal of phosphate the average q max of modified biochar for phosphate is 143 10 mg p g which is about 4 95x of unmodified biochar in a recent study wang et al 2020b increased the anion exchange capacity via treating biochars hardwood and softwood at 500 c with a cationic polymer poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac leading to an substantial increase of po4 p sorption approximately 1000 times greater than unmodified biochars the authors compared this result with mgo doped biochars and found that the pdadmac was comparable in sorption capacity but that sorption reversibility was greater for the pdadmac modified biochars 3 mechanisms of nutrient removal by biochar in order to further understand the removal of n and p by unmodified biochar and modified biochars factors governing the adsorption process such as surface area ion exchange surface functional group interaction and precipitation are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 surface area the specific surface area sa is generally considered a critical parameter governing the adsorption capacity of carbonaceous materials because sa is directly related to the density of adsorption sites per unit of mass the increase of sa is expected to lead to higher adsorption capacity this is supported multiple times throughout the literature for example zeng et al 2013 found that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature 500 700 c the sa of biochars significantly increased which elevated the adsorption capacities for ammonium and phosphate chintala et al 2013 found that concentrated hcl treated biochars have a nearly 10x higher sa which significantly improved their adsorption capacities for nitrate by contrast yang et al 2017 evaluated nh4 adsorption by three biochars with sas of 189 2 55 24 and 1 m2 g and found their adsorption capacities to be negatively correlated with sa similarly takaya et al 2016 found that biochars with higher sa did not necessarily adsorb more nh4 these cases suggest that sa is not the sole determinant of nh4 adsorption it is worth noting that the increase of sa correlates with the loss of oxygen containing functional groups which may also play an important role in nh4 adsorption details concerning surface functional groups will be further discussed in section 3 3 while increasing sa may improve nh4 adsorption the same may not be true for the adsorption of anions e g no3 po4 3 as the surface of biochar is most commonly negatively charged wang et al 2015b yao et al 2013 zeng et al 2013 3 2 ion exchange negatively charged biochar surfaces balance with positively charged cations in aqueous environments it has been observed that low temperature biochars may have a higher cec and therefore lead to higher nh4 adsorption capacity yang et al 2017 this may suggest that nh4 is adsorbed by replacing other cations with lower affinities for the surface sites of biochar a similar conclusion was reached by gai et al 2014 who found that biochar pyrolyzed at lower temperatures 400 c and 500 c had higher cec than those pyrolyzed at higher temperatures 600 c and 700 c in this study the highest nh4 removal was observed in the biochar with the highest cec in addition to pyrolysis temperature biochar cec is closely related to the properties of its feedstocks for example corn straw derived biochars had significantly higher cec and nh4 removal efficiency than those derived from peanut shell or wheat straw at all pyrolysis temperatures gai et al 2014 modification with the addition of metals may enhance biochar cec thus increase the adsorption for nh4 one study by gong et al 2017 illustrated this by demonstrating that nh4 sorption by mg modified phragmites australis biochar is predominantly governed by ion exchange between nh4 and mg2 3 3 surface functional groups the surface chemistry of biochar is largely characterized by hydrophobicity at higher pyrolysis temperatures and negatively charged surface functional groups at lower temperatures many of which typically contain oxygen e g oh cooh as a result biochars can have some affinity for nh4 however the lack of surface functional groups that carry a net positive charge minimizes electrostatic attraction of no3 and po4 3 to biochars the adsorption of ammonia on oxidized carbon surface of graphite oxides generally involves reactions with oxygen containing functional groups to form amines and amides as nh4 acts as a brønsted or lewis acid seredych and bandosz 2007 thus it is reasonable to expect that the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl on biochar surfaces may be closely related to nh4 adsorption for example low temperature derived biochars with higher o c mole ratios can have much higher nh4 adsorption capacity as chemical bonding or electrostatic interactions are formed between o containing functional groups on biochar surfaces and nh4 yang et al 2017 interactions between nh4 n and o containing functional groups can be elucidated by examining property changes before and after nh4 adsorption to our knowledge no direct evidence from biochar samples is currently available while the adsorption of nh4 by biomass strawberry powder has been examined following nh4 loading liu et al 2010 observed a new peak in the ft ir spectrum of strawberry powder at 1549 cm 1 which is recognized as the overlap band of the n h bending vibration and c n stretching some peak shifts in the spectrum of samples before and after nh4 adsorption were attributed to the binding of nh4 to hydroxyl phenolic and carboxyl groups liu et al 2010 the protonation and deprotonation of surface functional groups is impacted by solution ph and can significantly influence bonding between o containing functional groups and nh4 therefore influence the resultant adsorption of nh4 by biochars the removal efficiency of nh4 by wood and rice husk biochar 600 c was much lower at lower ph kizito et al 2015 which can be attributed to the protonation of functional groups c o coo on the biochar surface which results in weakened ionic bond formation between nh4 and biochar as biochar surfaces are primarily negatively charged anions such as po4 3 and no3 are typically repelled rather than adsorbed the effect of ph is further discussed in section 4 3 3 4 precipitation the formation of magnesium and calcium phosphates on biochar surfaces is considered the primary mechanism of po4 3 removal from water cui et al 2016 yao et al 2013 the high ratios of magnesium and calcium to phosphorus mg p 3 46 and ca p 47 6 respectively of a peanut shell biochar 700 c for example were used to explain its high po4 3 adsorption capacity jung et al 2015 a positive correlation between the ca and mg contents of biochars and phosphate adsorption was also observed by takaya et al 2016 authors found that only a small fraction of p loading was reversible through desorption suggesting the formation of a stable p composite on the biochar surface scanning electronic microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy images have revealed nano scale mg p precipitates closely adhered to biochar surfaces yao et al 2013 4 factors influencing nutrient removal by biochar 4 1 pyrolysis conditions unmodified biochars typically have very low capacity for no3 and po4 3 irrespective of pyrolysis conditions however it is well established that biochars pyrolyzed at lower temperatures retain more anionic functional groups and thus exhibit higher adsorption capacity for nh4 than those pyrolyzed at higher temperatures as discussed in subsection 3 3 for example yang et al 2017 observed q max values of pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c and 550 c to be 5 38 and 3 37 mg n g respectively similarly gai et al 2014 studied twelve biochars from three types of biomass pyrolyzed at four temperatures to report that the sorption of nh4 was negatively dependent with pyrolysis temperature the negative relationship between nh4 q max and pyrolysis temperature is attributed to the loss of n h and o containing polar functional groups at higher temperatures keiluweit et al 2010 relatedly the significant decrease in cec with the increase of pyrolysis temperature has been considered the main contributor to the decrease in q max since ion exchange is believed to be the predominant mechanism in the process of nh4 adsorption gai et al 2014 yang et al 2017 furthermore the increased temperature may increase the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of biochar surfaces ahmad et al 2014 mukome et al 2013 thereby weakening contact of biochar with the hydrophilic nh4 increasing biochar production temperature has often been linked to decreasing ammonium adsorption inconsistencies exist in the literature yao et al 2012 reported no significant relationship between the adsorption of nh4 and pyrolysis temperature while zeng et al 2013 observed an increase in adsorption capacity towards both nh4 and po4 3 at higher temperatures the significant increase of surface area with the increase of pyrolysis temperature 500 to 700 c was believed to be the main reason although li et al 2018 observed a decrease of ammonium adsorption by biosolid biochar with the increase of pyrolysis temperature inconsistencies were found in this study regarding the adsorption of ammonium by switchgrass biochar and water oak biochar these contrary findings indicate that multiple mechanisms govern the adsorption of n and p 4 2 co existing ions as described above cation exchange is a dominant mechanism for the removal of nh4 from aqueous solution as a result the presence of competing cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 may decrease nh4 adsorption to biochar yang et al 2017 this may be especially relevant for cations with higher bonding affinities towards biochar than nh4 divalent cations are typically stronger competitors as they have greater charge density and can occupy more adsorption sites on biochar yang et al 2017 while hou et al 2016 demonstrated that increasing cation concentration decreased the nh4 adsorption capacity of giant reed biochar authors also reported that divalent cations ca2 and mg2 competed more weakly with nh4 than the monovalent cations na and k the intensity of competition between nh4 and other cations depends on their relative electric affinity for the given functional groups and ph related variable charge at biochar surfaces anion adsorption by biochars is governed by the intensity and affinity of positively charged sites generated by metals and metal oxides at biochar surfaces except for specific complexation via covalent bonds novais et al 2018 observed that the affinity of anions to biochar increased with the increasing surface charge of biochar and decreasing hydrated ionic radius indicating an electrostatic interaction between biochar and anions anions such as phosphate and sulfate may compete with nitrate for adsorption on biochars chintala et al 2013 it is expected that the more negatively charged anions would occupy more available adsorption sites on the biochar surface leading to a significant decrease in nitrate adsorption to biochar the net nitrate adsorption by biochars would depend on the relative affinities of nitrate to adsorption sites compared to other anions yao et al 2013 observed that anions such as cl no3 hco3 compete with po4 3 thereby decreasing p adsorption this effect was strongest when these three competing ions were mixed in solution together the reduction of p adsorption by each anion separately was less than 20 while p adsorption was reduced by nearly 40 when anions were mixed authors hypothesized that anions like cl and no3 could not precipitate with mg in the engineered biochar and the reduction of p adsorption was caused by the completion or blocking of the surface adsorption sites competition among cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 for adsorption sites was also observed on al doped biochar novais et al 2018 fang et al 2014 similarly found that p adsorption by biochar decreased slightly in swine wastewater compared to artificial wastewater likely due to the presence of competing anions in swine wastewater 4 3 ambient ph aqueous ph not only influences the chemical form of ions but also alters the variable charge on biochar surfaces via protonation and deprotonation of surface functional groups thus affecting ion adsorption processes yang et al 2017 reported that nh4 adsorption by three biochars was significantly increased with increasing ph similar trends were observed for the sorption of nh4 from swine manure anaerobically digested slurry by wood and rice husk biochars kizito et al 2015 at lower ph the h ions may strongly compete against nh4 for the adsorption sites on the biochar surface thus inhibiting nh4 adsorption and removal efficiency moreover the protonation of negatively charged functional groups on the biochar surface hinders the interaction between nh4 and biochar kizito et al 2015 yang et al 2017 chintala et al 2013 found that increasing ph weakened the adsorption of nitrate on biochars mainly due to the dissociation and deprotonation of functional groups on the biochar surface which lead to electrostatic repulsion between nitrate and biochar surfaces it was similarly observed that increasing ph had a negative effect on the removal of anionic phosphate due to the ph dependent speciation of p h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 in the aqueous phase fang et al 2014 as ph increases the form of p tends to have increased negative charge density this combined with the deprotonation of biochar surface functional groups results in increased electrostatic repulsion and decreased p adsorption furthermore oh ions at higher ph may also compete with p for sorption sites on the biochar surface li et al 2016 reported that layered double hydroxides ldh modified biochar performed best for p removal at low ph e g ph 3 the authors demonstrated that the protonation of biochar surface functional groups at low ph under zero point charge phzpc resulted in an increase in positive surface charge which is believed to enhance the adsorption of phosphate li et al 2016 4 4 ambient temperature adsorption processes are influenced by the ambient temperature of aqueous environments due to both physical diffusion and heat exchange processes i e endothermic exothermic reactions increasing the ambient temperature from 25 to 40 to 50 c resulted in a decrease in the nh4 adsorption capacity of cotton stock biochar and naoh modified cotton stock biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c gao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 as the adsorption of nh4 was shown to be an exothermic process however the opposite result was reported by kizito et al 2015 who found that the adsorption of nh4 from swine manure anaerobic digested slurry by wood and rice husk biochars increased as the temperature increased from 15 to 45 c implying an endothermic process one explanation is that higher temperatures may facilitate the diffusivity of adsorbed nh4 into the inner structure of biochar thus leading to the elevated adsorption the sorption of nitrate by biochar has also been shown to be temperature dependent the nitrate adsorption capacity of biochar derived from bamboo biochar decreased from 1 25 mg n g to about 1 0 mg n g as the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c mizuta et al 2004 which suggests that the adsorption of nitrate by bamboo biochar is an exothermic process increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 c enhanced the adsorption of po4 3 by corn biochar and the thermodynamic calculation suggested that the sorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process fang et al 2014 this result was corroborated by jung et al 2015 who found that the increase of ambient temperature from 10 to 30 c promoted the adsorption of po4 3 by peanut shell biochar in this study the rising langmuir constant with increased temperature indicates that the adsorption affinity increases at higher temperatures it has been speculated that increasing temperature can promote the random thermal motion of ions which may enhance the likelihood of collision between phosphate and adsorption sites on biochar kilic et al 2013 wang et al 2016 5 challenges and perspectives biochars may contain considerable amounts of endogenous n and p depending on the composition of their biomass feedstocks as such biochar may become the source of nutrients in water through the release of inorganic n and p yao et al 2012 studied the leaching of nh4 and no3 from biochars and found that among tested thirteen biochars four of them released rather than removed nh4 while nine of them released no3 similarly chen et al 2017 observed the slow release of nh4 from biochar into the aqueous solution accounting for 0 3 4 92 of total nh4 the release of no3 in unmodified biochar was also observed by gai et al 2014 cacao shell and corn cob biochars released 1483 mg kg and 172 mg kg po4 p respectively in a 60 day continuous leaching study hale et al 2013 park et al 2015 reported even higher levels of phosphate release from sesame straw biochar ranging from 62 6 mg g to 168 2 mg g as pyrolysis temperature increased high levels of po4 3 released into the aqueous phase may be attributed to the low binding affinity of phosphate to biochar with low metal ca and mg contents jung et al 2015 significant phosphate release was observed by cui et al 2016 who reported that 17 of 22 tested biochars released po4 3 into the aqueous phase with a maximum amount of 3 68 mg p g biochar latest research has shown that inherent or added alkali metals in biochar can dramatically alter the leaching of p from biochar which has important implications for engineering of biochar for water treatment applications buss et al 2020 at higher initial po4 3 concentration level biochar tends to adsorb rather than release po4 3 therefore the net adsorption of po4 3 in the biochar aqueous system is determined by both the adsorption of exogenous po4 3 to biochar and the release of endogenous po4 3 from biochar into the water the amount of xenobiotic po4 3 adsorbed by biochar increases as its initial concentration in aqueous phase increases while the release of endogenous po4 3 is maintained at a constant level negative values occur when the concentration levels are relatively low while positive values occur at relatively high concentration levels fig 4 in addition ions present in natural water bodies and or wastewater environments act as strong competitors with nh4 no3 and po4 3 and consequently decrease their adsorption to biochar cations such as na k ca2 mg2 can significantly compete with nh4 while anions such as cl hco3 so4 2 negatively impact the removal of no3 and or po4 3 it has been observed that more than 90 of the nh4 n adsorbed to maple wood biochar can be desorbed in a kcl solution indicating a significant replacement of nh4 by k wang et al 2015a it has been observed that a pure water solution can extract more than 20 of p adsorbed to poultry manure biochar and sugarcane straw biochar after 4 extraction rounds while more than 90 was extracted with a solution of hco3 novais et al 2018 therefore the application of unmodified and modified biochar for the removal of nutrients from water is challenging in terms of the high variability of expected effectiveness not only because the endogenous nutrients in biochar can be potential sources under certain circumstances especially when n and p in water are present at low concentrations but also of the competition posed by the other ions that are abundant in water wastewater though biochar and its modifications have been deeply investigated for their ability to remove p and n from water uncertainty remains due to differences in biochar properties and those of the aqueous environment additionally the sorption capacities of biochars in the current studies are largely determined by single run batch adsorption experiments under controlled laboratory conditions which are difficult to extrapolate to field conditions the reusability the stability and the regeneration of biochar and modified biochar after use also need more investigations as a result careful evaluations should be given to choosing biochars for the removal of n and p from water and standardization of production and modification methods may be necessary before practical deployment of biochar for combating eutrophication furthermore the potential contaminants in biochars gelardi et al 2019 as well as the cost and potential secondary pollution of modifying biochars should also be taken into consideration 6 conclusions the removal of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and phosphorus po4 p from water via adsorption by unmodified and modified biochar has been extensively studied with data revealing variable efficacy removal efficiencies have been explained via ion exchange biochar surface functional group interaction or precipitation however the evidence so far has suggested that the majority of unmodified biochars only weakly adsorb n and p which is especially true for the anionic forms of n and p due to electrostatic repulsion elicited by the negatively charged biochar surface modification is necessary to significantly enhance the adsorption capability of biochars for n and p removal by reducing the electrostatic repulsion or enhancing surface interactions though the cost and environmental risks of biochar modification have yet to be fully explored therefore challenges still exist for the

17505,removal of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from water through the use of various sorbents is often considered an economically viable way for supplementing conventional methods biochar has been widely studied for its potential adsorption capabilities for soluble n and p but the performance of different types of biochars can vary widely in this review we summarized the adsorption capacities of biochars in removing n nh4 n and no3 n and p po4 p based on the reported data and discussed the possible mechanisms and influencing factors in general the nh4 n adsorption capacity of unmodified biochars is relatively low at levels of less than 20 mg g this adsorption is mainly via ion exchange and or interactions with oxygen containing functional groups on biochar surfaces the affinity is even lower for no3 n because of electrostatic repulsion by negatively charged biochar surfaces precipitation of po4 p by metals metal oxides in biochar is the primary mechanism for po4 p removal biochars modified by metals have a significantly higher capacity to remove nh4 n no3 n and po4 p than unmodified biochar due to the change in surface charge and the increase in metal oxides on the biochar surface ambient conditions in the aqueous phase including temperature ph and co existing ions can significantly alter the adsorption of n and p by biochars indicating the importance of optimal processing parameters for n and p removal however the release of endogenous n and p from biochar to water can impede its performance and the presence of competing ions in water poses practical challenges for the use of biochar for nutrient removal this review demonstrates that progress is needed to improve the performance of biochars and overcome challenges before the widespread field application of biochar for n and p removal is realized graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar nutrient removal adsorption biochar modification water treatment clean water and sanitation 1 nutrients in water nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements required in the structure and functions of living organisms such as n in protein synthesis formation and p in genetic material cell membranes and energy transfer marschner and marschner 2012 however excessive inputs of anthropogenic nutrients into aquatic systems have led to the eutrophication in rivers lakes reservoirs and estuaries worldwide subsequently leading to algal blooms that threaten drinking water safety and the biodiversity of aqueous ecosystems conley et al 2009 woodward et al 2012 xia et al 2020 in the aqueous phase inorganic n and p which are the main drivers of eutrophication mainly exist in the form of ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 yin et al 2018a it is the simultaneous presence of n and p nh4 and po4 3 no3 and po4 3 that causes algal blooms while the presence of n alone nh4 and no3 does not lead to blooms zeng et al 2016 studies conducted as early as the 1970s suggest that p is the primary limiting nutrient schindler 1974 reducing p loading has been shown to inhibit eutrophication in lakes though it was unable to improve water quality in other water bodies such as estuaries and marine waters conley et al 2009 therefore a dual nutrient reduction strategy for controlling both p and n in water is necessary for eutrophication control conley et al 2009 massive amounts of n and p rich products are produced and used for industrial agricultural and domestic purposes excess n and p may be released into aqueous environments via industrial effluents agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater systems fig 1 although wastewater treatment plants wwtps remove the majority of n and p to lower their concentration below local standard guidelines before final discharge into natural waterways and bodies they are still recognized as one of the main sources of n and p in receiving natural waters in addition to the anthropogenic sources atmospheric precipitation biological nitrogen fixation and the decomposition of organic matter in sediments may also contribute to the total n and p loading in aquatic ecosystems many processes have been developed to remove nutrients from wastewater the modified ludzak ettinger mle process is a common process for biological nitrogen removal song et al 2015 in which ammonia in wastewater is converted into nitrate and subsequently gaseous nitrogen by nitrification and denitrification respectively processes based on anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox to convert ammonia with nitrite to nitrogen gas have been developed and applied zhang et al 2008 high ammonia concentration in wastewater inhibits the activities of microorganisms involved in nitrogen transformation which has led to the coupled adoption of physicochemical methods such as folding point chlorination magnesium ammonium phosphate map precipitation and the airstrip process zhang et al 2011 the biological process may also be adopted to remove phosphorus in wastewater involving phosphate accumulating organisms paos in the aerobic oxic a o process oehmen et al 2007 paos have the ability to store and release phosphate in response to cyclical environmental conditions nielsen et al 2019 moreover because phosphate can be precipitated by a variety of metals and metal oxides chemical precipitation processes may be an alternative or supplementary method to biological processes ye et al 2017 the sources and controls of anthropogenic n and p in the water environment are illustrated in fig 1 adsorption is an effective and rapid process for removing contaminants from the aqueous phase depending on adsorbent properties and ambient electrolyte conditions many adsorbents have been evaluated for their effectiveness in the removal of n and p from water systems including zeolites bentonite polymeric ion exchangers nanoparticles and aluminum oxides alshameri et al 2018 angar et al 2017 jorgensen and weatherley 2003 li et al 2017 niu et al 2012 xu et al 2018 zhang and gao 2013 biochar is a carbon c rich solid product formed through thermal decomposition of biomass including agricultural and forestry waste municipal sludge manure and other c rich materials ahmad et al 2014 the easy availability of feedstock and potentially low cost of production of biochar has made it a material of interest for environmental remediation in recent decades ahmad et al 2014 the features of biochar that make it feasible for sorption include but are not limited to the high specific surface area well developed pore structure high c content abundant oxygen containing functional groups and high cation exchange capacity ahmad et al 2014 the physical and chemical properties and the sorption selectivity and capacity of biochars has been shown to be related to both the feedstock and temperature of production hassan et al 2020 mukome et al 2013 furthermore metallic elements in biochar may also play an indispensable role in adsorption wang et al 2020b yin et al 2018a biochar applied in soil may bind nutrients like nh4 no3 and po4 3 through specific and non specific adsorption hale et al 2013 and therefore serve as a n or p enriched input spokas et al 2012 thus undesirable contaminants in aqueous environments can be transformed into desirable nutrients in the cropping system nutrient leaching in soil may also be mitigated through these processes additionally biochar has been shown to sequester ammonia in a stable form for at least 12 days during which it may be available for plant uptake taghizadeh toosi et al 2012 numerous studies have used biochar as an adsorbent for individually or simultaneously removing n nh4 no3 and p po4 3 from water afkhami et al 2007 chintala et al 2013 gai et al 2014 gao et al 2015 hale et al 2013 mizuta et al 2004 yang et al 2017 zeng et al 2013 reports reveal that nutrient removal efficiencies of biochars in water vary significantly as a function of the types and properties of biochars and the ambient conditions of the aqueous phase xiao and pignatello 2016 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 we search reported references in the database of web of science using the terms of adsorption or sorption and biochar or charcoal and ammonium or nitrate or phosphate as keywords there are several review papers focused on the use of biochar for the removal of contaminants including heavy metals anionic contaminants and organic contaminants from water ahmed et al 2016 rajapaksha et al 2016 wang et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge no systematic review has been conducted on the capabilities and mechanisms of biochar and modified biochar for n and p removal in water based on the data from the literature especially the maximum adsorption capacity q max as estimated by the langmuir isotherm model this review evaluates the performance and capacity of biochars for n and p removal and explores the corresponding mechanisms and critical factors that may affect adsorption for the purposes of comparison within this review q max data from individual references has been converted into mg n g or mg p g the aim is to guide the development and application of biochar based technology to remove various forms of n and p in aquatic environments of water systems 2 efficiencies of biochar for nutrient removal from water 2 1 ammonium removal by biochar 2 1 1 ammonium removal by unmodified biochar ammonium is one of the main inorganic forms of n in the aqueous phase and the interconversion between ammonium and ammonia is ph and temperature dependent emerson et al 1975 based on the calculation by emerson et al 1975 ammonium nh4 is the predominant form 90 over ammonia nh3 in most of the water environment with ph 8 2 and temperature 28 c extensive batch adsorption studies have been carried out to evaluate the removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n by biochars of diverse feedstocks and production temperatures for example the potential application in nh4 n adsorption has been evaluated for pine sawdust biochar wheat straw biochar yang et al 2017 peanut shell biochar corncob biochar cotton stalk biochar gao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 and giant reed biochar hou et al 2016 q max values of biochars for nh4 n vary widely throughout the literature with a mean value of 11 19 mg n g the q max values for nh4 n were 5 38 and 3 37 mg n g in pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c and 550 c respectively yang et al 2017 and 1 21 1 49 mg n g in giant reed biochar pyrolyzed at 500 c hou et al 2016 much higher q max values for nh4 n were observed for sesame straw biochars pyrolyzed at 300 700 c 14 81 26 84 mg g yin et al 2018b cui et al 2016 pyrolyzed biomass from 22 species of plants obtained from constructed wetlands at 500 c and carried out a single concentration 100 mg l nh4 n adsorption test the canna indica biochar performed the best with a q max value of 7 71 mg n g in general most reported nh4 n adsorption capacities of biochar were below 20 mg n g however a few exceptions with nh4 n adsorption capacities up to 133 mg n g have been observed fan et al 2019 kizito et al 2015 which are summarized in fig 2 detailed nh4 n q max vales of different biochars are listed in table s1 as supplementary material 2 1 2 ammonium removal by modified biochar in order to improve the adsorption capacities of biochars for ammonium attempts to increase cec enhance chemical precipitation or alter biochar surface functional groups have been undertaken for example the addition of materials with high cec into biochar feedstocks may significantly enhance the q max of ammonium such as montmorillonite chen et al 2017 and bentonite ismadji et al 2015 similarly the adsorption isotherms for nh4 by mg modified phragmites australis biochar were almost linear indicating unsaturated adsorption capacities with increasing nh4 n concentrations and a q max value of 32 mg n g within the tested concentration range gong et al 2017 authors attribute this to the cationic exchange between mg2 and nh4 as nh4 adsorption was positively correlated with the release of mg2 gong et al 2017 it has been suggested by fan et al 2019 that adsorption of nh4 by phosphate rich biochar was significantly enhanced in the presence mg2 through the precipitation of struvite mgnh4po4 while these studies provide new insight into modification strategies for enhancing biochar ammonium removal efficiency other modification methods such as mild oxidation of biochar by h2o2 wang et al 2015a were not shown to significantly improve the adsorption capacity fig 2 illustrates that the average and medium q max values of modified biochar for ammonium 22 79 mg n g and 13 85 mg n g repsectively are significantly higher than that of unmodified biochar 11 19 mg n g and 4 12 mg n g repsectively indicating modification may be an effective strategy to enhance the ammonium removal efficiency of biochars chandra et al 2020 2 2 nitrate removal by biochar in the aquatic phase nitrate is present in the anionic form no3 due to the full dissociation of hno3 in water in theory the electrostatic repulsion between nitrate and the negatively charged biochar surface constitutes one of the most significant barriers for nitrate adsorption on biochar in this section studies are reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of biochars as adsorbents for nitrate removal during wastewater treatment or remediation in natural waters 2 2 1 nitrate removal by unmodified biochar although biochars derived from a broad range of biomass feedstocks and pyrolysis conditions have been tested for their nitrate adsorption capacity fig 2 few biochars have been shown to effectively interact with nitrate these observations are in accordance with the theoretical assumption the majority of studies demonstrate that unmodified biochar had almost no or minimal adsorption capacity for nitrate for example no nitrate removal in aqueous solution was observed for 12 biochars derived from 3 feedstocks in batch adsorption tests among which some biochars even released rather than adsorbed nitrate gai et al 2014 similar results were also observed for biochars derived from corn stover and oak wood pyrolyzed at 300 450 c hollister et al 2013 cacao shell and corn cob pyrolyzed at 300 350 c hale et al 2013 and sugarcane bagasse peanut hull pepperwood and bamboo pyrolyzed at 300 450 c yao et al 2012 these negligible nitrate removal efficiencies are most likely due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged biochar surface and the nitrate anion limited nitrate adsorption by biochars has been observed in some studies kameyama et al 2012 evaluated the performance of sugarcane bagasse derived biochar and found that the adsorption isotherm best fit the freundlich adsorption model though adsorption was weak with values less than 0 8 mg n g at equilibrium concentrations above 100 mg n l yao et al 2012 found that biochars derived from sugarcane bagasse peanut hull pepperwood and bamboo can slightly adsorb nitrate when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 600 c similar values 1 25 mg n g were also achieved by bamboo powder biochar produced at 900 c mizuta et al 2004 3 27 mg n g by corncob biochar pyrolyzed at 600 c zhao et al 2018 and 2 02 mg n g by oak sawdust pyrolyzed at 600 c wang et al 2015b corn stover 8 68 mg n g ponderosa pinewood residue 2 58 mg n g and switchgrass 8 75 mg n g pyrolyzed at 650 c using the microwave chintala et al 2013 higher pyrolysis temperature 600 c may explain the adsorption capacity of these biochars as it can lead to altered physicochemical such as higher surface area and lower o containing functional groups ahmad et al 2014 increased surface area may also increase the number of biochar sorption sites while decreased o containing functional groups may reduce the electrostatic repulsion between biochar and nitrate however it should be noted that even where biochar nitrate sorption was observed values were fairly low with average q max value of 1 78 mg n g fig 2 table s1 indicating that unmodified biochar may not be an effective strategy for nitrate removal for aqueous environments 2 2 2 nitrate removal by modified biochar substantial modification of biochars may facilitate their nitrate adsorption capacity especially where modifications hinder the electrostatic repulsion between nitrate ions and biochar common modification strategies include protonation of negatively charged functional groups and metal metal oxide impregnation into biochar or biochar feedstocks for example treating biochar with concentrated hcl has been shown to effectively increase nitrate adsorption capacity of biochars chintala et al 2013 in that study the highest level of enhancement for nitrate adsorption was found in hcl modified ponderosa pinewood residue biochar which adsorbed 9 74 mg n g compared to 2 58 mg n g in the unmodified biochar authors hypothesize this enhanced adsorption to be the result of a significant increase in surface area 10x following hcl modification chintala et al 2013 biochar pyrolyzed from lanthanum la immersed sawdust was also found to significantly enhance the nitrate adsorption capacity of oak sawdust biochar from 2 02 mg n g unmodified to 22 58 mg n g the authors hypothesized that an increase of basic functional groups in la modified biochar is responsible for the enhancement of nitrate removal wang et al 2015b in another study mgo modified biochar nanocomposite by immersing biomass feedstocks into mgcl2 solution before pyrolysis elevated nitrate adsorption capacities as high as 95 mg n g zhang et al 2012 high resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the morphology of mgo modified biochar was altered with increased spaces of 2 to 4 nm between the mgo nano flakes which may have served as new adsorption sites for anions zhang et al 2012 the average q max of modified biochar for nitrate is 7 42 mg n g table s1 which is about 3 8x of unmodified biochar 2 3 phosphate removal by biochar 2 3 1 removal of phosphate by unmodified biochar the inorganic form of p po4 p in water presents in different anionic forms such as h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 depending on environmental ph consistent with the observations for no3 phosphate anions are usually repelled by the negatively charged surfaces of biochar as a result the adsorption capacities of unmodified biochars for inorganic p are generally low cui et al 2016 compared twenty two biochars derived from wetland plants for their sorption capability of po4 p and found that only 4 biochars exhibited positive po4 p removal from the aqueous phase indicating weak interactions between biochar and po4 p in addition the desorption of po4 p from biochars was observed rather than adsorption gong et al 2017 found that the biochar derived from phragmites australis 600 c had little impact on the total phosphorus tp levels in samples from a eutrophic lake and its inflow river the ability of biochar to adsorb po4 p also appears biomass dependent for example biochar derived from peanut shells 700 c had much greater capacity for po4 p removal 2 0 mg p g at 20 c than biochars pyrolyzed at 700 c derived from oak wood soybean and bamboo wood and the later two biomass derived biochar even released rather than adsorbed p jung et al 2015 the significant lower mg p and ca p ratios in these two biochars were hypothesized to be responsible for the p desorption as divalent cation bridging may be the primary binding mechanism for phosphorus on biochar jung et al 2015 higher po4 p removal efficiencies have been observed by corn biochar pyrolyzed at 300 450 and 600 c with q max values up to 190 mg p g fig 2 though no specific explanation was provided regarding this unusually high q max fang et al 2014 the q max of biochar for phosphate ranges from 1 37 to 193 mg p g with average value of 28 90 mg p g table s1 2 3 2 phosphate removal by modified biochar as with nitrate removal researchers have attempted to increase phosphate adsorption by adding metals and metal oxides to biochar feedstocks with mixed results ajmal et al 2020 chandra et al 2020 wang et al 2020a zeng et al 2013 fig 2 mg is the most widely studied as it can significantly promote the po4 p adsorption capacity of biochar due to the stong divalent cation bridging between mg and p jung et al 2015 wang et al 2020b intrinsic mg present in the tissues of biochar feedstocks has also been shown to promote p sorption for instance zeng et al 2013 found that biochar derived from a phytoremediation plant thalia dealbata has a higher po4 p adsorption capacity about 2 54 4 96 mg p g compared to three other phytoremediation plants with negligible p removal efficiencies authors hypothesize this to be the result of the higher mg content in thalia dealbata than other plants was believed to be the main reason yao et al 2013 found biochar derived from mg enriched tomato leaves capable of adsorbing high amounts of po4 p 100 mg po4 p g they also concluded that the p loaded biochar might potentially be used as a soil amendment or a slow release fertilizer as it contains more than 10 p these findings led to an interest in modifying biochar by adding mg to enhance its po4 p adsorption capacity while some investigations resulted in no significant increase of po4 p adsorption in mg modified biochar fang et al 2014 others found an extraordinary increase from almost 0 to nearly 109 mg po4 p g gong et al 2017 the highest level of po4 p retention 835 mg p g was from a mgo modified biochar pyrolyzed from mgcl2 immerged sugar beet tailing at 600 c zhang et al 2012 differences in the effect of mg modification on po4 p adsorption capacity may be attributed to many factors including differences in intrinsic biochar properties the concentration of added mg and pyrolysis conditions additional metals such as la and al have also been reported to be effective in enhancing biochar po4 p removal the po4 p adsorption capacity of oak sawdust biochar 500 c was enhanced from 10 44 mg p g by the untreated to 46 57 mg p g by la modified biochars wang et al 2015b novais et al 2018 found that biochar derived from poultry manure and sugarcane straw 350 c can adsorb significant amounts of al those al doped biochars then had extremely high q max values of 701 65 mg p g and 758 96 mg p g respectively the al doping process can effectively cover the negatively charged biochar surface while forming positive adsorption sites for po4 p functioning as al bridges between biochar and po4 p and facilitating the adsorption precipitation of p novais et al 2018 further evaluation is necessary for the application of al doped biochar in water treatment as al solubility and toxicity should also be considered in aqueous environments and particularly in natural water bodies it can be clearly shown in fig 2 and table s1 that biochar modification can significantly enhance the removal of phosphate the average q max of modified biochar for phosphate is 143 10 mg p g which is about 4 95x of unmodified biochar in a recent study wang et al 2020b increased the anion exchange capacity via treating biochars hardwood and softwood at 500 c with a cationic polymer poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride pdadmac leading to an substantial increase of po4 p sorption approximately 1000 times greater than unmodified biochars the authors compared this result with mgo doped biochars and found that the pdadmac was comparable in sorption capacity but that sorption reversibility was greater for the pdadmac modified biochars 3 mechanisms of nutrient removal by biochar in order to further understand the removal of n and p by unmodified biochar and modified biochars factors governing the adsorption process such as surface area ion exchange surface functional group interaction and precipitation are illustrated in fig 3 3 1 surface area the specific surface area sa is generally considered a critical parameter governing the adsorption capacity of carbonaceous materials because sa is directly related to the density of adsorption sites per unit of mass the increase of sa is expected to lead to higher adsorption capacity this is supported multiple times throughout the literature for example zeng et al 2013 found that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature 500 700 c the sa of biochars significantly increased which elevated the adsorption capacities for ammonium and phosphate chintala et al 2013 found that concentrated hcl treated biochars have a nearly 10x higher sa which significantly improved their adsorption capacities for nitrate by contrast yang et al 2017 evaluated nh4 adsorption by three biochars with sas of 189 2 55 24 and 1 m2 g and found their adsorption capacities to be negatively correlated with sa similarly takaya et al 2016 found that biochars with higher sa did not necessarily adsorb more nh4 these cases suggest that sa is not the sole determinant of nh4 adsorption it is worth noting that the increase of sa correlates with the loss of oxygen containing functional groups which may also play an important role in nh4 adsorption details concerning surface functional groups will be further discussed in section 3 3 while increasing sa may improve nh4 adsorption the same may not be true for the adsorption of anions e g no3 po4 3 as the surface of biochar is most commonly negatively charged wang et al 2015b yao et al 2013 zeng et al 2013 3 2 ion exchange negatively charged biochar surfaces balance with positively charged cations in aqueous environments it has been observed that low temperature biochars may have a higher cec and therefore lead to higher nh4 adsorption capacity yang et al 2017 this may suggest that nh4 is adsorbed by replacing other cations with lower affinities for the surface sites of biochar a similar conclusion was reached by gai et al 2014 who found that biochar pyrolyzed at lower temperatures 400 c and 500 c had higher cec than those pyrolyzed at higher temperatures 600 c and 700 c in this study the highest nh4 removal was observed in the biochar with the highest cec in addition to pyrolysis temperature biochar cec is closely related to the properties of its feedstocks for example corn straw derived biochars had significantly higher cec and nh4 removal efficiency than those derived from peanut shell or wheat straw at all pyrolysis temperatures gai et al 2014 modification with the addition of metals may enhance biochar cec thus increase the adsorption for nh4 one study by gong et al 2017 illustrated this by demonstrating that nh4 sorption by mg modified phragmites australis biochar is predominantly governed by ion exchange between nh4 and mg2 3 3 surface functional groups the surface chemistry of biochar is largely characterized by hydrophobicity at higher pyrolysis temperatures and negatively charged surface functional groups at lower temperatures many of which typically contain oxygen e g oh cooh as a result biochars can have some affinity for nh4 however the lack of surface functional groups that carry a net positive charge minimizes electrostatic attraction of no3 and po4 3 to biochars the adsorption of ammonia on oxidized carbon surface of graphite oxides generally involves reactions with oxygen containing functional groups to form amines and amides as nh4 acts as a brønsted or lewis acid seredych and bandosz 2007 thus it is reasonable to expect that the abundance of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxyl on biochar surfaces may be closely related to nh4 adsorption for example low temperature derived biochars with higher o c mole ratios can have much higher nh4 adsorption capacity as chemical bonding or electrostatic interactions are formed between o containing functional groups on biochar surfaces and nh4 yang et al 2017 interactions between nh4 n and o containing functional groups can be elucidated by examining property changes before and after nh4 adsorption to our knowledge no direct evidence from biochar samples is currently available while the adsorption of nh4 by biomass strawberry powder has been examined following nh4 loading liu et al 2010 observed a new peak in the ft ir spectrum of strawberry powder at 1549 cm 1 which is recognized as the overlap band of the n h bending vibration and c n stretching some peak shifts in the spectrum of samples before and after nh4 adsorption were attributed to the binding of nh4 to hydroxyl phenolic and carboxyl groups liu et al 2010 the protonation and deprotonation of surface functional groups is impacted by solution ph and can significantly influence bonding between o containing functional groups and nh4 therefore influence the resultant adsorption of nh4 by biochars the removal efficiency of nh4 by wood and rice husk biochar 600 c was much lower at lower ph kizito et al 2015 which can be attributed to the protonation of functional groups c o coo on the biochar surface which results in weakened ionic bond formation between nh4 and biochar as biochar surfaces are primarily negatively charged anions such as po4 3 and no3 are typically repelled rather than adsorbed the effect of ph is further discussed in section 4 3 3 4 precipitation the formation of magnesium and calcium phosphates on biochar surfaces is considered the primary mechanism of po4 3 removal from water cui et al 2016 yao et al 2013 the high ratios of magnesium and calcium to phosphorus mg p 3 46 and ca p 47 6 respectively of a peanut shell biochar 700 c for example were used to explain its high po4 3 adsorption capacity jung et al 2015 a positive correlation between the ca and mg contents of biochars and phosphate adsorption was also observed by takaya et al 2016 authors found that only a small fraction of p loading was reversible through desorption suggesting the formation of a stable p composite on the biochar surface scanning electronic microscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy images have revealed nano scale mg p precipitates closely adhered to biochar surfaces yao et al 2013 4 factors influencing nutrient removal by biochar 4 1 pyrolysis conditions unmodified biochars typically have very low capacity for no3 and po4 3 irrespective of pyrolysis conditions however it is well established that biochars pyrolyzed at lower temperatures retain more anionic functional groups and thus exhibit higher adsorption capacity for nh4 than those pyrolyzed at higher temperatures as discussed in subsection 3 3 for example yang et al 2017 observed q max values of pine sawdust biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c and 550 c to be 5 38 and 3 37 mg n g respectively similarly gai et al 2014 studied twelve biochars from three types of biomass pyrolyzed at four temperatures to report that the sorption of nh4 was negatively dependent with pyrolysis temperature the negative relationship between nh4 q max and pyrolysis temperature is attributed to the loss of n h and o containing polar functional groups at higher temperatures keiluweit et al 2010 relatedly the significant decrease in cec with the increase of pyrolysis temperature has been considered the main contributor to the decrease in q max since ion exchange is believed to be the predominant mechanism in the process of nh4 adsorption gai et al 2014 yang et al 2017 furthermore the increased temperature may increase the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of biochar surfaces ahmad et al 2014 mukome et al 2013 thereby weakening contact of biochar with the hydrophilic nh4 increasing biochar production temperature has often been linked to decreasing ammonium adsorption inconsistencies exist in the literature yao et al 2012 reported no significant relationship between the adsorption of nh4 and pyrolysis temperature while zeng et al 2013 observed an increase in adsorption capacity towards both nh4 and po4 3 at higher temperatures the significant increase of surface area with the increase of pyrolysis temperature 500 to 700 c was believed to be the main reason although li et al 2018 observed a decrease of ammonium adsorption by biosolid biochar with the increase of pyrolysis temperature inconsistencies were found in this study regarding the adsorption of ammonium by switchgrass biochar and water oak biochar these contrary findings indicate that multiple mechanisms govern the adsorption of n and p 4 2 co existing ions as described above cation exchange is a dominant mechanism for the removal of nh4 from aqueous solution as a result the presence of competing cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 may decrease nh4 adsorption to biochar yang et al 2017 this may be especially relevant for cations with higher bonding affinities towards biochar than nh4 divalent cations are typically stronger competitors as they have greater charge density and can occupy more adsorption sites on biochar yang et al 2017 while hou et al 2016 demonstrated that increasing cation concentration decreased the nh4 adsorption capacity of giant reed biochar authors also reported that divalent cations ca2 and mg2 competed more weakly with nh4 than the monovalent cations na and k the intensity of competition between nh4 and other cations depends on their relative electric affinity for the given functional groups and ph related variable charge at biochar surfaces anion adsorption by biochars is governed by the intensity and affinity of positively charged sites generated by metals and metal oxides at biochar surfaces except for specific complexation via covalent bonds novais et al 2018 observed that the affinity of anions to biochar increased with the increasing surface charge of biochar and decreasing hydrated ionic radius indicating an electrostatic interaction between biochar and anions anions such as phosphate and sulfate may compete with nitrate for adsorption on biochars chintala et al 2013 it is expected that the more negatively charged anions would occupy more available adsorption sites on the biochar surface leading to a significant decrease in nitrate adsorption to biochar the net nitrate adsorption by biochars would depend on the relative affinities of nitrate to adsorption sites compared to other anions yao et al 2013 observed that anions such as cl no3 hco3 compete with po4 3 thereby decreasing p adsorption this effect was strongest when these three competing ions were mixed in solution together the reduction of p adsorption by each anion separately was less than 20 while p adsorption was reduced by nearly 40 when anions were mixed authors hypothesized that anions like cl and no3 could not precipitate with mg in the engineered biochar and the reduction of p adsorption was caused by the completion or blocking of the surface adsorption sites competition among cl no3 po4 3 so4 2 for adsorption sites was also observed on al doped biochar novais et al 2018 fang et al 2014 similarly found that p adsorption by biochar decreased slightly in swine wastewater compared to artificial wastewater likely due to the presence of competing anions in swine wastewater 4 3 ambient ph aqueous ph not only influences the chemical form of ions but also alters the variable charge on biochar surfaces via protonation and deprotonation of surface functional groups thus affecting ion adsorption processes yang et al 2017 reported that nh4 adsorption by three biochars was significantly increased with increasing ph similar trends were observed for the sorption of nh4 from swine manure anaerobically digested slurry by wood and rice husk biochars kizito et al 2015 at lower ph the h ions may strongly compete against nh4 for the adsorption sites on the biochar surface thus inhibiting nh4 adsorption and removal efficiency moreover the protonation of negatively charged functional groups on the biochar surface hinders the interaction between nh4 and biochar kizito et al 2015 yang et al 2017 chintala et al 2013 found that increasing ph weakened the adsorption of nitrate on biochars mainly due to the dissociation and deprotonation of functional groups on the biochar surface which lead to electrostatic repulsion between nitrate and biochar surfaces it was similarly observed that increasing ph had a negative effect on the removal of anionic phosphate due to the ph dependent speciation of p h2po4 hpo4 2 and po4 3 in the aqueous phase fang et al 2014 as ph increases the form of p tends to have increased negative charge density this combined with the deprotonation of biochar surface functional groups results in increased electrostatic repulsion and decreased p adsorption furthermore oh ions at higher ph may also compete with p for sorption sites on the biochar surface li et al 2016 reported that layered double hydroxides ldh modified biochar performed best for p removal at low ph e g ph 3 the authors demonstrated that the protonation of biochar surface functional groups at low ph under zero point charge phzpc resulted in an increase in positive surface charge which is believed to enhance the adsorption of phosphate li et al 2016 4 4 ambient temperature adsorption processes are influenced by the ambient temperature of aqueous environments due to both physical diffusion and heat exchange processes i e endothermic exothermic reactions increasing the ambient temperature from 25 to 40 to 50 c resulted in a decrease in the nh4 adsorption capacity of cotton stock biochar and naoh modified cotton stock biochar pyrolyzed at 300 c gao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 as the adsorption of nh4 was shown to be an exothermic process however the opposite result was reported by kizito et al 2015 who found that the adsorption of nh4 from swine manure anaerobic digested slurry by wood and rice husk biochars increased as the temperature increased from 15 to 45 c implying an endothermic process one explanation is that higher temperatures may facilitate the diffusivity of adsorbed nh4 into the inner structure of biochar thus leading to the elevated adsorption the sorption of nitrate by biochar has also been shown to be temperature dependent the nitrate adsorption capacity of biochar derived from bamboo biochar decreased from 1 25 mg n g to about 1 0 mg n g as the temperature increased from 10 to 20 c mizuta et al 2004 which suggests that the adsorption of nitrate by bamboo biochar is an exothermic process increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 c enhanced the adsorption of po4 3 by corn biochar and the thermodynamic calculation suggested that the sorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process fang et al 2014 this result was corroborated by jung et al 2015 who found that the increase of ambient temperature from 10 to 30 c promoted the adsorption of po4 3 by peanut shell biochar in this study the rising langmuir constant with increased temperature indicates that the adsorption affinity increases at higher temperatures it has been speculated that increasing temperature can promote the random thermal motion of ions which may enhance the likelihood of collision between phosphate and adsorption sites on biochar kilic et al 2013 wang et al 2016 5 challenges and perspectives biochars may contain considerable amounts of endogenous n and p depending on the composition of their biomass feedstocks as such biochar may become the source of nutrients in water through the release of inorganic n and p yao et al 2012 studied the leaching of nh4 and no3 from biochars and found that among tested thirteen biochars four of them released rather than removed nh4 while nine of them released no3 similarly chen et al 2017 observed the slow release of nh4 from biochar into the aqueous solution accounting for 0 3 4 92 of total nh4 the release of no3 in unmodified biochar was also observed by gai et al 2014 cacao shell and corn cob biochars released 1483 mg kg and 172 mg kg po4 p respectively in a 60 day continuous leaching study hale et al 2013 park et al 2015 reported even higher levels of phosphate release from sesame straw biochar ranging from 62 6 mg g to 168 2 mg g as pyrolysis temperature increased high levels of po4 3 released into the aqueous phase may be attributed to the low binding affinity of phosphate to biochar with low metal ca and mg contents jung et al 2015 significant phosphate release was observed by cui et al 2016 who reported that 17 of 22 tested biochars released po4 3 into the aqueous phase with a maximum amount of 3 68 mg p g biochar latest research has shown that inherent or added alkali metals in biochar can dramatically alter the leaching of p from biochar which has important implications for engineering of biochar for water treatment applications buss et al 2020 at higher initial po4 3 concentration level biochar tends to adsorb rather than release po4 3 therefore the net adsorption of po4 3 in the biochar aqueous system is determined by both the adsorption of exogenous po4 3 to biochar and the release of endogenous po4 3 from biochar into the water the amount of xenobiotic po4 3 adsorbed by biochar increases as its initial concentration in aqueous phase increases while the release of endogenous po4 3 is maintained at a constant level negative values occur when the concentration levels are relatively low while positive values occur at relatively high concentration levels fig 4 in addition ions present in natural water bodies and or wastewater environments act as strong competitors with nh4 no3 and po4 3 and consequently decrease their adsorption to biochar cations such as na k ca2 mg2 can significantly compete with nh4 while anions such as cl hco3 so4 2 negatively impact the removal of no3 and or po4 3 it has been observed that more than 90 of the nh4 n adsorbed to maple wood biochar can be desorbed in a kcl solution indicating a significant replacement of nh4 by k wang et al 2015a it has been observed that a pure water solution can extract more than 20 of p adsorbed to poultry manure biochar and sugarcane straw biochar after 4 extraction rounds while more than 90 was extracted with a solution of hco3 novais et al 2018 therefore the application of unmodified and modified biochar for the removal of nutrients from water is challenging in terms of the high variability of expected effectiveness not only because the endogenous nutrients in biochar can be potential sources under certain circumstances especially when n and p in water are present at low concentrations but also of the competition posed by the other ions that are abundant in water wastewater though biochar and its modifications have been deeply investigated for their ability to remove p and n from water uncertainty remains due to differences in biochar properties and those of the aqueous environment additionally the sorption capacities of biochars in the current studies are largely determined by single run batch adsorption experiments under controlled laboratory conditions which are difficult to extrapolate to field conditions the reusability the stability and the regeneration of biochar and modified biochar after use also need more investigations as a result careful evaluations should be given to choosing biochars for the removal of n and p from water and standardization of production and modification methods may be necessary before practical deployment of biochar for combating eutrophication furthermore the potential contaminants in biochars gelardi et al 2019 as well as the cost and potential secondary pollution of modifying biochars should also be taken into consideration 6 conclusions the removal of nitrogen nh4 n no3 n and phosphorus po4 p from water via adsorption by unmodified and modified biochar has been extensively studied with data revealing variable efficacy removal efficiencies have been explained via ion exchange biochar surface functional group interaction or precipitation however the evidence so far has suggested that the majority of unmodified biochars only weakly adsorb n and p which is especially true for the anionic forms of n and p due to electrostatic repulsion elicited by the negatively charged biochar surface modification is necessary to significantly enhance the adsorption capability of biochars for n and p removal by reducing the electrostatic repulsion or enhancing surface interactions though the cost and environmental risks of biochar modification have yet to be fully explored therefore challenges still exist for the development of cost effective environmentally friendly field applicable biochar adsorbents for nutrient removal from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17506,data assimilation da techniques are powerful means of dynamic natural system modeling that allow for the use of data as soon as it appears to improve model predictions and reduce prediction uncertainty by correcting state variables model parameters and boundary and initial conditions the objectives of this review are to explore existing approaches and advances in da applications for surface water quality modeling and to identify future research prospects we first reviewed the da methods used in water quality modeling as reported in literature we then addressed observations and suggestions regarding various factors of da performance such as the mismatch between both lateral and vertical spatial detail of measurements and modeling subgrid heterogeneity presence of temporally stable spatial patterns in water quality parameters and related biases evaluation of uncertainty in data and modeling results mismatch between scales and schedules of data from multiple sources selection of parameters to be updated along with state variables update frequency and forecast skill the review concludes with the outlook section that outlines current challenges and opportunities related to growing role of novel data sources scale mismatch between model discretization and observation structural uncertainty of models and conversion of measured to simulated vales experimentation with da prior to applications using da performance or model selection the role of sensitivity analysis and the expanding use of da in water quality management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality model data assimilation variational data assimilation extended kalman filter ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction a water quality model is the mathematical representation of pollutant fate and transport within a water body that may be coupled with a mathematical representation of the movement of pollutants from land movement of pollutants from land based sources to a water body kebede 2009 the water quality models include description of physical chemical and biological mechanisms affecting fate and transport of pollutants surface water quality models are critically important tools for managing our nations surface waters as they help local communities and environmental managers better understand how surface waters change in response to pollution and how to protect them water quality specialists use models for many purposes such as assessing water quality conditions and causes of impairment predicting how surface waters will respond to changes in their watersheds and the environment e g future growth climate change and forecasting quantitative benefits of new surface water protection policies epa 2018 streeter and phelps 1925 firstly introduced their model as a solution of the first order differential equation to simulate do decline by the decomposition of organic matters and do increased by reaeration water quality modeling has since advanced from considering a simple first order decomposition of organic matter to a complex multiple biochemically mediated processes from point source models to both point and nonpoint sources as well as from 1 dimensional steady state models to 3 dimensional dynamic models wang et al 2013 in this regard the number of model parameters considerably increased thereby increasing the prediction uncertainty it was eventually realized that the optimal estimates of the evolving water quality attributes should be obtained by jointly considering the outputs of the model with the data from ongoing observations this can be achieved by using mathematical techniques of data assimilation da and their computational implementations asch et al 2016 fletcher 2017 the data assimilation da is the methodology whereby observational data are combined with output from a numerical model to produce an optimal estimate of the evolving state and or parameters of the system o neill 2003 as new observations of a water quality become available the da may include updates of state variables e g dissolved oxygen concentration or phytoplankton biomass model parameters e g decomposition or reaeration rate and boundary conditions e g tributary input to the modeled water body the da allows us to update modeling results and or achieve model improvements each time new observations become available the update is based on the consideration of the uncertainties in data and in model predictions the more certain measurement data are and the less certain modeling results are the closer the modeling results become to measurements after updates the status of the pollution is simulated as the spatio temporal variation of the pollutant concentrations and water quality attributes that affect the fate of pollutants these concentrations and attributes are the state variables of the modeled aquatic systems coefficients in the surface water quality models describe the site specific conditions they are known as model parameters the da has drawn much attention in surface hydrology wherein review works and monographs analyzed the da potential to improve the hydrologic model performance montzka et al 2012 moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 park and xu 2013 its applications to water quality modeling have slower developments than its applications in hydrology robinson and lermusiaux 2000 sun et al 2016 partly because it was quite challenging to carry out real time and high frequency monitoring of water quality at multiple locations beginning from 2005 the total annual number of peer reviewed publications on water quality modeling steadily increased by about a hundred data from the scopus database this growth occurred due to multiple reasons which includes the development of remote sensing algorithms in situ sensors advances in the modeling of water bodies progress in understanding processes affecting water quality regulatory actions and development of pre and post processing capabilities around the same timeframe the da was applied for the first time to the three dimensional water quality model for a large natural water body vodacek et al 2008 since then various da methods were utilized in modeling various types of natural water constituents with the most recent focus on harmful algae blooms loos et al 2020 various da applications in the surface water models may include updates of state variables e g dissolved oxygen concentration or phytoplankton biomass model parameters e g dissolved organic matter decomposition rate and boundary conditions e g the tributary input to the main stream while the water quality modeling in general was extensively reviewed cho et al 2016 ji 2017 wellen et al 2015 reviews of da in water quality modeling have not been published there is a need for a systematic state of the art presentation of this fast developing field the currently published research allows one to evaluate and compare existing approaches and advances in da applications to the surface water quality modeling as well as identify future research prospects in this work we first review the application of each da methods then discuss the factors of da performance and finally highlight research gaps and opportunities in da application in surface water quality modelling 2 data assimilation applications in surface water quality models table 1 summarizes the reported da applications for the water quality modeling da applications started with batch systems simulated with ordinary differential equations where flow was not considered explicitly dissolved oxygen biological oxygen demand and chlorophyll a concentrations were the primary i e response variables of interest as the interest to managing water quality in large water bodies increased da applications have been developed for hydrodynamic models e g efdc the environmental fluids dynamics code delft3d waq alge and 3dhed and watershed water quality models e g hspf hydrologic simulation system fortran epa 2018b and coupled p model efdc and hspf are most often found in literature these two models typify the model classes that have been of primary interest to water quality da the efdc can simulate water flow and water quality constituent transport in geometrically and dynamically complex water bodies such as rivers stratified estuaries lakes and coastal seas the code is capable of simulating salinity temperature sediment contaminant and eutrophication variables on the other hand the hspf is a continuous simulation lumped parameter watershed scale model any time step minimum of 1 min can be used although the typical time step used is 1 h the subbasin is subdivided into hydrological response units defined as relatively homogeneous areas based on land use and hydrologic properties of both pervious and impervious land which hspf can simulate separately most of the recently used models are scalable and they have been applied to simulate streamflow and water quality at different spatial scales from ponds to large complex lakes most modeling work using da concentrated on biotic components of aquatic ecosystems in the last decade da applications in water quality modeling focused on simulations of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms 2 1 data assimilation methods in surface water quality research and management to date three major methods have been utilized to assimilate water quality data into the water quality models table 1 a the variational data assimilation b the extended kalman filter ekf and c ensemble kalman filter enkf the earliest application of data assimilation was published by beck and young 1976 they were the first to introduce the ekf method to explain the relationship between do and bod no applications of ekf have been published after 2009 historically the variational data assimilation was applied in environmental science before ekf and enkf but its surface water quality applications only appeared in 2013 the enkf has become the most popular da method suitable in incorporating multiple source observations currently the particle filter pf method was applied to assimilate do concentration by wang et al 2019 2 2 variational data assimilation the variational data assimilation approach was first introduced to minimize the discrepancy between model outputs and observations in meteorology and oceanography the methods have been actively used to update the state variables from the late 1980s lawless 2013 the objective of this approach is to find the values of update variables x 0 which minimizes the weighted least squares distance to the background non updated modeling result update variables xb plus the weighted least squares distance to the measurement in the assimilation window as shown in fig 1 a the cost function to minimize is 1 j x 0 1 2 x 0 x b t b 1 x 0 x b h x 0 y t r i 1 h x 0 y here x 0 is the vector of update variables which is sought as the result of data assimilation xb is the background values of update variables which is usually the modeling result for the update time b is the covariance matrix of the background error r is the covariance matrix of the observation error h is the observation operator which maps the vector of update variables into the observation space and y is the observation this data assimilation scheme is defined as the 3 dimensional variational data assimilation 3dvar as introduced by sasaki 1958 it is illustrated in fig 1a the 3dvar data assimilation was only recently applied in water quality modeling and was used for updating boundary or initial conditions shao et al 2016 studied da for a one dimensional convective dispersive transport model of the tracer in a river reach with four sampling stations the authors demonstrated that the performance of a water quality model on the fate and transport of contaminants can be improved by introducing the 3dvar data assimilation which resulted in a decrease of almost three times the root mean squared error rmse the da in three dimensional spatial setup was first applied by babbar sebens et al 2013 who used the 3dvar approach for incorporating spatially continuous remote sensing temperature observations from the multi spectral landsat 5 tm band and spatially discrete in situ observations to change initial conditions of the efdc model applied at a eutrophic eagle creek reservoir in central indiana the vector of initial conditions had 300 elements corresponding to different locations at the reservoir water surface and the genetic algorithm was used for minimization of the cost function some features of the 3dvar method require caution in its applications to water quality problems it remains challenging to apply 3dvar in updating both the state variable and the parameters of the water quality models which consist of many different biochemical parameters it has been shown that the 3dvar data assimilation can be inherently unstable if the observation operator is unbounded marx and potthast 2012 high computational cost may impose limitation of the variational assimilation applicability if the observation operator is strongly nonlinear the 4d variational algorithms rabier and liu 2003 that use more observation data within the observation window time are more appropriate application of such algorithms require integration of the additional adjoint model equations so far no applications of these algorithms to water quality modeling were attempted 2 3 the extended kalman filter ekf the extended kalman filter ekf was obtained by modifying the original kalman filter method using empirical assumptions beck and young 1976 young 1974 the original kalman filter linearizes the estimation of mean and covariance while the ekf is the nonlinear version of kalman filter the ekf includes two steps forecast and analysis that are carried out for each time interval between two updates as illustrated in fig 1b the ekf creates the background vector of update variables x j f at a time j from the previous time step x j 1 a 2 x j f f x j 1 a where f is the nonlinear water quality model it also quantifies the uncertainty of the estimate i e the system error or model error covariance p j from the previous time step during the analysis step the ekf obtains the vector of update variables x j a from x j f using the observation yj as follows 3 x j a x j f k j y j h x j f here h is the observation operator which maps the vector of update variables into the observation space and kj is the kalman filter matrix defined as 4 k j p j h j t h j p j b h j t r j 1 here pj is the error covariance matrix for update variables at time j and rj is the covariance matrix of the measurement error the ekf had been applied during the 1970s and 1980s with simple water quality models to estimate the model parameters and elucidate the performance of the models in 1976 beck and young initiated the application of ekf to the interaction of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand in a river they compared the performance of three relevant models and their kinetic parameters including reaeration and decay rate this study was the first to demonstrate the ability of ekf to provide valuable insight on model structure identification also it underscored the ekf limitations in terms of statistically ineffective estimation of parameters the usefulness of the ekf for evaluating model adequacy was further investigated by cosby and hornberger 1984 who estimated do associated parameters in photosynthesis light models for aquatic systems five different models generated synthetic data the random error was applied to modeling results and to parameters ekf application led to the absence of errors of type i i e failing to identify the correct model and errors of type ii i e preferring the incorrect model the effect of the inherent variability of water quality attribute chlorophyll a chl a on the efficiency of ekf was investigated by whitehead and hornberger 1984 with data on algae populations in the river thames the ekf method was applied to estimate nine algae related parameters resulting in either an incorrect estimation or a collinearity among parameters the generalized sensitivity analysis selected three of the most significant parameters e g algal growth rate a power term on the self shading factor and the optimal solar radiation before applying the ekf for the parameter estimation this approach effectively resolved the issues and was recommended to make reliable forecasts on algae behavior further research on the use of ekf to update parameters in a do chlorophyll model from the high frequency field measurements was reported by pastres et al 2003 for the lagoon of venice these authors concluded that ekf has proved to be a useful tool for the updating of the estimates of the parameters of a simple do chlorophyll model which can be used for linking the high frequency data to meteorological forcings such as solar radiation and wind and to other low frequency measurements of water quality parameters such as the concentrations of chl a and nutrients in particular by applying ekf they found that the do dynamic was not very sensitive to the tidal effect in the lagoon the reduced order iterated ekf roiekf the dimension reduced form of ekf proposed by cane et al 1996 was first introduced to include remote sensing observations in the simulation of water quality in a finnish lake voutilainen et al 2007 the filtering approach combined prior information of water quality from an evolution model with tss chl and cdom from remote sensing instruments attempting better estimation of water quality in the data processing they simply assumed the gaussian distribution of the system and the observation error of three water quality parameters in the evolution model but did not include the model parameters as the source of uncertainty the better performance of the filtering approach than the conventional least square method was demonstrated in this work the first ekf application with simultaneous state and parameter estimation in water quality modeling was reported by ennola et al 1998 for modeling the zooplankton population filinia longiseta the authors used bootstrap to resample the data from the original measurement dataset and made model runs with the resampled data in an attempt to test the reliability of the method the ekf appeared to be effective in handling the measurement errors by being relatively insensitive to the level of these errors in the study however the authors found two unexpected limitations in applying the ekf to their problem the time delay in the response to the change of parameters and the overcorrection of parameters after a time delay these two limitations which were also observed by argentesi et al 1987 were strongly dependent on the errors ennola et al 1998 recommended that in their case the method needed relatively good data the noise of single samples should be at most 25 to 40 and the sampling interval should also be short enough for the changes in population dynamics to be detected another example of ekf application with joint update of state and model parameters is provided in the work of mao et al 2009 who used the advanced ecosystem model to explain the algal bloom events in a marine fish culture zone in hong kong they found that the performance of ekf for chl a was highly influenced by sampling intervals and prediction lead times measurement frequencies could be unequal for different water quality attributes e g the more frequent do data could compensate for smaller frequency of algal biomass measurements overall the ekf has been successfully applied to update the state vector and the model parameters of various water quality related models with aquatic systems spanning the complexity range from relatively simple do dynamics to zooplankton behavior table 1 the primary advantages of the method are that it allows the estimation of the temporal trajectory of model parameters and allows one to directly see the influence of forcings on the model outputs the gaussianity assumption for model and measurement errors can be unrealistic the linearization in the ekf can introduce uncontrollable errors when strong nonlinearities exist in addition if the initial estimate of the state is wrong or if the process is modeled incorrectly the filter may quickly diverge owing this to its linearization another problem with the ekf is that the estimated covariance matrix tends to underestimate the true covariance matrix and therefore risks become inconsistent in the statistical sense without the addition of stabilizing noise huang et al 2008 maintaining the covariance matrix of the model errors may be computationally expensive in cases of many assimilation locations and can be subject to errors related to the nonlinearity of the model 2 4 ensemble kalman filter enkf the ensemble kalman filter was introduced to alleviate conceptual and computational problems related to the determination of the model error covariance matrix p in eq 4 enkf approximates the model error covariance matrix with the sample covariance matrix obtained from the ensemble of model runs evensen 1994 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 fig 1c shows the schematics of enkf operation each ensemble includes a set of possible model trajectories and their distribution serves as the source of information to find the covariance matrix of update the state variable p that is used in the kalman filter eq 4 fig 2 illustrates the typical procedure of enkf application with the water quality model chen et al 2019 here the model was initialized and then run with each ensemble member to estimate the covariance matrix mentioned above this procedure is applied until the end of the simulation period is reached the enkf is currently the most popular technique of data assimilation in water quality studies especially when the data sources are remote sensing platforms in the first application of enkf meris sensor data on suspended particulate matter was assimilated in the sediment transport model delft3d waq el serafy et al 2007 it was applied to assimilate the landsat 7 tm surface water temperature data in the efdc model javaheri et al 2016 modis imagery data on tss was assimilated in the sediment transport module of the alge hydrodynamic model vodacek et al 2008 assimilating data from multiple sources with enkf was found beneficial page et al 2018 used buoy and water quality observations to assimilate them into the phytoplankton community model protech chen et al 2019 assimilated multiple source data in situ and remote sensing measurements into the three dimensional hydro ecological dynamics 3dhed model targeting the cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu kim et al 2014a expanded application of the enkf to the assimilation of observations of the multiple water quality parameters po4 p and chl a in the efdc model coupled with the hspf model the number of ensemble members affects results of the enkf applications too small ensembles can cause underestimation of error variances and overestimation of error cross covariance for the variable update i e analysis of states in the model to address these problems various techniques are used to perform the variance inflation i e increase of variance of the update variables obtained from the ensemble members and variance localization i e reduction of the kalman gain matrix in 4 javaheri et al 2016 applied covariance inflation and covariance localization in enkf to assimilate the multi spectral landsat 5 tm band temperature data in 300 locations experimentation is required to choose parameters of the covariance adjustment procedures the large size of the covariance matrices may make results of minimization of the cost function sensitive to noise the maximum likelihood ensemble filter mlef method addresses this problem by preconditioning i e transformation that replaces the minimization of traditional cost function by the minimization procedure that is less sensitive to noise kim et al 2014b and riazi et al 2016 used the mlef to forecast multiple water quality variables and flow using the hspf and demonstrated that this da method can effectively deal with highly nonlinear hydrological and biochemical observation equations 2 5 particle filter pf the 3dvar ekf and enkf assume the gaussianity of the error statistics for both a priori estimate i e background field xb and observation the gaussianity assumption however is not necessarily correct because it is not adequate for inherently nonnegative variables in environmental fields this assumption can be unrealistic for a highly nonlinear feature of water quality e g nonlinear algal responses from various environments in an aquatic system one way to address this problem is to use the particle filter pf method which is based on the sequential monte carlo smc simulations and is proposed as an alternative of the kalman filter based method the pf uses the full prior probability function pdf without any assumptions on the form of prior pdf the pf represents the posterior density function using several independent random samples this method has been broadly used in hydrological modeling studies for a long time moradkhani et al 2005 weerts and el serafy 2006 and discussion in water quality modeling about its applicability has started huang et al 2013 margvelashvili et al 2010 franssen and neuweiler 2015 noted that the future hybrid approaches of enkf and pf method will be increasingly applied and further developed currently wang et al 2019 demonstrated that the pf method is an effective method for assimilation of a 15 min do observation data in the seine river system in addition it was able to identify the temporal variation of phytoplankton communities by estimating the optimal temperature for the growth of phytoplankton 3 the timeline of da applications in water quality modeling fig 3 presents the timeline of changes in water quality model types and data assimilation methods the milestones were the change in the dimensions of the flow model introduction of the extended kalman filter applications start of using da to support operational decisions in water quality management use of remote sensing data demonstration of the applicability of the 3dvar da method introduction of the mlef technique and beginning to use da in watershed scale modeling current application of the pf method evolution of the da supported modeling followed the availability of new types of data and quantifying their uncertainty 4 influence of data and model uncertainty on da process water sampling in situ measurements with sensors and remote sensing data have been employed in projects that included water quality data assimilation both analytical errors and environmental variability contribute to the uncertainty in observations per se and to the uncertainty of the conversion of measurements to the update variables the mismatch between spatial and temporal domains of measurement and modeling presents the major difficulty in data assimilation for water quality modeling babbar sebens et al 2013 assimilated satellite and sensor temperature data in a water quality model and commented that since the spatial resolution is smaller for tm images than the model grid system the unit pixel for each data set would be mismatched in spatial scale for example when two data sets were overlapped with each other there would be more than one pixel laid over the single model grid cell when the random locations were picked the corresponding value extracted from the tm images would not necessarily be the dominant pixel value located within its model grid size similarly when identifying the in situ measurement locations the corresponding values would not necessarily be dominant pixel values located within its model grid size also there are substantially inaccurate representations of remote sensing observations on water bodies which are smaller than the pixel size of the satellite image high uncertainty can also be encountered at the edge of the physical boundaries of water bodies since each cell in the observation includes the composite information from land and water the subgrid heterogeneity can complicate imagery data assimilation balsamo et al 2018 an example of such heterogeneity is shown in fig 4 with drone based imagery data for phycocyanin distribution in the deachung reservoir korea kwon et al 2020 homogeneity of scenes in boxes of 1 and 2 is reflected in symmetrical distributions and the average is expected to give a good representation of the aggregated information for the whole grid cell pixel the heterogeneous scene 3 has the distribution of the subgrid reflectance that is far from symmetrical and no univocal judgement can be made about the aggregation rule for further assimilation the mismatch of model and measurement scale in the vertical direction presents another issue that needs to be researched for assimilation of the remote sensing data in water quality models vertical gradients in top 20 25 cm layer in fresh water sources can be very high due to steep changes in water absorbance with depth e g maraccini et al 2016 the layer depth reflected in remote sensing based estimates of water quality parameters differs depending on the type of parameter and properties of the water body giardino et al 2015 used airborne imaging spectrometry and bio optical algorithms to retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter chlorophyll a and colored dissolved organic matter they validated retrievals with data acquired from the top 1 m layer in the study lake on the other hand javaheri et al 2019 found substantial biases in remotely sensed observations of temperature in surface water with landsat 7 and removed these biases before the actual data assimilation steps were conducted el serafy et al 2007 emphasized the need to account for the optical depth of the remote sensing products to remove the discrepancies between the remote sensing observations and the model output temporal stability i e presence of a persistent spatial pattern in deviations from average was observed for various water quality parameters examples for concentrations of the fecal indicator organism escherichia coli can be found in pachepsky et al 2017 and stocker et al 2019 this creates the spatially dependent bias that must be removed before the covariance matrix of errors are built if this bias is not removed the naïve computation of the covariance matrix for da purposes will result in overly high values feng et al 2011 the bias needs to be removed because all da methods usually assume a zero mean white noise error javaheri et al 2016 the bias correction may need to be applied to modeling results too the bias caused by structural deficiencies of the model can result in physically meaningless update variable values of a water quality model after data assimilation update eyre 2016 riazi et al 2016 used the mlef data assimilation algorithm with the hspf water quality model and employed the statistical bias correction procedure to account for systematic errors so that the da solution may be found within the dynamic range of the model the linear relationship between the truth and model prediction was used for the correction the determination of the slope and the intercept of those equation was independent on the da update and da was applied with and without bias correction to analyze the effect of this correction both spatial bias and model bias were removed in surface water temperature values in the work of javaheri et al 2019 before the remote sensing data assimilation update was applied it is notoriously difficult to evaluate the uncertainty of modeling results if system uncertainty that arises from the structural errors in the model lawless 2013 in an application of the 3dvar method shao et al 2016 suggested the use of the applied national meteorological center nmc method to estimate the background error covariance referring to the work of parrish and derber 1992 the method consists in approximation of the background variances by the variance of simulation results for consecutive update times in ekf applications cosby and hornberger 1984 assumed that the covariance matrix of system error can be obtained from either the variance of the innovations or the gain for a given r matrix pastres et al 2003 estimated the constant q using a preliminary two step analysis which utilized the time series of the residuals and measurements reports on assimilating data from multiple sources appear to be contradictory babbar sebens et al 2013 assimilated temperature data from satellite observations and from in situ measurements and found that improvements with respect to data from one data source occurred in parallel with worsening results with respect to another source the authors explain it by spatial and temporal mismatch between the two sources on other hand chen et al 2019 assimilated in situ and satellite data relevant to modeling of harmful algal blooms and found that multi source data was helpful in improving the model performance the enkf method is designed to obtain the uncertainty of modeling results explicitly from the ensemble simulations the number of ensemble members can be limited due to the heavy computational load of the 3 dimensional modeling javaheri et al 2019 proposed to create small ensembles by perturbing the inputs and model initial conditions via the latin hypercube sampling method in such case the covariance matrix of modeling results can be inaccurate kim et al 2014b demonstrated that the information about the usefulness of da can be obtained even with limited knowledge about the model result uncertainty however small ensembles in some cases have caused divergence and spurious correlations javaheri et al 2016 kim et al 2014b indicated that the application of the maximum likelihood ensemble filter includes the computation of the information matrix that allows the ensemble size to be judged overall the effect of the ensemble size on the assimilation results must be researched for the task in hands 5 updating state variables and or parameters and its influence on da performance the subsequent studies with ekf have generated the state parameter vectors to simultaneously update the state variable and the associated parameters whitehead and hornberger 1984 and cosby and hornberger 1984 explored the uncertainty of algae associated parameters to determine the state variable i e do concentrations they choose three significant parameters selected by the sensitivity analysis pastres et al 2003 also applied a sensitivity analysis to select important parameters and included one state variable do into the state parameter vector mao et al 2009 updated eight water quality variables and two most important parameters algal growth rate and settling velocity which were identified by a sensitivity analysis huang et al 2013 used the hydrodynamic phytoplankton model that included a total of 15 parameters with the most sensitive parameter being the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton considering the heavy computational burden due to the high spatial resolution 250 m 250 m and a relatively large ensemble size 100 of enkf only the most sensitive parameter was updated in this enkf application however updating the model parameters did not always produce the improvement of da performance fig 5 illustrates the absolute error of chl a generated from three different da strategies showing that updating the parameter does not improve the modeling result and the parameter uncertainty is relatively insignificant to other uncertainties e g model structure and forcing input huang and gao 2017 divided the year of 2014 into 24 sub periods and then investigated the two sensitive parameters for each sub period to be assimilated in the enkf of the coupled phosphorus p model they found much improved da results with the parameter dynamic than da results without the parameter dynamic some researchers reported results of updating water quality variables that have not been measured along with other variables that were measured kim et al 2014a simulated river hydrodynamics and water quality although only chl a data was involved in the assimilation phosphate was selected among other water quality variables for update to evaluate the effect of chl a assimilation on those variables it turned out that the phosphate simulation was not improved by the chl a data which was due to weak correlation between the two variables in the model ensemble mao et al 2009 applied data assimilation in modeling of algal bloom and observed that more frequent do data can compensate for less frequent algal biomass measurements estimating uncertainty of model parameters as well as boundary conditions is much more difficult than that of state variables huang et al 2013 noted that such estimates are mostly determined empirically e g with a certain percent of the initial value 5 35 of the initial value was generally used as the relative standard deviation of the observational error considering that phytoplankton varies significantly even in the short term in lake taihu the authors used 35 of the initial value as the standard deviation of the observational error the standard deviation of maximum growth rate of phytoplankton was empirically set as 0 1 that is large enough to account for its uncertainty the noise added to the forcing data was proportional to their magnitudes the proportionality factor was set to 0 1 that was assumed to be reasonable to describe uncertainty from forcing data 6 influence of frequency of updates and forecast skill on da process the da performance is very sensitive to the update time interval kim et al 2014b performed the sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal assimilation window and found 7 days to be sufficient for the watershed scale modeling in simulations of the algal bloom dynamics mao et al 2009 assimilated environmental data from multiple sources which had different observations frequency chlorophyll 1 day interval do 2 hour hydro meteorological data 1 hour and nutrient data bi weekly the ekf performance was evaluated for lower frequency of chl a 1 2 and 3 day and frequency of do 6 12 and 24 hour in general longer update time interval resulted in lower accuracy of prediction on chl a the authors observed that the do update time interval became very influential in model performance with the 3 day chl a update time interval shorter do sampling time still showed a high correlation but longer do sampling interval resulted in dramatic deterioration of the model performance the update time interval has not necessarily been constant javaheri et al 2019 assimilated multiple sensor water temperature data in the efdc model and applied an adaptive enkf to determine the optimal time to assimilate in situ measurement into the model by introducing the threshold error whenever the error of the model for in situ measurements is greater than the threshold value new in situ measurements were assimilated into the model the deterioration of forecast skills with the forecast time increase was noted by several authors javaheri et al 2019 reported that error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un updated model page et al 2018 determined that there was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods mao et al 2009 found that predictions with 1 to2 dsay lead time were highly correlated with the observations r 0 7 0 9 the correlation stayed at a high level for a lead time of 3 days r 0 6 0 7 hydrodynamic modeling may affect the suitability of update intervals for the water quality assessment kim et al 2014a found that the influence of da applied to the efdc simulating river water quality did not last for a long time in the upper reaches of the river where the flow velocity is relatively high 7 outlook challenges and opportunities data assimilation is becoming a staple in water quality management riazi et al 2016 romas et al 2018 table 1 shows that da is applied to different target variables of water quality control the availability of monitoring data defines the usability of the da for example the da can be especially efficient in modeling of the spread of waterborne pathogenic organisms because the extensive monitoring data become available in case of outbreaks successful applications of data assimilation in water quality modeling can stimulate research directed towards further improvements the number of possible data sources for data assimilation in water quality modeling is steadily growing currently unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with optical sensors became popular for environmental monitoring due to their high spatial resolutions kislik et al 2018 the drone borne hyperspectral imagery has sub meter spatial resolution fig 6 and optical resolutions on water quality that satellite and airborne imagery cannot provide the uav with optical sensors have been recently adopted for monitoring algal blooms in surface water bodies and demonstrated its ability to quantify algal species using various indexes including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi green leaf index gli and algal bloom detection index ai goldberg et al 2016 honkavaara et al 2013 jang et al 2016 kim et al 2016 su and chou 2015 xu et al 2018 images from uavs promise to be excellent resources of data that can be assimilated into water quality models data uncertainty topics are critical for the efficiency of the data assimilation and research is required not only spatial but also temporal mismatch between observations and models may need to be resolved availability of high frequency measurements may result in time steps of model encompassing several measurement time steps it is not obvious what statistic of the measurement dataset obtained during the model time step should be used in comparisons of modeling results obtained during this time step both temporal and spatial scales may be different for different types of data when multiple data sources are used in da the data assimilation algorithms have many modifications that account for the specifics of the problem at hand off the shelf versions will not necessarily work in a satisfactory manner the conversion of update variables to observations reflected by the observation operator h in eqs 1 and 4 may have an uncertainty strongly dependent on the range of the update variable values as controlled by the sensitivity of the sensor the influence of missing data on data assimilation results is not known and needs to be clarified the structural uncertainty of the model can be caused by its hydrology hydrodynamics module that limits the efficiency of the data assimilation applied to chemical and biological parameters i e riazi et al 2016 another limitation may arise due to the effect of the update frequency on the improvement of the model performance after da preliminary experimentation with da before application presents a worthy research topic most of da applications were developed using the hspf model for watersheds and the efdc for water bodies table 1 other models that are perfect candidates for da applications are as follows drainmod skaggs et al 2012 prose even et al 1998 flipo et al 2004 vilmin et al 2015 agnps young et al 1989 swat swat 2020 in watershed water quality modeling and dyresm hamilton and schladow 1997 protech reynolds et al 2001 or hype lindström et al 2010 for modeling water bodies besides as the frameworks supporting modularity in water quality modeling are being developed whelan et al 2014 the opportunities for da applications will increase the uncertainty in model predictions are in part dependent on model structure and it is possible that the efficiency of the da may be one of the criteria for the model selection the sensitivity analysis is expected play an influential role in controlling the da efficiency if the joint state and parameter updates are undertaken selecting parameters to update may lead to more robust da results we did not find published examples of applying the sensitivity analysis in conjunction with da there appears to be a need in research on combining the da and the sensitivity analysis 8 conclusion the number of the papers on data assimilation in water quality modeling is relatively small each of these papers summarizes a large project specifically focused on da application however the volume of the da applications in the water quality arena can be much larger most of modeling works that involve calibration with monitoring data provide material for the data assimilation studies such studies can provide the valuable information about the possible time dependence of model parameters as well as about reliability of calibration results the data assimilation in water quality modeling is steadily developing each of applications of data assimilation in water quality modeling has provided useful insights into the functioning of complex aquatic systems data assimilation is an efficient means of model accuracy improvement it also offers the opportunity of tracking parameter changes in the varying environment the possibility to improve the knowledge about the system with each new observation enriches monitoring information and may help to guide and correct the monitoring program explicit accounting for uncertainties in data and models will help to reach informed decisions on managing water quality lately da applications have begun to address regulatory and management needs with watershed scale hydrological and 3d hydrodynamic models acquiring improved water quality components data acquisition capabilities for the da in water quality arena are steadily improving especially in applications to harmful algal blooms where new remote sensing and proximal sensing platforms offer a treasure trove on useful information the multisource da has been tried research appears to be needed on unresolved issues concerning compatibility in space and time between model resolution data resolution and data from different sources more insight must be gained on data uncertainty of key da input also an understanding needs to be developed on how the absence of monitoring influential compartments of aquatic systems such as bottom sediments and periphyton affect the performance of da on water quality

17506,data assimilation da techniques are powerful means of dynamic natural system modeling that allow for the use of data as soon as it appears to improve model predictions and reduce prediction uncertainty by correcting state variables model parameters and boundary and initial conditions the objectives of this review are to explore existing approaches and advances in da applications for surface water quality modeling and to identify future research prospects we first reviewed the da methods used in water quality modeling as reported in literature we then addressed observations and suggestions regarding various factors of da performance such as the mismatch between both lateral and vertical spatial detail of measurements and modeling subgrid heterogeneity presence of temporally stable spatial patterns in water quality parameters and related biases evaluation of uncertainty in data and modeling results mismatch between scales and schedules of data from multiple sources selection of parameters to be updated along with state variables update frequency and forecast skill the review concludes with the outlook section that outlines current challenges and opportunities related to growing role of novel data sources scale mismatch between model discretization and observation structural uncertainty of models and conversion of measured to simulated vales experimentation with da prior to applications using da performance or model selection the role of sensitivity analysis and the expanding use of da in water quality management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality model data assimilation variational data assimilation extended kalman filter ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction a water quality model is the mathematical representation of pollutant fate and transport within a water body that may be coupled with a mathematical representation of the movement of pollutants from land movement of pollutants from land based sources to a water body kebede 2009 the water quality models include description of physical chemical and biological mechanisms affecting fate and transport of pollutants surface water quality models are critically important tools for managing our nations surface waters as they help local communities and environmental managers better understand how surface waters change in response to pollution and how to protect them water quality specialists use models for many purposes such as assessing water quality conditions and causes of impairment predicting how surface waters will respond to changes in their watersheds and the environment e g future growth climate change and forecasting quantitative benefits of new surface water protection policies epa 2018 streeter and phelps 1925 firstly introduced their model as a solution of the first order differential equation to simulate do decline by the decomposition of organic matters and do increased by reaeration water quality modeling has since advanced from considering a simple first order decomposition of organic matter to a complex multiple biochemically mediated processes from point source models to both point and nonpoint sources as well as from 1 dimensional steady state models to 3 dimensional dynamic models wang et al 2013 in this regard the number of model parameters considerably increased thereby increasing the prediction uncertainty it was eventually realized that the optimal estimates of the evolving water quality attributes should be obtained by jointly considering the outputs of the model with the data from ongoing observations this can be achieved by using mathematical techniques of data assimilation da and their computational implementations asch et al 2016 fletcher 2017 the data assimilation da is the methodology whereby observational data are combined with output from a numerical model to produce an optimal estimate of the evolving state and or parameters of the system o neill 2003 as new observations of a water quality become available the da may include updates of state variables e g dissolved oxygen concentration or phytoplankton biomass model parameters e g decomposition or reaeration rate and boundary conditions e g tributary input to the modeled water body the da allows us to update modeling results and or achieve model improvements each time new observations become available the update is based on the consideration of the uncertainties in data and in model predictions the more certain measurement data are and the less certain modeling results are the closer the modeling results become to measurements after updates the status of the pollution is simulated as the spatio temporal variation of the pollutant concentrations and water quality attributes that affect the fate of pollutants these concentrations and attributes are the state variables of the modeled aquatic systems coefficients in the surface water quality models describe the site specific conditions they are known as model parameters the da has drawn much attention in surface hydrology wherein review works and monographs analyzed the da potential to improve the hydrologic model performance montzka et al 2012 moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 park and xu 2013 its applications to water quality modeling have slower developments than its applications in hydrology robinson and lermusiaux 2000 sun et al 2016 partly because it was quite challenging to carry out real time and high frequency monitoring of water quality at multiple locations beginning from 2005 the total annual number of peer reviewed publications on water quality modeling steadily increased by about a hundred data from the scopus database this growth occurred due to multiple reasons which includes the development of remote sensing algorithms in situ sensors advances in the modeling of water bodies progress in understanding processes affecting water quality regulatory actions and development of pre and post processing capabilities around the same timeframe the da was applied for the first time to the three dimensional water quality model for a large natural water body vodacek et al 2008 since then various da methods were utilized in modeling various types of natural water constituents with the most recent focus on harmful algae blooms loos et al 2020 various da applications in the surface water models may include updates of state variables e g dissolved oxygen concentration or phytoplankton biomass model parameters e g dissolved organic matter decomposition rate and boundary conditions e g the tributary input to the main stream while the water quality modeling in general was extensively reviewed cho et al 2016 ji 2017 wellen et al 2015 reviews of da in water quality modeling have not been published there is a need for a systematic state of the art presentation of this fast developing field the currently published research allows one to evaluate and compare existing approaches and advances in da applications to the surface water quality modeling as well as identify future research prospects in this work we first review the application of each da methods then discuss the factors of da performance and finally highlight research gaps and opportunities in da application in surface water quality modelling 2 data assimilation applications in surface water quality models table 1 summarizes the reported da applications for the water quality modeling da applications started with batch systems simulated with ordinary differential equations where flow was not considered explicitly dissolved oxygen biological oxygen demand and chlorophyll a concentrations were the primary i e response variables of interest as the interest to managing water quality in large water bodies increased da applications have been developed for hydrodynamic models e g efdc the environmental fluids dynamics code delft3d waq alge and 3dhed and watershed water quality models e g hspf hydrologic simulation system fortran epa 2018b and coupled p model efdc and hspf are most often found in literature these two models typify the model classes that have been of primary interest to water quality da the efdc can simulate water flow and water quality constituent transport in geometrically and dynamically complex water bodies such as rivers stratified estuaries lakes and coastal seas the code is capable of simulating salinity temperature sediment contaminant and eutrophication variables on the other hand the hspf is a continuous simulation lumped parameter watershed scale model any time step minimum of 1 min can be used although the typical time step used is 1 h the subbasin is subdivided into hydrological response units defined as relatively homogeneous areas based on land use and hydrologic properties of both pervious and impervious land which hspf can simulate separately most of the recently used models are scalable and they have been applied to simulate streamflow and water quality at different spatial scales from ponds to large complex lakes most modeling work using da concentrated on biotic components of aquatic ecosystems in the last decade da applications in water quality modeling focused on simulations of eutrophication and harmful algal blooms 2 1 data assimilation methods in surface water quality research and management to date three major methods have been utilized to assimilate water quality data into the water quality models table 1 a the variational data assimilation b the extended kalman filter ekf and c ensemble kalman filter enkf the earliest application of data assimilation was published by beck and young 1976 they were the first to introduce the ekf method to explain the relationship between do and bod no applications of ekf have been published after 2009 historically the variational data assimilation was applied in environmental science before ekf and enkf but its surface water quality applications only appeared in 2013 the enkf has become the most popular da method suitable in incorporating multiple source observations currently the particle filter pf method was applied to assimilate do concentration by wang et al 2019 2 2 variational data assimilation the variational data assimilation approach was first introduced to minimize the discrepancy between model outputs and observations in meteorology and oceanography the methods have been actively used to update the state variables from the late 1980s lawless 2013 the objective of this approach is to find the values of update variables x 0 which minimizes the weighted least squares distance to the background non updated modeling result update variables xb plus the weighted least squares distance to the measurement in the assimilation window as shown in fig 1 a the cost function to minimize is 1 j x 0 1 2 x 0 x b t b 1 x 0 x b h x 0 y t r i 1 h x 0 y here x 0 is the vector of update variables which is sought as the result of data assimilation xb is the background values of update variables which is usually the modeling result for the update time b is the covariance matrix of the background error r is the covariance matrix of the observation error h is the observation operator which maps the vector of update variables into the observation space and y is the observation this data assimilation scheme is defined as the 3 dimensional variational data assimilation 3dvar as introduced by sasaki 1958 it is illustrated in fig 1a the 3dvar data assimilation was only recently applied in water quality modeling and was used for updating boundary or initial conditions shao et al 2016 studied da for a one dimensional convective dispersive transport model of the tracer in a river reach with four sampling stations the authors demonstrated that the performance of a water quality model on the fate and transport of contaminants can be improved by introducing the 3dvar data assimilation which resulted in a decrease of almost three times the root mean squared error rmse the da in three dimensional spatial setup was first applied by babbar sebens et al 2013 who used the 3dvar approach for incorporating spatially continuous remote sensing temperature observations from the multi spectral landsat 5 tm band and spatially discrete in situ observations to change initial conditions of the efdc model applied at a eutrophic eagle creek reservoir in central indiana the vector of initial conditions had 300 elements corresponding to different locations at the reservoir water surface and the genetic algorithm was used for minimization of the cost function some features of the 3dvar method require caution in its applications to water quality problems it remains challenging to apply 3dvar in updating both the state variable and the parameters of the water quality models which consist of many different biochemical parameters it has been shown that the 3dvar data assimilation can be inherently unstable if the observation operator is unbounded marx and potthast 2012 high computational cost may impose limitation of the variational assimilation applicability if the observation operator is strongly nonlinear the 4d variational algorithms rabier and liu 2003 that use more observation data within the observation window time are more appropriate application of such algorithms require integration of the additional adjoint model equations so far no applications of these algorithms to water quality modeling were attempted 2 3 the extended kalman filter ekf the extended kalman filter ekf was obtained by modifying the original kalman filter method using empirical assumptions beck and young 1976 young 1974 the original kalman filter linearizes the estimation of mean and covariance while the ekf is the nonlinear version of kalman filter the ekf includes two steps forecast and analysis that are carried out for each time interval between two updates as illustrated in fig 1b the ekf creates the background vector of update variables x j f at a time j from the previous time step x j 1 a 2 x j f f x j 1 a where f is the nonlinear water quality model it also quantifies the uncertainty of the estimate i e the system error or model error covariance p j from the previous time step during the analysis step the ekf obtains the vector of update variables x j a from x j f using the observation yj as follows 3 x j a x j f k j y j h x j f here h is the observation operator which maps the vector of update variables into the observation space and kj is the kalman filter matrix defined as 4 k j p j h j t h j p j b h j t r j 1 here pj is the error covariance matrix for update variables at time j and rj is the covariance matrix of the measurement error the ekf had been applied during the 1970s and 1980s with simple water quality models to estimate the model parameters and elucidate the performance of the models in 1976 beck and young initiated the application of ekf to the interaction of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand in a river they compared the performance of three relevant models and their kinetic parameters including reaeration and decay rate this study was the first to demonstrate the ability of ekf to provide valuable insight on model structure identification also it underscored the ekf limitations in terms of statistically ineffective estimation of parameters the usefulness of the ekf for evaluating model adequacy was further investigated by cosby and hornberger 1984 who estimated do associated parameters in photosynthesis light models for aquatic systems five different models generated synthetic data the random error was applied to modeling results and to parameters ekf application led to the absence of errors of type i i e failing to identify the correct model and errors of type ii i e preferring the incorrect model the effect of the inherent variability of water quality attribute chlorophyll a chl a on the efficiency of ekf was investigated by whitehead and hornberger 1984 with data on algae populations in the river thames the ekf method was applied to estimate nine algae related parameters resulting in either an incorrect estimation or a collinearity among parameters the generalized sensitivity analysis selected three of the most significant parameters e g algal growth rate a power term on the self shading factor and the optimal solar radiation before applying the ekf for the parameter estimation this approach effectively resolved the issues and was recommended to make reliable forecasts on algae behavior further research on the use of ekf to update parameters in a do chlorophyll model from the high frequency field measurements was reported by pastres et al 2003 for the lagoon of venice these authors concluded that ekf has proved to be a useful tool for the updating of the estimates of the parameters of a simple do chlorophyll model which can be used for linking the high frequency data to meteorological forcings such as solar radiation and wind and to other low frequency measurements of water quality parameters such as the concentrations of chl a and nutrients in particular by applying ekf they found that the do dynamic was not very sensitive to the tidal effect in the lagoon the reduced order iterated ekf roiekf the dimension reduced form of ekf proposed by cane et al 1996 was first introduced to include remote sensing observations in the simulation of water quality in a finnish lake voutilainen et al 2007 the filtering approach combined prior information of water quality from an evolution model with tss chl and cdom from remote sensing instruments attempting better estimation of water quality in the data processing they simply assumed the gaussian distribution of the system and the observation error of three water quality parameters in the evolution model but did not include the model parameters as the source of uncertainty the better performance of the filtering approach than the conventional least square method was demonstrated in this work the first ekf application with simultaneous state and parameter estimation in water quality modeling was reported by ennola et al 1998 for modeling the zooplankton population filinia longiseta the authors used bootstrap to resample the data from the original measurement dataset and made model runs with the resampled data in an attempt to test the reliability of the method the ekf appeared to be effective in handling the measurement errors by being relatively insensitive to the level of these errors in the study however the authors found two unexpected limitations in applying the ekf to their problem the time delay in the response to the change of parameters and the overcorrection of parameters after a time delay these two limitations which were also observed by argentesi et al 1987 were strongly dependent on the errors ennola et al 1998 recommended that in their case the method needed relatively good data the noise of single samples should be at most 25 to 40 and the sampling interval should also be short enough for the changes in population dynamics to be detected another example of ekf application with joint update of state and model parameters is provided in the work of mao et al 2009 who used the advanced ecosystem model to explain the algal bloom events in a marine fish culture zone in hong kong they found that the performance of ekf for chl a was highly influenced by sampling intervals and prediction lead times measurement frequencies could be unequal for different water quality attributes e g the more frequent do data could compensate for smaller frequency of algal biomass measurements overall the ekf has been successfully applied to update the state vector and the model parameters of various water quality related models with aquatic systems spanning the complexity range from relatively simple do dynamics to zooplankton behavior table 1 the primary advantages of the method are that it allows the estimation of the temporal trajectory of model parameters and allows one to directly see the influence of forcings on the model outputs the gaussianity assumption for model and measurement errors can be unrealistic the linearization in the ekf can introduce uncontrollable errors when strong nonlinearities exist in addition if the initial estimate of the state is wrong or if the process is modeled incorrectly the filter may quickly diverge owing this to its linearization another problem with the ekf is that the estimated covariance matrix tends to underestimate the true covariance matrix and therefore risks become inconsistent in the statistical sense without the addition of stabilizing noise huang et al 2008 maintaining the covariance matrix of the model errors may be computationally expensive in cases of many assimilation locations and can be subject to errors related to the nonlinearity of the model 2 4 ensemble kalman filter enkf the ensemble kalman filter was introduced to alleviate conceptual and computational problems related to the determination of the model error covariance matrix p in eq 4 enkf approximates the model error covariance matrix with the sample covariance matrix obtained from the ensemble of model runs evensen 1994 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 fig 1c shows the schematics of enkf operation each ensemble includes a set of possible model trajectories and their distribution serves as the source of information to find the covariance matrix of update the state variable p that is used in the kalman filter eq 4 fig 2 illustrates the typical procedure of enkf application with the water quality model chen et al 2019 here the model was initialized and then run with each ensemble member to estimate the covariance matrix mentioned above this procedure is applied until the end of the simulation period is reached the enkf is currently the most popular technique of data assimilation in water quality studies especially when the data sources are remote sensing platforms in the first application of enkf meris sensor data on suspended particulate matter was assimilated in the sediment transport model delft3d waq el serafy et al 2007 it was applied to assimilate the landsat 7 tm surface water temperature data in the efdc model javaheri et al 2016 modis imagery data on tss was assimilated in the sediment transport module of the alge hydrodynamic model vodacek et al 2008 assimilating data from multiple sources with enkf was found beneficial page et al 2018 used buoy and water quality observations to assimilate them into the phytoplankton community model protech chen et al 2019 assimilated multiple source data in situ and remote sensing measurements into the three dimensional hydro ecological dynamics 3dhed model targeting the cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu kim et al 2014a expanded application of the enkf to the assimilation of observations of the multiple water quality parameters po4 p and chl a in the efdc model coupled with the hspf model the number of ensemble members affects results of the enkf applications too small ensembles can cause underestimation of error variances and overestimation of error cross covariance for the variable update i e analysis of states in the model to address these problems various techniques are used to perform the variance inflation i e increase of variance of the update variables obtained from the ensemble members and variance localization i e reduction of the kalman gain matrix in 4 javaheri et al 2016 applied covariance inflation and covariance localization in enkf to assimilate the multi spectral landsat 5 tm band temperature data in 300 locations experimentation is required to choose parameters of the covariance adjustment procedures the large size of the covariance matrices may make results of minimization of the cost function sensitive to noise the maximum likelihood ensemble filter mlef method addresses this problem by preconditioning i e transformation that replaces the minimization of traditional cost function by the minimization procedure that is less sensitive to noise kim et al 2014b and riazi et al 2016 used the mlef to forecast multiple water quality variables and flow using the hspf and demonstrated that this da method can effectively deal with highly nonlinear hydrological and biochemical observation equations 2 5 particle filter pf the 3dvar ekf and enkf assume the gaussianity of the error statistics for both a priori estimate i e background field xb and observation the gaussianity assumption however is not necessarily correct because it is not adequate for inherently nonnegative variables in environmental fields this assumption can be unrealistic for a highly nonlinear feature of water quality e g nonlinear algal responses from various environments in an aquatic system one way to address this problem is to use the particle filter pf method which is based on the sequential monte carlo smc simulations and is proposed as an alternative of the kalman filter based method the pf uses the full prior probability function pdf without any assumptions on the form of prior pdf the pf represents the posterior density function using several independent random samples this method has been broadly used in hydrological modeling studies for a long time moradkhani et al 2005 weerts and el serafy 2006 and discussion in water quality modeling about its applicability has started huang et al 2013 margvelashvili et al 2010 franssen and neuweiler 2015 noted that the future hybrid approaches of enkf and pf method will be increasingly applied and further developed currently wang et al 2019 demonstrated that the pf method is an effective method for assimilation of a 15 min do observation data in the seine river system in addition it was able to identify the temporal variation of phytoplankton communities by estimating the optimal temperature for the growth of phytoplankton 3 the timeline of da applications in water quality modeling fig 3 presents the timeline of changes in water quality model types and data assimilation methods the milestones were the change in the dimensions of the flow model introduction of the extended kalman filter applications start of using da to support operational decisions in water quality management use of remote sensing data demonstration of the applicability of the 3dvar da method introduction of the mlef technique and beginning to use da in watershed scale modeling current application of the pf method evolution of the da supported modeling followed the availability of new types of data and quantifying their uncertainty 4 influence of data and model uncertainty on da process water sampling in situ measurements with sensors and remote sensing data have been employed in projects that included water quality data assimilation both analytical errors and environmental variability contribute to the uncertainty in observations per se and to the uncertainty of the conversion of measurements to the update variables the mismatch between spatial and temporal domains of measurement and modeling presents the major difficulty in data assimilation for water quality modeling babbar sebens et al 2013 assimilated satellite and sensor temperature data in a water quality model and commented that since the spatial resolution is smaller for tm images than the model grid system the unit pixel for each data set would be mismatched in spatial scale for example when two data sets were overlapped with each other there would be more than one pixel laid over the single model grid cell when the random locations were picked the corresponding value extracted from the tm images would not necessarily be the dominant pixel value located within its model grid size similarly when identifying the in situ measurement locations the corresponding values would not necessarily be dominant pixel values located within its model grid size also there are substantially inaccurate representations of remote sensing observations on water bodies which are smaller than the pixel size of the satellite image high uncertainty can also be encountered at the edge of the physical boundaries of water bodies since each cell in the observation includes the composite information from land and water the subgrid heterogeneity can complicate imagery data assimilation balsamo et al 2018 an example of such heterogeneity is shown in fig 4 with drone based imagery data for phycocyanin distribution in the deachung reservoir korea kwon et al 2020 homogeneity of scenes in boxes of 1 and 2 is reflected in symmetrical distributions and the average is expected to give a good representation of the aggregated information for the whole grid cell pixel the heterogeneous scene 3 has the distribution of the subgrid reflectance that is far from symmetrical and no univocal judgement can be made about the aggregation rule for further assimilation the mismatch of model and measurement scale in the vertical direction presents another issue that needs to be researched for assimilation of the remote sensing data in water quality models vertical gradients in top 20 25 cm layer in fresh water sources can be very high due to steep changes in water absorbance with depth e g maraccini et al 2016 the layer depth reflected in remote sensing based estimates of water quality parameters differs depending on the type of parameter and properties of the water body giardino et al 2015 used airborne imaging spectrometry and bio optical algorithms to retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter chlorophyll a and colored dissolved organic matter they validated retrievals with data acquired from the top 1 m layer in the study lake on the other hand javaheri et al 2019 found substantial biases in remotely sensed observations of temperature in surface water with landsat 7 and removed these biases before the actual data assimilation steps were conducted el serafy et al 2007 emphasized the need to account for the optical depth of the remote sensing products to remove the discrepancies between the remote sensing observations and the model output temporal stability i e presence of a persistent spatial pattern in deviations from average was observed for various water quality parameters examples for concentrations of the fecal indicator organism escherichia coli can be found in pachepsky et al 2017 and stocker et al 2019 this creates the spatially dependent bias that must be removed before the covariance matrix of errors are built if this bias is not removed the naïve computation of the covariance matrix for da purposes will result in overly high values feng et al 2011 the bias needs to be removed because all da methods usually assume a zero mean white noise error javaheri et al 2016 the bias correction may need to be applied to modeling results too the bias caused by structural deficiencies of the model can result in physically meaningless update variable values of a water quality model after data assimilation update eyre 2016 riazi et al 2016 used the mlef data assimilation algorithm with the hspf water quality model and employed the statistical bias correction procedure to account for systematic errors so that the da solution may be found within the dynamic range of the model the linear relationship between the truth and model prediction was used for the correction the determination of the slope and the intercept of those equation was independent on the da update and da was applied with and without bias correction to analyze the effect of this correction both spatial bias and model bias were removed in surface water temperature values in the work of javaheri et al 2019 before the remote sensing data assimilation update was applied it is notoriously difficult to evaluate the uncertainty of modeling results if system uncertainty that arises from the structural errors in the model lawless 2013 in an application of the 3dvar method shao et al 2016 suggested the use of the applied national meteorological center nmc method to estimate the background error covariance referring to the work of parrish and derber 1992 the method consists in approximation of the background variances by the variance of simulation results for consecutive update times in ekf applications cosby and hornberger 1984 assumed that the covariance matrix of system error can be obtained from either the variance of the innovations or the gain for a given r matrix pastres et al 2003 estimated the constant q using a preliminary two step analysis which utilized the time series of the residuals and measurements reports on assimilating data from multiple sources appear to be contradictory babbar sebens et al 2013 assimilated temperature data from satellite observations and from in situ measurements and found that improvements with respect to data from one data source occurred in parallel with worsening results with respect to another source the authors explain it by spatial and temporal mismatch between the two sources on other hand chen et al 2019 assimilated in situ and satellite data relevant to modeling of harmful algal blooms and found that multi source data was helpful in improving the model performance the enkf method is designed to obtain the uncertainty of modeling results explicitly from the ensemble simulations the number of ensemble members can be limited due to the heavy computational load of the 3 dimensional modeling javaheri et al 2019 proposed to create small ensembles by perturbing the inputs and model initial conditions via the latin hypercube sampling method in such case the covariance matrix of modeling results can be inaccurate kim et al 2014b demonstrated that the information about the usefulness of da can be obtained even with limited knowledge about the model result uncertainty however small ensembles in some cases have caused divergence and spurious correlations javaheri et al 2016 kim et al 2014b indicated that the application of the maximum likelihood ensemble filter includes the computation of the information matrix that allows the ensemble size to be judged overall the effect of the ensemble size on the assimilation results must be researched for the task in hands 5 updating state variables and or parameters and its influence on da performance the subsequent studies with ekf have generated the state parameter vectors to simultaneously update the state variable and the associated parameters whitehead and hornberger 1984 and cosby and hornberger 1984 explored the uncertainty of algae associated parameters to determine the state variable i e do concentrations they choose three significant parameters selected by the sensitivity analysis pastres et al 2003 also applied a sensitivity analysis to select important parameters and included one state variable do into the state parameter vector mao et al 2009 updated eight water quality variables and two most important parameters algal growth rate and settling velocity which were identified by a sensitivity analysis huang et al 2013 used the hydrodynamic phytoplankton model that included a total of 15 parameters with the most sensitive parameter being the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton considering the heavy computational burden due to the high spatial resolution 250 m 250 m and a relatively large ensemble size 100 of enkf only the most sensitive parameter was updated in this enkf application however updating the model parameters did not always produce the improvement of da performance fig 5 illustrates the absolute error of chl a generated from three different da strategies showing that updating the parameter does not improve the modeling result and the parameter uncertainty is relatively insignificant to other uncertainties e g model structure and forcing input huang and gao 2017 divided the year of 2014 into 24 sub periods and then investigated the two sensitive parameters for each sub period to be assimilated in the enkf of the coupled phosphorus p model they found much improved da results with the parameter dynamic than da results without the parameter dynamic some researchers reported results of updating water quality variables that have not been measured along with other variables that were measured kim et al 2014a simulated river hydrodynamics and water quality although only chl a data was involved in the assimilation phosphate was selected among other water quality variables for update to evaluate the effect of chl a assimilation on those variables it turned out that the phosphate simulation was not improved by the chl a data which was due to weak correlation between the two variables in the model ensemble mao et al 2009 applied data assimilation in modeling of algal bloom and observed that more frequent do data can compensate for less frequent algal biomass measurements estimating uncertainty of model parameters as well as boundary conditions is much more difficult than that of state variables huang et al 2013 noted that such estimates are mostly determined empirically e g with a certain percent of the initial value 5 35 of the initial value was generally used as the relative standard deviation of the observational error considering that phytoplankton varies significantly even in the short term in lake taihu the authors used 35 of the initial value as the standard deviation of the observational error the standard deviation of maximum growth rate of phytoplankton was empirically set as 0 1 that is large enough to account for its uncertainty the noise added to the forcing data was proportional to their magnitudes the proportionality factor was set to 0 1 that was assumed to be reasonable to describe uncertainty from forcing data 6 influence of frequency of updates and forecast skill on da process the da performance is very sensitive to the update time interval kim et al 2014b performed the sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal assimilation window and found 7 days to be sufficient for the watershed scale modeling in simulations of the algal bloom dynamics mao et al 2009 assimilated environmental data from multiple sources which had different observations frequency chlorophyll 1 day interval do 2 hour hydro meteorological data 1 hour and nutrient data bi weekly the ekf performance was evaluated for lower frequency of chl a 1 2 and 3 day and frequency of do 6 12 and 24 hour in general longer update time interval resulted in lower accuracy of prediction on chl a the authors observed that the do update time interval became very influential in model performance with the 3 day chl a update time interval shorter do sampling time still showed a high correlation but longer do sampling interval resulted in dramatic deterioration of the model performance the update time interval has not necessarily been constant javaheri et al 2019 assimilated multiple sensor water temperature data in the efdc model and applied an adaptive enkf to determine the optimal time to assimilate in situ measurement into the model by introducing the threshold error whenever the error of the model for in situ measurements is greater than the threshold value new in situ measurements were assimilated into the model the deterioration of forecast skills with the forecast time increase was noted by several authors javaheri et al 2019 reported that error in the water temperature predicted by the updated model reverted in less than two days to the same level as that of an un updated model page et al 2018 determined that there was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods mao et al 2009 found that predictions with 1 to2 dsay lead time were highly correlated with the observations r 0 7 0 9 the correlation stayed at a high level for a lead time of 3 days r 0 6 0 7 hydrodynamic modeling may affect the suitability of update intervals for the water quality assessment kim et al 2014a found that the influence of da applied to the efdc simulating river water quality did not last for a long time in the upper reaches of the river where the flow velocity is relatively high 7 outlook challenges and opportunities data assimilation is becoming a staple in water quality management riazi et al 2016 romas et al 2018 table 1 shows that da is applied to different target variables of water quality control the availability of monitoring data defines the usability of the da for example the da can be especially efficient in modeling of the spread of waterborne pathogenic organisms because the extensive monitoring data become available in case of outbreaks successful applications of data assimilation in water quality modeling can stimulate research directed towards further improvements the number of possible data sources for data assimilation in water quality modeling is steadily growing currently unmanned aerial vehicles uavs with optical sensors became popular for environmental monitoring due to their high spatial resolutions kislik et al 2018 the drone borne hyperspectral imagery has sub meter spatial resolution fig 6 and optical resolutions on water quality that satellite and airborne imagery cannot provide the uav with optical sensors have been recently adopted for monitoring algal blooms in surface water bodies and demonstrated its ability to quantify algal species using various indexes including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi green leaf index gli and algal bloom detection index ai goldberg et al 2016 honkavaara et al 2013 jang et al 2016 kim et al 2016 su and chou 2015 xu et al 2018 images from uavs promise to be excellent resources of data that can be assimilated into water quality models data uncertainty topics are critical for the efficiency of the data assimilation and research is required not only spatial but also temporal mismatch between observations and models may need to be resolved availability of high frequency measurements may result in time steps of model encompassing several measurement time steps it is not obvious what statistic of the measurement dataset obtained during the model time step should be used in comparisons of modeling results obtained during this time step both temporal and spatial scales may be different for different types of data when multiple data sources are used in da the data assimilation algorithms have many modifications that account for the specifics of the problem at hand off the shelf versions will not necessarily work in a satisfactory manner the conversion of update variables to observations reflected by the observation operator h in eqs 1 and 4 may have an uncertainty strongly dependent on the range of the update variable values as controlled by the sensitivity of the sensor the influence of missing data on data assimilation results is not known and needs to be clarified the structural uncertainty of the model can be caused by its hydrology hydrodynamics module that limits the efficiency of the data assimilation applied to chemical and biological parameters i e riazi et al 2016 another limitation may arise due to the effect of the update frequency on the improvement of the model performance after da preliminary experimentation with da before application presents a worthy research topic most of da applications were developed using the hspf model for watersheds and the efdc for water bodies table 1 other models that are perfect candidates for da applications are as follows drainmod skaggs et al 2012 prose even et al 1998 flipo et al 2004 vilmin et al 2015 agnps young et al 1989 swat swat 2020 in watershed water quality modeling and dyresm hamilton and schladow 1997 protech reynolds et al 2001 or hype lindström et al 2010 for modeling water bodies besides as the frameworks supporting modularity in water quality modeling are being developed whelan et al 2014 the opportunities for da applications will increase the uncertainty in model predictions are in part dependent on model structure and it is possible that the efficiency of the da may be one of the criteria for the model selection the sensitivity analysis is expected play an influential role in controlling the da efficiency if the joint state and parameter updates are undertaken selecting parameters to update may lead to more robust da results we did not find published examples of applying the sensitivity analysis in conjunction with da there appears to be a need in research on combining the da and the sensitivity analysis 8 conclusion the number of the papers on data assimilation in water quality modeling is relatively small each of these papers summarizes a large project specifically focused on da application however the volume of the da applications in the water quality arena can be much larger most of modeling works that involve calibration with monitoring data provide material for the data assimilation studies such studies can provide the valuable information about the possible time dependence of model parameters as well as about reliability of calibration results the data assimilation in water quality modeling is steadily developing each of applications of data assimilation in water quality modeling has provided useful insights into the functioning of complex aquatic systems data assimilation is an efficient means of model accuracy improvement it also offers the opportunity of tracking parameter changes in the varying environment the possibility to improve the knowledge about the system with each new observation enriches monitoring information and may help to guide and correct the monitoring program explicit accounting for uncertainties in data and models will help to reach informed decisions on managing water quality lately da applications have begun to address regulatory and management needs with watershed scale hydrological and 3d hydrodynamic models acquiring improved water quality components data acquisition capabilities for the da in water quality arena are steadily improving especially in applications to harmful algal blooms where new remote sensing and proximal sensing platforms offer a treasure trove on useful information the multisource da has been tried research appears to be needed on unresolved issues concerning compatibility in space and time between model resolution data resolution and data from different sources more insight must be gained on data uncertainty of key da input also an understanding needs to be developed on how the absence of monitoring influential compartments of aquatic systems such as bottom sediments and periphyton affect the performance of da on water quality

17507,perfluorochemicals pfcs are a set of chemicals containing c f bonds which are concerned due to their bioaccumulation property persistent and toxicological properties photocatalytic approaches have been widely studied for the effective removal of pfcs due to the mild operation conditions this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up to date summary on the homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for pfcs removal specifically the homogenous photocatalytic methods for remediating pfcs are firstly discussed including generation of hydrated electrons eaq and its performance and mechanisms for photo reductive destruction of pfcs the active species responsible for photo oxidative degradation of pfcs and the corresponding mechanisms and metal ion mediated fe iii mainly used processes for the remediation of pfcs the influences of molecular structures of pfcs and water matrix such as dissolved oxygen humic acid nitrate chloride on the homogenous photocatalytic degradation of pfcs are also discussed for heterogeneous photocatalytic processes various semiconductor photocatalysts used for the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are then discussed in terms of their specific properties benefiting photocatalytic performances the preparation methods for optimizing the performance of photocatalysts are also overviewed moreover the photo oxidative and photo reductive pathways are summarized for remediating pfoa in the presences of different semiconductor photocatalysts including active species responsible for the degradation we finally put forward several key perspectives for the photocatalytic removal of pfcs to promote its practical application in pfcs containing wastewater treatment including the treatment of pfcs degradation products such as fluoride ion and the development of noble metal free photocatalysts that could efficiently remove pfcs under solar light irradiation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorochemicals photocatalytic processes homogenous heterogeneous photo oxidative photo reductive 1 introduction pfcs are a set of anthropogenic fluorinated organic compounds hori et al 2006 prevedouros et al 2006 they have been produced since 1940s for numerous industrial applications such as refrigerants polymers pharmaceuticals adhesives insecticides and fire retardants baduel et al 2015 lehmler 2005 trojanowicz et al 2018 pfcs are demonstrated to have multiple toxic effects such as immunotoxicity hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity butenhoff et al 2012 the bond energy of c f bond is up to 544 kj mol 1 leading to its bioaccumulative nature xu et al 2017a pfcs are resistant to conventional oxidation processes which utilize reactive oxygen species ros and biological methods due to the strong c f bond dillert et al 2007 schultz et al 2006 therefore effective approaches are essential to convert pfcs to harmless substances under mild conditions basic structure of anthropogenic pfcs is comprised of a fully fluorinated alkyl chain a hydrophobic part and a terminated functional group such as carboxylates sulfonates sulphonamides and phosphonates which constitutes a hydrophilic part perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas especially pfoa have received tremendous attentions recently bioaccumulativity of pfcas is related to their chain length short chain pfcas are less bioaccumulative than pfoa martin et al 2003 pfos is also one of the primary pfcs which has been widely found in humans wildlife and various environmental media benskin et al 2010 kannan et al 2004 perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecss containing ether c o bonds are less bioaccumulative alternatives to full carbon chain predecessor pfcs brandsma et al 2019 however studies revealed that some pfecas exhibited even higher bioaccumulation potential and toxicity than pfoa and pfecas have been recognized as a new class of emerging contaminants cui et al 2018 photochemical decomposition appears to be effective to treat pfcs which could be easily operated under mild conditions and achieves higher decomposition and defluorination efficiency yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2019 homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic degradations of pfcs have been widely studied cui et al 2020 do et al 2020 yang et al 2020a in homogeneous photocatalytic processes pfcs can be removed more effectively in the presence of oxidants like persulfate and periodate cao et al 2010 a homogeneous photocatalyst i e heteropolyacid h3pw12o40 hpw was reported to show good performance for the decomposition of pfoa in the presence of oxygen gas hori et al 2004 in these photo oxidative processes electrons transfer from pfoa to the photo excited species is the crucial step of pfoa decomposition photo reductive process with eaq was confirmed to be effective for the degradation of pfcs and could be easily realized under mild conditions cui et al 2020 eaq can be produced by direct photolysis or inorganic anion mediated photolysis such as ferrocyanide mediated laser flash photolysis huang et al 2007 and ki qu et al 2010 or sulfite mediated uv photolysis methods song et al 2013 decomposition of pfcs could be also conducted by photo redox reactions catalyzed by metal ions via formation of metal pfcs complex hori et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the environmental photochemical properties of these complexes are of great importance for pollution abatement because it could promote photodecomposition of persistent pollutants cieśla et al 2004 šima and makáňová 1997 easy operation of homogenous photochemical processes low cost and readily availability of the additions make it promising for pfcs wastewater treatment however in homogenous processes the degradation and defluorination efficiencies of pfcs would be greatly influenced by water matrix constituents such as humic acid dissolved oxygen nitrate and h cui et al 2020 liang et al 2016 yang et al 2020a moreover it is troublesome to isolate the unreacted additions in homogenous photochemical processes heterogeneous photochemical processes are widely explored for environmental detoxification of liquid and gaseous ecosystems colmenares and luque 2014 with the advantages of low energy consumption high photocatalytic ability and easy separation of photocatalysts from the reaction systems chen et al 2015 although a great many of organic pollutants could be readily transformed to co2 and h2o over tio2 photocatalysts tio2 is inefficient for decomposing pfoa under mild conditions or harsh reaction conditions are required dillert et al 2007 panchangam et al 2009 notably ga2o3 in2o3 are found to be superior to tio2 when degrading pfoa in aqueous solution such as good chemical activity and stability li et al 2020a li et al 2012b bismuth based photocatalysts showed good performance in pfoa removal as well sahu et al 2018 however these photocatalysts are used for pfcs remediation only under uv light irradiation few photocatalysts are reported to possess a significant photocatalytic activity for pfoa decomposition under solar light irradiation wu et al 2019 photochemical approach appears to be effective to treat pfcs which could be easily operated under mild conditions and achieves high decomposition and defluorination efficiency xu et al have concluded heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for pfoa treatment xu et al 2017a photo oxidative and photo reductive processes have been reviewed for the degradation of pfos and pfoa wang et al 2017 very recently cui et al have concluded the reduction processes for pfcs remediation cui et al 2020 yang et al have summarized persulfate based degradation of pfos and pfoa yang et al 2020a the conclusion about heterogeneous photochemical processes for pfcs remediation is mainly about tio2 in2o3 and ga2o3 do et al 2020 a comprehensive review summarizing homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes treating pfcs is desirably needed to this end we aim to provide a critical overview of the recent advances in this area for homogenous processes oxidative reductive and metal ion mediated photocatalytic approaches are concluded including the active species participated and the degradation pathways of pfcs moreover the influences of molecular structures of pfcs on the remediation effect are discussed as well as the mechanisms of different remediation approaches for heterogeneous processes we summarize various photocatalysts applied for the decomposition of pfoa including specific properties of semiconductors benefiting their photocatalytic performances in addition the reductive and oxidative mechanisms of semiconductor photocatalytic processes and important factors influencing these processes were concluded 2 homogenous photochemical process for pfcs decomposition for the homogenous photochemical processes photo reductive and photo oxidative processes and metal ion mediated photochemical processes are concluded the performance and photo reductive degradation mechanisms of pfcs such as pfoa pfos and pfeca by eaq are reviewed and discussed unique properties of eaq and its generation in different photo reductive systems particularly uv sulfite and uv i are overviewed active radicals generated in different photo oxidative systems are concluded and the critical step for photo oxidative degradation is electron transfer from pfcs to active radicals metal ion mediated fe iii mainly used processes for the photodegradation processes are then overviewed decomposition of pfcs by fe iii was attributed to the photo redox reactions via formation of metal pfcs complex 2 1 photo reductive decomposition of pfcs the eaq induced reduction technologies are efficient to decompose recalcitrant pfcs the eaq is one of the most active species with a standard reduction potential of 2 9 v which can react with the organic compounds as a nucleophile the eaq is much more active when reacting with halogen atom included organics resulting in the cleavage of c x bond to release halide ions buxton et al 1988 the eaq can be produced by photolytic methods including direct photolysis and inorganic anions mediated photolysis i e i or sulfite mediated uv photolysis table 1 direct photoionization of liquid water is generally conducted under uv light irradiation at λ 200 nm due to a negligible absorption coefficient at λ 200 nm nikogosyan and angelov 1981 according to eq 1 both oxidative species e g oh and reductive species e g h and eaq could be generated from water splitting under uv irradiation λ 200 nm h standard reduction potential e 2 1 2 3 v was not able to break c f bonds of pfos e 2 7 v lyu et al 2015b the quantum yield of eaq from water photoionization is low because the radical species undergo significant geminate recombination mainly with oh eqs 2 3 thomsen et al 1999 scavenging oxidative species e g oh could increase the apparent quantum yields of eaq and aminopoly carboxylic acid s apcas were applied to effectively scavenge oh sun et al 2018 furthermore because of the rapid reaction between eaq and oxygen eq 4 the reduction efficiency of eaq is significantly affected by dissolved oxygen o2 thereby eaq mediated photoreductive approaches normally require strict anoxic conditions 1 h 2 o hv h e aq o h h 2 e aq h 2 o h o h 3 e aq h h 4 e aq o 2 o 2 higher quantum yield of eaq could be obtained by inorganic anions mediated photolysis than direct photolysis li et al 2012a the reason may be that solutes for photoexcitation can translate into more eaq li et al 2012a uv iodide i and uv sulfite systems are the most frequently used for the generation of eaq in the uv i system eaq was generated from the irradiation of aqueous iodide a caged complex was generated under uv irradiation containing an iodine atom and an electron i e eqs 5 7 the caged complex then dissociated into a eaq and an iodine atom the decomposition rate increased firstly and then declined as the ki concentration increased continuously the amount of triiodide and eaq generated increased with the increase of ki concentration more eaq would be consumed by triiodide resulting in the decrease of the amount of eaq available for the decomposition of pfoa humic acids could enhance the efficiency of uv i system because the generation of eaq is improved due to reduction of i2 hoi io3 and i3 back

2015 10 h o h h 2 o e aq 2 1 1 photo reductive decomposition of pfoa and pfos pfoa is decomposed by a photo reduction method in aqueous solution mediated by i qu et al 2010 this experiment was conducted at ph 9 at anaerobic conditions under uv 254 nm light irradiation a high defluorination efficiency of 98 was obtained indicating that pfoa was almost completely defluorinated so3 2 mediated photolysis was applied for photo reductive defluorination of pfoa under mild conditions song et al 2013 due to the strong electron withdrawing ability of fluorine the fluorine atom is the reaction center when eaq attack the pfoa molecule as shown in scheme 1 the α position c f bond is more easily attacked by eaq due to the inductive effect of the carboxyl in pfoa this leads to the elimination of fluorine from pfoa and the formation of cnf2n 1h2cooh eqs 11 14 under the irradiation of uv light cnf2n 1h2cooh was excited to form free radicals such as cn 1f2n 1 cooh and ch2 eq 15 cn 1f2n 1 perhaps combined with cooh to produce cn 1f2n 1cooh eq 16 meanwhile ch2 is reactive species which could transform to ch3 and then combined with cooh to form ch3cooh eq 17 18 11 c n f 2 n 1 cooh e aq c

kinetics and the f index of pfos increase linearly with increasing chain length in contrast chain length of perfluoroalkyl carboxylate appears to barely influence the observed kinetics and the f index hori et al 2006 park et al 2009 a reductive cleavage of the ionic headgroup occurs before complete defluorination indicated by the gaseous products from incomplete defluorination pfoa is much easier to be degraded than pfos it is reported that in a catalyst free uv system a high rate of 2 78 h 1 was obtained for pfoa decomposition at ph 7 0 and 90 c whereas it was only 0 058 h 1 for pfos lyu et al 2015 theoretical studies show that two lowest lying excited singlet states of pfoa were computed at considerably lower energy 5 84 ev for 21a and 5 97 ev for 31a while pfos was found to be energetically accessible only in the high energy vacuum uv range 6 20 ev in addition intramolecular oh may be formed for pfoa when protonated and interacting with uv radiation of 7 98 ev at 155 nm both these two reasons contribute to faster degradation of pfoa filho and de souza 2020 photo reductive methods appear to be efficient for the degradation of pfos li et al 2020 extra chemicals e g alcohol iodide or sulphite are usually required to enable efficient degradation of pfos table 1 a uv sulfite system with high photon flux was employed to promote eaq production as well as to enhance the decomposition of pfos gu et al 2016 the 98 pfos 32 µm was decomposed within 30 min with initial solution ph at 9 2 and do about 5 mg l the decomposition steps of pfos involved defluorination desulfonation and scission of c c bond initially pfos anion reacted with eaq to generate c8f17so3 2 then c8f17so3 2 dissociate to c8f17 based on the calculated relative energies of dissociation fragments with respect to c8f17so3 2 δe c8f17 is the most likely produced species with the lowest δe c8f17 was likely to be hydrolyzed to pfoa and then degraded the c3f7 c4f9 and c5f11 might also be favourably formed by the dissociation of c8f17so3 2 due to lower δe of these species than other dissociation fragments i e cf3 c2f5 and c7f15 these active intermediates might then combine with cooh to form short chain pfcas and degraded further photodegradation of pfos in alkaline 2 propanol is more effective than that in water yamamoto et al 2007 the photodegradation rate constant was 0 93 days 1 in alkaline 2 propanol solution and 0 13 days 1 in water respectively the possible reason might be that photodegradation of pfos in alkaline 2 propanol solution progresses through a radical chain reaction mediated by isopropyl radical ch3 2co that initially formed by uv irradiation li et al 2020 the ch3 2co was generated by uv photolysis of 2 propanol the first step for pfos decomposition is similar to the eaq reduction process where pfos react with ch3 2co to form c8f16so3 and f humic acid ha could enhance the degradation of pfos in the uv iodide system sun et al 2017 a high degradation ratio of 86 0 and a defluorination ratio of 55 6 was achieved after irradiation for 1 5 h in the presence of both i and ha while degradation ratio of 51 7 and defluorination ratio of 4 4 was reported for uv iodide system there are several reasons why ha could enhance the photo reductive destruction of pfos in the uv iodide system firstly ha could promote the reduction of iodide oxidation products i2 hoi io3 and i3 back to i secondly ha can act as an electron shuttle to enhance the electron transfer efficiency and increase the reaction possibility thirdly a weakly bonded association of i and pfos with ha increases the reaction probability finally ha could produce eaq itself under the irradiation of uv light linear and branched structural isomers of technical pfos have different reactivity to eaq jin et al reported the efficient defluorination of technical pfos in an anoxic alkaline solution ph 8 under irradiation of 185 nm vacuum ultraviolet vuv eaq was confirmed as the active species for pfos decomposition in this process jin and zhang 2015 complete defluorination of pfos was achieved with a high yield of fluoride 16 7 mol f mol pfos in anoxic alkaline solution the decomposition of pfos enhanced with the increase of ph value the branched isomers of pfos decomposed quickly with a first order reaction rate constant of 0 0806 min 1 at ph 12 5 whereas the linear pfos decomposed more slowly with a rate constant of 0 0175 h 1 the rate constants are nearly 967 times and 4 times higher than those at ph 6 8 respectively the photo reductive degradation of pfos can be enhanced by aminopoly carboxylic acid s apcas sun et al 2018 apcas are a class of compounds which contain several carboxylate groups bound to one or more nitrogen atoms nitrilotriacetic acid nta was used both as a photosensitizer to induce water photodissociation and a scavenger of oh to inhibit the recombination between oh and eaq therefore the addition of nta could increase the amount of eaq available for pfos decomposition a high pfos degradation ratio of 85 4 and a defluorination ratio of 46 8 could be realized within 10 h in the uv nta system various other apcas can also enhance the photoreductive degradation of pfos including iminodiacetic acid ida ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta gu et al 2020 ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid trisodium salt solution edds and methylglycine diacetic acid mgda catalyst free system was also developed for rapid photocatalytic degradation of pfos in aqueous solution lyu et al 2015b and eaq was responsible for pfos photodegradation in this system according to eq 1 both oxidative species e g oh and reductive species e g h and eaq could be generated from water splitting under uv irradiation by combining alkaline condition ph 11 8 and high temperature 100 c of the solution rapid photocatalytic decomposition of pfos was achieved with a pseudo first order decomposition rate constant of 0 91 h 1 higher temperature and alkaline conditions facilitate the generation of the eaq pfos photodegradation could be significantly accelerated under boiling condition compared to the non boiling control lyu et al 2015a in this process eaq was the major reactive species for pfos decomposition the boiling state of solution enhanced the interfacial mass transfer and improved effective concentrations of reactants at the gas liquid interface thereby accelerating the pfos decomposition as indicated in table 1 the ratio of pfoa degradation and associated defluorination is not consistent for different photocatalytic systems and show discrepancies in mass balance the defluorination ratio is generally lower than the degradation ratio because of the formation of fluorine containing intermediates moreover the total recovery of fluorine decreased initially and then increase to almost 100 after sufficient time of reaction qu et al 2010 the reason is that the hydro containing fluorinated carboxylic acids formed during the degradation process and might finally transform to f jin et al 2014 2 1 2 photo reductive decomposition of pfeca molecular structure of pfcs significantly affects their reducibility a uv activated sulfite system was applied to treat chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate i e f 53b clc8f16o4s fig 1 an alternative of pfos used to produce chrome mist suppressant in china bao et al 2019 compared to pfos and perfluorinated ether potassium sulfonate f 53 c8f17o4s cl atom significantly promoted the reducibility of f 53b resulting in the fast degradation of f 53b within 1 min the possible degradation pathway of f 53b is scheduled in fig 2 the decomposition initialized with the attack of eaq on f 53b chloro fluoro and hydro fluoro intermediates were identified which suggested that there were two pathways for eaq attacking hydrogenation route i fig 2 and molecular cleavage route ii fig 2 the degradation of perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid pfeca pollutants by uv generated eaq is intimately related to its molecular structure bentel et al 2020 the ether structures of pfecas result in their distinct degradation behavior compared to the full carbon chain perfluorocarboxylic acids oxygen atoms in pfeca would increase the bond energy of c f bonds on the adjacent cf2 moieties less h f exchanged polyfluorinated products are generated which are recalcitrant to reductive defluorination instead more unstable perfluoroalcohols are produced by the cleavage of ether c o bonds thus promoting defluorination of short fluoroalkyl moieties compared to the linear pfecas branched pfecas have a higher tendency of h f exchange on the tertiary carbon which leads to lower efficiency of defluorination hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hepo da ammonium salt with trade name genx fig 1 a typical pfecas can be readily defluorinated and degraded by eaq generated in uv sulfite system bao et al 2018 genx is completely degraded in 2 h and more than 90 of fluoride ion could be recovered after 6 h theoretical investigations indicate that the etheric bond in genx is a favorable location for eaq attack this study illustrates that uv sulfite system might be a promising technology to reduce genx pollutant 2 2 photo oxidative decomposition of pfcs homogenous photo oxidative processes have been also explored to decompose pfcs in these processes oxidative radicals generated by uv activation of inorganic ion solution are responsible for the decomoposition of pfcs the critical step for the photo oxidative decomposition of pfcs is electron extraction from pfcs to the oxidative radicals in general oh radical oxidation potential value 276 0 kj mol could not directly cleave the c f bonds in pfcs bond energy 544 kj mol 1 wang et al 2017 this is also true for other stronger oxidation radicals such as no2 co3 and so4 which can be generated in the photochemical process thus the decomposition of pfoa typically starts with the cleavage of the c c bond at the head group namely pfoa is firstly decarboxylated by radical oxidation electron transfer to form c7f15 eqs 19 20 which activates the molecule and initiates a stepwise defluorination process the c7f15 radical is unstable and may react with oh forming c6f13cof after eliminating hf c6f13cof further undergoes hydrolysis to generate c6f13cooheq 21 23 c6f13cooh then undergoes the same way as c7f15cooh and decomposed in a stepwise

electrophilic radical and more effective than ho for degrading organic compounds previous works on pfoa decomposition by so4 primarily focused on the removal efficiency and various activation strategies to produce so4 qian et al 2016 wang et al 2010 photolysis of s2o8 2 generated highly oxidative so4 which could efficiently decompose pfoa and other pfcas containing c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl groups hori et al 2005 eqs 19 23 f and co2 were the major degradation products also small amounts of pfcas with shorter chain lengths were detected in the reaction solution pfoa 1 35 mm was completely degraded with 50 mm s2o8 2 and 4 h of irradiation from a 200 w xenon mercury lamp and an initial period decomposition rate of 11 times higher than that using photolysis alone was obtained all sulfur containing species in the reaction solution were eventually transformed to sulfate ions in the degradation process carbonate radical anion co3 is a secondary radical generated by the one electron oxidation of carbonate or bicarbonate ions in aqueous solution co3 is a powerful oxidant with one electron reduction potentials of 1 59 v ph 12 5 and 1 78 v ph 7 respectively joshi and mukherjee 2006 it is strongly electrophilic towards electron rich compounds such as anilines phenols and sulfur containing compounds huie et al 1991 the addition of nahco3 and h2o2 could generate co3 under 254 nm uv irradiation phan thi et al 2013 thus significantly improving pfoa degradation with 95 7 of pfoa degraded after 8 h in this system co3 was generated by the oxidation of co3 2 and hco3 eqs 24 25 the key step for pfoa oxidation by co3 is electron extraction from c7f15coo to form c7f15coo eq 19 24 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 25 o h hc o 3 h 2 o c o 3 a uv nitrate system was reported for efficient mineralization of pfoa li et al 2017 where the in situ generated no2 dominated the degradation of pfoa the generated no2 could withdraw electrons form pfoa to produce pfoa radical c7f15coo eq 19 then the generated c7f15coo rapidly decarboxylated to perfluoroheptyl radical c7f15 trapping hydroxyl radial using scavengers might facilitate the generation of more no2 and enhance degradation of pfoa eqs

with both 254 nm and 185 nm light vuc light cao et al 2010 pfoa could be efficiently decomposed under vuc light irradiation while barely decomposed under uv light irradiation io4 could significantly enhance the decomposition and defluorination of pfoa under uv light irradiation while was unfavorable for both processes under vuc light irradiation highly reactive species such as io4 io3 oh and o are formed in the uv naio4 system and responsible for the decomposition of pfoa in vuc system water photolyzes into oh h and eaq resulting the decrease of io4 as being scavenged by eaq 2 3 metal ion mediated photo redox processes for pfcs removal the uv fe3 based systems have been reported to be used for the remediation of pfcs where the redox couple of fe3 fe2 is used as a homogenous photocatalyst fe3 mediated photo redox reactions table 2 proceeded via forming a metal pfcs complex iron ions are widely to be used because they are cheap and easily available researches have proved that photo irradiating an aqueous solution of fe3 carboxylate produces fe2 and oxidized carboxylate eq 28 the oxidized carboxylate can be decarboxylated to form perfluoroheptyl radicals cnh2n 1 eq 29

hydrolysis de bruyn et al 1995 forming the one cf2 unit shortened pfca cn 1f2n 1cooh eq 32 in addition fe2 in acidic water can be reoxidized to fe3 by oxygen bideau et al 1988 brandt and van eldik 1995 cn 1f2n 1cooh then undergoes the same way as cnh2n 1cooh to be decomposed in a stepwise manner the decomposition rate of pfoa is greatly affected by the concentration of fe3 wang et al 2008 increasing fe3 concentration could benefit the decomposition and defluorination of pfoa when the fe3 concentration increased from 10 to 80 µm the decomposition rate constants increased from 2 7 10 3 to 6 7 10 3 min 1 and the corresponding defluorination rate constant increased from 0 7 10 3 to 2 8 10 3 min 1 other metal ions such as cu2 and zn2 slightly enhance the decomposition of pfoa under 254 nm uv light irradiation different light sources were used to degrade pfoa in the presence of fe3 vacuum ultraviolet light λ 185 nm was combined with fe3 to defluorinate aqueous pfoa cheng et al 2014 pfoa could be effectively defluorinated under acidic conditions ph 3 4 with a molar ratio of pfoa fe3 between 1 8 1 and 1 2 1 a novel sunlight fe3 system is proposed to decompose pfoa in which 97 8 1 7 of 50 µm pfoa could be decomposed into shorter chain intermediates and f within 28 days liu et al 2013 the possible degradation pathway for pfoa is illustrated in fig 3 spectroscopic spectra indicate that electron transfer from pfoa to fe3 initiate the decomposition reaction forming fe2 and an unstable organic carboxyl radical fig 3 pathway 1 was predominant for the decomposition for pfoa fe3 was combined with oxidative species to degrade pfoa effectively uv photolysis of aqueous ferric nitrate solution uv fe no3 3 was reported which could utilize the synergistic effect of fe3 and the in situ generated no2 yuan et al 2020 92 pfoa initial concentration 5 ppm 50 ml could be removed within only 0 5 h in the uv fe no3 3 isopropanol air system with a rate constant of 2 262 h 1 o2 in this system was beneficial for the effective fe3 fe2 redox cycle and isopropanol was essential to scavenge oh to facilitate the generation of no2 the effective fe3 fe2 redox cycle and the in situ generated no2 were beneficial for the destructive removal of pfoa influences of reaction atmosphere extra inorganic oxidant inorganic anion and organic matter on pfoa photodecomposition in the presence of fe3 were investigated liang et al 2016 different from the uv fe3 system atmosphere air o2 or n2 has little impact on the defluorination of pfoa in the uvc fe3 system the reason may be that the reoxidation of fe2 to fe3 by oxygen was not essential under vuc irradiation it is reported that h2o can be cleaved to produce oh and h radicals under uv irradiation at wavelengths less than 200 nm jin and zhang 2015 oh generated by vuc light irradiation showed a profound impact on the reoxidation of fe2 to fe3 and therefore significantly affected pfoa defluorination adding extra oxidants leads to consumption of photon energy as well as fe2 and fe3 thus reducing pfoa decomposition rate for example persulfate addition obviously inhibited the decomposition of pfoa in the vuc fe3 system co3 2 hco3 added would cause an obvious increase of the solution ph and result in the precipitation of ferric hydroxide at a ph higher than 4 the complex affinity between fe3 and the anions were in the order of oh 8 95 so4 2 2 95 cl 0 5 no3 0 23 clo4 the coordination of inorganic ions with fe3 likely interfered with the fe pfoa complexation thus hampering the decomposition of pfoa inorganic anions exert adverse effects on pfoa decomposition and their effects extent follows hco3 so4 2 no3 cl clo4 cui et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 volatile organic compounds vocs in water decreased the deflluorination of pfoa the reasons may be that vocs in solution could consume photon energy and scavenge non selective radicals i e oh whereas in the presence of dissolving organic matter dom i e humic acids dom had an increasingly insignificant impact on pfoa degradation over relatively long reaction times the reason may be that humic acids were decomposed after a certain period of time liang et al 2016 c2 c5 pfcas in water can be mineralized by photocatalysis with the addition of a small amount of fe3 hori et al 2007 under uv vis 220 to 460 nm irradiation in oxygen atmosphere with the initial pfca initial fe3 molar ratio of 13 5 initial pfca concentration 67 3 mm the pseudo first order rate constants for pfca decomposition by photocatalysis were 3 6 5 3 times higher than those by photolysis alone the turnover number for pfca decomposition by photocatalysis reached 6 71 8 68 after irradiation for 24 h the catalysis process can be explained by photoredox reactions among pfca fe3 fe2 and oxygen via photo induced complexation of fe iii with the pfcas the uv vis absorption of pfcas strongly responsed to shorter wavelength below 300 nm after combining with fe3 hori et al 2007 therefore 300 nm light can only decompose limited tfa in water in the presence of fe3 maruthamuthu and huie 1995 the photodecomposition of pfos under uv light irradiation is also greatly accelerated by fe3 jin et al 2014 pfos combined with fe3 to form a complex which was photolyzed to fe2 and an organic radical through the ligand to metal charge transfer by uv light excitation subsequently the unstable pfos radical was desulfonated to generate a perfluoroalkyl radical the perfluoroalkyl radical underwent the same way of those derived from pfoa and finally mineralized to f and co2 eqs 30 32 this method works efficiently under mild conditions i e room temperature and atmospheric pressure 3 heterogeneous photochemical process for pfcs decomposition heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient approach for pfcs removal from contaminated water up to date there are only a few semicondutors studied for the photocatalytic degradation of pfcs and researches only focused on the decomposition of pfoa fig 4 displays the band energy diagram of semiconductors studied for the degradation of pfoa the performance and mechanisms of these photocatalysts for remediating pfoa in contaminated water are discussed according to the photo oxidative and photo reductive pathways this review mainly focuses on the performance and properties of in ga and bi based photocatalysts 3 1 photo reductive processes semiconductor photocatalysis is able to degrade pfcs in a reductive way β ga2o3 with a wide bandgap was employed for photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa zhao et al 2015 zhao and zhang 2009 the β ga2o3 has much wider bandgap 4 8 ev than tio2 3 2 ev and its conduction band position e cb 1 55 ev is much higher than tio2 e cb 0 29 ev relative to the vacuum energy level fig 4 zhao et al 2015 therefore photo induced electrons ecb in the conduction band of β ga2o3 have stronger reductive capability than that of tio2 pfoa molecules adsorbed on the surface of β ga2o3 could be reductively decomposed in an anaerobic atmosphere zhao and zhang 2009 photocatalytic reduction of pfoa by β ga2o3 was also investigated in anoxic aqueous solution zhao et al 2012 after reacting for 3 h 98 8 of pfoa was degraded with a defluorination efficiency of 31 6 in the presence of thiosulfate and bubbling n2 a possible mechanism was proposed involving the attack of ecb onto the carboxyl of cnf2n 1cooh the generated cnf2n 1 reacted with h2o to form cnf2n 1oh and then cnf2n 1oh underwent hf elimination and hydrolysis to form cn 1f2n 1cooh wang et al reported that oxalic acid could greatly improve pfoa decomposition over tio2 under n2 atmosphere wang and zhang 2011 epr results confirmed the formation of co2 which was produced from reactions between oxalic acid and photo generated h eq 34 oxalic acid can also remarkably prolong the life time of photo generated ecb by reacting with photo generated h co2 is a strong reductant with a normal potential of 1 85 v surdhar et al 1989 the authors propose that both ecb and co2 could possibly initiate the decarboxylation of pfoa eq 35 36 to form c7f15 then c7f15 would rapidly react with h2o to produce c7f15oh and forming c6f13cof after eliminating hf eq 37 38 c6f13cof was unstable and underwent hydrolysis to form c6f13cooh eq 39 c6f13cooh would undergo the same way to be completely mineralized to co2 and f co2 was primarily responsible for pfoa decomposition due to its significantly larger reduction potential compared with ecb and 86 7 pf pfoa could be decomposed in 180 min with the addition of 3 mm oxalic acid and under

scission fig 5 besides that carbonyl groups were attacked by ecb yielding perfluoroalkyl radicals cnf2n 1 by losing ho and co there were two main reaction pathways for the subsequent transformation of cnf2n 1 on one hand it reacted with h2o to generate unstable cnh2n 1oh which then underwent hf elimination and hydrolysis to form cn 1f2n 1cooh on the other hand the hydro defluorination also took place via si h c f redistribution at chain terminal of cnf2n 1 thus yielding cn 1f2n 1 by removing ch2 carbene furthermore addition or elimination of coo induced mutual transformation between cn 1f2n 1 and cn 1f2n 1cooh a new method for reductive defluorination of pfoa under visible light was conducted by using pt bi2o4 as photocatalysts and ki as electron donors wang et al 2020 the defluorination of pfoa proceeded in a photo reductive pathway in which the photo induced ecb was the dominate active species pt served as co catalyst to trap ecb while ki could trap photo generated h to promote e h separation due to the high affinity of ecb the ecb firstly attacked f atom at α position resulting in the replacement of f with h atom to form c7f13h2cooh the produced c7f13h2cooh was further

decomposition process unstable perfluoroalkyl radical c7f15coo is generated from oxidation of the adsorbed pfoa by the photo generated hvb eq 42 and subsequently decarboxylated to form c7f15 eq 43 c7f15 radical is unstable and may react with oh forming c6f13cof after eliminating hf c6f13cof further undergoes hydrolysis to generate c6f13cooh eqs 44 46 c6f13cooh then undergoes the same way as c7f15cooh and decomposed in a stepwise manner the amount of hvb and the adsorption capacity of pfoa are two key parameters that determine the degradation efficiency of semiconductors under uv visible light irradiation and these two key parameters can be optimized by adjusting inherent properties of semiconductors and operation conditions of degradation reactions 42 c 7 f 15 co o h v b c 7 f 15 co

heterogeneous semiconductors would benefit the direct oxidation of pfoa by hvb inherent properties of semiconductors have great impact on the adsorption capacity of photocatalysts larger ssa of photocatalysts helps to expose more active surfaces and enhances the adsorption capacity for pfoa it is reported that higher oxygen vacancy ov level would facilitate the adsorption of pfoa onto semiconductors li et al 2013c the bidentate coordination allows closer contact between pfoa and photocatalysts than that of monodentate mode li et al 2012b song et al 2017 moreover a side on parallel mode with both the head and tail groups anchored on the photocatalysts is reported to be much more efficient for pfoa decomposition li et al 2020b the optimization approaches for different classes of semiconductors are discussed in details along with the enhanced performance for pfoa degradation in2o3 exhibited enhanced activity than tio2 for pfoa decomposition li et al 2012b the pfoa binding pattern to tio2 surface was monodentate and the binding strength was relatively weaker therefore the hvb of tio2 are preferentially transformed to hydroxyl radicals oh which is less reactive for pfoa degradation indicated by electron spin resonance esr results li et al 2012b the pfoa closely coordinates to in2o3 in a bidentate or bridging mode fig 6 the strong bidentate binding between carboxylic group of pfoa and in2o3 surface benefited direct decomposition of pfoa by photo induced hvb the main decomposition products of in2o3 are similar to those of tio2 including c2 c7 pfcas and fluoride ions thereafter in2o3 nanostructures with different morphologies were prepared and exhibited distinct properties table 3 three kinds of nanostructured in2o3 materials were fabricated by dehydration of the corresponding in oh 3 nanostructures at 500 c for 2 h the decomposition rates of pfoa by these in2o3 materials i e porous microspheres nanoplates and nanocubes were 74 7 41 9 and 17 3 times higher than that using p25 tio2 respectively fig 7 c li et al 2013b higher surface oxygen vacancies ovs level benefited the adsorption of pfoa towards in2o3 the more ovs defects existed in in2o3 materials the better activity was obtained for pfoa decomposition fig 7d a semiconductor of wide band gap p block metal oxyhydroxide inooh was prepared and exhibited high activity for pfoa degradation under uv light irradiation at mild conditions xu et al 2017b the rate constant for pfoa degradation by inooh is 27 6 times higher than that by p25 the main reason is that inooh have a enhanced adsorption capacity for ionized pfoa c7f15coo than p25 sheaf like ga2o3 was prepared via a polyvinyl alcohol pva assisted hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment shao et al 2013a and exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation under uv 254 nm light irradiation the decomposition rate constant was 4 85 h 1 which was 16 and 44 times higher than that using commercial ga2o3 and p25 tio2 respectively needle like β ga2o3 was also prepared and used as photocatalyst for pfoa decomposition shao et al 2013b the prepared material was efficient for the removal of trace pfoa in both pure water and wastewater with first order rate constants of 4 03 and 3 51 h 1 respectively diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts revealed the tight coordination of pfoa with ga2o3 surface in a bidentate or bridging configuration which facilitates direct pfoa decomposed by photo generated h fig 8 the biocl also demonstrated good performance for the phtocatalytic degradation of pfoa the ovs controllable biocl nanosheets were facilely synthesized via a hydrolysis method and applied to degrade pfoa when ovs ratio in biocl nanosheets increased from 0 573 to 0 981 by changing the alkali source applied for preparation the efficiencies of degradation and defluorination of pfoa increased by 3 4 times the photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa over biocl is dominated by the direct hole oxidation process song et al 2017 a linear relationship was observed between the ovs level in biocl and the photocatalytic decomposition efficiency of pfoa song et al 2019 the presence of ovs in semiconductors can not only narrow the band gap to facilitate photo absorption ye et al 2011 but also promote the separation of charge carriers by trapping ecb thus promoting efficient hvb oxidation liu et al 2009 moreover ovs can serve as adsorption sites for pfcs and consequently promote the oxidation of target pollutants by photo generated hvb song et al 2019 surface defective biocl was also synthesized and used for efficient photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa using sunlight as the energy source sun et al 2019 application of biox in photocatalytic mineralization of persistent organic pollutants still suffer from drawbacks such as mismatch among the large band gap wide spectral response and weak oxidizing capability of hvb liu et al 2015 qin et al 2016 halogen doping was an effective way to adjust the band structures of bismuth oxyhalide to achieve optimal photocatalytic activity gnayem and sasson 2013 facet regulation is another efficient method to enhance the activity of a photocatalyst a high 001 facet exposed bioi0 95br0 05 was successfully prepared by doping bromine via solvothermal method and possessed remarkably high photocatalytic ability for pfoa degradation under uv light irradiation 96 of pfoa could be decomposed within 120 min and 65 of pfoa was mineralized within 180 min the reaction kinetic constant was 4 3 times higher than that using bioi control the photo generated ecb hvb were responsible for pfoa decomposition li et al 2019 the generated short chain pfcas and their evolution trends indicated that the α carbon atom was the attack point the degradation process of pfoa was initialized followed by losing cf2 unit in a stepwise manner bioi bi5o7i p n heterojunction photocatalysts could be facilely prepared by calcinating bioi at 350 c t 410 c wang et al 2019a the rate constant for pfoa decomposition by bioi bi5o7i p n heterojunction calcinated at 390 c t 390 was four times higher than that of pristine bioi k 0 061 h 1 and 1 2 times higher than that of bi5o7i prepared at 410 c k 0 206 h 1 t 390 also possessed excellent mineralization ability for pfoa with about 60 of total organic carbon removed after 6 h of irradiation epr results and active species scavenging experiments demonstrated that oh was largely responsible for photodegradation of pfoa in this system followed by o2 and hvb attacked by these active species pfoa was gradually mineralized by losing cf2 units monoclinic bipo4 a novel bi3o oh po4 2 bohp catalyst of wide band gap semiconductor were applied for the degradation of pfoa under ultraviolet irradiation bohp microparticles achieved dramatically faster rate in pfoa degradation and mineralization compared to bipo4 and a β ga2o3 nanomaterial catalyst which have smaller surface area and lower band gap energy the rate constant of bohp for pfoa degradation in a pure water solution was 15 times higher than those of both bipo4 and β ga2o3 the superior performance of bohp was primarily related to the surface charge facilitating the adsorption behavior of pfoa onto the catalyst the favorable redox potentials of bohp charge carriers also contributed to the enhanced pfoa decomposition sahu et al 2018 carbon sphere cs modification could enhance the performance of bismuth phosphate composite biohp cs xu et al 2020b 99 of pfoa could be adsorbed by biohp cs in 2 h and subsequently almost completely decomposed in 4 h of uv irradiation with a defluorination ratio of 32 5 the pfoa degradation rate was 18 times higher than that by neat biohp the carbon modification can not only enhance the adsorption capacity of pfoa but also facilitate a side on adsorption configuration of pfoa with the active sites which would promote photocatalytic cleavage of c f bonds moreover cs could enhance the stability of biohp by accepting photo induced ecb to suppress photo corrosion of the composite tungstic heteropolyacid h3pw12o40 hpw demonstrated good performance for the photodegradation of pfoa however it is worth noting that hpw has small specific surface area which would limit its application to a large extent you et al synthesized hpw biomodal mesoporous silica bms catalyst and employed it as photocatalyst for pfoa degradation under vuv light irradiation you et al 2018 bms possessed large specific surface area 1000 m2 g 1 and could provide sufficient surfaces for the dispersion of hpw the vuv hpw bms system was efficient for pfoa defluorination boron nitride bn was reported to degrade pfoa under 254 nm light irradiation duan et al 2020 scavenging experiment results indicated that pfoa degraded in a hole initiated reaction pathway in the presence of bn which is similar to the tio2 case and ros species i e o2 oh also participated in the degradation process bn was 2 and 4 times more active than tio2 before and after ball milling the material the reason may be that edge defects or b or vacancies help to enhance light absorption moreover bn demonstrated good stability showing no obvious decrease in activity over three cycles bn was also active for the photocatalytic degradation of genx however few semiconductor photocatalysts are found to efficiently degrade pfoa under mild solar irradiation mno x is deposited on the surface of in2o3 to enhance ros generation wu et al 2019 ovs generated on the surface of in2o3 paly critical roles to assist pfoa adsorption the mno x modified oxygen vacancy rich in2o3 photocatalyst possesses a significantly improved photodegradation and defluorination activity for pfoa under solar light irradiation compared to the pristine in2o3 enhanced pfoa adsorption ability and ros generation efficiency contribute to the improved performance of mnox modified in2o3 iron hydr oxides and carbon spheres feo cs were prepared via a one step hydrothermal method xu et al 2020a feo cs showed good performance for adsorbing and then degrading the pre sorbed pfoa under simulated solar light fig 9 feo cs 1 1 derived from fe glucose mixture with a molar ratio of 1 1 possessed the highest pfoa adsorption capacity and photoactivity feo cs 1 1 1 0 g l adsorbed nearly 200 µg l of pfoa within 1 h and 95 2 of pre concentrated pfoa was photodegraded in 4 h at neutral ph with a defluorination rate of 57 2 there were two reasons for the good performance of feo cs on one hand cs facilitated formation of ferrihydrite enabling adsorption of pfoa onto feo cs via binuclear and bidentate binding on the other hand the hybrid feocs structure promoted multi point corporative adsorption of pfoa which could benefit direct electron extraction from pfoa under solar light irradiation a novel adsorptive photocatalyst fe tnts ac was prepared based on commercial activated carbon ac and titanate nanotubes tnts li et al 2020b fe tnts ac demonstrated synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity for rapid and efficient degradation of pfoa in aqueous solution fe tnts ac was able to adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating pfoa on the photoactive sites more than 90 of the pre concentrated pfoa could be degraded in 4 h by fe tnts ac under uv irradiation with a defluorination ratio of 62 fe tnts ac was also regenerated by the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa and showed no significant difference in the performance for pfoa adsorption and degradation the cooperative adsorption modes of α fe2o3 particles and ac for pfoa allowed pfoa to be adsorbed on the surface of fe tnts ac in the parallel orientation side on with both tail and carboxylate group of pfoa anchored on the photocatalyst the closer contact between pfoa and photocatalyst is conducive to pfoa decomposition by photo generated hvb this study offers a concentrate destroy strategy for efficient decomposition of pfoa which is potential to degrade pfoa and other pfcs in real wastewater more cost effectively epr spin trapping experiments could be applied for identifying reactive radicals tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl could be used as the radical scavenger of photo induced ecb and h peng et al 2020 dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide is used as the trapping agent for the detection of oh and o2 the detection of o2 should be conducted in methanol dispersion and in aqueous solution for the detection of oh chen et al 2017 temp 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine is selected as the trapping agents to examine 1o2 generation wang et al 2016 for active species scavenging experiments tert butanol t buoh edta na2 benzoquinone bq and sodium azide nan3 are used as scavengers of oh holes o2 and 1o2 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the s2o8 2 can effectively consume the hydrated electrons as an electron scavenger yamazaki et al 2001 to enhance the amount of hvb available for pfoa degradation photocatalysts have been combined with other semiconductors or graphene to improve its photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation to decrease the recombination of photo induced hvb ecb in2o3 have also been combined with other semiconductors or graphene to improve its photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation ceo2 doped in2o3 xceo2 in2o3 were synthesized and used for pfoa photocatalytic degradation jiang et al 2016 the as prepared xceo2 in2o3 showed much higher photocatalytic activity than ceo2 and in2o3 under uv light irradiation the excellent photocatalytic activity of 0 86 ceo2 in2o3 was ascribed to the effective separation of photo induced electron holes promoted by charge transfer between ceo2 and in2o3 in2o3 graphene composites were also synthesized and demonstrated enhanced activity for the photodecomposition of pfoa li et al 2013a graphene was deposited on the surface of in2o3 via a sonication assisted solution method followed by heat treatment the coverage percentage of graphene on in2o3 could be adjusted by changing calcination temperature the in2o3 graphene composites without calcination were compactly covered by graphene but showed lower photocatalytic activity than in2o3 nanoparticles after heating in2o3 graphene composites at 400 c the surface of in2o3 nanoparticles were partly enwrapped by graphene and demonstrated enhanced activity for photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa the increased exposing surface of in2o3 graphene composites should be the predominant reason for providing more adsorption sites for pfoa in addition some researchers demonstrated that graphene could carry excited electrons from the semiconductor to the electron acceptor due to the role of electron shuttling resulting in efficient photogenerated electron hole pairs separation zhang et al 2010 biocl zn al hydrotalcite b bhza photocatalyst was prepared and applied for the photocatalytic degradation of pfoa yang et al 2020b over 90 of pfoa could be removed in 6 h under uv light at an optimal ph of 2 the hybrid structure of b bhza promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers thus facilitating the direct hole oxidation of pfoa the operation parameters e g ph also have significant impact on the adsorption capacity of semiconductors for pfoa with a pk a of 2 8 in water goss 2008 pfoa was completely deprotonated even at a ph of 4 the surface of photocatalyst is positively charged when solution ph the ph point of zero charge ph pzc of photocatalyst and negatively charged at ph ph pzc therefore enhanced adsorption of pfoa on photocatalysts could be realized when solution ph is smaller than ph pzc and conducive to pfoa ionization heavily acidic and alkaline conditions are not conducive to the decomposition of pfoa for instance higher defluorination rate of 38 was obtained at ph 4 in the vuv hpw bms system you et al 2018 more positively charged bohp surfaces at acidic conditions facilitated electrostatic attraction of cf3 cf2 x coo thus enhancing its photocatalytic efficiency for pfoa degradation sahu et al 2018 the presence of perchloric acid could increase the chances of perfluorocarboxylic anions to be oxidized by the hvb of excited to2 panchangam et al 2009 heterogeneous photocatalytic treatment achieved more than 99 decomposition with a defluorination efficiency of 38 of pfoa in 7 h in the presence of perchloric acid the photocatalytic system with 0 15 m perchloric acid in conjunction with optimum tio2 loading of 0 66 g l 1 exhibited optimal performance 4 conclusions and perspectives homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes are comprehensively explored for the decomposition of pfcs for homogenous systems oxidative reductive and metal ion mediated redox photochemical processes are efficient for the degradation of pfcs oxidative radicals produced in the uv addition systems and eaq generated from inorganic ion mediated are responsible species for the degradation of pfcs metal ion mediated mainly fe iii processes are effective for pfcs removal due to the formation of metal pfcs complexes that could benefit electron transfer from pfcs to fe iii photo oxidative and photo reductive approaches show relatively higher defluorination efficiency than metal ion mediated processes and photo reductive approach is more efficient for the removal of pfeca because the etheric bond in pfeca is a favorable attack point for eaq for heterogeneous photocatalytic processes degrading pfcs various photocatalysts developed are reviewed their instinct properties benefiting pfcs removal are discussed a linear relationship is obtained between the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of pfoa and the ovs amount in photocatalysts photo induced ecb and h are reactive species of photo oxidative and photo reductive approaches for pfoa removal respectively and strong binding between pfoa and semiconductor is beneficial for its decomposition adjusting aqueous ph and the surface properties of photocatalysts such as higher ovs level could benefit the adsorption of pfoa towards photocatalysts further enhancing its decomposition however heterogeneous methods show relatively lower defluorination efficiency compared to homogenous photocatalytic processes in addition compared with the homogenous photochemical processes it is much easier to separate photocatalysts from the heterogeneous reaction systems though its operation cost might be higher due to the relatively expensive price of semiconductor photocatalysts regarding these efforts made for the removal of pfcs more works are still needed from the following respects for homogenous processes firstly complete mineralization of pfcs to co2 and f is the final target for pollutant remediation but this ideal situation for pfcs degradation has not been documented therefore researchers should further improve both the decomposition and defluorination efficiencies for pfcs removal secondly the advanced treatment of pfcs degradation products has yet been reported until now how to treat the fluoride ions degradation intemediates and additives in homogenous processes remains to be a great challenge for wastewater treatment for heterogeneous processes visible light responsive photocatalysts are required for efficient degradation and defluorination of pfcs developing noble metal free photocatalysts with high activity good stability and recoverability is essential for the treatment of practical pfcs containing wastewaters moreover recent studies for heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of pfcs only focused on pfoa however pfcs are a diverse class of compounds with different structures therefore more researches are desired for the treatment of different kinds of pfcs lastly most of the reported studies are about synthetic wastewater which contain much higher concentration mg l 1 of pfcs than those in real contaminated water ng l 1 µg l 1 also the constituents of real wastewater are much more complex than that of synthetic wastewater the interfering factors e g dissolved oxygen ph noms no3 cl etc could significantly influence the pfcs removal thus both homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes should be applied and tested for the remediation of pfcs in real

17507,perfluorochemicals pfcs are a set of chemicals containing c f bonds which are concerned due to their bioaccumulation property persistent and toxicological properties photocatalytic approaches have been widely studied for the effective removal of pfcs due to the mild operation conditions this review aims to provide a comprehensive and up to date summary on the homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for pfcs removal specifically the homogenous photocatalytic methods for remediating pfcs are firstly discussed including generation of hydrated electrons eaq and its performance and mechanisms for photo reductive destruction of pfcs the active species responsible for photo oxidative degradation of pfcs and the corresponding mechanisms and metal ion mediated fe iii mainly used processes for the remediation of pfcs the influences of molecular structures of pfcs and water matrix such as dissolved oxygen humic acid nitrate chloride on the homogenous photocatalytic degradation of pfcs are also discussed for heterogeneous photocatalytic processes various semiconductor photocatalysts used for the decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa are then discussed in terms of their specific properties benefiting photocatalytic performances the preparation methods for optimizing the performance of photocatalysts are also overviewed moreover the photo oxidative and photo reductive pathways are summarized for remediating pfoa in the presences of different semiconductor photocatalysts including active species responsible for the degradation we finally put forward several key perspectives for the photocatalytic removal of pfcs to promote its practical application in pfcs containing wastewater treatment including the treatment of pfcs degradation products such as fluoride ion and the development of noble metal free photocatalysts that could efficiently remove pfcs under solar light irradiation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorochemicals photocatalytic processes homogenous heterogeneous photo oxidative photo reductive 1 introduction pfcs are a set of anthropogenic fluorinated organic compounds hori et al 2006 prevedouros et al 2006 they have been produced since 1940s for numerous industrial applications such as refrigerants polymers pharmaceuticals adhesives insecticides and fire retardants baduel et al 2015 lehmler 2005 trojanowicz et al 2018 pfcs are demonstrated to have multiple toxic effects such as immunotoxicity hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity butenhoff et al 2012 the bond energy of c f bond is up to 544 kj mol 1 leading to its bioaccumulative nature xu et al 2017a pfcs are resistant to conventional oxidation processes which utilize reactive oxygen species ros and biological methods due to the strong c f bond dillert et al 2007 schultz et al 2006 therefore effective approaches are essential to convert pfcs to harmless substances under mild conditions basic structure of anthropogenic pfcs is comprised of a fully fluorinated alkyl chain a hydrophobic part and a terminated functional group such as carboxylates sulfonates sulphonamides and phosphonates which constitutes a hydrophilic part perfluorocarboxylic acids pfcas especially pfoa have received tremendous attentions recently bioaccumulativity of pfcas is related to their chain length short chain pfcas are less bioaccumulative than pfoa martin et al 2003 pfos is also one of the primary pfcs which has been widely found in humans wildlife and various environmental media benskin et al 2010 kannan et al 2004 perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids pfecss containing ether c o bonds are less bioaccumulative alternatives to full carbon chain predecessor pfcs brandsma et al 2019 however studies revealed that some pfecas exhibited even higher bioaccumulation potential and toxicity than pfoa and pfecas have been recognized as a new class of emerging contaminants cui et al 2018 photochemical decomposition appears to be effective to treat pfcs which could be easily operated under mild conditions and achieves higher decomposition and defluorination efficiency yang et al 2020a zhang et al 2019 homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic degradations of pfcs have been widely studied cui et al 2020 do et al 2020 yang et al 2020a in homogeneous photocatalytic processes pfcs can be removed more effectively in the presence of oxidants like persulfate and periodate cao et al 2010 a homogeneous photocatalyst i e heteropolyacid h3pw12o40 hpw was reported to show good performance for the decomposition of pfoa in the presence of oxygen gas hori et al 2004 in these photo oxidative processes electrons transfer from pfoa to the photo excited species is the crucial step of pfoa decomposition photo reductive process with eaq was confirmed to be effective for the degradation of pfcs and could be easily realized under mild conditions cui et al 2020 eaq can be produced by direct photolysis or inorganic anion mediated photolysis such as ferrocyanide mediated laser flash photolysis huang et al 2007 and ki qu et al 2010 or sulfite mediated uv photolysis methods song et al 2013 decomposition of pfcs could be also conducted by photo redox reactions catalyzed by metal ions via formation of metal pfcs complex hori et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the environmental photochemical properties of these complexes are of great importance for pollution abatement because it could promote photodecomposition of persistent pollutants cieśla et al 2004 šima and makáňová 1997 easy operation of homogenous photochemical processes low cost and readily availability of the additions make it promising for pfcs wastewater treatment however in homogenous processes the degradation and defluorination efficiencies of pfcs would be greatly influenced by water matrix constituents such as humic acid dissolved oxygen nitrate and h cui et al 2020 liang et al 2016 yang et al 2020a moreover it is troublesome to isolate the unreacted additions in homogenous photochemical processes heterogeneous photochemical processes are widely explored for environmental detoxification of liquid and gaseous ecosystems colmenares and luque 2014 with the advantages of low energy consumption high photocatalytic ability and easy separation of photocatalysts from the reaction systems chen et al 2015 although a great many of organic pollutants could be readily transformed to co2 and h2o over tio2 photocatalysts tio2 is inefficient for decomposing pfoa under mild conditions or harsh reaction conditions are required dillert et al 2007 panchangam et al 2009 notably ga2o3 in2o3 are found to be superior to tio2 when degrading pfoa in aqueous solution such as good chemical activity and stability li et al 2020a li et al 2012b bismuth based photocatalysts showed good performance in pfoa removal as well sahu et al 2018 however these photocatalysts are used for pfcs remediation only under uv light irradiation few photocatalysts are reported to possess a significant photocatalytic activity for pfoa decomposition under solar light irradiation wu et al 2019 photochemical approach appears to be effective to treat pfcs which could be easily operated under mild conditions and achieves high decomposition and defluorination efficiency xu et al have concluded heterogeneous photocatalytic processes for pfoa treatment xu et al 2017a photo oxidative and photo reductive processes have been reviewed for the degradation of pfos and pfoa wang et al 2017 very recently cui et al have concluded the reduction processes for pfcs remediation cui et al 2020 yang et al have summarized persulfate based degradation of pfos and pfoa yang et al 2020a the conclusion about heterogeneous photochemical processes for pfcs remediation is mainly about tio2 in2o3 and ga2o3 do et al 2020 a comprehensive review summarizing homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes treating pfcs is desirably needed to this end we aim to provide a critical overview of the recent advances in this area for homogenous processes oxidative reductive and metal ion mediated photocatalytic approaches are concluded including the active species participated and the degradation pathways of pfcs moreover the influences of molecular structures of pfcs on the remediation effect are discussed as well as the mechanisms of different remediation approaches for heterogeneous processes we summarize various photocatalysts applied for the decomposition of pfoa including specific properties of semiconductors benefiting their photocatalytic performances in addition the reductive and oxidative mechanisms of semiconductor photocatalytic processes and important factors influencing these processes were concluded 2 homogenous photochemical process for pfcs decomposition for the homogenous photochemical processes photo reductive and photo oxidative processes and metal ion mediated photochemical processes are concluded the performance and photo reductive degradation mechanisms of pfcs such as pfoa pfos and pfeca by eaq are reviewed and discussed unique properties of eaq and its generation in different photo reductive systems particularly uv sulfite and uv i are overviewed active radicals generated in different photo oxidative systems are concluded and the critical step for photo oxidative degradation is electron transfer from pfcs to active radicals metal ion mediated fe iii mainly used processes for the photodegradation processes are then overviewed decomposition of pfcs by fe iii was attributed to the photo redox reactions via formation of metal pfcs complex 2 1 photo reductive decomposition of pfcs the eaq induced reduction technologies are efficient to decompose recalcitrant pfcs the eaq is one of the most active species with a standard reduction potential of 2 9 v which can react with the organic compounds as a nucleophile the eaq is much more active when reacting with halogen atom included organics resulting in the cleavage of c x bond to release halide ions buxton et al 1988 the eaq can be produced by photolytic methods including direct photolysis and inorganic anions mediated photolysis i e i or sulfite mediated uv photolysis table 1 direct photoionization of liquid water is generally conducted under uv light irradiation at λ 200 nm due to a negligible absorption coefficient at λ 200 nm nikogosyan and angelov 1981 according to eq 1 both oxidative species e g oh and reductive species e g h and eaq could be generated from water splitting under uv irradiation λ 200 nm h standard reduction potential e 2 1 2 3 v was not able to break c f bonds of pfos e 2 7 v lyu et al 2015b the quantum yield of eaq from water photoionization is low because the radical species undergo significant geminate recombination mainly with oh eqs 2 3 thomsen et al 1999 scavenging oxidative species e g oh could increase the apparent quantum yields of eaq and aminopoly carboxylic acid s apcas were applied to effectively scavenge oh sun et al 2018 furthermore because of the rapid reaction between eaq and oxygen eq 4 the reduction efficiency of eaq is significantly affected by dissolved oxygen o2 thereby eaq mediated photoreductive approaches normally require strict anoxic conditions 1 h 2 o hv h e aq o h h 2 e aq h 2 o h o h 3 e aq h h 4 e aq o 2 o 2 higher quantum yield of eaq could be obtained by inorganic anions mediated photolysis than direct photolysis li et al 2012a the reason may be that solutes for photoexcitation can translate into more eaq li et al 2012a uv iodide i and uv sulfite systems are the most frequently used for the generation of eaq in the uv i system eaq was generated from the irradiation of aqueous iodide a caged complex was generated under uv irradiation containing an iodine atom and an electron i e eqs 5 7 the caged complex then dissociated into a eaq and an iodine atom the decomposition rate increased firstly and then declined as the ki concentration increased continuously the amount of triiodide and eaq generated increased with the increase of ki concentration more eaq would be consumed by triiodide resulting in the decrease of the amount of eaq available for the decomposition of pfoa humic acids could enhance the efficiency of uv i system because the generation of eaq is improved due to reduction of i2 hoi io3 and i3 back

conducted at ph 9 at anaerobic conditions under uv 254 nm light irradiation a high defluorination efficiency of 98 was obtained indicating that pfoa was almost completely defluorinated so3 2 mediated photolysis was applied for photo reductive defluorination of pfoa under mild conditions song et al 2013 due to the strong electron withdrawing ability of fluorine the fluorine atom is the reaction center when eaq attack the pfoa molecule as shown in scheme 1 the α position c f bond is more easily attacked by eaq due to the inductive effect of the carboxyl in pfoa this leads to the elimination of fluorine from pfoa and the formation of cnf2n 1h2cooh eqs 11 14 under the irradiation of uv light cnf2n 1h2cooh was excited to form free radicals such as cn 1f2n 1 cooh and ch2 eq 15 cn 1f2n 1 perhaps combined with cooh to produce cn 1f2n 1cooh eq 16 meanwhile ch2 is reactive species which could transform to ch3 and then combined with cooh to form ch3cooh eq 17 18 11 c n f 2 n 1 cooh e aq c

kinetics and the f index of pfos increase linearly with increasing chain length in contrast chain length of perfluoroalkyl carboxylate appears to barely influence the observed kinetics and the f index hori et al 2006 park et al 2009 a reductive cleavage of the ionic headgroup occurs before complete defluorination indicated by the gaseous products from incomplete defluorination pfoa is much easier to be degraded than pfos it is reported that in a catalyst free uv system a high rate of 2 78 h 1 was obtained for pfoa decomposition at ph 7 0 and 90 c whereas it was only 0 058 h 1 for pfos lyu et al 2015 theoretical studies show that two lowest lying excited singlet states of pfoa were computed at considerably lower energy 5 84 ev for 21a and 5 97 ev for 31a while pfos was found to be energetically accessible only in the high energy vacuum uv range 6 20 ev in addition intramolecular oh may be formed for pfoa when protonated and interacting with uv radiation of 7 98 ev at 155 nm both these two reasons contribute to faster degradation of pfoa filho and de souza 2020 photo reductive methods appear to be efficient for the degradation of pfos li et al 2020 extra chemicals e g alcohol iodide or sulphite are usually required to enable efficient degradation of pfos table 1 a uv sulfite system with high photon flux was employed to promote eaq production as well as to enhance the decomposition of pfos gu et al 2016 the 98 pfos 32 µm was decomposed within 30 min with initial solution ph at 9 2 and do about 5 mg l the decomposition steps of pfos involved defluorination desulfonation and scission of c c bond initially pfos anion reacted with eaq to generate c8f17so3 2 then c8f17so3 2 dissociate to c8f17 based on the calculated relative energies of dissociation fragments with respect to c8f17so3 2 δe c8f17 is the most likely produced species with the lowest δe c8f17 was likely to be hydrolyzed to pfoa and then degraded the c3f7 c4f9 and c5f11 might also be favourably formed by the dissociation of c8f17so3 2 due to lower δe of these species than other dissociation fragments i e cf3 c2f5 and c7f15 these active intermediates might then combine with cooh to form short chain pfcas and degraded further photodegradation of pfos in alkaline 2 propanol is more effective than that in water yamamoto et al 2007 the photodegradation rate constant was 0 93 days 1 in alkaline 2 propanol solution and 0 13 days 1 in water respectively the possible reason might be that photodegradation of pfos in alkaline 2 propanol solution progresses through a radical chain reaction mediated by isopropyl radical ch3 2co that initially formed by uv irradiation li et al 2020 the ch3 2co was generated by uv photolysis of 2 propanol the first step for pfos decomposition is similar to the eaq reduction process where pfos react with ch3 2co to form c8f16so3 and f humic acid ha could enhance the degradation of pfos in the uv iodide system sun et al 2017 a high degradation ratio of 86 0 and a defluorination ratio of 55 6 was achieved after irradiation for 1 5 h in the presence of both i and ha while degradation ratio of 51 7 and defluorination ratio of 4 4 was reported for uv iodide system there are several reasons why ha could enhance the photo reductive destruction of pfos in the uv iodide system firstly ha could promote the reduction of iodide oxidation products i2 hoi io3 and i3 back to i secondly ha can act as an electron shuttle to enhance the electron transfer efficiency and increase the reaction possibility thirdly a weakly bonded association of i and pfos with ha increases the reaction probability finally ha could produce eaq itself under the irradiation of uv light linear and branched structural isomers of technical pfos have different reactivity to eaq jin et al reported the efficient defluorination of technical pfos in an anoxic alkaline solution ph 8 under irradiation of 185 nm vacuum ultraviolet vuv eaq was confirmed as the active species for pfos decomposition in this process jin and zhang 2015 complete defluorination of pfos was achieved with a high yield of fluoride 16 7 mol f mol pfos in anoxic alkaline solution the decomposition of pfos enhanced with the increase of ph value the branched isomers of pfos decomposed quickly with a first order reaction rate constant of 0 0806 min 1 at ph 12 5 whereas the linear pfos decomposed more slowly with a rate constant of 0 0175 h 1 the rate constants are nearly 967 times and 4 times higher than those at ph 6 8 respectively the photo reductive degradation of pfos can be enhanced by aminopoly carboxylic acid s apcas sun et al 2018 apcas are a class of compounds which contain several carboxylate groups bound to one or more nitrogen atoms nitrilotriacetic acid nta was used both as a photosensitizer to induce water photodissociation and a scavenger of oh to inhibit the recombination between oh and eaq therefore the addition of nta could increase the amount of eaq available for pfos decomposition a high pfos degradation ratio of 85 4 and a defluorination ratio of 46 8 could be realized within 10 h in the uv nta system various other apcas can also enhance the photoreductive degradation of pfos including iminodiacetic acid ida ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta gu et al 2020 ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid trisodium salt solution edds and methylglycine diacetic acid mgda catalyst free system was also developed for rapid photocatalytic degradation of pfos in aqueous solution lyu et al 2015b and eaq was responsible for pfos photodegradation in this system according to eq 1 both oxidative species e g oh and reductive species e g h and eaq could be generated from water splitting under uv irradiation by combining alkaline condition ph 11 8 and high temperature 100 c of the solution rapid photocatalytic decomposition of pfos was achieved with a pseudo first order decomposition rate constant of 0 91 h 1 higher temperature and alkaline conditions facilitate the generation of the eaq pfos photodegradation could be significantly accelerated under boiling condition compared to the non boiling control lyu et al 2015a in this process eaq was the major reactive species for pfos decomposition the boiling state of solution enhanced the interfacial mass transfer and improved effective concentrations of reactants at the gas liquid interface thereby accelerating the pfos decomposition as indicated in table 1 the ratio of pfoa degradation and associated defluorination is not consistent for different photocatalytic systems and show discrepancies in mass balance the defluorination ratio is generally lower than the degradation ratio because of the formation of fluorine containing intermediates moreover the total recovery of fluorine decreased initially and then increase to almost 100 after sufficient time of reaction qu et al 2010 the reason is that the hydro containing fluorinated carboxylic acids formed during the degradation process and might finally transform to f jin et al 2014 2 1 2 photo reductive decomposition of pfeca molecular structure of pfcs significantly affects their reducibility a uv activated sulfite system was applied to treat chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate i e f 53b clc8f16o4s fig 1 an alternative of pfos used to produce chrome mist suppressant in china bao et al 2019 compared to pfos and perfluorinated ether potassium sulfonate f 53 c8f17o4s cl atom significantly promoted the reducibility of f 53b resulting in the fast degradation of f 53b within 1 min the possible degradation pathway of f 53b is scheduled in fig 2 the decomposition initialized with the attack of eaq on f 53b chloro fluoro and hydro fluoro intermediates were identified which suggested that there were two pathways for eaq attacking hydrogenation route i fig 2 and molecular cleavage route ii fig 2 the degradation of perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid pfeca pollutants by uv generated eaq is intimately related to its molecular structure bentel et al 2020 the ether structures of pfecas result in their distinct degradation behavior compared to the full carbon chain perfluorocarboxylic acids oxygen atoms in pfeca would increase the bond energy of c f bonds on the adjacent cf2 moieties less h f exchanged polyfluorinated products are generated which are recalcitrant to reductive defluorination instead more unstable perfluoroalcohols are produced by the cleavage of ether c o bonds thus promoting defluorination of short fluoroalkyl moieties compared to the linear pfecas branched pfecas have a higher tendency of h f exchange on the tertiary carbon which leads to lower efficiency of defluorination hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid hepo da ammonium salt with trade name genx fig 1 a typical pfecas can be readily defluorinated and degraded by eaq generated in uv sulfite system bao et al 2018 genx is completely degraded in 2 h and more than 90 of fluoride ion could be recovered after 6 h theoretical investigations indicate that the etheric bond in genx is a favorable location for eaq attack this study illustrates that uv sulfite system might be a promising technology to reduce genx pollutant 2 2 photo oxidative decomposition of pfcs homogenous photo oxidative processes have been also explored to decompose pfcs in these processes oxidative radicals generated by uv activation of inorganic ion solution are responsible for the decomoposition of pfcs the critical step for the photo oxidative decomposition of pfcs is electron extraction from pfcs to the oxidative radicals in general oh radical oxidation potential value 276 0 kj mol could not directly cleave the c f bonds in pfcs bond energy 544 kj mol 1 wang et al 2017 this is also true for other stronger oxidation radicals such as no2 co3 and so4 which can be generated in the photochemical process thus the decomposition of pfoa typically starts with the cleavage of the c c bond at the head group namely pfoa is firstly decarboxylated by radical oxidation electron transfer to form c7f15 eqs 19 20 which activates the molecule and initiates a stepwise defluorination process the c7f15 radical is unstable and may react with oh forming c6f13cof after eliminating hf c6f13cof further undergoes hydrolysis to generate c6f13cooheq 21 23 c6f13cooh then undergoes the same way as c7f15cooh and decomposed in a stepwise

electrophilic radical and more effective than ho for degrading organic compounds previous works on pfoa decomposition by so4 primarily focused on the removal efficiency and various activation strategies to produce so4 qian et al 2016 wang et al 2010 photolysis of s2o8 2 generated highly oxidative so4 which could efficiently decompose pfoa and other pfcas containing c4 c8 perfluoroalkyl groups hori et al 2005 eqs 19 23 f and co2 were the major degradation products also small amounts of pfcas with shorter chain lengths were detected in the reaction solution pfoa 1 35 mm was completely degraded with 50 mm s2o8 2 and 4 h of irradiation from a 200 w xenon mercury lamp and an initial period decomposition rate of 11 times higher than that using photolysis alone was obtained all sulfur containing species in the reaction solution were eventually transformed to sulfate ions in the degradation process carbonate radical anion co3 is a secondary radical generated by the one electron oxidation of carbonate or bicarbonate ions in aqueous solution co3 is a powerful oxidant with one electron reduction potentials of 1 59 v ph 12 5 and 1 78 v ph 7 respectively joshi and mukherjee 2006 it is strongly electrophilic towards electron rich compounds such as anilines phenols and sulfur containing compounds huie et al 1991 the addition of nahco3 and h2o2 could generate co3 under 254 nm uv irradiation phan thi et al 2013 thus significantly improving pfoa degradation with 95 7 of pfoa degraded after 8 h in this system co3 was generated by the oxidation of co3 2 and hco3 eqs 24 25 the key step for pfoa oxidation by co3 is electron extraction from c7f15coo to form c7f15coo eq 19 24 o h c o 3 2 o h c o 3 25 o h hc o 3 h 2 o c o 3 a uv nitrate system was reported for efficient mineralization of pfoa li et al 2017 where the in situ generated no2 dominated the degradation of pfoa the generated no2 could withdraw electrons form pfoa to produce pfoa radical c7f15coo eq 19 then the generated c7f15coo rapidly decarboxylated to perfluoroheptyl radical c7f15 trapping hydroxyl radial using scavengers might facilitate the generation of more no2 and enhance degradation of pfoa eqs

with both 254 nm and 185 nm light vuc light cao et al 2010 pfoa could be efficiently decomposed under vuc light irradiation while barely decomposed under uv light irradiation io4 could significantly enhance the decomposition and defluorination of pfoa under uv light irradiation while was unfavorable for both processes under vuc light irradiation highly reactive species such as io4 io3 oh and o are formed in the uv naio4 system and responsible for the decomposition of pfoa in vuc system water photolyzes into oh h and eaq resulting the decrease of io4 as being scavenged by eaq 2 3 metal ion mediated photo redox processes for pfcs removal the uv fe3 based systems have been reported to be used for the remediation of pfcs where the redox couple of fe3 fe2 is used as a homogenous photocatalyst fe3 mediated photo redox reactions table 2 proceeded via forming a metal pfcs complex iron ions are widely to be used because they are cheap and easily available researches have proved that photo irradiating an aqueous solution of fe3 carboxylate produces fe2 and oxidized carboxylate eq 28 the oxidized carboxylate can be decarboxylated to form perfluoroheptyl radicals cnh2n 1 eq 29

hydrolysis de bruyn et al 1995 forming the one cf2 unit shortened pfca cn 1f2n 1cooh eq 32 in addition fe2 in acidic water can be reoxidized to fe3 by oxygen bideau et al 1988 brandt and van eldik 1995 cn 1f2n 1cooh then undergoes the same way as cnh2n 1cooh to be decomposed in a stepwise manner the decomposition rate of pfoa is greatly affected by the concentration of fe3 wang et al 2008 increasing fe3 concentration could benefit the decomposition and defluorination of pfoa when the fe3 concentration increased from 10 to 80 µm the decomposition rate constants increased from 2 7 10 3 to 6 7 10 3 min 1 and the corresponding defluorination rate constant increased from 0 7 10 3 to 2 8 10 3 min 1 other metal ions such as cu2 and zn2 slightly enhance the decomposition of pfoa under 254 nm uv light irradiation different light sources were used to degrade pfoa in the presence of fe3 vacuum ultraviolet light λ 185 nm was combined with fe3 to defluorinate aqueous pfoa cheng et al 2014 pfoa could be effectively defluorinated under acidic conditions ph 3 4 with a molar ratio of pfoa fe3 between 1 8 1 and 1 2 1 a novel sunlight fe3 system is proposed to decompose pfoa in which 97 8 1 7 of 50 µm pfoa could be decomposed into shorter chain intermediates and f within 28 days liu et al 2013 the possible degradation pathway for pfoa is illustrated in fig 3 spectroscopic spectra indicate that electron transfer from pfoa to fe3 initiate the decomposition reaction forming fe2 and an unstable organic carboxyl radical fig 3 pathway 1 was predominant for the decomposition for pfoa fe3 was combined with oxidative species to degrade pfoa effectively uv photolysis of aqueous ferric nitrate solution uv fe no3 3 was reported which could utilize the synergistic effect of fe3 and the in situ generated no2 yuan et al 2020 92 pfoa initial concentration 5 ppm 50 ml could be removed within only 0 5 h in the uv fe no3 3 isopropanol air system with a rate constant of 2 262 h 1 o2 in this system was beneficial for the effective fe3 fe2 redox cycle and isopropanol was essential to scavenge oh to facilitate the generation of no2 the effective fe3 fe2 redox cycle and the in situ generated no2 were beneficial for the destructive removal of pfoa influences of reaction atmosphere extra inorganic oxidant inorganic anion and organic matter on pfoa photodecomposition in the presence of fe3 were investigated liang et al 2016 different from the uv fe3 system atmosphere air o2 or n2 has little impact on the defluorination of pfoa in the uvc fe3 system the reason may be that the reoxidation of fe2 to fe3 by oxygen was not essential under vuc irradiation it is reported that h2o can be cleaved to produce oh and h radicals under uv irradiation at wavelengths less than 200 nm jin and zhang 2015 oh generated by vuc light irradiation showed a profound impact on the reoxidation of fe2 to fe3 and therefore significantly affected pfoa defluorination adding extra oxidants leads to consumption of photon energy as well as fe2 and fe3 thus reducing pfoa decomposition rate for example persulfate addition obviously inhibited the decomposition of pfoa in the vuc fe3 system co3 2 hco3 added would cause an obvious increase of the solution ph and result in the precipitation of ferric hydroxide at a ph higher than 4 the complex affinity between fe3 and the anions were in the order of oh 8 95 so4 2 2 95 cl 0 5 no3 0 23 clo4 the coordination of inorganic ions with fe3 likely interfered with the fe pfoa complexation thus hampering the decomposition of pfoa inorganic anions exert adverse effects on pfoa decomposition and their effects extent follows hco3 so4 2 no3 cl clo4 cui et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 volatile organic compounds vocs in water decreased the deflluorination of pfoa the reasons may be that vocs in solution could consume photon energy and scavenge non selective radicals i e oh whereas in the presence of dissolving organic matter dom i e humic acids dom had an increasingly insignificant impact on pfoa degradation over relatively long reaction times the reason may be that humic acids were decomposed after a certain period of time liang et al 2016 c2 c5 pfcas in water can be mineralized by photocatalysis with the addition of a small amount of fe3 hori et al 2007 under uv vis 220 to 460 nm irradiation in oxygen atmosphere with the initial pfca initial fe3 molar ratio of 13 5 initial pfca concentration 67 3 mm the pseudo first order rate constants for pfca decomposition by photocatalysis were 3 6 5 3 times higher than those by photolysis alone the turnover number for pfca decomposition by photocatalysis reached 6 71 8 68 after irradiation for 24 h the catalysis process can be explained by photoredox reactions among pfca fe3 fe2 and oxygen via photo induced complexation of fe iii with the pfcas the uv vis absorption of pfcas strongly responsed to shorter wavelength below 300 nm after combining with fe3 hori et al 2007 therefore 300 nm light can only decompose limited tfa in water in the presence of fe3 maruthamuthu and huie 1995 the photodecomposition of pfos under uv light irradiation is also greatly accelerated by fe3 jin et al 2014 pfos combined with fe3 to form a complex which was photolyzed to fe2 and an organic radical through the ligand to metal charge transfer by uv light excitation subsequently the unstable pfos radical was desulfonated to generate a perfluoroalkyl radical the perfluoroalkyl radical underwent the same way of those derived from pfoa and finally mineralized to f and co2 eqs 30 32 this method works efficiently under mild conditions i e room temperature and atmospheric pressure 3 heterogeneous photochemical process for pfcs decomposition heterogeneous photocatalysis is an efficient approach for pfcs removal from contaminated water up to date there are only a few semicondutors studied for the photocatalytic degradation of pfcs and researches only focused on the decomposition of pfoa fig 4 displays the band energy diagram of semiconductors studied for the degradation of pfoa the performance and mechanisms of these photocatalysts for remediating pfoa in contaminated water are discussed according to the photo oxidative and photo reductive pathways this review mainly focuses on the performance and properties of in ga and bi based photocatalysts 3 1 photo reductive processes semiconductor photocatalysis is able to degrade pfcs in a reductive way β ga2o3 with a wide bandgap was employed for photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa zhao et al 2015 zhao and zhang 2009 the β ga2o3 has much wider bandgap 4 8 ev than tio2 3 2 ev and its conduction band position e cb 1 55 ev is much higher than tio2 e cb 0 29 ev relative to the vacuum energy level fig 4 zhao et al 2015 therefore photo induced electrons ecb in the conduction band of β ga2o3 have stronger reductive capability than that of tio2 pfoa molecules adsorbed on the surface of β ga2o3 could be reductively decomposed in an anaerobic atmosphere zhao and zhang 2009 photocatalytic reduction of pfoa by β ga2o3 was also investigated in anoxic aqueous solution zhao et al 2012 after reacting for 3 h 98 8 of pfoa was degraded with a defluorination efficiency of 31 6 in the presence of thiosulfate and bubbling n2 a possible mechanism was proposed involving the attack of ecb onto the carboxyl of cnf2n 1cooh the generated cnf2n 1 reacted with h2o to form cnf2n 1oh and then cnf2n 1oh underwent hf elimination and hydrolysis to form cn 1f2n 1cooh wang et al reported that oxalic acid could greatly improve pfoa decomposition over tio2 under n2 atmosphere wang and zhang 2011 epr results confirmed the formation of co2 which was produced from reactions between oxalic acid and photo generated h eq 34 oxalic acid can also remarkably prolong the life time of photo generated ecb by reacting with photo generated h co2 is a strong reductant with a normal potential of 1 85 v surdhar et al 1989 the authors propose that both ecb and co2 could possibly initiate the decarboxylation of pfoa eq 35 36 to form c7f15 then c7f15 would rapidly react with h2o to produce c7f15oh and forming c6f13cof after eliminating hf eq 37 38 c6f13cof was unstable and underwent hydrolysis to form c6f13cooh eq 39 c6f13cooh would undergo the same way to be completely mineralized to co2 and f co2 was primarily responsible for pfoa decomposition due to its significantly larger reduction potential compared with ecb and 86 7 pf pfoa could be decomposed in 180 min with the addition of 3 mm oxalic acid and under

scission fig 5 besides that carbonyl groups were attacked by ecb yielding perfluoroalkyl radicals cnf2n 1 by losing ho and co there were two main reaction pathways for the subsequent transformation of cnf2n 1 on one hand it reacted with h2o to generate unstable cnh2n 1oh which then underwent hf elimination and hydrolysis to form cn 1f2n 1cooh on the other hand the hydro defluorination also took place via si h c f redistribution at chain terminal of cnf2n 1 thus yielding cn 1f2n 1 by removing ch2 carbene furthermore addition or elimination of coo induced mutual transformation between cn 1f2n 1 and cn 1f2n 1cooh a new method for reductive defluorination of pfoa under visible light was conducted by using pt bi2o4 as photocatalysts and ki as electron donors wang et al 2020 the defluorination of pfoa proceeded in a photo reductive pathway in which the photo induced ecb was the dominate active species pt served as co catalyst to trap ecb while ki could trap photo generated h to promote e h separation due to the high affinity of ecb the ecb firstly attacked f atom at α position resulting in the replacement of f with h atom to form c7f13h2cooh the produced c7f13h2cooh was further transformed to c6f13cooh eq 40 and eq 41 then the generated c6f13cooh was further decomposed in the same way and finally mineralized to f and co2 40 c 7 f 13 h 2 cooh c 6 f 13 c h 2 cooh 41 c 6 f 13

c7f15cooh and decomposed in a stepwise manner the amount of hvb and the adsorption capacity of pfoa are two key parameters that determine the degradation efficiency of semiconductors under uv visible

heterogeneous semiconductors would benefit the direct oxidation of pfoa by hvb inherent properties of semiconductors have great impact on the adsorption capacity of photocatalysts larger ssa of photocatalysts helps to expose more active surfaces and enhances the adsorption capacity for pfoa it is reported that higher oxygen vacancy ov level would facilitate the adsorption of pfoa onto semiconductors li et al 2013c the bidentate coordination allows closer contact between pfoa and photocatalysts than that of monodentate mode li et al 2012b song et al 2017 moreover a side on parallel mode with both the head and tail groups anchored on the photocatalysts is reported to be much more efficient for pfoa decomposition li et al 2020b the optimization approaches for different classes of semiconductors are discussed in details along with the enhanced performance for pfoa degradation in2o3 exhibited enhanced activity than tio2 for pfoa decomposition li et al 2012b the pfoa binding pattern to tio2 surface was monodentate and the binding strength was relatively weaker therefore the hvb of tio2 are preferentially transformed to hydroxyl radicals oh which is less reactive for pfoa degradation indicated by electron spin resonance esr results li et al 2012b the pfoa closely coordinates to in2o3 in a bidentate or bridging mode fig 6 the strong bidentate binding between carboxylic group of pfoa and in2o3 surface benefited direct decomposition of pfoa by photo induced hvb the main decomposition products of in2o3 are similar to those of tio2 including c2 c7 pfcas and fluoride

the better activity was obtained for pfoa decomposition fig 7d a semiconductor of wide band gap p block metal oxyhydroxide inooh was prepared and exhibited high activity for pfoa degradation under uv light irradiation at mild conditions xu et al 2017b the rate constant for pfoa degradation by inooh is 27 6 times higher than that by p25 the main reason is that inooh have a enhanced adsorption capacity for ionized pfoa c7f15coo than p25 sheaf like ga2o3 was prepared via a polyvinyl alcohol pva assisted hydrothermal method followed by heat treatment shao et al 2013a and exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation under uv 254 nm light irradiation the decomposition rate constant was 4 85 h 1 which was 16 and 44 times higher than that using commercial ga2o3 and p25 tio2 respectively needle like β ga2o3 was also prepared and used as photocatalyst for pfoa decomposition shao et al 2013b the prepared material was efficient for the removal of trace pfoa in both pure water and wastewater with first order rate constants of 4 03 and 3 51 h 1 respectively diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy drifts revealed the tight coordination of pfoa with ga2o3 surface in a bidentate or bridging configuration which facilitates direct pfoa decomposed by photo generated h fig 8 the biocl also demonstrated good performance for the phtocatalytic degradation of pfoa the ovs controllable biocl nanosheets were facilely synthesized via a hydrolysis method and applied to degrade pfoa when ovs ratio in biocl nanosheets increased from 0 573 to 0 981 by changing the alkali source applied for preparation the efficiencies of degradation and defluorination of pfoa increased by 3 4 times the photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa over biocl is dominated by the direct hole oxidation process song et al 2017 a linear relationship was observed between the ovs level in biocl and the photocatalytic decomposition efficiency of pfoa song et al 2019 the presence of ovs in semiconductors can not only narrow the band gap to facilitate photo absorption ye et al 2011 but also promote the separation of charge carriers by trapping ecb thus promoting efficient hvb oxidation liu et al 2009 moreover ovs can serve as adsorption sites for pfcs and consequently promote the oxidation of target pollutants by photo generated hvb song et al 2019 surface defective biocl was also synthesized and used for efficient photocatalytic defluorination of pfoa using sunlight as the energy source sun et al 2019 application of biox in photocatalytic mineralization of persistent organic pollutants still suffer from drawbacks such as mismatch among the large band gap wide spectral response and weak oxidizing capability of hvb liu et al 2015 qin et al 2016 halogen doping was an effective way to adjust the band structures of bismuth oxyhalide to achieve optimal photocatalytic activity gnayem and sasson 2013 facet regulation is another efficient method to enhance the activity of a photocatalyst a high 001 facet exposed bioi0 95br0 05 was successfully prepared by doping bromine via solvothermal method and possessed remarkably high photocatalytic ability for pfoa degradation under uv light irradiation 96 of pfoa could be decomposed within 120 min and 65 of pfoa was mineralized within 180 min the reaction kinetic constant was 4 3 times higher than that using bioi control the photo generated ecb hvb were responsible for pfoa decomposition li et al 2019 the generated short chain pfcas and their evolution trends indicated that the α carbon atom was the attack point the degradation process of pfoa was initialized followed by losing cf2 unit in a stepwise manner bioi bi5o7i p n heterojunction photocatalysts could be facilely prepared by calcinating bioi at 350 c t 410 c wang et al 2019a the rate constant for pfoa decomposition by bioi bi5o7i p n heterojunction calcinated at 390 c t 390 was four times higher than that of pristine bioi k 0 061 h 1 and 1 2 times higher than that of bi5o7i prepared at 410 c k 0 206 h 1 t 390 also possessed excellent mineralization ability for pfoa with about 60 of total organic carbon removed after 6 h of irradiation epr results and active species scavenging experiments demonstrated that oh was largely responsible for photodegradation of pfoa in this system followed by o2 and hvb attacked by these active species pfoa was gradually mineralized by losing cf2 units monoclinic bipo4 a novel bi3o oh po4 2 bohp catalyst of wide band gap semiconductor were applied for the degradation of pfoa under ultraviolet irradiation bohp microparticles achieved dramatically faster rate in pfoa degradation and mineralization compared to bipo4 and a β ga2o3 nanomaterial catalyst which have smaller surface area and lower band gap energy the rate constant of bohp for pfoa degradation in a pure water solution was 15 times higher than those of both bipo4 and β ga2o3 the superior performance of bohp was primarily related to the surface charge facilitating the adsorption behavior of pfoa onto the catalyst the favorable redox potentials of bohp charge carriers also contributed to the enhanced pfoa decomposition sahu et al 2018 carbon sphere cs modification could enhance the performance of bismuth phosphate composite biohp cs xu et al 2020b 99 of pfoa could be adsorbed by biohp cs in 2 h and subsequently almost completely decomposed in 4 h of uv irradiation with a defluorination ratio of 32 5 the pfoa degradation rate was 18 times higher than that by neat biohp the carbon modification can not only enhance the adsorption capacity of pfoa but also facilitate a side on adsorption configuration of pfoa with the active sites which would promote photocatalytic cleavage of c f bonds moreover cs could enhance the stability of biohp by accepting photo induced ecb to suppress photo corrosion of the composite tungstic heteropolyacid h3pw12o40 hpw demonstrated good performance for the photodegradation of pfoa however it is worth noting that hpw has small specific surface area which would limit its application to a large extent you et al synthesized hpw biomodal mesoporous silica bms catalyst and employed it as photocatalyst for pfoa degradation under vuv light irradiation you et al 2018 bms possessed large specific surface area 1000 m2 g 1 and could provide sufficient surfaces for the dispersion of hpw the vuv hpw bms system was efficient for pfoa defluorination boron nitride bn was reported to degrade pfoa under 254 nm light irradiation duan et al 2020 scavenging experiment results indicated that pfoa degraded in a hole initiated reaction pathway in the presence of bn which is similar to the tio2 case and ros species i e o2 oh also participated in the degradation process bn was 2 and 4 times more active than tio2 before and after ball milling the material the reason may be that edge defects or b or vacancies help to enhance light absorption moreover bn demonstrated good stability showing no obvious decrease in activity over three cycles bn was also active for the photocatalytic degradation of genx however few semiconductor photocatalysts are found to efficiently degrade pfoa under mild solar irradiation mno x is deposited on the surface of in2o3 to enhance ros generation wu et al 2019 ovs generated on the surface of in2o3 paly critical roles to assist pfoa adsorption the mno x modified oxygen vacancy rich in2o3 photocatalyst possesses a significantly improved photodegradation and defluorination activity for pfoa under solar light irradiation compared to the pristine in2o3 enhanced pfoa adsorption ability and ros generation efficiency contribute to the improved performance of mnox modified in2o3 iron hydr oxides and carbon spheres feo cs were prepared via a one step hydrothermal method xu et al 2020a feo cs showed good performance for adsorbing and then degrading the pre sorbed pfoa under simulated solar light fig 9 feo cs 1 1 derived from fe glucose mixture with a molar ratio of 1 1 possessed the highest pfoa adsorption capacity and photoactivity feo cs 1 1 1 0 g l adsorbed nearly 200 µg l of pfoa within 1 h and 95 2 of pre concentrated pfoa was photodegraded in 4 h at neutral ph with a defluorination rate of 57 2 there were two reasons for the good performance of feo cs on one hand cs facilitated formation of ferrihydrite enabling adsorption of pfoa onto feo cs via binuclear and bidentate binding on the other hand the hybrid feocs structure promoted multi point corporative adsorption of pfoa which could benefit direct electron extraction from pfoa under solar light irradiation a novel adsorptive photocatalyst fe tnts ac was prepared based on commercial activated carbon ac and titanate nanotubes tnts li et al 2020b fe tnts ac demonstrated synergistic adsorption and photocatalytic activity for rapid and efficient degradation of pfoa in aqueous solution fe tnts ac was able to adsorb pfoa within a few minutes thereby effectively concentrating pfoa on the photoactive sites more than 90 of the pre concentrated pfoa could be degraded in 4 h by fe tnts ac under uv irradiation with a defluorination ratio of 62 fe tnts ac was also regenerated by the efficient photodegradation of pre concentrated pfoa and showed no significant difference in the performance for pfoa adsorption and degradation the cooperative adsorption modes of α fe2o3 particles and ac for pfoa allowed pfoa to be adsorbed on the surface of fe tnts ac in the parallel orientation side on with both tail and carboxylate group of pfoa anchored on the photocatalyst the closer contact between pfoa and photocatalyst is conducive to pfoa decomposition by photo generated hvb this study offers a concentrate destroy strategy for efficient decomposition of pfoa which is potential to degrade pfoa and other pfcs in real wastewater more cost effectively epr spin trapping experiments could be applied for identifying reactive radicals tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl could be used as the radical scavenger of photo induced ecb and h peng et al 2020 dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide is used as the trapping agent for the detection of oh and o2 the detection of o2 should be conducted in methanol dispersion and in aqueous solution for the detection of oh chen et al 2017 temp 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine is selected as the trapping agents to examine 1o2 generation wang et al 2016 for active species scavenging experiments tert butanol t buoh edta na2 benzoquinone bq and sodium azide nan3 are used as scavengers of oh holes o2 and 1o2 xu et al 2019 wang et al 2016 the s2o8 2 can effectively consume the hydrated electrons as an electron scavenger yamazaki et al 2001 to enhance the amount of hvb available for pfoa degradation photocatalysts have been combined with other semiconductors or graphene to improve its photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation to decrease the recombination of photo induced hvb ecb in2o3 have also been combined with other semiconductors or graphene to improve its photocatalytic activity for pfoa degradation ceo2 doped in2o3 xceo2 in2o3 were synthesized and used for pfoa photocatalytic degradation jiang et al 2016 the as prepared xceo2 in2o3 showed much higher photocatalytic activity than ceo2 and in2o3 under uv light irradiation the excellent photocatalytic activity of 0 86 ceo2 in2o3 was ascribed to the effective separation of photo induced electron holes promoted by charge transfer between ceo2 and in2o3 in2o3 graphene composites were also synthesized and demonstrated enhanced activity for the photodecomposition of pfoa li et al 2013a graphene was deposited on the surface of in2o3 via a sonication assisted solution method followed by heat treatment the coverage percentage of graphene on in2o3 could be adjusted by changing calcination temperature the in2o3 graphene composites without calcination were compactly covered by graphene but showed lower photocatalytic activity than in2o3 nanoparticles after heating in2o3 graphene composites at 400 c the surface of in2o3 nanoparticles were partly enwrapped by graphene and demonstrated enhanced activity for photocatalytic decomposition of pfoa the increased exposing surface of in2o3 graphene composites should be the predominant reason for providing more adsorption sites for pfoa in addition some researchers demonstrated that graphene could carry excited electrons from the semiconductor to the electron acceptor due to the role of electron shuttling resulting in efficient photogenerated electron hole pairs separation zhang et al 2010 biocl zn al hydrotalcite b bhza photocatalyst was prepared and applied for the photocatalytic degradation of pfoa yang et al 2020b over 90 of pfoa could be removed in 6 h under uv light at an optimal ph of 2 the hybrid structure of b bhza promoted the separation of photogenerated carriers thus facilitating the direct hole oxidation of pfoa the operation parameters e g ph also have significant impact on the adsorption capacity of semiconductors for pfoa with a pk a of 2 8 in water goss 2008 pfoa was completely deprotonated even at a ph of 4 the surface of photocatalyst is positively charged when solution ph the ph point of zero charge ph pzc of photocatalyst and negatively charged at ph ph pzc therefore enhanced adsorption of pfoa on photocatalysts could be realized when solution ph is smaller than ph pzc and conducive to pfoa ionization heavily acidic and alkaline conditions are not conducive to the decomposition of pfoa for instance higher defluorination rate of 38 was obtained at ph 4 in the vuv hpw bms system you et al 2018 more positively charged bohp surfaces at acidic conditions facilitated electrostatic attraction of cf3 cf2 x coo thus enhancing its photocatalytic efficiency for pfoa degradation sahu et al 2018 the presence of perchloric acid could increase the chances of perfluorocarboxylic anions to be oxidized by the hvb of excited to2 panchangam et al 2009 heterogeneous photocatalytic treatment achieved more than 99 decomposition with a defluorination efficiency of 38 of pfoa in 7 h in the presence of perchloric acid the photocatalytic system with 0 15 m perchloric acid in conjunction with optimum tio2 loading of 0 66 g l 1 exhibited optimal performance 4 conclusions and perspectives homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes are comprehensively explored for the decomposition of pfcs for homogenous systems oxidative reductive and metal ion mediated redox photochemical processes are efficient for the degradation of pfcs oxidative radicals produced in the uv addition systems and eaq generated from inorganic ion mediated are responsible species for the degradation of pfcs metal ion mediated mainly fe iii processes are effective for pfcs removal due to the formation of metal pfcs complexes that could benefit electron transfer from pfcs to fe iii photo oxidative and photo reductive approaches show relatively higher defluorination efficiency than metal ion mediated processes and photo reductive approach is more efficient for the removal of pfeca because the etheric bond in pfeca is a favorable attack point for eaq for heterogeneous photocatalytic processes degrading pfcs various photocatalysts developed are reviewed their instinct properties benefiting pfcs removal are discussed a linear relationship is obtained between the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of pfoa and the ovs amount in photocatalysts photo induced ecb and h are reactive species of photo oxidative and photo reductive approaches for pfoa removal respectively and strong binding between pfoa and semiconductor is beneficial for its decomposition adjusting aqueous ph and the surface properties of photocatalysts such as higher ovs level could benefit the adsorption of pfoa towards photocatalysts further enhancing its decomposition however heterogeneous methods show relatively lower defluorination efficiency compared to homogenous photocatalytic processes in addition compared with the homogenous photochemical processes it is much easier to separate photocatalysts from the heterogeneous reaction systems though its operation cost might be higher due to the relatively expensive price of semiconductor photocatalysts regarding these efforts made for the removal of pfcs more works are still needed from the following respects for homogenous processes firstly complete mineralization of pfcs to co2 and f is the final target for pollutant remediation but this ideal situation for pfcs degradation has not been documented therefore researchers should further improve both the decomposition and defluorination efficiencies for pfcs removal secondly the advanced treatment of pfcs degradation products has yet been reported until now how to treat the fluoride ions degradation intemediates and additives in homogenous processes remains to be a great challenge for wastewater treatment for heterogeneous processes visible light responsive photocatalysts are required for efficient degradation and defluorination of pfcs developing noble metal free photocatalysts with high activity good stability and recoverability is essential for the treatment of practical pfcs containing wastewaters moreover recent studies for heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of pfcs only focused on pfoa however pfcs are a diverse class of compounds with different structures therefore more researches are desired for the treatment of different kinds of pfcs lastly most of the reported studies are about synthetic wastewater which contain much higher concentration mg l 1 of pfcs than those in real contaminated water ng l 1 µg l 1 also the constituents of real wastewater are much more complex than that of synthetic wastewater the interfering factors e g dissolved oxygen ph noms no3 cl etc could significantly influence the pfcs removal thus both homogenous and heterogeneous photocatalytic processes should be applied and tested for the remediation of pfcs in real wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported

of aquatic environment increases the presence of contaminants of emerging concern cecs in the environment has generated great concern in recent decades the term cecs refers to a broad range of anthropogenic chemicals including pharmaceutical coumpounds phacs personal care products herbicides pesticides endocrine disrupting compounds edcs etc that are usually unregulated by current laws are generally present at low levels in the aquatic environment and impose hazards to the biota diamond et al 2011 their occurrence in surface water groundwater municipal wastewater as well as many drinking water sources has been frequently reported and well documented in the literature andreozzi et al 2003 doll and frimmel 2003 fekadu et al 2019 félix cañedo et al 2013 martínez et al 2011 nikolaou et al 2007 sánchez polo et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 yang et al 2017 detrimental effects caused by cecs have been reported and these include toxicity and endocrine disruptive effects on various living species promoting the build up of antibiotic resistance genes in pathogens and human health risks increasing the cancer risks by daily exposure to carcinogenic cecs bredhult et al 2007 forte et al 2016 helmestam et al 2014 jiang et al 2005 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 in this context the cecs pollution has become a global challenge to not only the water industry but also the entire human society tio2 photocatalysis is a promising tool for the elimination of cecs because of its mild operation conditions easy applicability and chemical free thus without continuous dosing of chemicals nature the applicability of tio2 photocatalysis for cecs elimination has been extensively studied choi et al 2010 dionysiou et al 2000 fotiou et al 2016 jiménez tototzintle et al 2018 sacco et al 2015 zheng et al 2014 and such topic is covered by some review articles published in recent years fagan et al 2016 tong et al 2012 wols and hofman caris 2012 although the use of tio2 nanoparticles is beneficial for fundamental research some major drawbacks are limiting their implementation in water treatment practice 1 costly solid liquid separation processes are needed for the retention of catalyst 2 the suspension of fine tio2 particles is easily interfered by water matrices autin et al 2013 therefore immobilized tio2 is gaining increasing research interests arlos et al 2016 chiou et al 2006 dijkstra et al 2001 dijkstra et al 2002 he et al 2016 mascolo et al 2007 among various immobilized tio2 for cecs elimination purpose tio2 nanotube array tna fabricated by electrochemical anodization is drawing more attention and is often considered to be a viable catalyst because of its large specific surface area high stability and unique transport properties of charge carriers low et al 2018 wang et al 2014 many review papers are readily available that provide general overviews on tna materials often with a focus on the fabrication and characterization of tna and its applications for different purposes macak et al 2007a b mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in recent years there are many studies on the application of tna on the elimination of cecs in water arfanis et al 2017 liang and li 2009 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b and a critical review paper that has a focus on this theme is timely therefore there is a need for a comprehensive view on the applicability of tna for cecs elimination including new perspectives to assist the identification of future research trends the primary goal of the present review work is to help the development and implementation of tna materials on cecs elimination by providing a comprehensive overview and a systematic assessment of the applications of tna materials for the elimination of different cecs current insights on the cecs removal mechanisms and kinetics over tna effects of tna properties effects of operation conditions and water matrices were summarized and analyzed and new research opportunities are identified and recommended 2 background 2 1 fundamentals of photocatalysis the study on the photoelectrochemical dissociation of water reported by fujishima and honda in 1972 opened the era of tio2 photocatalysis pc fujishima and honda 1972 since then the applications of tio2 photocatalysis for different purposes were extensively investigated cavalcante et al 2015 ioannou et al 2011 liu et al 2008a liu et al 2008b fundamentals of tio2 photocatalytic processes have been proposed in the literature cavalcante et al 2015 kuipers 2014 as a typical semiconductor tio2 has two energy bands separated by an energy level i e band gap fig 1 a thus valence band vb which has lower energy level and is fully occupied at 0 k and conduction band cb which has higher energy level and is empty at 0 k the energy level of the highest filled orbital at 0 k is defined as the fermi level ef which lies in between the valence band and the conduction band as shown in fig 1a weller 2014 when tio2 is in contact with a reaction solution a schottky junction is formed at the interface due to the difference between the ef of tio2 and the redox potential of the solution eredox the ef of tio2 would change to reach an equilibrium with the eredox of the reaction solution resulting in the formation of band bending within tio2 and the amount of band bending depends on the difference between the ef and the eredox bessegato et al 2015 paramasivam et al 2012 zhang and yates 2012 the region where the band bending takes place is defined as space charge layer scl bessegato et al 2015 more detailed review works on the electrochemical properties of semiconductors can be seen in the literature paramasivam et al 2012 zhang and yates 2012 tio2 has three crystalline phases of i e anatase brookite and rutile among which rutile and anatase are the commonly used crystalline phases in photocatalytic water treatment studies because of their appropriate band gaps 3 0 ev for rutile and 3 2 ev for anatase and easy to make nature they are the typical crystalline phases obtained in most tio2 synthesis methods whereas brookite is rarely studied as a photocatalyst in water treatment due to difficulty in synthesis cavalcante et al 2016 perego et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a a schematic representation of the photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation processes over tio2 is shown in fig 1b upon irradiation with photons having energy levels higher than the band gap of tio2 electrons e are excited and migrate from the valence band to the conduction band and leave vacant holes h in the valence band afterwards some of the e h pairs would undergo fast recombination and do not participate in following redox reactions for this the irradiation energy is lost and converted to heat the remaining charge carriers migrate to the surface of tio2 and can trigger a series of reduction oxidation processes aqueous organic contaminants can diffuse from the bulk liquid to the tio2 surface and be adsorbed both the conduction band electrons and the valence band holes can directly interact with adsorbed organic contaminants besides the valence band holes can react with water or ho to generate hydroxyl radicals oh while the conduction band electrons react with dissolved oxygen do to produce superoxide radical anions o2 those in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros especially oh possess high reactivity and can degrade a broad range of organic contaminants 2 2 fundamentals of photoelectrocatalysis the fast recombination of e h pairs is deemed as a major drawback of tio2 photocatalysis lowering the quantum efficiency of the incident irradiation power garcia segura and brillas 2017 photoelectrocatalysis pec enables better e h separation by applying a bias potential between the tna anode and the reference electrode when using a three electrode configuration where a reference electrode is applied or a voltage between the tna anode and the cathode when using a two electrode configuration without reference electrode li et al 2014b liu et al 2013 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 xin et al 2014 the applied bias potential on tio2 can regulated its ef and therefore the band bending behavior an applied bias potential at which the bands are flat and no band bending would occur is generally defined as the flat band potential efb paramasivam et al 2012 in a typical pec process a bias potential greater than the efb is applied thus the band bending within tio2 is created where the fast separation of charge carriers is achieved in general an increasing anodic voltage when using a two electrode configuration without reference electrode or anodic potential when using a three electrode configuration where a reference electrode is applied on tio2 will increase its band bending and is beneficial for the separation of charge carriers and therefore promotes the degradation of target contaminants fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the principles of pec 2 3 fundamentals of photocatalytic fuel cell in recent years a special category of pec system namely photocatalytic fuel cell pfc is gaining increasing research interests in water treatment research chen et al 2020 li et al 2014a liu et al 2011b liu et al 2011c in a pfc system the migration of photogenerated electrons from the photoanode to the counter electrode is driven by the self bias between both electrodes fig 3 for the tio2 photoanode the potential is close to the potential of its conduction band 0 46 0 56 v vs nhe at ph 7 tamirat et al 2016 while the cathode potential is approximate to the redox potential of reduction reactions take place on the cathodic surface in aerobic conditions the predominant cathodic reduction reaction is the o2 reduction reactions lianos 2017 the difference between the anode potential and the cathode potential is thus the cell voltage of the pfc system i e self bias which drives the photogenerated electrons migrating to the cathode consequently the separation of charge carriers is enhanced and therefore better degradation efficiency of cec removal is obtained compared to photocatalysis using the same catalysts without the addition of external bias more detailed review works on the principles of pfc are available elsewhere lianos 2017 2 4 general consensus on the mechanisms of cecs removal processes over tna the general consensus on the mechanisms of cecs removal over tna in both photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic including pfc processes indicates that various ros and the photogenerated h could contribute to the degradation of cecs as demonstrated in figs 1 2 and 3 among various ros mechanistic studies have highlighted the crucial role of oh in cecs via ros scavenging experiments chae et al 2019 cheng et al 2016 hua et al 2016 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b depending on the nature of the cec treated adsorption onto the tna surface is also a key step in cecs removal process especially at low initial concentrations followed by direct oxidation by the photogenerated h brugnera et al 2010 chae et al 2019 chen et al 2020 ma et al 2014 mao et al 2013 besides o2 derived from the reduction of do by photogenerated e can also contribute to the degradation of cecs mesones et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2015 teng et al 2020 2 5 tio2 nanotube arrays fabricated by electrochemical anodization the fabrication of tna via electrochemical anodization was firstly reported by zwilling et al 1999a b they found that anodic oxidation of titanium substrate in fluoride containing electrolytes could result in the formation of tna and identified the vital role of fluoride ions thereafter synthesis modification characterization and application of the tna materials drew increasing research interest albu et al 2007 beranek et al 2003 ma et al 2018 macak et al 2005 ozkan et al 2018 for a typical electrochemical anodization tna fabrication process a titanium substrate is anodized in a fluoride containing electrolyte at a constant anodic voltage either too low fluoride content 0 05 wt or too high fluoride content 1 wt is detrimental to the formation of tna too low fluoride content leads to the formation of a compact tio2 layer rather than tna while too high fluoride content leads to rigorously dissolving of the tio2 layer so the applied fluoride ions concentration is often ranging from 0 1 wt to 1 wt mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 the required anodic voltage varies greatly depending on the water content in the electrolyte when aqueous electrolyte was applied the applied anodic voltage ranged from 1 30 v in various previous studies while much higher voltage 5 150 v according to the literature was needed in organic electrolytes roy et al 2011 during the anodization process tio2 layer is firstly formed initiated by the applied anodic voltage equation 1 then the formed tio2 layer is etched by fluoride ions to form soluble tif6 2 species eqs 2 and 3 during anodization a balance between the formation and the etching of the tio2 layer would lead to the formation of the tna structure on the titanium substrate surface roy et al 2011 1 ti 2 h 2 o ti o 2 4 h 4 e 2 ti o 2 6 f 4 h ti f 6 2 2 h 2 o 3 t i 4 6 f ti f 6 2 during the fabrication of tna annealing temperature anodization potential anodization time ph of the electrolyte are key factors affecting the properties of obtained tna after anodization the as formed tna is usually in amorphous form which is not favorable for photocatalysis applications therefore annealing is needed to increase the crystalinity during which the crystalline phase of the tna can be tuned by changing the annealing temperature it is generally recognized that the applied annealing temperature for the formation of anatase is between 280 c to 450 c while higher annealing temperature above 600 c is required to the formation of rutile macak et al 2007a the diameter and the wall thickness of the tio2 nanotubes can be tuned by altering the applied anodic voltage linear correlations between the diameter of tio2 nanotubes and the applied anodic voltage have been reported in many previous studies macak et al 2007a yasuda and schmuki 2007 the length of the tio2 nanotubes is often regulated by the anodization treatment time adán et al 2016 macak et al 2007b the ph of the electrolyte affect the self organization behavior of tna by affecting the dissolution rate of tio2 ge et al 2016 besides the electrolyte temperature also exert an effect on the tna formation because viscosity of the electrolyte and mobility of fluoride ions are affected by the electrolyte temperature ge et al 2016 more in depth review works on the fabrication and characterization of tna are available in the literature ge et al 2016 mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 3 cecs removal in water and wastewater by tna table 1 presents some selected examples of recent studies on aqueous cecs elimination by tna published during the past decade 3 1 efficiencies of different processes in previous studies the efficiencies of various tna based materials in the removal of aqueous cecs were well studied chae et al 2019 mao et al 2013 marien et al 2016 tang et al 2012 tian et al 2017 ye et al 2019 and more focus were recently given to photoelectrocatalytic cecs removal over tna based materials cheng et al 2016 luo et al 2018 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 where justifications of the efficiencies of pc and pec processes were often made a consensus could be concluded from previous studies is that a tna generally exhibit better cecs removal efficiency in pec systems than that in pc systems li et al 2014b liu et al 2013 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 xin et al 2014 because the application of an anodic bias potential on the tna can promote the separation of charge carriers and therefore more charge carriers can participate in the degradation of cecs zhao and zhu 2006 moreover the applied anodic bias potential on tna may also initiate electrolysis of the target cec which would enhance the removal efficiency luo et al 2018 the role of applied bias potential on the cecs removal will be further discussed in details in section 3 4 4 applications of cecs removal over tna in pfc systems have historically drawn less research interests but more attention is paid on this direction in recent years chen et al 2020 li et al 2019a liu et al 2011c lu et al 2019 ye et al 2018a in comparison with pc systems the pfc systems generally exhibited higher cecs removal efficiencies due to enhanced separation of charge carriers driven by the self bias between tna and the counter electrode liu et al 2011b c ye et al 2018a 3 2 tna vs other immobilized tio2 materials some previous studies presented higher cecs removal efficiencies of tna than other immobilized tio2 materials for example xin et al 2011 compared the alachlor removal efficiencies of a wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material prepared in an h2so4 solution and a tna material prepared in naf na2so4 electrolyte the results showed that tna has better photoelectrochemical properties than the wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material and both photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic degradation efficiencies of alachlor by tna were much higher than those of the wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material such superior performance of tna was ascribed to the long range ordered nanostructure and short orientation diffusion distance of charge carriers although both materials consist of anatase and rutile only the tna had highly ordered nanostructure that facilitates the migration of charge carriers li et al 2014b compared the photoelectrocatalytic removal of ofloxacin over tna and a reference tio2 film under the identical operating conditions ph 3 0 applied bias potential 0 8 v and the initial concentration of ofloxacin 5 mg l although the total tio2 mass of the reference tio2 film was higher than that of the tna tna had higher ofloxacin removal efficiency due to the larger specific surface area of tna liang et al 2008 evaluated the photocatalytic removal of 2 3 dichlorophenol over tna and a conventional tio2 thin film and found that the tna exhibited higher efficiency than the conventional tio2 thin film which could be ascribed to several facts larger surface area hollow interior walls the small tna tube wall thickness of around 28 nm far smaller than the minority carrier diffusion length of 100 nm resulted in efficient separation of charge carriers and enhanced diffusion activities of the electrolyte species into the tna however it is still hard to draw a firm conclusion that any form of immobilized tio2 material is advantageous over the others the removal efficiencies and kinetics of cecs by the same catalyst material can vary greatly with different cecs different cec concentrations different mater matrices and incident light intensities an example is a study conducted by arfanis et al 2017 which compared the photocatalytic efficiencies on both salicylic acid and caffeine of tna and a tio2 p25 film under different ph conditions the results demonstrated that the cecs removal efficiency of tna could vary significantly when different target cec was dealt with tna exhibited lower caffeine removal efficiency than tio2 p25 film but its salicylic acid removal efficiency is comparable with or even higher than that of tio2 p25 film besides the difference in the total mass of tio2 in the tna and the tio2 p25 film studied in that work may also impose an effect the cec degradation process therefore no fair judgment on the performance of the different studied immobilized tio2 materials could be reached 3 3 the role of tna properties 3 3 1 effects of morphological and crystallographic properties tna fabricated by electrochemical anodization has easily tunable morphological and crystallographic properties understanding the effects of such properties on the cecs removal efficiency of tna is of particular importance a study on the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol by tna demonstrated that the crystallographic composition imposed a significant role on the metoprolol removal efficiency of tna ye et al 2018b the results suggested that the tna consisting of a mixture of anatase and rutile had a better metoprolol removal efficiency similarly liang and li 2009 reported that the tna containing both anatase and rutile had better photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 3 dichlorophenol in aqueous solution however contradictory findings were also reported according to macak et al 2007b tna consisting of pure anatase phase has the highest photocatalytic performance regarding the effect of the crystallographic composition it is a combination of the following facts that have been documented in the literature 1 anatase and rutile have different light absorbance due to their different band gaps i e 3 2 ev for anatase and 3 0 ev for rutile cavalcante et al 2016 so a mixture of anatase and rutile may have different light absorbance than pure anatase or rutile 2 anatase and rutile has different carriers recombination rates rutile has higher charge carriers recombination rate sreekantan et al 2009 so the mixture of anatase and rutile may have worse charge carriers separation than monophasic anatase tio2 which is detrimental on the photocatalytic performance 3 in some fabrication methods the heterojunction of anatase and rutile can be formed which could facilitate the separation of charge carriers and therefore promote the photocatalytic performance li et al 2019b to this end both the anatase to rutile composition ratio as well as the alignment of these two different crystalline phases play vital roles in steering the overall photocatalytic performance of a tna the effect of crystallinity was elucidated in a study by nishanthi et al 2014 cecs removal efficiency of tna increases with increasing crystallinity such findings are in accordance with the study conducted by xin et al 2011 the positive effect of higher crystallinity on the photocatalytic performance of tna was mainly attributed to the fact that higher crystallinity promotes the separation of charge carriers because high degree of crystallization reduces the presences of bulk tio2 defects which often act as charge carriers recombination sites puddu et al 2010 besides the effects of morphological properties on the cecs removal efficiency of tna have been examined for example we examined the effect of tna tube diameter on its photocatalytic metoprolol degradation efficiency ye et al 2018b the results showed that the metoprolol degradation efficiency of tna increased significantly with increasing tna tube diameter from 26 nm to 50 nm while further increased tna tube diameter to 80 nm and 106 nm did not change the metoprolol degradation efficiency according to zhuang et al 2007 the tna tube diameter affects its photocatalytic efficiency by affecting the light transmittance inside the nanotubes and changing the specific surface area of tna in general the effect of increasing tube diameter on the cecs removal efficiency is two sided 1 the increasing tube diameter benefits the organic pollutant degradation by enhancing light penetration and absorption inside the tubular structure 2 the increasing tube diameter reduces the specific surface area and therefore the mass transfer the tube length of tna is another important factor that affects the cecs removal efficiency of tna various studies have been conducted to investigate the optimal length but distinctive values were obtained in the literature lee et al 2016 fabricated tna with carried length from 7 5 to 84 7 μm and compared the photocatalytic efficiency of these tnas in terms of oh radical generally known to be the primary oxidant in tio2 photocatalysis generation capability the results clearly showed that tnas with longer tube lengths have better oh generation in a very recent study by mazierski et al 2019 the photoelectrocatalytic 5 fluorouracil removal efficiencies of tnas with varied tube lengths 0 8 μm 1 7 μm and 2 2 μm were examined and the optimal tube length was found to be 1 7 μm arfanis et al 2017 studied the efficiencies of tnas with varied tube lengths 5 20 μm on salicylic acid and caffeine removal and found that the tnas with longer tube length of 10 μm had higher salicylic acid and caffeine removal efficiencies than that of tnas with shorter tube length of 1 5 5 μm but further increased tube length to 20 μm did not affect the tna performance although they found a nearly proportional rise of the surface area and tio2 mass along with the increase of tna tube length the study by marien et al 2016 provided a more comprehensive perspective by evaluating the paraquat removal efficiencies of tnas with varied tube length 1 5 25 μm the results showed that the tna with a tube length of 7 μm exhibited the highest removal efficiency towards paraquat a model was developed to rationalize the optimal tube length for the photocatalytic performance of tna in this model the optimal photocatalytic activity of a tna was attributed to a compromise between light absorption and easy access inside the tubes 3 3 2 effect of modification fast recombination of e h pairs and the relatively wide band gap of tio2 are usually considered to be obstacles limiting the application of tio2 photocatalytic processes the recombination of e h pairs leads to waste of incident irradiation power and the relatively wide band gap limits the light absorption of tio2 exclusively in the uv range and therefore greatly inhibits the utilization of solar irradiation these shortcomings are encountered by tna as well in this context attempts have been made to improve the activity of tna by various means including doping construction of heterojunction composites etc tang et al 2012 fabricated ag nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide co decorated tna ag rgo tna and investigated its application for the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid under simulated solar light the deposition of rgo on the tna surface was via an electrochemical deposition method while the deposition of ag nanoparticles was achieved by photo reduction of adsorbed ag on the tna surface in an ag containing electrolyte the results showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ag rgo tna the photocatalytic degradation rate of the target contaminant over ag rgo tna was 11 3 times higher than that over bare tna those authors attributed this to two facts 1 rgo can enhance the separation of e h pairs by capturing the photogenerated electrons of tio2 2 ag can further enhance the electron transfer between rgo and tio2 by bridging the electron transfer process a follow up study by zhou et al 2019 using ag rgo tna for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a reported enhanced degradation by ag rgo tna compared to bare tna xin et al 2014 investigated the synthesis and application of wo3 decorated tna wo3 tna for photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 4 nonylphenol the modification of tna by wo3 was achieved by the electrochemical deposition method the wo3 tna enabled 90 removal of 4 nonylphenol under neutral conditions without external bias after 2 h illumination and the removal of 4 nonylphenol reached 98 under the same conditions when 2 v bias was applied as explained in fig 4 a the enhanced activity of wo3 tna was due to the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction and therefore facilitated e h separation in tio2 because of the lower energy of the conduction band of wo3 it would attract photogenerated e from the conduction band of tio2 and prolonged life span of h which is beneficial to the generation of ros and degradation of the target contaminant enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity of wo3 tna was also observed in a study performed by martins et al 2017 which investigated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of propylparaben by wo3 tna under the same operation conditions the degradation of propylparaben over wo3 tna was 1 5 times higher than that over bare tna sun et al 2016 reported the fabrication of cu2o modified tna cu2o tna by depositing cu2o nanoparticles onto a tna via ultrasound assisted chemical bath deposition the obtained cu2o tna exhibited superior photoelectrocatalytic activity for ibuprofen degradation photocurrent response of the cu2o tna illustrated greatly reduced e h recombination in the cu2o tna such reduced e h recombination resulted from the fact that the deposited cu2o nanoparticles on the tna surface could serve as charge carrier traps which prolonged the life span of e under the same conditions the lifetime of e in cu2o tna was estimated to be 3 8 times higher than that in unmodified tna via the bode plot estimation method by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 4b and c lu et al 2019 investigated the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride in a visible light driven pfc system employing a bivo4 modified tna bivo4 tna photoanode and a cu2o modified tna cu2o tna as the photocathode in this study the fabrication of bivo4 modified tna was achieved via two steps firstly bioi was electrochemically deposited onto the tna surface then the deposited bioi was converted to bivo4 by adding dimethyl sulfoxide containing 0 2 m vo acac 2 followed by thermal treatment photoelectric properties test showed that the bivo4 tna has higher photo response because of the formation of bivo4 tio2 heterojunction 1 the light absorption was extended to visible region due to the narrower band gap of bivo4 2 separation of e h pairs was enhanced due to facilitated migration of photogenerated e xu et al 2020 modified the tna by self doping of ti3 to produce the reduced tna for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in this study a series of self doped tnas were fabricated via an electrochemical doping method the pristine tna was placed in a three electrode electrolysis cell as the cathode with a pt foil anode and a sce reference electrode at a cathodic voltage of 1 5 v to 0 v for a designated time 0 20 min in the presence of 0 138 mg l formic acid the reduced tna exhibited much stronger light absorption in the entire uv vis range and high efficiency of photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid the enhanced light absorption was due to the formation of a doping level from ti3 species below the conduction band of tio2 and therefore narrowed the band gap of tio2 after electrochemical reduction self doping by ti3 besides research efforts have also been made to optimize the adsorption capability of tna chae et al 2019 fabricated carbon nanotubes cnt surface modified tna cnt tna to remove four commonly present cyanotoxins the obtained cnt tna showed significantly promoted adsorption capability towards the examined cyanotoxins for microcystin lr the enhancement in its adsorption on the tna was more profound the unmodified tna showed nearly no adsorption of microcystin lr while the cnt tna contains 8 6 mg cm2 cnt exhibited significant adsorption of the same contaminant in addition the cnt tna showed selective adsorption capability towards relatively larger and more hydrophobic compounds 3 4 the role of operation conditions and water matrices on the cecs removal performance of tna 3 4 1 effect of ph for photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants the ph plays an important role affecting the system performance therefore numerous studies investigating the applicability of tna on cecs removal have also highlighted the effect of ph ye et al 2018b investigated the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol over tna in a ph range of 3 to 11 rapid metoprolol degradation was obtained in the tested ph range and the degradation efficiency of metoprolol only decreased slightly in alkaline ph ph 11 this slight decrease was attributed to the electrostatic repulsive effect between deprotonated metoprolol molecules and the negatively charge tna surface however in a later study ye et al 2019 by the same authors on the 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid photocatalytic degradation over tna it was found that the alkaline ph ph 11 exhibited a great inhibitory effect ma et al 2014 investigated the application of a silver modified tna ag tna for the photocatalytic removal of glyphosate the glyphosate photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed under varying ph conditions i e ph 3 5 7 9 11 and the results suggested that acidic conditions were beneficial for glyphosate degradation while its degradation in neutral and alkaline conditions is relatively slow such a phenomenon was attributed to the altered tna surface charge and the deprotonation status of glyphosate molecules sun et al 2016 reported a similar beneficial effect of acidic ph on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen on a cu2o doped tna chen et al 2020 investigated the effect of ph on ofloxacin degradation in a tna based pfc system with a pt cathode and 0 01 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte at different ph i e ph 3 7 11 the highest ofloxacin degradation efficiency was obtained at ph 7 and the acidic ph led to a slower ofloxacin degradation while the lowest ofloxacin degradation was obtained in alkaline ph ph 11 on the contrary the highest ofloxacin degradation was obtained at ph 3 tested ph range 3 9 in another study performed by li et al 2014b who investigated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin in a photoelectrocatalysis cell consisted of a tna as photoanode and a pt cathode with 0 1 m na2so4 solution as the electrolyte liang et al 2008 reported an increased photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 3 dichlorophenol over tna with increasing ph from 3 4 to 10 9 these authors further elucidated the effect of ph on 2 3 dichlorophenol photocatalytic degradation over tna by investigating the degradation pathways under different ph values and found the formation of some intermediates was highly ph dependent similar results were found by luo et al 2018 in their investigation on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol in the literature several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain how ph affects the cecs degradation processes as illustrated in fig 5 1 the ph affects the electrostatic interaction between the tna and the target cec molecule by changing the deprotonation protonation state and thus the charge of both the tna surface and the cec molecule martins et al 2017 2 the cec degradation pathways may differ at different ph frontistis et al 2017 3 the ph has an effect on the photochemical properties of cecs e g light absorption reactivity towards direct photolysis etc liang et al 2008 4 the varied ph changes the formation and transformation pathways of main ros hepel and luo 2001 5 lower ph values favor the charge transfer between the tna and the ambient solution mazierski et al 2019 6 the flat band potential of tio2 is ph dependent liao et al 2013 7 the redox potentials of different ros are ph dependent martins et al 2017 mazierski et al 2019 in conclusion ph indeed plays a significant role in the cecs removal efficiencies of tna materials but the effect of ph cannot be generalized and depends on the chemical and physical properties of both the target cec and the applied tna therefore when designing a tna based photocatalytic process the optimal ph should be experimentally examined in each case taking these properties into account 3 4 2 effect of dissolved oxygen the role of dissolved oxygen do on tio2 photocatalysis has been highlighted in the literature do in water can act as an effective quencher for the photo generated electrons in the tna which could be beneficial for the separation of the e h pairs and therefore promotes the availability of h and the generation of oh moreover by reacting with the photo generated electrons some ros like superoxide radical anions o2 are derived from do which is also reactive towards a broad range of organic pollutants studies on the degradation of organics on semiconductor materials have highlighted the role o2 when o2 quenches e from the surface of the tio2 and minimizes the e h recombination the reaction of the adsorbed o2 with the photo generated electrons may be the rate controlling step in photocatalytic oxidation reactions gerischer and heller 1991 liang et al 2008 and the rate of this step can be maximized when oxygen is in excess almquist and biswas 2001 for tna the role of do is similar to that observed for other forms of tio2 liang et al 2008 reported that at very low do concentration 0 3 mg l the photocatalytic degradation by of 2 3 dichlorophenol by tna decreased dramatically compared to that in do saturated conditions and further increase in do up to 33 mg l by continuously purging oxygen did not significantly increase the degradation of 2 3 dichlorophenol this was attributed to the efficient separation of charge carriers within the tna structure and the efficient capture of photogenerated electrons by do chen et al 2020 investigated the effect of do on the photocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin in a tna based pfc system with n2 or air purging corresponding do concentrations were 9 mg l and 0 mg l respectively the results showed that the ofloxacin degradation rate with 9 mg l do was higher than that in the absence of do 3 4 3 effect of initial cec concentration the initial concentration of cec is an important operational parameter because the concentration level of a cec varies in different water bodies and the change of the initial cec concentration can change the removal kinetics and therefore change the treatment time required to achieve a certain level of cec removal many previous studies on cecs removal in tna based processes have investigated the effect of initial cec concentration the general consensus of these studies concludes that the apparent pseudo first order degradation rate constant kapp may decrease with the increasing initial cec concentration luo et al 2018 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018b zhou et al 2019 and sometimes linear correlations between the kapp values and the initial cec concentrations were obtained fig 6 the decrease in kapp values as initial cec concentrations increase reveals deviations for first order kinetics zhao et al 2019 however regarding the actual cec degradation rate i e d cec dt the higher initial cec concentration often yields to higher initial degradation rate for example zhou et al 2019 performed a study on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a with a silver and reduced graphene oxide modified tna it was observed that the initial tetrabromobisphenol a degradation rate increased from 0 04 mg l min to 0 46 mg l min by increasing the initial tetrabromobisphenol a concentration from 1 mg l to 20 mg l similar results were also reported by mazierski et al 2019 the initial degradation rate of 5 fluorouracil increased from 0 02 mg l min to 0 5 mg l min when increasing the initial 5 fluorouracil concentration from 1 mg l to 50 mg l moreover some previous studies also reported that at high initial cec concentrations although the kapp values decreased with increasing initial cec concentrations the initial cec degradation rates remained constant xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018b zhang et al 2014b this is an indication of possible zero order degradation kinetics when the initial cec concentrations are at high levels which may be attributed to 1 saturation of active adsorption sites of the tna 2 the mass transfer and or incident light irradiation become rate limiting ollis 2018 up to date most of previous studies were conducted with high initial concentrations of cecs in the range of 0 1 mg l to 100 mg l fig 7 which were much higher than their typical concentration levels ng l to µg l andreozzi et al 2003 doll and frimmel 2003 martínez et al 2011 nikolaou et al 2007 sánchez polo et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 of cecs in natural water bodies and various wastewater streams viewing the fact that the degradation kinetics may differ significantly at different initial cec concentration levels more efforts are still in need to examine the performance of tna based cecs removal processes at their typical environmental concentration levels and to develop more accurate kinetic models to describe and predict the degradation processes in practice 3 4 4 effect of applied bias potential in photoelectrocatalytic processes many previous studies have evaluated the effect of this parameter xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 investigated the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a in a pec system consisted of a silver and reduced graphene oxide modified tna ag gro tna photoanode and a pt sheet cathode it was found that the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a increased with an increasing bias voltage from 1 v to 9 v xin et al 2014 observed an increasing 4 nonylphenol degradation efficiency with increasing bias from 0 v to 2 v in a study investigating the degradation of 4 nonylphenol in a pec system employing a wo3 tna as photoanode and a pt foil cathode luo et al 2018 studied the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol in a pec system consisted of a tna with ru iro2 coating on the ti substrate as the photoanode and a stainless steel cathode they reported that when the applied bias was increased from 2 v to 2 7 v the total removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol increased from 60 to 100 and the rate constant increased from 0 0382 min 1 to 0 1664 min 1 these findings could be attributed to the increasing e migration to the cathode with the increase of bias potential and therefore less recombination of e h and increase in the production of ros however it should be noted that there is an optimal bias potential above which the degradation efficiency of cec no longer increases with the increasing bias potential it was also reported that the cecs degradation decreased when bias potential increased above a certain level mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 the applied bias potential can play several roles in a tna based photoelectrocatalytic cec degradation process fig 8 when the applied bias potential is lower than the oxidation potential of a cec it mainly acts as the driving force that promotes the separation of photogenerated e h pairs luo et al 2018 zhao and zhu 2006 when the applied bias potential is higher than the oxidation potential of a cec it plays a binary role that simultaneously promotes the separation of photogenerated e h pairs and initiates the electrocatalytic oxidation of the target cec where usually a synergistic effect between photoelectrocatalysis and electrocatalysis can be obtained luo et al 2018 further increased applied bias potential higher than the optimal value is often considered to be detrimental because the higher bias potentials may trigger side reactions of h which could compete with the generation of oh martins et al 2017 the optimal bias potential of a pec process depends on the nature of the tna materials applied as well as the irradiation power applied luo et al 2018 3 5 the role of water matrices on the cecs removal performance of tna 3 5 1 effect of background natural organic matter natural organic matter nom includes a broad range of organics i e humic and fulvic acids proteins and their derivatives carbohydrates and hydrocarbons that are commonly present in the aquatic environment with typical concentration levels ranging from 0 1 to 200 mg l dissolved organic carbon awfa et al 2018 mwaanga et al 2014 shimizu et al 2018 its detrimental effect on conventional tio2 slurry has been well documented gora and andrews 2017 rincón and pulgarin 2004 the detrimental effect of nom on the cecs removal performance of tna was highlighted in a few reports ye et al 2018b studied the influence of suwannee river nom standard reference nom purchased from the international humic substances society on the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol in a tna based photocatalytic system both the metoprolol degradation rate and its total removal after 2 hours of treatment were examined with the presence of nom at varied concentration levels from 5 mg l to 15 mg l the results showed that at concentration levels exceeding 5 mg l the suwannee river nom imposes a significant inhibitory effect on metoprolol degradation similar inhibitory effects were obtained with suwannee river nom and upper mississippi river nom both are standard reference noms purchased from the international humic substances society on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid over in a tna based photocatalytic system ye et al 2019 the effect of nom can also differ greatly in different operation water matrices conditions long et al 2017 for example it was reported that although nom imposes a detrimental effects on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid over tna such detrimental effects could be largely mitigated in the presence of hco3 and po4 3 or acidic alkaline conditions ye et al 2019 unfortunately the possible synergy or counteraction between nom and other operation water matrices conditions were not studied in depth a comprehensive understanding of the effect of nom is still in need 3 5 2 effect of inorganic ions a number of previous studies have been performed to examine the effect of various inorganic species liang et al 2008 xin et al 2014 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2019 ye et al 2018b for example ye et al 2018b investigated the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol over tna in the presence of po4 3 and hco3 at concentration levels of 50 200 mg l the results showed that the presence of both anions exerted no detrimental effect on the photocatalytic activity of tna in terms of metoprolol degradation moreover a slight increase in the photocatalytic activity of tna was obtained in the presence of hco3 liang et al liang et al 2008 investigated the effect of so4 2 no3 cl and h2po4 on the tna photocatalytic activity of tna in terms of 2 3 dichlorophenol degradation the obtained results demonstrated that such anions impose detrimental effects on the photocatalytic degradation of 2 3 dichlorophenol detrimental effects of no3 cl and so4 2 on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid by tna was also reported by ye et al 2019 xin et al 2014 reported detrimental effects of no3 cl hco3 and so4 2 on the degradation of 4 nonylphenol in a photoelectrocatalytic system based on wo3 tna and attributed such inhibitory effects to competitive adsorption on the surface of wo3 tna in the work by luo et al 2018 investigating the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol it was found that the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol increased significantly with increasing cl concentration the above mentioned examples often focused on how different inorganic ions interfere with the degradation kinetics of a certain cec because the constituent functional groups and the chemical properties can vary significantly among different cecs the effect of a certain inorganic ion on tna based cecs removal processes is often contaminant specific in general so4 2 no3 po4 3 were usually found to have detrimental effects on the degradation of many cecs whereas the effects of carbonate species hco3 co3 2 and cl are more contaminant specific carbonate species affect tna based cec removal processes in two ways on one hand they can rigorously quench photo generated e on the tna surface and therefore reduced e h recombination that is beneficial for cecs degradation ye et al 2018b on the other hand they act as oh scavengers which decrease the availability of oh for cecs degradation by scavenging oh carbonate species themselves are converted to carbonate radical co3 via the reactions below eqs 4 and 5 the in situ generated co3 is a selective oxidant that prefer to attack electron rich functional groups lai et al 2017 therefore the observed effect of carbonate species varies depending on the structures of cecs 4 oh co 3 2 co 3 h o 5 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o although cl acts as oh scavenger it also leads to the formation of reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 etc as shown in scheme 1 grebel et al 2010 these reactive chlorine species can react with organic contaminants via one electron oxidation hydrogen abstraction and addition to unsaturated carbon carbon bonds and therefore have selectivity to attack electron rich functional groups for cecs containing electro rich functional groups the presence of cl is unlikely to slow down their degradation whereas detrimental effect is expected for cecs do not contain electron rich functional groups therefore the effect of cl is highly compound specific 3 5 3 cecs removal performance of tna in real water matrices most previous studies on cecs removal by tna were carried out in synthetic water although it is conducive to gain basic understandings on the degradation mechanisms it is far different from the situation in real waters because natural water bodies wastewaters and even drinking water are rather complex matrices containing a broad range of inorganics bulk organics and microbiomes to fully evaluate the applicability of tna based water treatment processes for cecs removal investigations in actual waters are of great importance however only very few studies considered this aspect luo et al 2018 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b an study by ye et al 2018a investigated the removal of the herbicide 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid from real drinking water matrices containing 4 mg l organic carbon 35 6 mg l cl 11 2 mg l no3 0 18 mg l so4 2 57 7 mg l carbonate bicarbonate 27 7 mg l ca2 76 9 mg l na 9 6 mg l mg2 2 0 mg l k and 0 3 mg l cu2 in a pfc system comprised of a tna photoanode and a cu foil cathode the results showed that although the 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid degradation efficiency decreased compared to that in synthetic water the degradation of the target contaminant was nearly twice higher than that in photocatalytic operation mode even without the addition of any supporting electrolyte or adjusting of ph 4 knowledge gaps and research opportunities the applications of tna as an emerging immobilized catalyst for the removal of aqueous cecs have been demonstrated during the past decades but more research efforts are still needed to facilitate the practical implementations firstly wastewater and natural water bodies generally contain multiple cecs a large variety of different inorganics organics and microbiomes which can interfere with the tna based cecs removal but only very few studies examined the cecs removal efficiency of tna in real water matrices the current understandings on the effect of inorganic ions and background bulk organics are limited to single species and in depth mechanistic insights on the possible synergy or counteraction of the co existing inorganic ions and background organics are often are still needed secondly more comprehensive kinetics modeling are needed for process scale up in previous studies the langmuir hinshelwood model and pseudo first order kinetics model were the most applied models to describe the tna based cecs removal processes chen et al 2020 li et al 2014b liang et al 2008 liu et al 2011a lu et al 2019 marien et al 2016 martins et al 2017 mazierski et al 2019 tang et al 2012 tian et al 2017 xin et al 2014 xin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b zhou et al 2019 however the inadequacy of langmuir hinshelwood model and pseudo first order model in heterogeneous photocatalysis have been pointed out by several research groups calza et al 2020 emeline et al 2005 minero and vione 2006 ollis 2018 moreover in water treatment practice multiple cecs are present with a large variety of inorganic salts bulk organic matter as well as microbiomes but most of the previous studies did not include such factors in the kinetics models thirdly the stability of tna in real water matrices after long time operation is a crucial issue regarding its commercial applications but did not receive enough research interests the surface of tio2 nanoparticles after long time exposure to complex water matrices may change significantly peng et al 2017 but in previous studies demonstrating the efficiencies of tna based cecs removal processes in actual waters the stability of tna after long time exposure to complex water matrices remains unknown future studies exploring this aspect would be appreciated fourthly the cost efficiency is crucial to judge the applicability of a water treatment technology but it was rarely evaluated in previous studies moreover a fair comparison across studies is difficult due to varied experimental design more attention in future studies can be paid to the cost efficiency evaluation of their proposed process design and the applied tna although the obtained cost estimations may still differ from full scale implementations it can at least reflect the potential of a tna or a process design for such purposes the following aspects are strongly advised to be included 1 the demand for the irradiation energy to removal certain amount of target cec 2 the cost of the catalyst synthesis and the durability of the catalyst 3 the cost for the regeneration of the catalyst 4 the cost of any other materials involved fifthly the formation of various intermediates may increase the toxicity after treatment but the change of the toxicity after cecs degradation processes was merely studied therefore more attention should be paid to this aspect in order to assist rational process design for minimizing the risks moreover most of the previous studies were lab scale and there is still a big gap before the studied technologies are considered in full scale applications more research efforts on the reactor design reactor modeling and pilot scale operation are needed 5 concluding remarks the studies in the past decade on the applications of tna for cecs removal in different processes were reviewed in this work current insights on the cecs removal mechanisms and kinetics over tna effects of tna properties effects of operation conditions and water matrices were summarized and analyzed key knowledge gaps that need future research efforts were highlighted 1 in depth mechanistic insights on the possible synergy or counteraction of the co existing water constituents 2 more

of aquatic environment increases the presence of contaminants of emerging concern cecs in the environment has generated great concern in recent decades the term cecs refers to a broad range of anthropogenic chemicals including pharmaceutical coumpounds phacs personal care products herbicides pesticides endocrine disrupting compounds edcs etc that are usually unregulated by current laws are generally present at low levels in the aquatic environment and impose hazards to the biota diamond et al 2011 their occurrence in surface water groundwater municipal wastewater as well as many drinking water sources has been frequently reported and well documented in the literature andreozzi et al 2003 doll and frimmel 2003 fekadu et al 2019 félix cañedo et al 2013 martínez et al 2011 nikolaou et al 2007 sánchez polo et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 yang et al 2017 detrimental effects caused by cecs have been reported and these include toxicity and endocrine disruptive effects on various living species promoting the build up of antibiotic resistance genes in pathogens and human health risks increasing the cancer risks by daily exposure to carcinogenic cecs bredhult et al 2007 forte et al 2016 helmestam et al 2014 jiang et al 2005 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 in this context the cecs pollution has become a global challenge to not only the water industry but also the entire human society tio2 photocatalysis is a promising tool for the elimination of cecs because of its mild operation conditions easy applicability and chemical free thus without continuous dosing of chemicals nature the applicability of tio2 photocatalysis for cecs elimination has been extensively studied choi et al 2010 dionysiou et al 2000 fotiou et al 2016 jiménez tototzintle et al 2018 sacco et al 2015 zheng et al 2014 and such topic is covered by some review articles published in recent years fagan et al 2016 tong et al 2012 wols and hofman caris 2012 although the use of tio2 nanoparticles is beneficial for fundamental research some major drawbacks are limiting their implementation in water treatment practice 1 costly solid liquid separation processes are needed for the retention of catalyst 2 the suspension of fine tio2 particles is easily interfered by water matrices autin et al 2013 therefore immobilized tio2 is gaining increasing research interests arlos et al 2016 chiou et al 2006 dijkstra et al 2001 dijkstra et al 2002 he et al 2016 mascolo et al 2007 among various immobilized tio2 for cecs elimination purpose tio2 nanotube array tna fabricated by electrochemical anodization is drawing more attention and is often considered to be a viable catalyst because of its large specific surface area high stability and unique transport properties of charge carriers low et al 2018 wang et al 2014 many review papers are readily available that provide general overviews on tna materials often with a focus on the fabrication and characterization of tna and its applications for different purposes macak et al 2007a b mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 wang et al 2014 in recent years there are many studies on the application of tna on the elimination of cecs in water arfanis et al 2017 liang and li 2009 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b and a critical review paper that has a focus on this theme is timely therefore there is a need for a comprehensive view on the applicability of tna for cecs elimination including new perspectives to assist the identification of future research trends the primary goal of the present review work is to help the development and implementation of tna materials on cecs elimination by providing a comprehensive overview and a systematic assessment of the applications of tna materials for the elimination of different cecs current insights on the cecs removal mechanisms and kinetics over tna effects of tna properties effects of operation conditions and water matrices were summarized and analyzed and new research opportunities are identified and recommended 2 background 2 1 fundamentals of photocatalysis the study on the photoelectrochemical dissociation of water reported by fujishima and honda in 1972 opened the era of tio2 photocatalysis pc fujishima and honda 1972 since then the applications of tio2 photocatalysis for different purposes were extensively investigated cavalcante et al 2015 ioannou et al 2011 liu et al 2008a liu et al 2008b fundamentals of tio2 photocatalytic processes have been proposed in the literature cavalcante et al 2015 kuipers 2014 as a typical semiconductor tio2 has two energy bands separated by an energy level i e band gap fig 1 a thus valence band vb which has lower energy level and is fully occupied at 0 k and conduction band cb which has higher energy level and is empty at 0 k the energy level of the highest filled orbital at 0 k is defined as the fermi level ef which lies in between the valence band and the conduction band as shown in fig 1a weller 2014 when tio2 is in contact with a reaction solution a schottky junction is formed at the interface due to the difference between the ef of tio2 and the redox potential of the solution eredox the ef of tio2 would change to reach an equilibrium with the eredox of the reaction solution resulting in the formation of band bending within tio2 and the amount of band bending depends on the difference between the ef and the eredox bessegato et al 2015 paramasivam et al 2012 zhang and yates 2012 the region where the band bending takes place is defined as space charge layer scl bessegato et al 2015 more detailed review works on the electrochemical properties of semiconductors can be seen in the literature paramasivam et al 2012 zhang and yates 2012 tio2 has three crystalline phases of i e anatase brookite and rutile among which rutile and anatase are the commonly used crystalline phases in photocatalytic water treatment studies because of their appropriate band gaps 3 0 ev for rutile and 3 2 ev for anatase and easy to make nature they are the typical crystalline phases obtained in most tio2 synthesis methods whereas brookite is rarely studied as a photocatalyst in water treatment due to difficulty in synthesis cavalcante et al 2016 perego et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a a schematic representation of the photocatalytic organic pollutant degradation processes over tio2 is shown in fig 1b upon irradiation with photons having energy levels higher than the band gap of tio2 electrons e are excited and migrate from the valence band to the conduction band and leave vacant holes h in the valence band afterwards some of the e h pairs would undergo fast recombination and do not participate in following redox reactions for this the irradiation energy is lost and converted to heat the remaining charge carriers migrate to the surface of tio2 and can trigger a series of reduction oxidation processes aqueous organic contaminants can diffuse from the bulk liquid to the tio2 surface and be adsorbed both the conduction band electrons and the valence band holes can directly interact with adsorbed organic contaminants besides the valence band holes can react with water or ho to generate hydroxyl radicals oh while the conduction band electrons react with dissolved oxygen do to produce superoxide radical anions o2 those in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros especially oh possess high reactivity and can degrade a broad range of organic contaminants 2 2 fundamentals of photoelectrocatalysis the fast recombination of e h pairs is deemed as a major drawback of tio2 photocatalysis lowering the quantum efficiency of the incident irradiation power garcia segura and brillas 2017 photoelectrocatalysis pec enables better e h separation by applying a bias potential between the tna anode and the reference electrode when using a three electrode configuration where a reference electrode is applied or a voltage between the tna anode and the cathode when using a two electrode configuration without reference electrode li et al 2014b liu et al 2013 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 xin et al 2014 the applied bias potential on tio2 can regulated its ef and therefore the band bending behavior an applied bias potential at which the bands are flat and no band bending would occur is generally defined as the flat band potential efb paramasivam et al 2012 in a typical pec process a bias potential greater than the efb is applied thus the band bending within tio2 is created where the fast separation of charge carriers is achieved in general an increasing anodic voltage when using a two electrode configuration without reference electrode or anodic potential when using a three electrode configuration where a reference electrode is applied on tio2 will increase its band bending and is beneficial for the separation of charge carriers and therefore promotes the degradation of target contaminants fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the principles of pec 2 3 fundamentals of photocatalytic fuel cell in recent years a special category of pec system namely photocatalytic fuel cell pfc is gaining increasing research interests in water treatment research chen et al 2020 li et al 2014a liu et al 2011b liu et al 2011c in a pfc system the migration of photogenerated electrons from the photoanode to the counter electrode is driven by the self bias between both electrodes fig 3 for the tio2 photoanode the potential is close to the potential of its conduction band 0 46 0 56 v vs nhe at ph 7 tamirat et al 2016 while the cathode potential is approximate to the redox potential of reduction reactions take place on the cathodic surface in aerobic conditions the predominant cathodic reduction reaction is the o2 reduction reactions lianos 2017 the difference between the anode potential and the cathode potential is thus the cell voltage of the pfc system i e self bias which drives the photogenerated electrons migrating to the cathode consequently the separation of charge carriers is enhanced and therefore better degradation efficiency of cec removal is obtained compared to photocatalysis using the same catalysts without the addition of external bias more detailed review works on the principles of pfc are available elsewhere lianos 2017 2 4 general consensus on the mechanisms of cecs removal processes over tna the general consensus on the mechanisms of cecs removal over tna in both photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic including pfc processes indicates that various ros and the photogenerated h could contribute to the degradation of cecs as demonstrated in figs 1 2 and 3 among various ros mechanistic studies have highlighted the crucial role of oh in cecs via ros scavenging experiments chae et al 2019 cheng et al 2016 hua et al 2016 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b depending on the nature of the cec treated adsorption onto the tna surface is also a key step in cecs removal process especially at low initial concentrations followed by direct oxidation by the photogenerated h brugnera et al 2010 chae et al 2019 chen et al 2020 ma et al 2014 mao et al 2013 besides o2 derived from the reduction of do by photogenerated e can also contribute to the degradation of cecs mesones et al 2020 rodríguez et al 2015 teng et al 2020 2 5 tio2 nanotube arrays fabricated by electrochemical anodization the fabrication of tna via electrochemical anodization was firstly reported by zwilling et al 1999a b they found that anodic oxidation of titanium substrate in fluoride containing electrolytes could result in the formation of tna and identified the vital role of fluoride ions thereafter synthesis modification characterization and application of the tna materials drew increasing research interest albu et al 2007 beranek et al 2003 ma et al 2018 macak et al 2005 ozkan et al 2018 for a typical electrochemical anodization tna fabrication process a titanium substrate is anodized in a fluoride containing electrolyte at a constant anodic voltage either too low fluoride content 0 05 wt or too high fluoride content 1 wt is detrimental to the formation of tna too low fluoride content leads to the formation of a compact tio2 layer rather than tna while too high fluoride content leads to rigorously dissolving of the tio2 layer so the applied fluoride ions concentration is often ranging from 0 1 wt to 1 wt mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 the required anodic voltage varies greatly depending on the water content in the electrolyte when aqueous electrolyte was applied the applied anodic voltage ranged from 1 30 v in various previous studies while much higher voltage 5 150 v according to the literature was needed in organic electrolytes roy et al 2011 during the anodization process tio2 layer is firstly formed initiated by the applied anodic voltage equation 1 then the formed tio2 layer is etched by fluoride ions to form soluble tif6 2 species eqs 2 and 3 during anodization a balance between the formation and the etching of the tio2 layer would lead to the formation of the tna structure on the titanium substrate surface roy et al 2011 1 ti 2 h 2 o ti o 2 4 h 4 e 2 ti o 2 6 f 4 h ti f 6 2 2 h 2 o 3 t i 4 6 f ti f 6 2 during the fabrication of tna annealing temperature anodization potential anodization time ph of the electrolyte are key factors affecting the properties of obtained tna after anodization the as formed tna is usually in amorphous form which is not favorable for photocatalysis applications therefore annealing is needed to increase the crystalinity during which the crystalline phase of the tna can be tuned by changing the annealing temperature it is generally recognized that the applied annealing temperature for the formation of anatase is between 280 c to 450 c while higher annealing temperature above 600 c is required to the formation of rutile macak et al 2007a the diameter and the wall thickness of the tio2 nanotubes can be tuned by altering the applied anodic voltage linear correlations between the diameter of tio2 nanotubes and the applied anodic voltage have been reported in many previous studies macak et al 2007a yasuda and schmuki 2007 the length of the tio2 nanotubes is often regulated by the anodization treatment time adán et al 2016 macak et al 2007b the ph of the electrolyte affect the self organization behavior of tna by affecting the dissolution rate of tio2 ge et al 2016 besides the electrolyte temperature also exert an effect on the tna formation because viscosity of the electrolyte and mobility of fluoride ions are affected by the electrolyte temperature ge et al 2016 more in depth review works on the fabrication and characterization of tna are available in the literature ge et al 2016 mor et al 2006 roy et al 2011 3 cecs removal in water and wastewater by tna table 1 presents some selected examples of recent studies on aqueous cecs elimination by tna published during the past decade 3 1 efficiencies of different processes in previous studies the efficiencies of various tna based materials in the removal of aqueous cecs were well studied chae et al 2019 mao et al 2013 marien et al 2016 tang et al 2012 tian et al 2017 ye et al 2019 and more focus were recently given to photoelectrocatalytic cecs removal over tna based materials cheng et al 2016 luo et al 2018 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 where justifications of the efficiencies of pc and pec processes were often made a consensus could be concluded from previous studies is that a tna generally exhibit better cecs removal efficiency in pec systems than that in pc systems li et al 2014b liu et al 2013 luo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 xin et al 2014 because the application of an anodic bias potential on the tna can promote the separation of charge carriers and therefore more charge carriers can participate in the degradation of cecs zhao and zhu 2006 moreover the applied anodic bias potential on tna may also initiate electrolysis of the target cec which would enhance the removal efficiency luo et al 2018 the role of applied bias potential on the cecs removal will be further discussed in details in section 3 4 4 applications of cecs removal over tna in pfc systems have historically drawn less research interests but more attention is paid on this direction in recent years chen et al 2020 li et al 2019a liu et al 2011c lu et al 2019 ye et al 2018a in comparison with pc systems the pfc systems generally exhibited higher cecs removal efficiencies due to enhanced separation of charge carriers driven by the self bias between tna and the counter electrode liu et al 2011b c ye et al 2018a 3 2 tna vs other immobilized tio2 materials some previous studies presented higher cecs removal efficiencies of tna than other immobilized tio2 materials for example xin et al 2011 compared the alachlor removal efficiencies of a wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material prepared in an h2so4 solution and a tna material prepared in naf na2so4 electrolyte the results showed that tna has better photoelectrochemical properties than the wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material and both photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic degradation efficiencies of alachlor by tna were much higher than those of the wormhole shaped immobilized tio2 material such superior performance of tna was ascribed to the long range ordered nanostructure and short orientation diffusion distance of charge carriers although both materials consist of anatase and rutile only the tna had highly ordered nanostructure that facilitates the migration of charge carriers li et al 2014b compared the photoelectrocatalytic removal of ofloxacin over tna and a reference tio2 film under the identical operating conditions ph 3 0 applied bias potential 0 8 v and the initial concentration of ofloxacin 5 mg l although the total tio2 mass of the reference tio2 film was higher than that of the tna tna had higher ofloxacin removal efficiency due to the larger specific surface area of tna liang et al 2008 evaluated the photocatalytic removal of 2 3 dichlorophenol over tna and a conventional tio2 thin film and found that the tna exhibited higher efficiency than the conventional tio2 thin film which could be ascribed to several facts larger surface area hollow interior walls the small tna tube wall thickness of around 28 nm far smaller than the minority carrier diffusion length of 100 nm resulted in efficient separation of charge carriers and enhanced diffusion activities of the electrolyte species into the tna however it is still hard to draw a firm conclusion that any form of immobilized tio2 material is advantageous over the others the removal efficiencies and kinetics of cecs by the same catalyst material can vary greatly with different cecs different cec concentrations different mater matrices and incident light intensities an example is a study conducted by arfanis et al 2017 which compared the photocatalytic efficiencies on both salicylic acid and caffeine of tna and a tio2 p25 film under different ph conditions the results demonstrated that the cecs removal efficiency of tna could vary significantly when different target cec was dealt with tna exhibited lower caffeine removal efficiency than tio2 p25 film but its salicylic acid removal efficiency is comparable with or even higher than that of tio2 p25 film besides the difference in the total mass of tio2 in the tna and the tio2 p25 film studied in that work may also impose an effect the cec degradation process therefore no fair judgment on the performance of the different studied immobilized tio2 materials could be reached 3 3 the role of tna properties 3 3 1 effects of morphological and crystallographic properties tna fabricated by electrochemical anodization has easily tunable morphological and crystallographic properties understanding the effects of such properties on the cecs removal efficiency of tna is of particular importance a study on the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol by tna demonstrated that the crystallographic composition imposed a significant role on the metoprolol removal efficiency of tna ye et al 2018b the results suggested that the tna consisting of a mixture of anatase and rutile had a better metoprolol removal efficiency similarly liang and li 2009 reported that the tna containing both anatase and rutile had better photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 3 dichlorophenol in aqueous solution however contradictory findings were also reported according to macak et al 2007b tna consisting of pure anatase phase has the highest photocatalytic performance regarding the effect of the crystallographic composition it is a combination of the following facts that have been documented in the literature 1 anatase and rutile have different light absorbance due to their different band gaps i e 3 2 ev for anatase and 3 0 ev for rutile cavalcante et al 2016 so a mixture of anatase and rutile may have different light absorbance than pure anatase or rutile 2 anatase and rutile has different carriers recombination rates rutile has higher charge carriers recombination rate sreekantan et al 2009 so the mixture of anatase and rutile may have worse charge carriers separation than monophasic anatase tio2 which is detrimental on the photocatalytic performance 3 in some fabrication methods the heterojunction of anatase and rutile can be formed which could facilitate the separation of charge carriers and therefore promote the photocatalytic performance li et al 2019b to this end both the anatase to rutile composition ratio as well as the alignment of these two different crystalline phases play vital roles in steering the overall photocatalytic performance of a tna the effect of crystallinity was elucidated in a study by nishanthi et al 2014 cecs removal efficiency of tna increases with increasing crystallinity such findings are in accordance with the study conducted by xin et al 2011 the positive effect of higher crystallinity on the photocatalytic performance of tna was mainly attributed to the fact that higher crystallinity promotes the separation of charge carriers because high degree of crystallization reduces the presences of bulk tio2 defects which often act as charge carriers recombination sites puddu et al 2010 besides the effects of morphological properties on the cecs removal efficiency of tna have been examined for example we examined the effect of tna tube diameter on its photocatalytic metoprolol degradation efficiency ye et al 2018b the results showed that the metoprolol degradation efficiency of tna increased significantly with increasing tna tube diameter from 26 nm to 50 nm while further increased tna tube diameter to 80 nm and 106 nm did not change the metoprolol degradation efficiency according to zhuang et al 2007 the tna tube diameter affects its photocatalytic efficiency by affecting the light transmittance inside the nanotubes and changing the specific surface area of tna in general the effect of increasing tube diameter on the cecs removal efficiency is two sided 1 the increasing tube diameter benefits the organic pollutant degradation by enhancing light penetration and absorption inside the tubular structure 2 the increasing tube diameter reduces the specific surface area and therefore the mass transfer the tube length of tna is another important factor that affects the cecs removal efficiency of tna various studies have been conducted to investigate the optimal length but distinctive values were obtained in the literature lee et al 2016 fabricated tna with carried length from 7 5 to 84 7 μm and compared the photocatalytic efficiency of these tnas in terms of oh radical generally known to be the primary oxidant in tio2 photocatalysis generation capability the results clearly showed that tnas with longer tube lengths have better oh generation in a very recent study by mazierski et al 2019 the photoelectrocatalytic 5 fluorouracil removal efficiencies of tnas with varied tube lengths 0 8 μm 1 7 μm and 2 2 μm were examined and the optimal tube length was found to be 1 7 μm arfanis et al 2017 studied the efficiencies of tnas with varied tube lengths 5 20 μm on salicylic acid and caffeine removal and found that the tnas with longer tube length of 10 μm had higher salicylic acid and caffeine removal efficiencies than that of tnas with shorter tube length of 1 5 5 μm but further increased tube length to 20 μm did not affect the tna performance although they found a nearly proportional rise of the surface area and tio2 mass along with the increase of tna tube length the study by marien et al 2016 provided a more comprehensive perspective by evaluating the paraquat removal efficiencies of tnas with varied tube length 1 5 25 μm the results showed that the tna with a tube length of 7 μm exhibited the highest removal efficiency towards paraquat a model was developed to rationalize the optimal tube length for the photocatalytic performance of tna in this model the optimal photocatalytic activity of a tna was attributed to a compromise between light absorption and easy access inside the tubes 3 3 2 effect of modification fast recombination of e h pairs and the relatively wide band gap of tio2 are usually considered to be obstacles limiting the application of tio2 photocatalytic processes the recombination of e h pairs leads to waste of incident irradiation power and the relatively wide band gap limits the light absorption of tio2 exclusively in the uv range and therefore greatly inhibits the utilization of solar irradiation these shortcomings are encountered by tna as well in this context attempts have been made to improve the activity of tna by various means including doping construction of heterojunction composites etc tang et al 2012 fabricated ag nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide co decorated tna ag rgo tna and investigated its application for the removal of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid under simulated solar light the deposition of rgo on the tna surface was via an electrochemical deposition method while the deposition of ag nanoparticles was achieved by photo reduction of adsorbed ag on the tna surface in an ag containing electrolyte the results showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ag rgo tna the photocatalytic degradation rate of the target contaminant over ag rgo tna was 11 3 times higher than that over bare tna those authors attributed this to two facts 1 rgo can enhance the separation of e h pairs by capturing the photogenerated electrons of tio2 2 ag can further enhance the electron transfer between rgo and tio2 by bridging the electron transfer process a follow up study by zhou et al 2019 using ag rgo tna for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a reported enhanced degradation by ag rgo tna compared to bare tna xin et al 2014 investigated the synthesis and application of wo3 decorated tna wo3 tna for photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 4 nonylphenol the modification of tna by wo3 was achieved by the electrochemical deposition method the wo3 tna enabled 90 removal of 4 nonylphenol under neutral conditions without external bias after 2 h illumination and the removal of 4 nonylphenol reached 98 under the same conditions when 2 v bias was applied as explained in fig 4 a the enhanced activity of wo3 tna was due to the formation of wo3 tio2 heterojunction and therefore facilitated e h separation in tio2 because of the lower energy of the conduction band of wo3 it would attract photogenerated e from the conduction band of tio2 and prolonged life span of h which is beneficial to the generation of ros and degradation of the target contaminant enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity of wo3 tna was also observed in a study performed by martins et al 2017 which investigated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of propylparaben by wo3 tna under the same operation conditions the degradation of propylparaben over wo3 tna was 1 5 times higher than that over bare tna sun et al 2016 reported the fabrication of cu2o modified tna cu2o tna by depositing cu2o nanoparticles onto a tna via ultrasound assisted chemical bath deposition the obtained cu2o tna exhibited superior photoelectrocatalytic activity for ibuprofen degradation photocurrent response of the cu2o tna illustrated greatly reduced e h recombination in the cu2o tna such reduced e h recombination resulted from the fact that the deposited cu2o nanoparticles on the tna surface could serve as charge carrier traps which prolonged the life span of e under the same conditions the lifetime of e in cu2o tna was estimated to be 3 8 times higher than that in unmodified tna via the bode plot estimation method by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 4b and c lu et al 2019 investigated the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride in a visible light driven pfc system employing a bivo4 modified tna bivo4 tna photoanode and a cu2o modified tna cu2o tna as the photocathode in this study the fabrication of bivo4 modified tna was achieved via two steps firstly bioi was electrochemically deposited onto the tna surface then the deposited bioi was converted to bivo4 by adding dimethyl sulfoxide containing 0 2 m vo acac 2 followed by thermal treatment photoelectric properties test showed that the bivo4 tna has higher photo response because of the formation of bivo4 tio2 heterojunction 1 the light absorption was extended to visible region due to the narrower band gap of bivo4 2 separation of e h pairs was enhanced due to facilitated migration of photogenerated e xu et al 2020 modified the tna by self doping of ti3 to produce the reduced tna for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in this study a series of self doped tnas were fabricated via an electrochemical doping method the pristine tna was placed in a three electrode electrolysis cell as the cathode with a pt foil anode and a sce reference electrode at a cathodic voltage of 1 5 v to 0 v for a designated time 0 20 min in the presence of 0 138 mg l formic acid the reduced tna exhibited much stronger light absorption in the entire uv vis range and high efficiency of photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid the enhanced light absorption was due to the formation of a doping level from ti3 species below the conduction band of tio2 and therefore narrowed the band gap of tio2 after electrochemical reduction self doping by ti3 besides research efforts have also been made to optimize the adsorption capability of tna chae et al 2019 fabricated carbon nanotubes cnt surface modified tna cnt tna to remove four commonly present cyanotoxins the obtained cnt tna showed significantly promoted adsorption capability towards the examined cyanotoxins for microcystin lr the enhancement in its adsorption on the tna was more profound the unmodified tna showed nearly no adsorption of microcystin lr while the cnt tna contains 8 6 mg cm2 cnt exhibited significant adsorption of the same contaminant in addition the cnt tna showed selective adsorption capability towards relatively larger and more hydrophobic compounds 3 4 the role of operation conditions and water matrices on the cecs removal performance of tna 3 4 1 effect of ph for photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants the ph plays an important role affecting the system performance therefore numerous studies investigating the applicability of tna on cecs removal have also highlighted the effect of ph ye et al 2018b investigated the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol over tna in a ph range of 3 to 11 rapid metoprolol degradation was obtained in the tested ph range and the degradation efficiency of metoprolol only decreased slightly in alkaline ph ph 11 this slight decrease was attributed to the electrostatic repulsive effect between deprotonated metoprolol molecules and the negatively charge tna surface however in a later study ye et al 2019 by the same authors on the 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid photocatalytic degradation over tna it was found that the alkaline ph ph 11 exhibited a great inhibitory effect ma et al 2014 investigated the application of a silver modified tna ag tna for the photocatalytic removal of glyphosate the glyphosate photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed under varying ph conditions i e ph 3 5 7 9 11 and the results suggested that acidic conditions were beneficial for glyphosate degradation while its degradation in neutral and alkaline conditions is relatively slow such a phenomenon was attributed to the altered tna surface charge and the deprotonation status of glyphosate molecules sun et al 2016 reported a similar beneficial effect of acidic ph on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of ibuprofen on a cu2o doped tna chen et al 2020 investigated the effect of ph on ofloxacin degradation in a tna based pfc system with a pt cathode and 0 01 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte at different ph i e ph 3 7 11 the highest ofloxacin degradation efficiency was obtained at ph 7 and the acidic ph led to a slower ofloxacin degradation while the lowest ofloxacin degradation was obtained in alkaline ph ph 11 on the contrary the highest ofloxacin degradation was obtained at ph 3 tested ph range 3 9 in another study performed by li et al 2014b who investigated the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin in a photoelectrocatalysis cell consisted of a tna as photoanode and a pt cathode with 0 1 m na2so4 solution as the electrolyte liang et al 2008 reported an increased photocatalytic degradation efficiency of 2 3 dichlorophenol over tna with increasing ph from 3 4 to 10 9 these authors further elucidated the effect of ph on 2 3 dichlorophenol photocatalytic degradation over tna by investigating the degradation pathways under different ph values and found the formation of some intermediates was highly ph dependent similar results were found by luo et al 2018 in their investigation on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol in the literature several possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain how ph affects the cecs degradation processes as illustrated in fig 5 1 the ph affects the electrostatic interaction between the tna and the target cec molecule by changing the deprotonation protonation state and thus the charge of both the tna surface and the cec molecule martins et al 2017 2 the cec degradation pathways may differ at different ph frontistis et al 2017 3 the ph has an effect on the photochemical properties of cecs e g light absorption reactivity towards direct photolysis etc liang et al 2008 4 the varied ph changes the formation and transformation pathways of main ros hepel and luo 2001 5 lower ph values favor the charge transfer between the tna and the ambient solution mazierski et al 2019 6 the flat band potential of tio2 is ph dependent liao et al 2013 7 the redox potentials of different ros are ph dependent martins et al 2017 mazierski et al 2019 in conclusion ph indeed plays a significant role in the cecs removal efficiencies of tna materials but the effect of ph cannot be generalized and depends on the chemical and physical properties of both the target cec and the applied tna therefore when designing a tna based photocatalytic process the optimal ph should be experimentally examined in each case taking these properties into account 3 4 2 effect of dissolved oxygen the role of dissolved oxygen do on tio2 photocatalysis has been highlighted in the literature do in water can act as an effective quencher for the photo generated electrons in the tna which could be beneficial for the separation of the e h pairs and therefore promotes the availability of h and the generation of oh moreover by reacting with the photo generated electrons some ros like superoxide radical anions o2 are derived from do which is also reactive towards a broad range of organic pollutants studies on the degradation of organics on semiconductor materials have highlighted the role o2 when o2 quenches e from the surface of the tio2 and minimizes the e h recombination the reaction of the adsorbed o2 with the photo generated electrons may be the rate controlling step in photocatalytic oxidation reactions gerischer and heller 1991 liang et al 2008 and the rate of this step can be maximized when oxygen is in excess almquist and biswas 2001 for tna the role of do is similar to that observed for other forms of tio2 liang et al 2008 reported that at very low do concentration 0 3 mg l the photocatalytic degradation by of 2 3 dichlorophenol by tna decreased dramatically compared to that in do saturated conditions and further increase in do up to 33 mg l by continuously purging oxygen did not significantly increase the degradation of 2 3 dichlorophenol this was attributed to the efficient separation of charge carriers within the tna structure and the efficient capture of photogenerated electrons by do chen et al 2020 investigated the effect of do on the photocatalytic degradation of ofloxacin in a tna based pfc system with n2 or air purging corresponding do concentrations were 9 mg l and 0 mg l respectively the results showed that the ofloxacin degradation rate with 9 mg l do was higher than that in the absence of do 3 4 3 effect of initial cec concentration the initial concentration of cec is an important operational parameter because the concentration level of a cec varies in different water bodies and the change of the initial cec concentration can change the removal kinetics and therefore change the treatment time required to achieve a certain level of cec removal many previous studies on cecs removal in tna based processes have investigated the effect of initial cec concentration the general consensus of these studies concludes that the apparent pseudo first order degradation rate constant kapp may decrease with the increasing initial cec concentration luo et al 2018 mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018b zhou et al 2019 and sometimes linear correlations between the kapp values and the initial cec concentrations were obtained fig 6 the decrease in kapp values as initial cec concentrations increase reveals deviations for first order kinetics zhao et al 2019 however regarding the actual cec degradation rate i e d cec dt the higher initial cec concentration often yields to higher initial degradation rate for example zhou et al 2019 performed a study on the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a with a silver and reduced graphene oxide modified tna it was observed that the initial tetrabromobisphenol a degradation rate increased from 0 04 mg l min to 0 46 mg l min by increasing the initial tetrabromobisphenol a concentration from 1 mg l to 20 mg l similar results were also reported by mazierski et al 2019 the initial degradation rate of 5 fluorouracil increased from 0 02 mg l min to 0 5 mg l min when increasing the initial 5 fluorouracil concentration from 1 mg l to 50 mg l moreover some previous studies also reported that at high initial cec concentrations although the kapp values decreased with increasing initial cec concentrations the initial cec degradation rates remained constant xu et al 2020 ye et al 2018b zhang et al 2014b this is an indication of possible zero order degradation kinetics when the initial cec concentrations are at high levels which may be attributed to 1 saturation of active adsorption sites of the tna 2 the mass transfer and or incident light irradiation become rate limiting ollis 2018 up to date most of previous studies were conducted with high initial concentrations of cecs in the range of 0 1 mg l to 100 mg l fig 7 which were much higher than their typical concentration levels ng l to µg l andreozzi et al 2003 doll and frimmel 2003 martínez et al 2011 nikolaou et al 2007 sánchez polo et al 2012 ternes et al 2002 tixier et al 2003 of cecs in natural water bodies and various wastewater streams viewing the fact that the degradation kinetics may differ significantly at different initial cec concentration levels more efforts are still in need to examine the performance of tna based cecs removal processes at their typical environmental concentration levels and to develop more accurate kinetic models to describe and predict the degradation processes in practice 3 4 4 effect of applied bias potential in photoelectrocatalytic processes many previous studies have evaluated the effect of this parameter xu et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 investigated the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a in a pec system consisted of a silver and reduced graphene oxide modified tna ag gro tna photoanode and a pt sheet cathode it was found that the degradation of tetrabromobisphenol a increased with an increasing bias voltage from 1 v to 9 v xin et al 2014 observed an increasing 4 nonylphenol degradation efficiency with increasing bias from 0 v to 2 v in a study investigating the degradation of 4 nonylphenol in a pec system employing a wo3 tna as photoanode and a pt foil cathode luo et al 2018 studied the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol in a pec system consisted of a tna with ru iro2 coating on the ti substrate as the photoanode and a stainless steel cathode they reported that when the applied bias was increased from 2 v to 2 7 v the total removal of 2 4 dichlorophenol increased from 60 to 100 and the rate constant increased from 0 0382 min 1 to 0 1664 min 1 these findings could be attributed to the increasing e migration to the cathode with the increase of bias potential and therefore less recombination of e h and increase in the production of ros however it should be noted that there is an optimal bias potential above which the degradation efficiency of cec no longer increases with the increasing bias potential it was also reported that the cecs degradation decreased when bias potential increased above a certain level mazierski et al 2019 xu et al 2020 the applied bias potential can play several roles in a tna based photoelectrocatalytic cec degradation process fig 8 when the applied bias potential is lower than the oxidation potential of a cec it mainly acts as the driving force that promotes the separation of photogenerated e h pairs luo et al 2018 zhao and zhu 2006 when the applied bias potential is higher than the oxidation potential of a cec it plays a binary role that simultaneously promotes the separation of photogenerated e h pairs and initiates the electrocatalytic oxidation of the target cec where usually a synergistic effect between photoelectrocatalysis and electrocatalysis can be obtained luo et al 2018 further increased applied bias potential higher than the optimal value is often considered to be detrimental because the higher bias potentials may trigger side reactions of h which could compete with the generation of oh martins et al 2017 the optimal bias potential of a pec process depends on the nature of the tna materials applied as well as the irradiation power applied luo et al 2018 3 5 the role of water matrices on the cecs removal performance of tna 3 5 1 effect of background natural organic matter natural organic matter nom includes a broad range of organics i e humic and fulvic acids proteins and their derivatives carbohydrates and hydrocarbons that are commonly present in the aquatic environment with typical concentration levels ranging from 0 1 to 200 mg l dissolved organic carbon awfa et al 2018 mwaanga et al 2014 shimizu et al 2018 its detrimental effect on conventional tio2 slurry has been well documented gora and andrews 2017 rincón and pulgarin 2004 the detrimental effect of nom on the cecs removal performance of tna was highlighted in a few reports ye et al 2018b studied the influence of suwannee river nom standard reference nom purchased from the international humic substances society on the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol in a tna based photocatalytic system both the metoprolol degradation rate and its total removal after 2 hours of treatment were examined with the presence of nom at varied concentration levels from 5 mg l to 15 mg l the results showed that at concentration levels exceeding 5 mg l the suwannee river nom imposes a significant inhibitory effect on metoprolol degradation similar inhibitory effects were obtained with suwannee river nom and upper mississippi river nom both are standard reference noms purchased from the international humic substances society on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid over in a tna based photocatalytic system ye et al 2019 the effect of nom can also differ greatly in different operation water matrices conditions long et al 2017 for example it was reported that although nom imposes a detrimental effects on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid over tna such detrimental effects could be largely mitigated in the presence of hco3 and po4 3 or acidic alkaline conditions ye et al 2019 unfortunately the possible synergy or counteraction between nom and other operation water matrices conditions were not studied in depth a comprehensive understanding of the effect of nom is still in need 3 5 2 effect of inorganic ions a number of previous studies have been performed to examine the effect of various inorganic species liang et al 2008 xin et al 2014 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2019 ye et al 2018b for example ye et al 2018b investigated the photocatalytic degradation of metoprolol over tna in the presence of po4 3 and hco3 at concentration levels of 50 200 mg l the results showed that the presence of both anions exerted no detrimental effect on the photocatalytic activity of tna in terms of metoprolol degradation moreover a slight increase in the photocatalytic activity of tna was obtained in the presence of hco3 liang et al liang et al 2008 investigated the effect of so4 2 no3 cl and h2po4 on the tna photocatalytic activity of tna in terms of 2 3 dichlorophenol degradation the obtained results demonstrated that such anions impose detrimental effects on the photocatalytic degradation of 2 3 dichlorophenol detrimental effects of no3 cl and so4 2 on the photocatalytic degradation of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid by tna was also reported by ye et al 2019 xin et al 2014 reported detrimental effects of no3 cl hco3 and so4 2 on the degradation of 4 nonylphenol in a photoelectrocatalytic system based on wo3 tna and attributed such inhibitory effects to competitive adsorption on the surface of wo3 tna in the work by luo et al 2018 investigating the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol it was found that the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol increased significantly with increasing cl concentration the above mentioned examples often focused on how different inorganic ions interfere with the degradation kinetics of a certain cec because the constituent functional groups and the chemical properties can vary significantly among different cecs the effect of a certain inorganic ion on tna based cecs removal processes is often contaminant specific in general so4 2 no3 po4 3 were usually found to have detrimental effects on the degradation of many cecs whereas the effects of carbonate species hco3 co3 2 and cl are more contaminant specific carbonate species affect tna based cec removal processes in two ways on one hand they can rigorously quench photo generated e on the tna surface and therefore reduced e h recombination that is beneficial for cecs degradation ye et al 2018b on the other hand they act as oh scavengers which decrease the availability of oh for cecs degradation by scavenging oh carbonate species themselves are converted to carbonate radical co3 via the reactions below eqs 4 and 5 the in situ generated co3 is a selective oxidant that prefer to attack electron rich functional groups lai et al 2017 therefore the observed effect of carbonate species varies depending on the structures of cecs 4 oh co 3 2 co 3 h o 5 oh hco 3 co 3 h 2 o although cl acts as oh scavenger it also leads to the formation of reactive chlorine species e g cl cl2 etc as shown in scheme 1 grebel et al 2010 these reactive chlorine species can react with organic contaminants via one electron oxidation hydrogen abstraction and addition to unsaturated carbon carbon bonds and therefore have selectivity to attack electron rich functional groups for cecs containing electro rich functional groups the presence of cl is unlikely to slow down their degradation whereas detrimental effect is expected for cecs do not contain electron rich functional groups therefore the effect of cl is highly compound specific 3 5 3 cecs removal performance of tna in real water matrices most previous studies on cecs removal by tna were carried out in synthetic water although it is conducive to gain basic understandings on the degradation mechanisms it is far different from the situation in real waters because natural water bodies wastewaters and even drinking water are rather complex matrices containing a broad range of inorganics bulk organics and microbiomes to fully evaluate the applicability of tna based water treatment processes for cecs removal investigations in actual waters are of great importance however only very few studies considered this aspect luo et al 2018 ye et al 2018a ye et al 2018b an study by ye et al 2018a investigated the removal of the herbicide 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid from real drinking water matrices containing 4 mg l organic carbon 35 6 mg l cl 11 2 mg l no3 0 18 mg l so4 2 57 7 mg l carbonate bicarbonate 27 7 mg l ca2 76 9 mg l na 9 6 mg l mg2 2 0 mg l k and 0 3 mg l cu2 in a pfc system comprised of a tna photoanode and a cu foil cathode the results showed that although the 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyacetic acid degradation efficiency decreased compared to that in synthetic water the degradation of the target contaminant was nearly twice higher than that in photocatalytic operation mode even without the addition of any supporting electrolyte or adjusting of ph 4 knowledge gaps and research opportunities the applications of tna as an emerging immobilized catalyst for the removal of aqueous cecs have been demonstrated during the past decades but more research efforts are still needed to facilitate the practical implementations firstly wastewater and natural water bodies generally contain multiple cecs a large variety of different inorganics organics and microbiomes which can interfere with the tna based cecs removal but only very few studies examined the cecs removal efficiency of tna in real water matrices the current understandings on the effect of inorganic ions and background bulk organics are limited to single species and in depth mechanistic insights on the possible synergy or counteraction of the co existing inorganic ions and background organics are often are still needed secondly more comprehensive kinetics modeling are needed for process scale up in previous studies the langmuir hinshelwood model and pseudo first order kinetics model were the most applied models to describe the tna based cecs removal processes chen et al 2020 li et al 2014b liang et al 2008 liu et al 2011a lu et al 2019 marien et al 2016 martins et al 2017 mazierski et al 2019 tang et al 2012 tian et al 2017 xin et al 2014 xin et al 2011 zhang et al 2014b zhou et al 2019 however the inadequacy of langmuir hinshelwood model and pseudo first order model in heterogeneous photocatalysis have been pointed out by several research groups calza et al 2020 emeline et al 2005 minero and vione 2006 ollis 2018 moreover in water treatment practice multiple cecs are present with a large variety of inorganic salts bulk organic matter as well as microbiomes but most of the previous studies did not include such factors in the kinetics models thirdly the stability of tna in real water matrices after long time operation is a crucial issue regarding its commercial applications but did not receive enough research interests the surface of tio2 nanoparticles after long time exposure to complex water matrices may change significantly peng et al 2017 but in previous studies demonstrating the efficiencies of tna based cecs removal processes in actual waters the stability of tna after long time exposure to complex water matrices remains unknown future studies exploring this aspect would be appreciated fourthly the cost efficiency is crucial to judge the applicability of a water treatment technology but it was rarely evaluated in previous studies moreover a fair comparison across studies is difficult due to varied experimental design more attention in future studies can be paid to the cost efficiency evaluation of their proposed process design and the applied tna although the obtained cost estimations may still differ from full scale implementations it can at least reflect the potential of a tna or a process design for such purposes the following aspects are strongly advised to be included 1 the demand for the irradiation energy to removal certain amount of target cec 2 the cost of the catalyst synthesis and the durability of the catalyst 3 the cost for the regeneration of the catalyst 4 the cost of any other materials involved fifthly the formation of various intermediates may increase the toxicity after treatment but the change of the toxicity after cecs degradation processes was merely studied therefore more attention should be paid to this aspect in order to assist rational process design for minimizing the risks moreover most of the previous studies were lab scale and there is still a big gap before the studied technologies are considered in full scale applications more research efforts on the reactor design reactor modeling and pilot scale operation are needed 5 concluding remarks the studies in the past decade on the applications of tna for cecs removal in different processes were reviewed in this work current insights on the cecs removal mechanisms and kinetics over tna effects of tna properties effects of operation conditions and water matrices were summarized and analyzed key knowledge gaps that need future research efforts were highlighted 1 in depth mechanistic insights on the possible synergy or counteraction of the co existing water constituents 2 more comprehensive kinetics modelling 3 stability of tna after long time exposure to complex water matrices 4 cost efficiency evaluation 5 analysis on the toxicity change 6 reactor engineering studies

17509,zero valent iron zvi is known to be an additive in facilitating waste treatment and improving biogas production in anaerobic digestion ad systems this review concentrates on the chemical cycle of iron as well as the function of the iron cycle in the removal of four kinds of pollutants organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and phosphorus which are commonly encountered in waste treatment in recent studies the addition of zvi to an ad system promoted the in situ production of ch4 from co2 enabling carbon capture through biotechnology additionally using iron carbon microbial electrolytic cells in ad systems in order to accelerate electron transport as well as specific pollutant degradation mechanisms are illustrated in the present study particularly the main factors affecting the removal efficiency of contaminants in a zvi ad system such as ph vfa alkalinity alk oxidation reduction potential and particle size are reviewed according to the above characteristics combined with technical model and economic analyses an ad system based on zvi was considered to be an economical efficient and carbon neutral pollutant treatment technology accordingly iron based ad is suggested to be a promising and sustainable approach orientated to a circular economy which may be applied to many waste treatments fields graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion zero

a variety of wastes it is often utilised to produce renewable biogas like methane and hydrogen recently numerous studies have focused on adding zero valent iron zvi in ad systems in order to facilitate waste treatment and improve biogas production specifically zvi has been studied to examine its effects in improving methanogenesis from ad one hundred and twenty nine typical research papers in the past ten years are outlined in fig 1 which are statistically analysed in terms of feedstock operation temperature and country methanogenesis occurs when carbon transitions through its various oxidation states accepting electrons until carbon attains its highest reduction state wei et al 2018b zvi has been added to the system to undergo various morphological changes and played a vital role in the degradation of organic matter as well as the removal of contaminants essentially complex carbon containing compounds are broken down until they are reduced to saturated simple methane molecules while reducing carbon zvi functions as an electron donor producing hydrogen gas through the following corrosion reaction eq 1 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 presumably carbon containing compounds accept these electrons through the mediation of methanogens resulting in the production of methane it has been previously hypothesised that methanogenic bacteria consume some hydrogen to stimulate methane metabolism wu et al 2015 in other words zvi s reaction with water is believed to be the source for hydrogen which eventually saturate methane carbons other mechanisms are also considered important in using zvi to improve ad methanogenesis liu et al 2012b identified zvi s role in acting as a cofactor in several vital enzymatic processes particularly in pyruvate ferrodoxin oxidoreductase a stage where fe s clusters partake in facilitating fermentation ganzoury and allam 2015 as this fermentative step is a vital component of the overall methanogenic process it stands to reason that zvi would improve process s functionality in this way in addition zvi s reductive power has been successfully shown to contribute to the dehalogenation of its chlorinated hydrocarbons filip et al 2014 son et al 2011 in a two and a half year study of emulsified zvi in treating tetracholorethene and chlorinated daughter products it registered removal fluxes of over 85 contaminant removal su et al 2012 zvi is clearly an effective additive in the removal of sulphide phosphide and heavy metal ions as shown in table 1 ayala parra et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in fact similar instances were measured in the remediation of other wastewater systems fu et al 2014 tested a variety of zvi configurations discovering removal efficiencies for many chloro and nitro contaminants exceeding 90 of which nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi was found to be efficient in completely removing various types of dyes zvi clearly and selectively removes and degrades organic compounds which may be attributed to its success in supporting bacterial communities that perform such remediation processes accordingly zvi has demonstrated its potential in enhancing ad performance through several avenues however though these results may be instructive further research is necessary in order to understand the zvi cycle in ad systems and what the effect it has on specific mechanisms involved in pollutant removal current research continues to focus on waste treatment in the zvi enhancement of ad though investigations pertaining to methane production improvement using zvi is emerging as a major area of focus zvi s efficacy in aiding the reduction of co2 as well as the in situ production of ch4 have been analysed by many studies dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 according to the theoretical basis of zvi s role in aiding bacterial communities involved in ad ad systems that utilise zvi appear to be more robust than those without it liu et al 2015b found that zero valent iron was effective in reducing sulphate as well as producing methane from food waste by ad with production levels around 0 25 l ch4 g influent cod compared to 0 22 l ch4 g which was found to be statistically significant p 0 05 furthermore in petroleum reservoirs the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane is of great importance in the regulation of the global carbon cycle and recovery of sustainable energy the net carbon dioxide emissions of the zvi ad system almost reached zero ma et al 2018 hence carbon capture using zvi ad systems and the enhancement of in situ methane production has been the centre points of many researches many methods have been applied to enhance ad using a combination of zvi as well as other methods organic pollutants and certain specific contaminants may be removed by iron carbon microelectrolysis icme and iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells wang et al 2016a zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 although various studies have discussed co enhancement on pollutant degradation between zvi and anaerobic bacteria in the integrated system it is important to understand the mechanism of iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells in order to use this system to enhance the ad process in terms of its application in engineering less effort has been given to develop pollutant removal and ch4 production models in the zvi ad system therefore it is essential to summarize the corresponding models and create better applications for engineering moreover few reviews comprehensively summarized the mechanism of the iron cycle as well as the mechanism of the iron cycle in enhancing pollutant removal in ad systems in this review focus will be given to the mechanism of the fe cycle including electron transfer and enzyme components in the removal of important pollutants in ad systems accordingly mechanisms related to the iron cycle that improve the removal of organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and phosphorous and confer impacts on the microbial community are discussed the effect of zvi on co2 reduction and in situ ch4 production illustrated by numerous papers in recent years will also be examined from a variety of perspectives encompassing a review of electron transport dominant bacteria and co2 fixation applying zvi in carbon capture for energy conservation and emission reduction using ad systems will also be considered in addition the mechanism regarding iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells in ad systems to accelerate electron transport and promote the specific degradation of pollutants will be summarized finally a model analysis as well as considerations regarding environmental economic impacts in using zvi will be underscored evaluating zvi evaluated according to how it well performs in regard to waste treatment and renewable energy production throughout the review challenges encountered in further zvi ad process optimisations will be put forward and future directions of zvi ad research will be mentioned according to the results of the evaluated papers 2 the mechanism of iron cycle in the anaerobic digestion with zvi addition zvi is preferentially oxidized to fe ii under anaerobic conditions as shown in fig 2 it is added to the system due to its narrower stability domain for fe iii than for fe ii as shown in table 2 eq 6 7 esnault et al 2011 lefevre et al 2016 fe ii plays a significant role in microorganism proliferation and participates in the removal of various contaminants moreover it possesses a synthetic effect of key enzymes during methanogenesis improving enzymatic activity wei et al 2018a similarly acetate kinase ak phosphotransacetylase pta butyrate kinase bk and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb enzymes are vital in acid formation in anticipation of the acetification and methanogenic phases rosenzweig and ragsdale 2011 the dissolved fe ii triggers a larger percentage of protein in electronic power steering eps enriching methanogens and avoiding excessive accumulation of propionic acid and butyric acid in the system which improves the adaptability of microorganisms in adverse environments ganzoury and allam 2015 wang et al 2016a the fe s cluster is an active group in f420 reducing hydrogenase frh h2 f420 nadph f420h2 nadp which is involved in transferring co2 and h2 into ch4 with the help of coenzyme f420 it plays a dominant role in the catalysis of frh the fe

a nutrient for sulfate reducing bacteria srb and combines with h2s to form fes thereby removing s ruan et al 2017 it was reported that fe ii has a positive influence on the fermentation of fats for ch4 and its degradation products production such as long chain fatty acids production kong et al 2018 bio iron ii mediates the transfer of e from iron reducing bacteria to chlorinated organic pollutants enhancing the reduction of carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene and ddt under anoxic conditions cao et al 2012 even in strict anaerobic conditions when zvi is added to the reaction system it will react with water and oxygen to form fe iii oxide attached to the surface of zvi while a part of fe ii will be converted into fe iii in the oxidation reaction eq 10 13 deng et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 used x ray sem edx images and x ray diffraction xrd analysis to show that the main oxidation products attached to the zvi surface were feooh and fe3o4 fe iii oxide is insoluble in water under neutral conditions and can be used as an electron acceptor in degrading organic matter by iron reducing bacteria irb which is then reduced to fe ii mcgachy honetschlägerová et al 2017 the electron transport pathways during the degradation of pollutants include direct contact electron shuttles and bacteria nanowires zhang et al 2014 direct electron transfer is a process which completed through the direct contact between fe iii oxide and reductase in the extracellular membrane the enzymes mainly include multihaem c type cytochromes and enzymes related to metal reduction which oxidize organic substances to short chain or long chain fatty acids while fe iii is reduced to fe ii simultaneously shi et al 2009 the second route mainly embodies iron reducing bacteria lacking multihaem c type cytochromes conductive pili is produced from these bacteria to achieve electron transfer and this process does not require direct contact between irb and iron oxides bao 2018 liu et al 2016 in the third route exogenous and or endogenous electron shuttles such as metal chelators and flavins s0 biochar and fe ii species are used to transfer electrons dong et al 2019a feng et al 2013 qiao et al 2018a when organic matter is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by irb oxidized humic acid ha is converted into reduced ha by accepting electrons displaced from the process meanwhile fe iii is reduced by taking electrons that were transferred from the reduced ha yang et al 2017 zvi addition enriches the diversity of acetobacteria encouraging proliferation of iron reducing bacteria that degrade complex substrates in a process amenable to ad liu et al 2012c meng et al 2013 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 peng et al 2014 demonstrated that fe iii can increase methane production and its corresponding rates under anaerobic conditions accordingly maximum methane production reached 234 ml g 1 79 times the methane production in that of a control reactor luo et al 2014 peng et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 3 removal mechanism of contaminants through the iron cycle 3 1 the mechanism of the iron cycle in the removal of organic carbon the utilisation of zvi in removing cod has been shown to be largely successful de vrieze et al 2013 meng et al 2013 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 evaluated the effects of zvi addition on azo dye wastewater treatment performance and illustrated that zvi is favourable for cod removal similar studies on the zvi ad treatment of dye wastewater achieved similar levels of cod removal efficacy feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 cod removal was also observed when treating soils lefevre et al 2016 and high sulphate industrial wastewater zhang et al 2011 suggesting the mechanism is robust to a variety of waste inocula applications as the authors found concentrations of bacteria in the zvi reactors to be lower than those of non zvi reactors it appears as if the f e 0 f e 2 2 e reaction is capable of oxidizing organic substances thereby lessening cod even if zvi hinders methanogenic bacteria production when monitoring enzymes associated with improved hydrolysis acidification feng et al 2014 determined that zvi dosage aided biogas production by increasing the activity of the associated enzymes for example protease serves to decompose proteins into amino acids while cellulose catalyses the hydrolysis of polysaccharides to monoses at a zvi dosage of 20 g l protease and cellulose levels increased 92 0 and 91 7 respectively yang et al 2013 corroborated these results as a large increase in cod and cell lysis were detectable when a large nzvi with a diameter of 30 mm was used here as cod is a considerable parameter in any ad investigation the effect of zvi on cod in every reasonable context is valuable studies have also demonstrated that zvi is beneficial to the proliferation of microbes essential to the hydrolysis acidification stage in the ad process feng et al 2014 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 previous microbial analyses yang et al 2013 showed that populations of acid forming bacteroidia and clostridia gena were bolstered in nano zvi reactors which was in accordance with the findings of zvi improved oxidation reduction potential orp it would be interesting to see whether these results hold for other zvi configurations for example whether scrap zvi also results in an effective shift of the bacterial community towards acidogenesis it is important that future studies investigate the efficacy of novel zvi configurations on cod for instance employing a core shell structure similar to that of earlier studies su et al 2015 may be done to maintain the cod removal capabilities of zvi while minimising microbiotoxicity 3 2 the role of iron cycle in the removal of nitrogen nitrogen is an important structural component of microbial cells and it supports microbial activity by serving as both a source of synthetic nitrogenous metabolites and energy in the ad system hou et al 2015 however a higher concentration of nitrogen in the ad system usually results in serious inhibitory effects on the biological process the free ammonia nitrogen release by nitrogen rich feedstock is considered to be the main inhibitor for its diffusion through cell membranes and disrupting cell activity liu et al 2020 moreover previous research found that excess free ammonia could block the acetate metabolism and leading to ad process instability peng et al 2018 hence for the nitrogen rich feedstock involved in the abundance solubilization of nitrogen during the anaerobic digestion i e cattle manure and waste activated sludge the removal of nitrogen must be carried out the addition of zvi to the ad system can significantly improve the denitrify ability of the system kijjanapanich and yaowakun 2019 showed that the removal capacity of nitrogen in the system reached 93 3 in the denitrification process oxidize fe ii to fe iii under the action of nitrate reducing bacteria while the nitrate is gradually reduced to n2 tominski et al 2018 nitrate reducing bacteria are further divided into autotrophic nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizinng bacteria nrfeox and non autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria mixotrophs the autotrophic mechanism does not require the addition of organic carbon except fe ii on the contrary the latter requires the addition of organic carbon kappler et al 2005 straub et al 2004 nrfeox uses fe ii as an electron donor to generate energy and fix carbon dioxide croal et al 2009 the mechanism mainly includes three parts the mechanism diagram is shown in table 3 and fig 3 1 the presence of iron oxidoreductase 2 nitrate reductase has non specific activity 3 the electrons from fe ii are accepted by bc1 complex and reduces the quinone pool ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 for mixotrophs the role of fe ii is controversial some studies have shown that in the system of adding zvi the activity and quantity of bacteria are increased and fe ii can be regarded as an enzyme component chakraborty et al 2011 however klueglein and kappler 2013 believe that fe acts as a nutrient rather than enzymatic fe oxidation the determination of enzymatic component in potential mixotrophs is technically challenging to unravel and needs to have intricate analysis of all reactive intermediates the production of reactive nitrogen and the oxidation of fe ii occur in the cytoplasm of nitrate reducing bacteria klueglein and kappler 2013 the oxidation of organic carbon provides electrons and promotes the production of various reactive nitrogen intermediates no n2o no 2 etc chakraborty et al 2011 oshiki et al 2013 picardal 2012 intermediates of nitrate are reduced by fe ii oxidation and the process is catalysed directly by nitrous oxide reductase nos nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrate reductase nar or other periplasmic components or through ligands accelerated abiotic reactions hao et al 2017 the reactive nitrogen intermediate is reacted outside of the cell through the flanking community or with soluble iron to form nitrogen eq 15 tominski et al 2018 at the same time the hydrogen produced during the conversion of zvi to fe ii can be used as an electron donor to reduce the nitrate to nitrogen eq 13 18 wang et al 2012 zvi stoichiometrically reduces nitrate to ammonium nitrogen eq 16 xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 reported that fe ii can increase the number of haem c improve the activity of related metabolic enzymes enhance the enrichment of microorganisms and enrich the denitrifying bacteria however iron oxide deposited on the cell surface may restrict the activity of denitrifying microorganisms schädler et al 2009 3 3 the role of iron cycle in the removal of sulfur during the ad process the presence of sulfates in the system could lead to the growth of srb which impact negatively on methane production from ad the srb could compete against methanogenic bacteria for electrons and generate the toxic sulphide such as h2s which inhibit both methanogens and fermentative bacteria zhang et al 2016 hence controlling sulfates concentration below an assessable level is therefore crucial to maintain stability of an anaerobic digester lee and wong 2013 when srb is unsuitable for environmental conditions or lacks an electron donor there is hysteresis in the process of reducing sulphate ge et al 2012 guo et al 2017 the ability of the anaerobic system to reduce sulphate can be enhanced by zvi addition zhang et al 2011 found that zvi is effective in treating sulfate rich wastewater acting as an additional electron donor and buffering agent that lowers concentration of h2s it was found that zvi addition to a 4 5 g cod 1 0 g so4 2 up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb digester removed cod and sulfate at rates of 81 95 and 39 4 respectively this finding is significant as ad with cod sulfate ratios 10 exhibit high presence of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which compete against methanogenic bacteria for electrons and generate the toxic sulphide chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 during the anaerobic desulfurization adding zvi to the system produces h2 and fe ii and organic carbon to provide electrons for sulfate reduction which is shown in table 4 and fig 4 kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b venzlaff et al 2013 at the same time h2 can drive srb such as desulfovibrio and desulfobacterium reducing sulphate seth and edyvean 2006 zvi can reduce the orp 100 mw and create a strong oxidative condition for sulfate reduction zhang et al 2011 srb converts sulfate to sulfides by accepting electrons from electron donors such as h2s s2 and hs eq 22 28 kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b when the environmental conditions are neutral or alkaline the sulfides mainly exist in the form of hs and when the ph is 7 h2s is dominant and the presence of h2s inhibits the activity of srb kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b the introduction of zvi by products can modulate the ph and create alkaline conditions that favour srb growth xiao et al 2013 fe ii is an important component of hydrogenase which responsible for mass transport and electron transfer in the srb metabolism process guo et al 2017 meng et al 2013 xin et al 2008 showed that the addition of zvi can enrich srb and thereby increase sulphate finally fe ii combines with the sulfide to form a precipitate and at the same time it can also precipitate heavy metal species kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b heavy metals removed by zvi sbr relies mainly on reductive precipitation sulfide precipitation co precipitation and biosorption eq 29 dong et al 2019b 3 4 the role of iron cycle in the removal of phosphorus phosphorous is an element used in the production of fertilisers flares and steel its removal is therefore desired in ad due to the ongoing shortage of sustainably sourced phosphorous keating et al 2016 it is also possible that adjusting the phosphorous content of ad sludge can improve methane production martin et al 2009 tapia et al 2018 several studies have shown that phosphorous removal was achieved using zvi ayala parra et al 2016 shi et al 2011 su et al 2015 suanon et al 2016 su et al 2015 found nzvi favourable to phosphorous removal with the difference in p concentration in nzvi supplemented reactors being statistically significant at the p 0 001 level bioavailable fractions of p relative to total concentration decreased from 58 1 to 5 32 0 78 and 0 38 when treated with 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 wt nzvi respectively smith and carliell marquet 2009 even found that specialised dosing techniques can result in significantly better phosphorous removal rates the premise of this thrust of the study was that addition of fe would result in formation of fe p complexes which are removable through gravitational settling eq 30 31 the complexation was confirmed by the increase in fe extracted in the ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta and na4p2o7 fractions from 3 7 mg g 1 total solids ts to 67 mg g 1 ts indeed fe dosing lowered soluble p concentration from 11 2 mg g 1 ts to 2 2 mg g 1 ts shi et al 2011 explored the effects of zvi on vitamin c biosynthesis wastewater in a uasb reactor measuring multiple operation parameters promisingly one of the greatest impacts of zvi was that of its sequestration power of phosphorous in its phosphate form phosphorous removal efficiencies in the zvi enhanced bioreactor exceeded 76 compared to a meagre 2 for the control reactor however removal of phosphorous must have its limits as the element is required for encouraging methanogenic bacterial activity fjordbøge et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 and low phosphourous levels have long been associated with ad process failure phosphorus is one of the essential nutrient elements for the growth and metabolism of methanogens generally the mass fraction of phosphorus ranges from 5 to 28 g l bi et al 2013 phosphorous removal is yet another advantage of zvi treatment in ad with useful future directions including determining the zvi loads necessary to achieving optimal phosphorous content 30 2 p o 4 3 3 f e 2 f e 3 p o 4 2 31 p o 4 3 f e 3 f e p o 4 4 enhancement of anaerobic digestion process by zvi 4 1 improving co2 reduction and in situ methane production before accelerat co2 reduction to methane it is useful to understand the current achievements of zvi to enhance biogas production many studies have been founded to add zvi into anaerobic digesters to promote biogas production carpenter et al 2015 lin et al 2011 liu et al 2015a yu et al 2015 most studies surveyed in this review focused on methane production but hydrogen production as a primary aim was also significantly improved kim et al 2013 lin et al 2011 yu et al 2015 on the basis of zvi can increase the methanogenic rate of anaerobic fermentation systems many studies have begun to focus on the use of zvi ad systems to promote the conversion of co2 to methane and also capture carbon using biomethane especially in petroleum reservoirs the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane is of great significance regulating the global carbon cycle and achieving the recovery of sustainable energy the net carbon dioxide emissions of the zvi ad system can be close to zero ma et al 2018 the main mechanism is that zvi can be used as an electron donor to convert carbon dioxide into methane which is shown in fig 5 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoactogenesis are the main methanogenic pathway the h2 h drived by zvi addition is utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens for methane production through eq 4 ma et al 2018 oh et al 2016 amongst them methanosarcina spp play a major role under anaerobic conditions the bacteria can preferentially utilize carbon dioxide and hydrogen can withstand different pressures and proliferate quickly qin et al 2019 as for homoacetogenesis clostridiaceae converts co2 and h2 to acetic acid via the acety1 coa pathway eq 6 at the same time co2 can also form feco3 fe0 co2 h2o feco3 h2 with zvi as a potential extended immobilizing pathway ma et al 2019 vyrides et al 2018 found that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis predominates in the conversion of co2 to ch4 by adding inhibitors while dong added nzvi to the ad system it was reported that when excessive addition of nzvi 25 g l clostridiaceae was enriched and homoacetogenesis was dominant in the process of methane generation dong et al 2019a in the zvi ad system to promote carbon dioxide methanogenesis small zvi particles can be selected to have a larger specific surface area to promote hydrogen production and methanogenesis some research determined that the primary mechanism undergirding zvi s role in bolstering methane production lies in its improvement of biochemical methane potential bmp rather than in its improvement of hydrolysis burkhardt et al 2015 liu et al 2015a luo and angelidaki 2012 as a genus which contains exclusively acetogenic species methanosaeta is an important microbial cohort to monitor chen et al 2015 in their examination of the effects of nzvi on sludge ad yu et al 2016 found the relative abundances of methanosaeta to be between 66 6 and 74 2 for zvi treated sludge compared to the control 59 4 similarly feng et al 2014 found abundance of homoacetogens to be 38 3 in zvi reactors compared to just 23 8 for the no zvi reactors in both studies intermediate acetogenic abundance was associated with the highest methane production suggesting that an optimal balance of acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria is a prerequisite for accomplishing ideal methane production further insights into the role zvi can play for adjusting the balance of acetogenesis and methanogenesis would aid in expanding the justifications for deploying zvi in anaerobic digesters studying the measures for these results is necessary for the efficient design of future carbon dioxide capture 4 2 co enhancement on process stability and methane production of anaerobic digestion 4 2 1 synergistic enhancement of anaerobic digestion using zvi combined with biochar many methods have been employed to enhance ad using a combination of zvi and other methods liu et al 2011 oh et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 reported that gac nzvi addition led to the formation of densely packed aggregates and significantly improved the electrical conductivity and eps content in sludge fe content in sludge reached 20 43 with the loss of only 5 4 during the 34 d operation as revealed from the results of the microbial community analysis gac nzvi addition could both elevate the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria and archaea it is noteworthy that total methanogens contents were overall up regulated from 74 7 to 81 74 resulting in higher methane production oh et al 2016 studied the effects zvi and biochar on microbial reduction of nitrate finding that the co existence of zvi and biochar resulted in favourable nitrate removal after 14 days nitrate levels in the mixed waste culture fell 37 in the biochar zvi configuration compared to just 29 with zvi alone and 18 in the control reactor future studies would do well to examine whether zvi biochar aids in other ad parameters particularly performing a materials and energy balance around zvi biochar zvi biochar and control configurations for methanogenic ad would be useful in determining which configuration is most favourable li et al 2019 reported that the bioreduction of nzvi can be enhanced effectively by biochar with shewanella putrefaciens cn32 through mediating the electron transport directly in the degradation of pentachlorophenol it s reported that the zvi biochar mixtures have cooperative effects of both biochar and zvi to reduce the bioavailability and mobility of as and cd in polluted soil simultaneously qiao et al 2018b further study need to focus on bio reduction mediated by biochar to tackle the unfavourable issues of zvi zvi biochar co enhancement are attractive but care must be taken to ensure only necessary material and energy inputs are realised for example co enhancement to lessen the zvi requirements or to more favourably convert waste to high grade methane is more desirable than merely maximising waste treatment and energy output at the cost of excessive materials input critically uncovering the mechanisms behind the benefits of co enhancement would reduce time spent on unnecessary investigations into unproductive co enhancement configurations 4 2 2 the mechanism of iron carbon coupling with electrolysis iron carbon microbial electrolytic cells degrade organic pollutants and has a wide range of applications in industrial wastewater and organic wastewater treatment the system uses fe as the anode fe ii and electron eq 32 produced by the anode reaction carbon as the cathode and accept electron eq 33 the h is consumed at the cathode to suppress excessive acidification so the system has a stronger ability to degrade acetic acid fan et al 2009 compared with the addition of zvi alone during anaerobic biological treatment c can accelerate the reduction of contaminants by accepting and transferring the electrons donated by anode iron to the contaminants due to its conductivity and high adsorption capacity iron carbon fe c further accelerates the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode enhances hydrogen transfer between species boosts the decomposition of butyric acid and propionic acid and improves the methanogenic capacity which is shown in and fig 6 wang et al 2016a fe ii and h produced by icme can break the carbon chain of organic matter which is beneficial to microbial degradation of organic matter while effectively reducing carbon dioxide to produce methane liu et al 2012a at the same time the methanogenesis process uses iron as the external electron donor eq 34 to convert co2 into methane feng et al 2014 in addition micro electrolysis can enhance the specific removal of contaminants the current generated by electron transfer enhances the activation of persulfate to form sulfate and undo the benzene ring therefore it is possible to degrade a biodegradable contaminant to the small molecule organic acid li et al 2018 wang et al 2016a coupled icme into the uasb reactor to process fischere tropsch wastewater the cod removal efficiency was 80 6 1 7 and methane production arrived at 1 38 0 11 l l d which were higher than those values with zvi addition 74 5 2 8 and 1 21 0 09 l l d under the optimum hydraulic retention time hrt 5d icem improved the activities of both hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens when the contained at the 10 1 zvi activated carbon ac ratio results in a higher methane yield the cumulative methane production was 132 1 ml g vs the content arrived at 68 8 which was 55 2 higher than that of the blank and 59 6 higher than the sludge added ac alone yang et al 2019 uses uasb system to form a biofuel cell instead of an external power source blast furnace dusting ash bfda is built into the anaerobic system to build a microbial electrolysis cell in which fe and c form inter electrolysis which improves cod removal rate and the production of methane bfda is a kind of waste generated in the steel production process which realizes the recycling of waste and has high economic value in the future research process waste materials with such characteristics can also be added to the system to be constructed as bio electrolysis cells thereby realizing the recycling of waste 32 anode oxidation f e 2 e f e 2 e θ f e

utilising ad has been studied zhu et al 2012 found that rust zvi could result in bio hydrogen production levels exceeding those of industrial zvi owing in part to the increased surface area caused by rusting by day 6 of the study hydrogen yield for the 1 g l rust zvi reactor surpassed 20 umol bottle compared to under 5 umol bottle for the 1 g l industrial zvi and 200 umol bottle for the 1 g l nano zvi configuration although nzvi was definitely superior to the other configurations it is also notable that rusting appears to improve performance of industrial zvi for hydrogen production the same pattern emerged for the effect of rusting on methane production with cumulative methane at the day 10 end of the story as follows 40 umol bottle for the nzvi bottle 39 umol bottle for the rust zvi rzvi bottle 33 umol bottle for the izvi bottle and 3 umol bottle for the control bottle in the case of methane it appears that rusted zvi is practically as desirable as nzvi these results are noteworthy insofar as they offer up an environmentally favourable alternative to nzvi technology for biogas production and waste treatment with the potential to recycle rusted industrial iron to achieve reliable methane production dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 reported of methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems is promoted by the addition of zvi to the cathode compartment to reduce co2 to ch4 zvi serves as an additional element to reduce biocathode power increases cathode dependant production of ch4 and reduces current production so zvi increases cathode capture efficiency cce which measures the transfer efficiency of electrons from cathode to ch4 therefore methanogenesis can be achieved at a lower applied voltage and external energy input can be reduced furthermore adding zvi to a methanogenic biocathode can be developed to improve future biocathodes buffering the microbial activity when voltage interruptions occur or an electromethanogenic biocathode is unload however further research is required to explore the electron transfer mechanism s in methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems with zvi 5 operating parameters influencing contaminants removal in bio zvi system 5 1 ph and vfa alk the ph refers to one of the critical factors of ad as all the involved microorganisms are significantly sensitive to ph variations and the different microorganisms tolerate different ph ranges for instance the fermentative bacteria could maintain its activity in a comprehensive ph range from 4 to 8 5 while the most methanogens worked optimally in a ph range from 6 5 to 7 2 braguglia et al 2018 bai fan 2013 reported a ph range from 6 5 to 7 6 as ideal for ad as the processes composing ad require near neutral conditions however slight basicity is expected as an indicator that acidic waste compounds are converted into alkaline products which is shown in table 6 carpenter et al 2015 and luo et al 2014 proposed that reaction of zvi with available protons increases ph according to eq 7 it can be clearly seen that the above reaction explains zvi s tendency to lower the protonation of a solution which corresponds to a preferential ph value carpenter et al 2015 future studies would do well to examine how optimal zvi levels for ph management differ in different waste sources and how the optimal zvi content for ph compares to the optimal content for biogas production and waste remediation it is likely that these values will coincide meanwhile food waste ad experiments performed in kong et al 2016 found that ph for non zvi reactors ranged from 5 2 to 5 4 at high organic loading rate olr 30 g vs l ph in zvi treated reactors was maintained between 7 5 and 8 0 suggesting that olr could be increased without hindering methane production clearly zvi is very effective at elevating sludge ph which is necessary for increasing olr and sustaining methane production indeed such a discrepancy between ph is very interesting as it shows that zvi addition allows for a much higher organic loading rate other operational indicators are important to monitor to confirm that zvi aids in process stabilization across all fields of digester functionality closely related to ph is vfa alk ratio another important indicator of process stability a vfa alk ratio below 0 3 0 4 indicates a minimal risk of acidification elbeshbishy and nakhla 2011 shahriari et al 2013 kong et al 2016 demonstrated that zvi was effective in controlling acid content of the reactors with volatile fatty acids vfas alkaline ratios between 0 01 to 0 02 for zvi reactors compared with a value of 1 95 for the control reactor future studies could focus on developing specialised treatments to rein in high fatty acid waste streams testing the differences in efficacy for pre and concurrent treatment configurations 5 2 oxidation reduction potential orp is another parameter influencing contaminants removal in bio zvi system in fact amongst all the parameters affecting the anaerobic digestion performance oxidative reduction potential orp is considered a vital factor for anaerobic microorganism a lower concentration of oxygen and orp is necessary since the higher potential could completely reduce the cytochrome thereby impacting the transport of extracellular electron and the growth of microorganism li et al 2019a the orp could also determine the fermentation type overall the species of both butyric acid type fermentation and ethanol type fermentation which improves methane production are strict anaerobes however the species of propionic acid type fermentation which is not suit for methane generation are facultative anaerobes hence some researchers managed the fermentation type by controlling orp chen et al 2015 liu et al 2012b moreover evaluating the orp of sludge helps determine the operability of ad in the anaerobic digestion process orp is capable of regulating the anaerobic digestion process by changing the ratio of nadh nad and an appropriate level of nadh nad is essential to enhance the methane production wei et al 2018a xi et al 2014 hence orp should be regulated in the anaerobic digestion process zvi shows an effective ability to control the system orp luo et al 2014 found that the reactors dosed with nanoscale zvi at a load of 5 0 g l expressed an average orp of 272 7 mv compared to the control value of 145 42 mv indicating that acidogenesis was improved by zvi addition interestingly this corresponded to a similar increase in atp in acetogenic bacteria demonstrating how the creation of an oxidative reductive potential generates useful energy for the microbes it is imperative that the effect of zvi on orp be correlated to some impact on the microbial community as it is clear that zvi s effects on process stability parameters are driven by impacts that zvi has on the ad microbial community 5 3 particle size when examining the various literature concerning the enhancement of ad with zvi it emerged that different configurations of zvi had different effects on ad parameters one differentiation of zvi concerns whether it is in a powder fine form or in a scrap bulky form zhang et al 2014 reported that at dosages between 6 and 20 g l iron scrap zvi approximately 8 mm 4 mm 0 5 mm led to the methane yields 5 40 greater than those with the use of powder zvi 0 2 mm diameter without modifications that scrap zvi is superior to ordinary powder zvi for methane production is also elucidated in earlier study liu et al 2015b furthermore according to the results from yang et al 2013 nzvi particle sizes below the powder level are detrimental to methane production and fare only just as well as the control for hydrogen production however powder zvi with special modifications exhibited an excellent ability to enhance ad performance su et al 2015 reported effective ad process improvement using nzvi that was developed consisting of a metallic electron donor core and a sorption friendly oxide shell thus far it has been revealed that powder zvi with special modifications can more rapidly produce more methane however when capital costs are a top concern scrap zvi can be a better option evidently life cycle analyses need to be conducted in order to determine which configuration results in the best outcome for the environment as well as for economic viability 6 model analysis in the ad process various uncertain factors were varying under the system conditions thereby causing the instability of the ad e g unsteady ph the short of nutrients and variable temperature vahid razaviarani et al 2015 to modify the design and control strategies of ad numerous studies have been conducted on the kinetic models to clarify the anaerobic rates of vfas degradation which are the key to the advanced modelling of ad chao hu et al 2018 the mathematical model of the ad treatment process is critical to thoroughly understand the anaerobic treatment digestion mechanism table 5 amongst the models anaerobic digestion model 1 adm1 refers to one of the most prominent model estimating a general and reduced set of parameters to build the main functional structure of conditions in ad based on considerable experimental data pasiano rivas garcía et al 2013 adm1 expresses biochemical processes in anaerobic degradation e g decomposition hydrolysis acid formation and acetyl formation as well as two methane generation pathways to predict ad process xu et al 2012 over the past few years xiao et al 2013 have built a model to simulate and assess the performance of adding zvi to an anaerobic system for treating less biodegradable pollutants lbp in wastewater the model includes zvi corrosion and h2 formation lbps degradation kinetics and lbps conversion and product toxicity model and the addition of zvi promotes the degradation of lbps by the model however it s very distinct to add zvi to the anaerobic granular sludge sulfate reduction reactor because it relates to the processes of mass transfer within the particle the interaction of zvi driven acidogens methanogenic archaea ma srb and acetogens as well as the inhibition of hydrogen sulfide that is undissociated thus reports by liu et al 2015b illustrated the sulfate reduction and the increase in ch4 yield in the zvi anaerobic granular sludge reactor by building a model which is based on adm1 the model is to propose zvi corrosion zvi promotes degradation of propionate precipitation of ferrous sulfide inhibition of undissociated h2s and methanogenesis puyol et al 2018 introduced a model included balancing chemical zvi addition and the enhancement of performance due to the addition of zvi methanogenesis is mainly affected by the rate of hydrolysis k and the biochemical methane potential b0 these two parameters were used for evaluation and comparison on the methanogenic kinetics and methanogenic potential of several types and concentrations of zvi liu et al 2015a moreover the biochemical methane potential bmp experimental methanogenic data were fitted with the use of the first order kinetic model based on biochemical kinetics physical and chemical balance adm1 was developed to simulate the ad process and circumstances with complex substrates under sophisticated conditions recep kaan dereli et al 2010 since the migration and transformation of zvi is complex and its function is sophisticated in ad system models to analyse and simulate the performance of ad with zvi addition have been developed extensively 7 microbial community analysis on the whole existing studies demonstrated that zvi is conducive to proliferating microbes that are critical to the hydrolysis acidification in the ad process abdelsalam et al 2017 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2017 as revealed from the microbial analysis conducted by luo et al 2014 the acid forming bacteroidia and clostridia genus increased in nzvi reactors complying with their findings that zvi could improve orp the sum of percentage abundances of the bacteroida and clostridia genus was determined as 2 in the control reactors compared with 12 7 in the nzvi reactors such population shift in the reactors was significant since it suggested the direct improving effect of nzvi on acidogenesis in the process which could elucidate the positive effects of zvi on biogas production when monitoring enzymes that were related to improved hydrolysis acidification feng et al 2014 reported that zvi dosage facilitated biogas production by enhancing the activity of the mentioned enzymes for instance protease was used to decompose proteins into amino acids while cellulose catalyses polysaccharides to be hydrolysed to monosaccharides at a zvi dosage of 20 g l the protease and cellulose levels were elevated to 92 0 and 91 7 respectively likewise ak pta bk and ptb enzymes are of critical importance to acid formation in anticipation of the acetification and methanogenic phases adding zvi can increase the diversity of acetobacteria which facilitates the proliferation of iron reducing bacteria that are capable of degrading complex substrates in a process amenable to anaerobic digestion meng et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 methanosaeta a genus that contains unique acetogenic species is considered an important microbial cohort to monitor when determining the effects of nzvi on sludge anaerobic digestion yu et al 2016 reported the relative abundances of methanosaeta which ranged from 66 6 to 74 2 for zvi treated sludge compared with the control of 59 4 likewise feng et al 2014 found the abundance of homoacetogens as 38 3 in zvi reactors compared with only 23 8 for the no zvi reactors in both of the mentioned studies intermediate acetogenic abundance was related to the highest methane production which indicated that an optimal balance of acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria is required to achieve ideal methane production further studying the effect of zvi on regulating the balance of acetogenesis and methanogenesis would make the use of zvi in anaerobic digesters more reasonable since methane production refers to a major goal of numerous ad systems improvement of methanogenic bacterial proliferation should be studied it is noteworthy that improvement of methanogen profile is linked to biohydrogen production yang et al 2013 studied the effects of using nzvi that had different diameters on the improvement of anaerobic digestion especially for hydrogen production it was observed that at all diameters were less than 30 mm and methanosaeta and methanosarcina the two methanogenic genus involved exhibited the concentration up regulated to 1 29e9 and 6 08e2 cells ml respectively however 30 mm nzvi reactor levels of these genes were only 2 99e8 and 3 74e2 marking a statistically significant difference at the p 0 001 level since nzvi can inactivate bacteria by critically damaging cell membranes and severely decomposing proteins on the strong reducing nzvi surface the bacterial vivacity is indeed significantly inhibited kim et al 2010 lee et al 2008 the authors proposed that the increase in hydrogen production accounted for the selective targeting process of the methanogenic species since temperature and hydrogen partial pressure impacted the competition between homoacetogens and methanogens for dispensable hydrogen as reported by kotsyurbenko et al 2001 the mentioned findings suggested that using other forms of zvi with larger diameters e g scrap zvi might be less effective to stimulate methanogenic bacteria insights into the difference in zvi s effects on the microbial community is critical to design zvi enhanced ad systems that create the best microbial profile satisfying the waste resources and production requirements subsequent research could elucidate how parameters e g gas production composition temperature and zvi characteristics determine bacteria to be either inhibited or promoted 8 economic and environmental considerations although the benefits of utilising zvi are alluring it is important to constrict evaluation of the necessity of zvi within the paradigm of effective waste remediation and renewable energy production the harnessing of any iron resource requires consideration of the inherent environmental drawbacks of iron acquisition namely iron mining is widely recognised as yielding many negative health and environmental effects most iron mining is open pit meaning that considerable land use is required pell et al 2019 chemicals utilised in acquisition and processing steps are of course wreak some ecological havoc it is therefore important to determine the most efficient means of zvi treatment taking great care to plan experiments which most effectively consume iron resources in addition as grieger et al 2010 highlight many of the environmental effects of using zvi in situ remain unknown zvi most likely fits somewhere between the best case and worst case scenarios for environmental dispersal ecotoxicity environmental persistency bioaccumulation reversibility and pollution mitigation indeed chang et al 2014 investigated the biodegradability of three different zvi dispersants it was found that all dispersants were highly effective at biodegrading trichloroethylene waste through dichlorination but that one of the dispersants polyacrylic acid or paa was biodegradable under neither aerobic nor anaerobic conditions the implications of this study include that the environmental effects of compounds used in conjunction with zvi need to be examined that these effects may be both positive and negative and that thorough studies can evaluate which compounds provide positive remediation benefits with minimal environmental harms in this same vein it is also vital that scientific investigations focus on determining what configurations of zvi provide the least problematic environmental benefits nzvi is a well explored configuration that appears to offer many benefits however scrap metal zvi szvi is a cost efficient alternative that has shown some benefits over nzvi see previous particle size szvi is easily attained from machinery industries and is therefore locally attainable in most places yadav et al 2012 as a waste product itself szvi is an environmentally attractive substitute for specially prepared powdered and nano zvi it is also possible that the bulkier quality of szvi means that its environmental impacts regarding dispersal and reversibility are lesser although this needs to be confirmed in future research fortunately environmental and economic interests align to promote the rigorous exploration of iron recycling to acquire zvi in its review of recent the limitations of recent zvi technology some research identified the various zvi configurations and determined which expressed potential for ecotoxicity cho et al 2005 guan et al 2015 liu et al 2013 lo 2001 it was shown that other methods of zvi design are energy or cost prohibitive however mixing of zvi with pillared bentonite or iron oxide is effective only so long as zvi and the other material is mixed perfectly costa et al 2006 huang et al 2012 mak et al 2011 saito et al 2004 when methane production is the chief aim addition of ions such as fe2 co2 and mn2 is attractive as the drawback of resultant ion pollution is of little concern to the generation of methane for fuel lai et al 2012 tang et al 2014 it is reasonable to propose that specific pre treatment methodologies for zvi be explored during the undertaking of every zvi study so that a library of most efficient zvi pre treatment methodologies can be collected for the benefit of the academic community and of field implementation of zvi ad 9 conclusions and perspectives one important aspect of the current research is comparing the effects of the ad process from zvi to accelerate co2 reduction to ch4 to those resulting from concurrent treatment essentially it is necessary to determine to what extent zvi itself improves the rate of co2 reduction and prepares itself for ad as well as to what extent zvi indirectly improves the process by improving the quality of the ad methanogenic bacterial community moreover the electron donating ability of zvi as well as its tendency to facilitate the enzymatic processes necessary for methanogenesis has proven to be effective in aiding ad through a variety of parameters the mechanism underlying the zvi cycle during pollutant removal clearly aids in stabilising the ad process and has exhibited the necessary conditions for further research in enhancing the treatment ability of ad systems in addition at moderate doses of zvi particularly nano zvi biogas production is improved and methanogenic bacteria proliferate however the deleterious environmental effects of nano zvi s preparation as well as its lack of biodegradability requires additional focus on scrap zvi which would also decrease operation costs closely examining zvi s benefit model to each ad parameter would also assist the design of optimal anaerobic digester configurations facilitating the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to the field even if utilising zvi can bring about high benefits the necessity of zvi in the paradigm of effective waste remediation and renewable energy production should be evaluated furthermore how iron carbon microelectrolysis can enhance treatment efficiency should be determined as well as its most environmentally responsible sources in the future to ensure that adding zvi improves the sustainability and economy of ad technology subsequently a further explore on the treatment efficiency and mechanism of solid waste by using zvi need to be carried out especially focus on the high efficient resource and energy recovery furthermore apart from the ordinary contaminants the removal of emerging contaminants using zvi and its work mechanism also remain to be explored in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

17509,zero valent iron zvi is known to be an additive in facilitating waste treatment and improving biogas production in anaerobic digestion ad systems this review concentrates on the chemical cycle of iron as well as the function of the iron cycle in the removal of four kinds of pollutants organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and phosphorus which are commonly encountered in waste treatment in recent studies the addition of zvi to an ad system promoted the in situ production of ch4 from co2 enabling carbon capture through biotechnology additionally using iron carbon microbial electrolytic cells in ad systems in order to accelerate electron transport as well as specific pollutant degradation mechanisms are illustrated in the present study particularly the main factors affecting the removal efficiency of contaminants in a zvi ad system such as ph vfa alkalinity alk oxidation reduction potential and particle size are reviewed according to the above characteristics combined with technical model and economic analyses an ad system based on zvi was considered to be an economical efficient and carbon neutral pollutant treatment technology accordingly iron based ad is suggested to be a promising and sustainable approach orientated to a circular economy which may be applied to many waste treatments fields graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion zero

a variety of wastes it is often utilised to produce renewable biogas like methane and hydrogen recently numerous studies have focused on adding zero valent iron zvi in ad systems in order to facilitate waste treatment and improve biogas production specifically zvi has been studied to examine its effects in improving methanogenesis from ad one hundred and twenty nine typical research papers in the past ten years are outlined in fig 1 which are statistically analysed in terms of feedstock operation temperature and country methanogenesis occurs when carbon transitions through its various oxidation states accepting electrons until carbon attains its highest reduction state wei et al 2018b zvi has been added to the system to undergo various morphological changes and played a vital role in the degradation of organic matter as well as the removal of contaminants essentially complex carbon containing compounds are broken down until they are reduced to saturated simple methane molecules while reducing carbon zvi functions as an electron donor producing hydrogen gas through the following corrosion reaction eq 1 1 f e 0 2 h 2 o f e 2 2 o h h 2 presumably carbon containing compounds accept these electrons through the mediation of methanogens resulting in the production of methane it has been previously hypothesised that methanogenic bacteria consume some hydrogen to stimulate methane metabolism wu et al 2015 in other words zvi s reaction with water is believed to be the source for hydrogen which eventually saturate methane carbons other mechanisms are also considered important in using zvi to improve ad methanogenesis liu et al 2012b identified zvi s role in acting as a cofactor in several vital enzymatic processes particularly in pyruvate ferrodoxin oxidoreductase a stage where fe s clusters partake in facilitating fermentation ganzoury and allam 2015 as this fermentative step is a vital component of the overall methanogenic process it stands to reason that zvi would improve process s functionality in this way in addition zvi s reductive power has been successfully shown to contribute to the dehalogenation of its chlorinated hydrocarbons filip et al 2014 son et al 2011 in a two and a half year study of emulsified zvi in treating tetracholorethene and chlorinated daughter products it registered removal fluxes of over 85 contaminant removal su et al 2012 zvi is clearly an effective additive in the removal of sulphide phosphide and heavy metal ions as shown in table 1 ayala parra et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 in fact similar instances were measured in the remediation of other wastewater systems fu et al 2014 tested a variety of zvi configurations discovering removal efficiencies for many chloro and nitro contaminants exceeding 90 of which nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi was found to be efficient in completely removing various types of dyes zvi clearly and selectively removes and degrades organic compounds which may be attributed to its success in supporting bacterial communities that perform such remediation processes accordingly zvi has demonstrated its potential in enhancing ad performance through several avenues however though these results may be instructive further research is necessary in order to understand the zvi cycle in ad systems and what the effect it has on specific mechanisms involved in pollutant removal current research continues to focus on waste treatment in the zvi enhancement of ad though investigations pertaining to methane production improvement using zvi is emerging as a major area of focus zvi s efficacy in aiding the reduction of co2 as well as the in situ production of ch4 have been analysed by many studies dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 according to the theoretical basis of zvi s role in aiding bacterial communities involved in ad ad systems that utilise zvi appear to be more robust than those without it liu et al 2015b found that zero valent iron was effective in reducing sulphate as well as producing methane from food waste by ad with production levels around 0 25 l ch4 g influent cod compared to 0 22 l ch4 g which was found to be statistically significant p 0 05 furthermore in petroleum reservoirs the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane is of great importance in the regulation of the global carbon cycle and recovery of sustainable energy the net carbon dioxide emissions of the zvi ad system almost reached zero ma et al 2018 hence carbon capture using zvi ad systems and the enhancement of in situ methane production has been the centre points of many researches many methods have been applied to enhance ad using a combination of zvi as well as other methods organic pollutants and certain specific contaminants may be removed by iron carbon microelectrolysis icme and iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells wang et al 2016a zhou et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 although various studies have discussed co enhancement on pollutant degradation between zvi and anaerobic bacteria in the integrated system it is important to understand the mechanism of iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells in order to use this system to enhance the ad process in terms of its application in engineering less effort has been given to develop pollutant removal and ch4 production models in the zvi ad system therefore it is essential to summarize the corresponding models and create better applications for engineering moreover few reviews comprehensively summarized the mechanism of the iron cycle as well as the mechanism of the iron cycle in enhancing pollutant removal in ad systems in this review focus will be given to the mechanism of the fe cycle including electron transfer and enzyme components in the removal of important pollutants in ad systems accordingly mechanisms related to the iron cycle that improve the removal of organic carbon nitrogen sulphur and phosphorous and confer impacts on the microbial community are discussed the effect of zvi on co2 reduction and in situ ch4 production illustrated by numerous papers in recent years will also be examined from a variety of perspectives encompassing a review of electron transport dominant bacteria and co2 fixation applying zvi in carbon capture for energy conservation and emission reduction using ad systems will also be considered in addition the mechanism regarding iron carbon microbial electrolysis cells in ad systems to accelerate electron transport and promote the specific degradation of pollutants will be summarized finally a model analysis as well as considerations regarding environmental economic impacts in using zvi will be underscored evaluating zvi evaluated according to how it well performs in regard to waste treatment and renewable energy production throughout the review challenges encountered in further zvi ad process optimisations will be put forward and future directions of zvi ad research will be mentioned according to the results of the evaluated papers 2 the mechanism of iron cycle in the anaerobic digestion with zvi addition zvi is preferentially oxidized to fe ii under anaerobic conditions as shown in fig 2 it is added to the system due to its narrower stability domain for fe iii than for fe ii as shown in table 2 eq 6 7 esnault et al 2011 lefevre et al 2016 fe ii plays a significant role in microorganism proliferation and participates in the removal of various contaminants moreover it possesses a synthetic effect of key enzymes during methanogenesis improving enzymatic activity wei et al 2018a similarly acetate kinase ak phosphotransacetylase pta butyrate kinase bk and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb enzymes are vital in acid formation in anticipation of the acetification and methanogenic phases rosenzweig and ragsdale 2011 the dissolved fe ii triggers a larger percentage of protein in electronic power steering eps enriching methanogens and avoiding excessive accumulation of propionic acid and butyric acid in the system which improves the adaptability of microorganisms in adverse environments ganzoury and allam 2015 wang et al 2016a the fe s cluster is an active group in f420 reducing hydrogenase frh h2 f420 nadph f420h2 nadp which is involved in transferring co2 and h2 into ch4 with the help of coenzyme f420 it plays a dominant role in the catalysis of frh the fe s cluster is significantly stimulated by fe ii as a cofactor further improving the function of coenzyme f420 in indirectly converting co2 and h2 into ch4 wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2018 fe ii acts as a nutrient for sulfate reducing bacteria srb and combines with h2s to form fes thereby removing s ruan et al 2017 it was reported that fe ii has a positive influence on the fermentation of fats for ch4 and its degradation products production such as long chain fatty acids production kong et al 2018 bio iron ii mediates the transfer of e from iron reducing bacteria to chlorinated organic pollutants enhancing the reduction of carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene and ddt under anoxic conditions cao et al 2012 even in strict anaerobic conditions when zvi is added to the reaction system it will react with water and oxygen to form fe iii oxide attached to the surface of zvi while a part of fe ii will be converted into fe iii in the oxidation reaction eq 10 13 deng et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 used x ray sem edx images and x ray diffraction xrd analysis to show that the main oxidation products attached to the zvi surface were feooh and fe3o4 fe iii oxide is insoluble in water under neutral conditions and can be used as an electron acceptor in degrading organic matter by iron reducing bacteria irb which is then reduced to fe ii mcgachy honetschlägerová et al 2017 the electron transport pathways during the degradation of pollutants include direct contact electron shuttles and bacteria nanowires zhang et al 2014 direct electron transfer is a process which completed through the direct contact between fe iii oxide and reductase in the extracellular membrane the enzymes mainly include multihaem c type cytochromes and enzymes related to metal reduction which oxidize organic substances to short chain or long chain fatty acids while fe iii is reduced to fe ii simultaneously shi et al 2009 the second route mainly embodies iron reducing bacteria lacking multihaem c type cytochromes conductive pili is produced from these bacteria to achieve electron transfer and this process does not require direct contact between irb and iron oxides bao 2018 liu et al 2016 in the third route exogenous and or endogenous electron shuttles such as metal chelators and flavins s0 biochar and fe ii species are used to transfer electrons dong et al 2019a feng et al 2013 qiao et al 2018a when organic matter is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by irb oxidized humic acid ha is converted into reduced ha by accepting electrons displaced from the process meanwhile fe iii is reduced by taking electrons that were transferred from the reduced ha yang et al 2017 zvi addition enriches the diversity of acetobacteria encouraging proliferation of iron reducing bacteria that degrade complex substrates in a process amenable to ad liu et al 2012c meng et al 2013 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 peng et al 2014 demonstrated that fe iii can increase methane production and its corresponding rates under anaerobic conditions accordingly maximum methane production reached 234 ml g 1 79 times the methane production in that of a control reactor luo et al 2014 peng et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 3 removal mechanism of contaminants through the iron cycle 3 1 the mechanism of the iron cycle in the removal of organic carbon the utilisation of zvi in removing cod has been shown to be largely successful de vrieze et al 2013 meng et al 2013 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 evaluated the effects of zvi addition on azo dye wastewater treatment performance and illustrated that zvi is favourable for cod removal similar studies on the zvi ad treatment of dye wastewater achieved similar levels of cod removal efficacy feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 cod removal was also observed when treating soils lefevre et al 2016 and high sulphate industrial wastewater zhang et al 2011 suggesting the mechanism is robust to a variety of waste inocula applications as the authors found concentrations of bacteria in the zvi reactors to be lower than those of non zvi reactors it appears as if the f e 0 f e 2 2 e reaction is capable of oxidizing organic substances thereby lessening cod even if zvi hinders methanogenic bacteria production when monitoring enzymes associated with improved hydrolysis acidification feng et al 2014 determined that zvi dosage aided biogas production by increasing the activity of the associated enzymes for example protease serves to decompose proteins into amino acids while cellulose catalyses the hydrolysis of polysaccharides to monoses at a zvi dosage of 20 g l protease and cellulose levels increased 92 0 and 91 7 respectively yang et al 2013 corroborated these results as a large increase in cod and cell lysis were detectable when a large nzvi with a diameter of 30 mm was used here as cod is a considerable parameter in any ad investigation the effect of zvi on cod in every reasonable context is valuable studies have also demonstrated that zvi is beneficial to the proliferation of microbes essential to the hydrolysis acidification stage in the ad process feng et al 2014 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2016b yang et al 2013 previous microbial analyses yang et al 2013 showed that populations of acid forming bacteroidia and clostridia gena were bolstered in nano zvi reactors which was in accordance with the findings of zvi improved oxidation reduction potential orp it would be interesting to see whether these results hold for other zvi configurations for example whether scrap zvi also results in an effective shift of the bacterial community towards acidogenesis it is important that future studies investigate the efficacy of novel zvi configurations on cod for instance employing a core shell structure similar to that of earlier studies su et al 2015 may be done to maintain the cod removal capabilities of zvi while minimising microbiotoxicity 3 2 the role of iron cycle in the removal of nitrogen nitrogen is an important structural component of microbial cells and it supports microbial activity by serving as both a source of synthetic nitrogenous metabolites and energy in the ad system hou et al 2015 however a higher concentration of nitrogen in the ad system usually results in serious inhibitory effects on the biological process the free ammonia nitrogen release by nitrogen rich feedstock is considered to be the main inhibitor for its diffusion through cell membranes and disrupting cell activity liu et al 2020 moreover previous research found that excess free ammonia could block the acetate metabolism and leading to ad process instability peng et al 2018 hence for the nitrogen rich feedstock involved in the abundance solubilization of nitrogen during the anaerobic digestion i e cattle manure and waste activated sludge the removal of nitrogen must be carried out the addition of zvi to the ad system can significantly improve the denitrify ability of the system kijjanapanich and yaowakun 2019 showed that the removal capacity of nitrogen in the system reached 93 3 in the denitrification process oxidize fe ii to fe iii under the action of nitrate reducing bacteria while the nitrate is gradually reduced to n2 tominski et al 2018 nitrate reducing bacteria are further divided into autotrophic nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizinng bacteria nrfeox and non autotrophic nitrate reducing bacteria mixotrophs the autotrophic mechanism does not require the addition of organic carbon except fe ii on the contrary the latter requires the addition of organic carbon kappler et al 2005 straub et al 2004 nrfeox uses fe ii as an electron donor to generate energy and fix carbon dioxide croal et al 2009 the mechanism mainly includes three parts the mechanism diagram is shown in table 3 and fig 3 1 the presence of iron oxidoreductase 2 nitrate reductase has non specific activity 3 the electrons from fe ii are accepted by bc1 complex and reduces the quinone pool ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 for mixotrophs the role of fe ii is controversial some studies have shown that in the system of adding zvi the activity and quantity of bacteria are increased and fe ii can be regarded as an enzyme component chakraborty et al 2011 however klueglein and kappler 2013 believe that fe acts as a nutrient rather than enzymatic fe oxidation the determination of enzymatic component in potential mixotrophs is technically challenging to unravel and needs to have intricate analysis of all reactive intermediates the production of reactive nitrogen and the oxidation of fe ii occur in the cytoplasm of nitrate reducing bacteria klueglein and kappler 2013 the oxidation of organic carbon provides electrons and promotes the production of various reactive nitrogen intermediates no n2o no 2 etc chakraborty et al 2011 oshiki et al 2013 picardal 2012 intermediates of nitrate are reduced by fe ii oxidation and the process is catalysed directly by nitrous oxide reductase nos nitrite reductase nir nitric oxide reductase nor and nitrate reductase nar or other periplasmic components or through ligands accelerated abiotic reactions hao et al 2017 the reactive nitrogen intermediate is reacted outside of the cell through the flanking community or with soluble iron to form nitrogen eq 15 tominski et al 2018 at the same time the hydrogen produced during the conversion of zvi to fe ii can be used as an electron donor to reduce the nitrate to nitrogen eq 13 18 wang et al 2012 zvi stoichiometrically reduces nitrate to ammonium nitrogen eq 16 xing et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 reported that fe ii can increase the number of haem c improve the activity of related metabolic enzymes enhance the enrichment of microorganisms and enrich the denitrifying bacteria however iron oxide deposited on the cell surface may restrict the activity of denitrifying microorganisms schädler et al 2009 3 3 the role of iron cycle in the removal of sulfur during the ad process the presence of sulfates in the system could lead to the growth of srb which impact negatively on methane production from ad the srb could compete against methanogenic bacteria for electrons and generate the toxic sulphide such as h2s which inhibit both methanogens and fermentative bacteria zhang et al 2016 hence controlling sulfates concentration below an assessable level is therefore crucial to maintain stability of an anaerobic digester lee and wong 2013 when srb is unsuitable for environmental conditions or lacks an electron donor there is hysteresis in the process of reducing sulphate ge et al 2012 guo et al 2017 the ability of the anaerobic system to reduce sulphate can be enhanced by zvi addition zhang et al 2011 found that zvi is effective in treating sulfate rich wastewater acting as an additional electron donor and buffering agent that lowers concentration of h2s it was found that zvi addition to a 4 5 g cod 1 0 g so4 2 up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb digester removed cod and sulfate at rates of 81 95 and 39 4 respectively this finding is significant as ad with cod sulfate ratios 10 exhibit high presence of sulfate reducing bacteria srb which compete against methanogenic bacteria for electrons and generate the toxic sulphide chen et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 during the anaerobic desulfurization adding zvi to the system produces h2 and fe ii and organic carbon to provide electrons for sulfate reduction which is shown in table 4 and fig 4 kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b venzlaff et al 2013 at the same time h2 can drive srb such as desulfovibrio and desulfobacterium reducing sulphate seth and edyvean 2006 zvi can reduce the orp 100 mw and create a strong oxidative condition for sulfate reduction zhang et al 2011 srb converts sulfate to sulfides by accepting electrons from electron donors such as h2s s2 and hs eq 22 28 kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b when the environmental conditions are neutral or alkaline the sulfides mainly exist in the form of hs and when the ph is 7 h2s is dominant and the presence of h2s inhibits the activity of srb kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b the introduction of zvi by products can modulate the ph and create alkaline conditions that favour srb growth xiao et al 2013 fe ii is an important component of hydrogenase which responsible for mass transport and electron transfer in the srb metabolism process guo et al 2017 meng et al 2013 xin et al 2008 showed that the addition of zvi can enrich srb and thereby increase sulphate finally fe ii combines with the sulfide to form a precipitate and at the same time it can also precipitate heavy metal species kumar et al 2015a kumar et al 2015b heavy metals removed by zvi sbr relies mainly on reductive precipitation sulfide precipitation co precipitation and biosorption eq 29 dong et al 2019b 3 4 the role of iron cycle in the removal of phosphorus phosphorous is an element used in the production of fertilisers flares and steel its removal is therefore desired in ad due to the ongoing shortage of sustainably sourced phosphorous keating et al 2016 it is also possible that adjusting the phosphorous content of ad sludge can improve methane production martin et al 2009 tapia et al 2018 several studies have shown that phosphorous removal was achieved using zvi ayala parra et al 2016 shi et al 2011 su et al 2015 suanon et al 2016 su et al 2015 found nzvi favourable to phosphorous removal with the difference in p concentration in nzvi supplemented reactors being statistically significant at the p 0 001 level bioavailable fractions of p relative to total concentration decreased from 58 1 to 5 32 0 78 and 0 38 when treated with 0 05 0 10 and 0 20 wt nzvi respectively smith and carliell marquet 2009 even found that specialised dosing techniques can result in significantly better phosphorous removal rates the premise of this thrust of the study was that addition of fe would result in formation of fe p complexes which are removable through gravitational settling eq 30 31 the complexation was confirmed by the increase in fe extracted in the ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid edta and na4p2o7 fractions from 3 7 mg g 1 total solids ts to 67 mg g 1 ts indeed fe dosing lowered soluble p concentration from 11 2 mg g 1 ts to 2 2 mg g 1 ts shi et al 2011 explored the effects of zvi on vitamin c biosynthesis wastewater in a uasb reactor measuring multiple operation parameters promisingly one of the greatest impacts of zvi was that of its sequestration power of phosphorous in its phosphate form phosphorous removal efficiencies in the zvi enhanced bioreactor exceeded 76 compared to a meagre 2 for the control reactor however removal of phosphorous must have its limits as the element is required for encouraging methanogenic bacterial activity fjordbøge et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 and low phosphourous levels have long been associated with ad process failure phosphorus is one of the essential nutrient elements for the growth and metabolism of methanogens generally the mass fraction of phosphorus ranges from 5 to 28 g l bi et al 2013 phosphorous removal is yet another advantage of zvi treatment in ad with useful future directions including determining the zvi loads necessary to achieving optimal phosphorous content 30 2 p o 4 3 3 f e 2 f e 3 p o 4 2 31 p o 4 3 f e 3 f e p o 4 4 enhancement of anaerobic digestion process by zvi 4 1 improving co2 reduction and in situ methane production before accelerat co2 reduction to methane it is useful to understand the current achievements of zvi to enhance biogas production many studies have been founded to add zvi into anaerobic digesters to promote biogas production carpenter et al 2015 lin et al 2011 liu et al 2015a yu et al 2015 most studies surveyed in this review focused on methane production but hydrogen production as a primary aim was also significantly improved kim et al 2013 lin et al 2011 yu et al 2015 on the basis of zvi can increase the methanogenic rate of anaerobic fermentation systems many studies have begun to focus on the use of zvi ad systems to promote the conversion of co2 to methane and also capture carbon using biomethane especially in petroleum reservoirs the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane is of great significance regulating the global carbon cycle and achieving the recovery of sustainable energy the net carbon dioxide emissions of the zvi ad system can be close to zero ma et al 2018 the main mechanism is that zvi can be used as an electron donor to convert carbon dioxide into methane which is shown in fig 5 hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoactogenesis are the main methanogenic pathway the h2 h drived by zvi addition is utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens for methane production through eq 4 ma et al 2018 oh et al 2016 amongst them methanosarcina spp play a major role under anaerobic conditions the bacteria can preferentially utilize carbon dioxide and hydrogen can withstand different pressures and proliferate quickly qin et al 2019 as for homoacetogenesis clostridiaceae converts co2 and h2 to acetic acid via the acety1 coa pathway eq 6 at the same time co2 can also form feco3 fe0 co2 h2o feco3 h2 with zvi as a potential extended immobilizing pathway ma et al 2019 vyrides et al 2018 found that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis predominates in the conversion of co2 to ch4 by adding inhibitors while dong added nzvi to the ad system it was reported that when excessive addition of nzvi 25 g l clostridiaceae was enriched and homoacetogenesis was dominant in the process of methane generation dong et al 2019a in the zvi ad system to promote carbon dioxide methanogenesis small zvi particles can be selected to have a larger specific surface area to promote hydrogen production and methanogenesis some research determined that the primary mechanism undergirding zvi s role in bolstering methane production lies in its improvement of biochemical methane potential bmp rather than in its improvement of hydrolysis burkhardt et al 2015 liu et al 2015a luo and angelidaki 2012 as a genus which contains exclusively acetogenic species methanosaeta is an important microbial cohort to monitor chen et al 2015 in their examination of the effects of nzvi on sludge ad yu et al 2016 found the relative abundances of methanosaeta to be between 66 6 and 74 2 for zvi treated sludge compared to the control 59 4 similarly feng et al 2014 found abundance of homoacetogens to be 38 3 in zvi reactors compared to just 23 8 for the no zvi reactors in both studies intermediate acetogenic abundance was associated with the highest methane production suggesting that an optimal balance of acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria is a prerequisite for accomplishing ideal methane production further insights into the role zvi can play for adjusting the balance of acetogenesis and methanogenesis would aid in expanding the justifications for deploying zvi in anaerobic digesters studying the measures for these results is necessary for the efficient design of future carbon dioxide capture 4 2 co enhancement on process stability and methane production of anaerobic digestion 4 2 1 synergistic enhancement of anaerobic digestion using zvi combined with biochar many methods have been employed to enhance ad using a combination of zvi and other methods liu et al 2011 oh et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 reported that gac nzvi addition led to the formation of densely packed aggregates and significantly improved the electrical conductivity and eps content in sludge fe content in sludge reached 20 43 with the loss of only 5 4 during the 34 d operation as revealed from the results of the microbial community analysis gac nzvi addition could both elevate the chao 1 richness index and shannon diversity index of bacteria and archaea it is noteworthy that total methanogens contents were overall up regulated from 74 7 to 81 74 resulting in higher methane production oh et al 2016 studied the effects zvi and biochar on microbial reduction of nitrate finding that the co existence of zvi and biochar resulted in favourable nitrate removal after 14 days nitrate levels in the mixed waste culture fell 37 in the biochar zvi configuration compared to just 29 with zvi alone and 18 in the control reactor future studies would do well to examine whether zvi biochar aids in other ad parameters particularly performing a materials and energy balance around zvi biochar zvi biochar and control configurations for methanogenic ad would be useful in determining which configuration is most favourable li et al 2019 reported that the bioreduction of nzvi can be enhanced effectively by biochar with shewanella putrefaciens cn32 through mediating the electron transport directly in the degradation of pentachlorophenol it s reported that the zvi biochar mixtures have cooperative effects of both biochar and zvi to reduce the bioavailability and mobility of as and cd in polluted soil simultaneously qiao et al 2018b further study need to focus on bio reduction mediated by biochar to tackle the unfavourable issues of zvi zvi biochar co enhancement are attractive but care must be taken to ensure only necessary material and energy inputs are realised for example co enhancement to lessen the zvi requirements or to more favourably convert waste to high grade methane is more desirable than merely maximising waste treatment and energy output at the cost of excessive materials input critically uncovering the mechanisms behind the benefits of co enhancement would reduce time spent on unnecessary investigations into unproductive co enhancement configurations 4 2 2 the mechanism of iron carbon coupling with electrolysis iron carbon microbial electrolytic cells degrade organic pollutants and has a wide range of applications in industrial wastewater and organic wastewater treatment the system uses fe as the anode fe ii and electron eq 32 produced by the anode reaction carbon as the cathode and accept electron eq 33 the h is consumed at the cathode to suppress excessive acidification so the system has a stronger ability to degrade acetic acid fan et al 2009 compared with the addition of zvi alone during anaerobic biological treatment c can accelerate the reduction of contaminants by accepting and transferring the electrons donated by anode iron to the contaminants due to its conductivity and high adsorption capacity iron carbon fe c further accelerates the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode enhances hydrogen transfer between species boosts the decomposition of butyric acid and propionic acid and improves the methanogenic capacity which is shown in and fig 6 wang et al 2016a fe ii and h produced by icme can break the carbon chain of organic matter which is beneficial to microbial degradation of organic matter while effectively reducing carbon dioxide to produce methane liu et al 2012a at the same time the methanogenesis process uses iron as the external electron donor eq 34 to convert co2 into methane feng et al 2014 in addition micro electrolysis can enhance the specific removal of contaminants the current generated by electron transfer enhances the activation of persulfate to form sulfate and undo the benzene ring therefore it is possible to degrade a biodegradable contaminant to the small molecule organic acid li et al 2018 wang et al 2016a coupled icme into the uasb reactor to process fischere tropsch wastewater the cod removal efficiency was 80 6 1 7 and methane production arrived at 1 38 0 11 l l d which were higher than those values with zvi addition 74 5 2 8 and 1 21 0 09 l l d under the optimum hydraulic retention time hrt 5d icem improved the activities of both hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens when the contained at the 10 1 zvi activated carbon ac ratio results in a higher methane yield the cumulative methane production was 132 1 ml g vs the content arrived at 68 8 which was 55 2 higher than that of the blank and 59 6 higher than the sludge added ac alone yang et al 2019 uses uasb system to form a biofuel cell instead of an external power source blast furnace dusting ash bfda is built into the anaerobic system to build a microbial electrolysis cell in which fe and c form inter electrolysis which improves cod removal rate and the production of methane bfda is a kind of waste generated in the steel production process which realizes the recycling of waste and has high economic value in the future research process waste materials with such characteristics can also be added to the system to be constructed as bio electrolysis cells thereby realizing the recycling of waste 32 anode oxidation f e 2 e f e 2 e θ f e

utilising ad has been studied zhu et al 2012 found that rust zvi could result in bio hydrogen production levels exceeding those of industrial zvi owing in part to the increased surface area caused by rusting by day 6 of the study hydrogen yield for the 1 g l rust zvi reactor surpassed 20 umol bottle compared to under 5 umol bottle for the 1 g l industrial zvi and 200 umol bottle for the 1 g l nano zvi configuration although nzvi was definitely superior to the other configurations it is also notable that rusting appears to improve performance of industrial zvi for hydrogen production the same pattern emerged for the effect of rusting on methane production with cumulative methane at the day 10 end of the story as follows 40 umol bottle for the nzvi bottle 39 umol bottle for the rust zvi rzvi bottle 33 umol bottle for the izvi bottle and 3 umol bottle for the control bottle in the case of methane it appears that rusted zvi is practically as desirable as nzvi these results are noteworthy insofar as they offer up an environmentally favourable alternative to nzvi technology for biogas production and waste treatment with the potential to recycle rusted industrial iron to achieve reliable methane production dykstra and pavlostathis 2017 reported of methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems is promoted by the addition of zvi to the cathode compartment to reduce co2 to ch4 zvi serves as an additional element to reduce biocathode power increases cathode dependant production of ch4 and reduces current production so zvi increases cathode capture efficiency cce which measures the transfer efficiency of electrons from cathode to ch4 therefore methanogenesis can be achieved at a lower applied voltage and external energy input can be reduced furthermore adding zvi to a methanogenic biocathode can be developed to improve future biocathodes buffering the microbial activity when voltage interruptions occur or an electromethanogenic biocathode is unload however further research is required to explore the electron transfer mechanism s in methanogenic bioelectrochemical systems with zvi 5 operating parameters influencing contaminants removal in bio zvi system 5 1 ph and vfa alk the ph refers to one of the critical factors of ad as all the involved microorganisms are significantly sensitive to ph variations and the different microorganisms tolerate different ph ranges for instance the fermentative bacteria could maintain its activity in a comprehensive ph range from 4 to 8 5 while the most methanogens worked optimally in a ph range from 6 5 to 7 2 braguglia et al 2018 bai fan 2013 reported a ph range from 6 5 to 7 6 as ideal for ad as the processes composing ad require near neutral conditions however slight basicity is expected as an indicator that acidic waste compounds are converted into alkaline products which is shown in table 6 carpenter et al 2015 and luo et al 2014 proposed that reaction of zvi with available protons increases ph according to eq 7 it can be clearly seen that the above reaction explains zvi s tendency to lower the protonation of a solution which corresponds to a preferential ph value carpenter et al 2015 future studies would do well to examine how optimal zvi levels for ph management differ in different waste sources and how the optimal zvi content for ph compares to the optimal content for biogas production and waste remediation it is likely that these values will coincide meanwhile food waste ad experiments performed in kong et al 2016 found that ph for non zvi reactors ranged from 5 2 to 5 4 at high organic loading rate olr 30 g vs l ph in zvi treated reactors was maintained between 7 5 and 8 0 suggesting that olr could be increased without hindering methane production clearly zvi is very effective at elevating sludge ph which is necessary for increasing olr and sustaining methane production indeed such a discrepancy between ph is very interesting as it shows that zvi addition allows for a much higher organic loading rate other operational indicators are important to monitor to confirm that zvi aids in process stabilization across all fields of digester functionality closely related to ph is vfa alk ratio another important indicator of process stability a vfa alk ratio below 0 3 0 4 indicates a minimal risk of acidification elbeshbishy and nakhla 2011 shahriari et al 2013 kong et al 2016 demonstrated that zvi was effective in controlling acid content of the reactors with volatile fatty acids vfas alkaline ratios between 0 01 to 0 02 for zvi reactors compared with a value of 1 95 for the control reactor future studies could focus on developing specialised treatments to rein in high fatty acid waste streams testing the differences in efficacy for pre and concurrent treatment configurations 5 2 oxidation reduction potential orp is another parameter influencing contaminants removal in bio zvi system in fact amongst all the parameters affecting the anaerobic digestion performance oxidative reduction potential orp is considered a vital factor for anaerobic microorganism a lower concentration of oxygen and orp is necessary since the higher potential could completely reduce the cytochrome thereby impacting the transport of extracellular electron and the growth of microorganism li et al 2019a the orp could also determine the fermentation type overall the species of both butyric acid type fermentation and ethanol type fermentation which improves methane production are strict anaerobes however the species of propionic acid type fermentation which is not suit for methane generation are facultative anaerobes hence some researchers managed the fermentation type by controlling orp chen et al 2015 liu et al 2012b moreover evaluating the orp of sludge helps determine the operability of ad in the anaerobic digestion process orp is capable of regulating the anaerobic digestion process by changing the ratio of nadh nad and an appropriate level of nadh nad is essential to enhance the methane production wei et al 2018a xi et al 2014 hence orp should be regulated in the anaerobic digestion process zvi shows an effective ability to control the system orp luo et al 2014 found that the reactors dosed with nanoscale zvi at a load of 5 0 g l expressed an average orp of 272 7 mv compared to the control value of 145 42 mv indicating that acidogenesis was improved by zvi addition interestingly this corresponded to a similar increase in atp in acetogenic bacteria demonstrating how the creation of an oxidative reductive potential generates useful energy for the microbes it is imperative that the effect of zvi on orp be correlated to some impact on the microbial community as it is clear that zvi s effects on process stability parameters are driven by impacts that zvi has on the ad microbial community 5 3 particle size when examining the various literature concerning the enhancement of ad with zvi it emerged that different configurations of zvi had different effects on ad parameters one differentiation of zvi concerns whether it is in a powder fine form or in a scrap bulky form zhang et al 2014 reported that at dosages between 6 and 20 g l iron scrap zvi approximately 8 mm 4 mm 0 5 mm led to the methane yields 5 40 greater than those with the use of powder zvi 0 2 mm diameter without modifications that scrap zvi is superior to ordinary powder zvi for methane production is also elucidated in earlier study liu et al 2015b furthermore according to the results from yang et al 2013 nzvi particle sizes below the powder level are detrimental to methane production and fare only just as well as the control for hydrogen production however powder zvi with special modifications exhibited an excellent ability to enhance ad performance su et al 2015 reported effective ad process improvement using nzvi that was developed consisting of a metallic electron donor core and a sorption friendly oxide shell thus far it has been revealed that powder zvi with special modifications can more rapidly produce more methane however when capital costs are a top concern scrap zvi can be a better option evidently life cycle analyses need to be conducted in order to determine which configuration results in the best outcome for the environment as well as for economic viability 6 model analysis in the ad process various uncertain factors were varying under the system conditions thereby causing the instability of the ad e g unsteady ph the short of nutrients and variable temperature vahid razaviarani et al 2015 to modify the design and control strategies of ad numerous studies have been conducted on the kinetic models to clarify the anaerobic rates of vfas degradation which are the key to the advanced modelling of ad chao hu et al 2018 the mathematical model of the ad treatment process is critical to thoroughly understand the anaerobic treatment digestion mechanism table 5 amongst the models anaerobic digestion model 1 adm1 refers to one of the most prominent model estimating a general and reduced set of parameters to build the main functional structure of conditions in ad based on considerable experimental data pasiano rivas garcía et al 2013 adm1 expresses biochemical processes in anaerobic degradation e g decomposition hydrolysis acid formation and acetyl formation as well as two methane generation pathways to predict ad process xu et al 2012 over the past few years xiao et al 2013 have built a model to simulate and assess the performance of adding zvi to an anaerobic system for treating less biodegradable pollutants lbp in wastewater the model includes zvi corrosion and h2 formation lbps degradation kinetics and lbps conversion and product toxicity model and the addition of zvi promotes the degradation of lbps by the model however it s very distinct to add zvi to the anaerobic granular sludge sulfate reduction reactor because it relates to the processes of mass transfer within the particle the interaction of zvi driven acidogens methanogenic archaea ma srb and acetogens as well as the inhibition of hydrogen sulfide that is undissociated thus reports by liu et al 2015b illustrated the sulfate reduction and the increase in ch4 yield in the zvi anaerobic granular sludge reactor by building a model which is based on adm1 the model is to propose zvi corrosion zvi promotes degradation of propionate precipitation of ferrous sulfide inhibition of undissociated h2s and methanogenesis puyol et al 2018 introduced a model included balancing chemical zvi addition and the enhancement of performance due to the addition of zvi methanogenesis is mainly affected by the rate of hydrolysis k and the biochemical methane potential b0 these two parameters were used for evaluation and comparison on the methanogenic kinetics and methanogenic potential of several types and concentrations of zvi liu et al 2015a moreover the biochemical methane potential bmp experimental methanogenic data were fitted with the use of the first order kinetic model based on biochemical kinetics physical and chemical balance adm1 was developed to simulate the ad process and circumstances with complex substrates under sophisticated conditions recep kaan dereli et al 2010 since the migration and transformation of zvi is complex and its function is sophisticated in ad system models to analyse and simulate the performance of ad with zvi addition have been developed extensively 7 microbial community analysis on the whole existing studies demonstrated that zvi is conducive to proliferating microbes that are critical to the hydrolysis acidification in the ad process abdelsalam et al 2017 luo et al 2014 wang et al 2016a yang et al 2017 as revealed from the microbial analysis conducted by luo et al 2014 the acid forming bacteroidia and clostridia genus increased in nzvi reactors complying with their findings that zvi could improve orp the sum of percentage abundances of the bacteroida and clostridia genus was determined as 2 in the control reactors compared with 12 7 in the nzvi reactors such population shift in the reactors was significant since it suggested the direct improving effect of nzvi on acidogenesis in the process which could elucidate the positive effects of zvi on biogas production when monitoring enzymes that were related to improved hydrolysis acidification feng et al 2014 reported that zvi dosage facilitated biogas production by enhancing the activity of the mentioned enzymes for instance protease was used to decompose proteins into amino acids while cellulose catalyses polysaccharides to be hydrolysed to monosaccharides at a zvi dosage of 20 g l the protease and cellulose levels were elevated to 92 0 and 91 7 respectively likewise ak pta bk and ptb enzymes are of critical importance to acid formation in anticipation of the acetification and methanogenic phases adding zvi can increase the diversity of acetobacteria which facilitates the proliferation of iron reducing bacteria that are capable of degrading complex substrates in a process amenable to anaerobic digestion meng et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 methanosaeta a genus that contains unique acetogenic species is considered an important microbial cohort to monitor when determining the effects of nzvi on sludge anaerobic digestion yu et al 2016 reported the relative abundances of methanosaeta which ranged from 66 6 to 74 2 for zvi treated sludge compared with the control of 59 4 likewise feng et al 2014 found the abundance of homoacetogens as 38 3 in zvi reactors compared with only 23 8 for the no zvi reactors in both of the mentioned studies intermediate acetogenic abundance was related to the highest methane production which indicated that an optimal balance of acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria is required to achieve ideal methane production further studying the effect of zvi on regulating the balance of acetogenesis and methanogenesis would make the use of zvi in anaerobic digesters more reasonable since methane production refers to a major goal of numerous ad systems improvement of methanogenic bacterial proliferation should be studied it is noteworthy that improvement of methanogen profile is linked to biohydrogen production yang et al 2013 studied the effects of using nzvi that had different diameters on the improvement of anaerobic digestion especially for hydrogen production it was observed that at all diameters were less than 30 mm and methanosaeta and methanosarcina the two methanogenic genus involved exhibited the concentration up regulated to 1 29e9 and 6 08e2 cells ml respectively however 30 mm nzvi reactor levels of these genes were only 2 99e8 and 3 74e2 marking a statistically significant difference at the p 0 001 level since nzvi can inactivate bacteria by critically damaging cell membranes and severely decomposing proteins on the strong reducing nzvi surface the bacterial vivacity is indeed significantly inhibited kim et al 2010 lee et al 2008 the authors proposed that the increase in hydrogen production accounted for the selective targeting process of the methanogenic species since temperature and hydrogen partial pressure impacted the competition between homoacetogens and methanogens for dispensable hydrogen as reported by kotsyurbenko et al 2001 the mentioned findings suggested that using other forms of zvi with larger diameters e g scrap zvi might be less effective to stimulate methanogenic bacteria insights into the difference in zvi s effects on the microbial community is critical to design zvi enhanced ad systems that create the best microbial profile satisfying the waste resources and production requirements subsequent research could elucidate how parameters e g gas production composition temperature and zvi characteristics determine bacteria to be either inhibited or promoted 8 economic and environmental considerations although the benefits of utilising zvi are alluring it is important to constrict evaluation of the necessity of zvi within the paradigm of effective waste remediation and renewable energy production the harnessing of any iron resource requires consideration of the inherent environmental drawbacks of iron acquisition namely iron mining is widely recognised as yielding many negative health and environmental effects most iron mining is open pit meaning that considerable land use is required pell et al 2019 chemicals utilised in acquisition and processing steps are of course wreak some ecological havoc it is therefore important to determine the most efficient means of zvi treatment taking great care to plan experiments which most effectively consume iron resources in addition as grieger et al 2010 highlight many of the environmental effects of using zvi in situ remain unknown zvi most likely fits somewhere between the best case and worst case scenarios for environmental dispersal ecotoxicity environmental persistency bioaccumulation reversibility and pollution mitigation indeed chang et al 2014 investigated the biodegradability of three different zvi dispersants it was found that all dispersants were highly effective at biodegrading trichloroethylene waste through dichlorination but that one of the dispersants polyacrylic acid or paa was biodegradable under neither aerobic nor anaerobic conditions the implications of this study include that the environmental effects of compounds used in conjunction with zvi need to be examined that these effects may be both positive and negative and that thorough studies can evaluate which compounds provide positive remediation benefits with minimal environmental harms in this same vein it is also vital that scientific investigations focus on determining what configurations of zvi provide the least problematic environmental benefits nzvi is a well explored configuration that appears to offer many benefits however scrap metal zvi szvi is a cost efficient alternative that has shown some benefits over nzvi see previous particle size szvi is easily attained from machinery industries and is therefore locally attainable in most places yadav et al 2012 as a waste product itself szvi is an environmentally attractive substitute for specially prepared powdered and nano zvi it is also possible that the bulkier quality of szvi means that its environmental impacts regarding dispersal and reversibility are lesser although this needs to be confirmed in future research fortunately environmental and economic interests align to promote the rigorous exploration of iron recycling to acquire zvi in its review of recent the limitations of recent zvi technology some research identified the various zvi configurations and determined which expressed potential for ecotoxicity cho et al 2005 guan et al 2015 liu et al 2013 lo 2001 it was shown that other methods of zvi design are energy or cost prohibitive however mixing of zvi with pillared bentonite or iron oxide is effective only so long as zvi and the other material is mixed perfectly costa et al 2006 huang et al 2012 mak et al 2011 saito et al 2004 when methane production is the chief aim addition of ions such as fe2 co2 and mn2 is attractive as the drawback of resultant ion pollution is of little concern to the generation of methane for fuel lai et al 2012 tang et al 2014 it is reasonable to propose that specific pre treatment methodologies for zvi be explored during the undertaking of every zvi study so that a library of most efficient zvi pre treatment methodologies can be collected for the benefit of the academic community and of field implementation of zvi ad 9 conclusions and perspectives one important aspect of the current research is comparing the effects of the ad process from zvi to accelerate co2 reduction to ch4 to those resulting from concurrent treatment essentially it is necessary to determine to what extent zvi itself improves the rate of co2 reduction and prepares itself for ad as well as to what extent zvi indirectly improves the process by improving the quality of the ad methanogenic bacterial community moreover the electron donating ability of zvi as well as its tendency to facilitate the enzymatic processes necessary for methanogenesis has proven to be effective in aiding ad through a variety of parameters the mechanism underlying the zvi cycle during pollutant removal clearly aids in stabilising the ad process and has exhibited the necessary conditions for further research in enhancing the treatment ability of ad systems in addition at moderate doses of zvi particularly nano zvi biogas production is improved and methanogenic bacteria proliferate however the deleterious environmental effects of nano zvi s preparation as well as its lack of biodegradability requires additional focus on scrap zvi which would also decrease operation costs closely examining zvi s benefit model to each ad parameter would also assist the design of optimal anaerobic digester configurations facilitating the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to the field even if utilising zvi can bring about high benefits the necessity of zvi in the paradigm of effective waste remediation and renewable energy production should be evaluated furthermore how iron carbon microelectrolysis can enhance treatment efficiency should be determined as well as its most environmentally responsible sources in the future to ensure that adding zvi improves the sustainability and economy of ad technology subsequently a further explore on the treatment efficiency and mechanism of solid waste by using zvi need to be carried out especially focus on the high efficient resource and energy recovery furthermore apart from the ordinary contaminants the removal of emerging contaminants using zvi and its work mechanism also remain to be explored in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this
