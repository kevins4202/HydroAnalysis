7550,this study delivers new insights into rainfall induced seal formation through a novel approach in the use of x ray computed tomography ct up to now seal and crust thickness have been directly quantified mainly through visual examination of sealed crusted surfaces and there has been no quantitative method to estimate this important property x ray ct images were quantitatively analysed to derive formal measures of seal and crust thickness a factorial experiment was established in the laboratory using open topped microcosms packed with soil the factors investigated were soil type three soils silty clay loam zcl sandy silt loam szl sandy loam sl and rainfall duration 2 14 min surface seal formation was induced by applying artificial rainfall events characterised by variable duration but constant kinetic energy intensity and raindrop size distribution soil porosities derived from ct scans were used to quantify the thickness of the rainfall induced surface seals and reveal temporal seal micro morphological variations with increasing rainfall duration in addition the water repellency and infiltration dynamics of the developing seals were investigated by measuring water drop penetration time wdpt and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kun the range of seal thicknesses detected varied from 0 6 to 5 4 mm soil textural characteristics and om content played a central role in the development of rainfall induced seals with coarser soil particles and lower om content resulting in thicker seals two different trends in soil porosity vs depth were identified i for sl soil porosity was lowest at the immediate soil surface it then increased constantly with depth till the median porosity of undisturbed soil was equalled ii for zcl and sl the highest reduction in porosity as compared to the median porosity of undisturbed soil was observed in a well defined zone of maximum porosity reduction c 0 24 0 48 mm below the soil surface this contrasting behaviour was related to different dynamics and processes of seal formation which depended on the soil properties the impact of rainfall induced surface sealing on the hydrological behaviour of soil as represented by wdtp and kun was rapid and substantial an average 60 reduction in kun occurred for all soils between 2 and 9 min rainfall and water repellent surfaces were identified for szl and zcl this highlights that the condition of the immediate surface of agricultural soils involving rainfall induced structural seals has a strong impact in the overall ability of soil to function as water reservoir keywords soil structural seal seal crust thickness quantification x ray computed tomography ct unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kun soil water repellency simulated rainfall 1 introduction a soil crust is a thin layer of consolidated material at the immediate soil surface with significantly different structural and mechanical characteristics than the underlying zone which develops as result of temporal and spatial interactions between physical biological and chemical properties and processes assouline 2004 bajracharya and lal 1999 neave and rayburg 2007 in general two broad classes of soil crusts are distinguished based on their predominant mechanism of formation viz biological and physical biological soil crusts develop from the intimate association between soil particles and microorganisms such as cyanobacteria green algae fungi bacteria lichens and bryophytes which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimetres of soil belnap and gardner 1993 they are typical of arid and semi arid regions but can occur in most ecosystems bowker et al 2010 jeffery et al 2009 knapen et al 2007 in contrast physical crusts have a physicochemical origin neave and rayburg 2007 rainfall impacting on the soil surface is one of the major drivers for physical seal formation the kinetic energy associated with raindrop impacts destroys soil aggregates with concomitant compaction slaking physico chemical dispersion and particle re organization porosity at the immediate soil surface is significantly reduced through the in filling and clogging of pores due to the wash in of fine material compaction associated with raindrop impacts and deposition of clay particles at the immediate soil surface post rainfall assouline 2004 this gives rise to a structural seal dehydration of this rainfall induced seal results in the formation of a structural crust throughout this paper the term seal is used when referring to the wetting phase and crust when reference is made to the dehydrated seal the soil water reservoir is a major component of water storage within a catchment any alteration of the hydraulic structure of soils has great impacts on evapotranspiration soil moisture content groundwater recharge runoff processes and river flow and in turn largely influences the catchment water balance soil crusts either biological or physical are extremely frequent both on cultivated bajracharya and lal 1999 bedaiwy 2008 knapen et al 2007 and uncultivated soils menon et al 2011 therefore the response of the soil surface to rainfall can have a significant impact on hydrological and ecological processes assouline et al 2015 recent record breaking weather phenomena and flooding events in the uk and across europe slingo et al 2014 schneider et al 2013 have renewed interest on the possible links between agricultural land management and flooding in this context the effects of biological and or physical sealing on agricultural soils and its implications for downstream flood risk could be of major significance hydrological models are regularly used for flood forecasting at the basis of hydrological modelling is the rainfall runoff relationship of the catchment this is a highly complex and non linear hydrological phenomenon chen and adams 2006 modarres and ouarda 2013 that describes the transformation of precipitation into discharge wagener and wheater 2004 the presence of a biological and or physical seal crust on the soil surface modifies the partitioning between infiltration and runoff and adds extra complexity to the system chen et al 2013 applied a rainfall runoff model to analyse the respective role of several factors including the presence of a physical seal layer on the hydrological response of a semiarid hillslope they found that the seal layer controlled runoff generation to such an extent that runoff was not generated when the seal was excluded from the simulation assouline and mualem 2006 investigated the combined effect of soil heterogeneity and surface seal formation on the rainfall runoff relationship of a small hypothetical bare catchment and showed that soil sealing had a bigger impact on runoff than soil heterogeneity the thickness of the disturbed layer is a key feature of a sealed surface which allows estimation of the extent of the impact of the sealing phenomenon wide ranges in seal thickness have been reported in the literature visual examination and measurement of the sealed crusted surface either directly with vernier calipers bedaiwy 2008 roth 1997 or via microphotographs bresson and boiffin 1990 bu et al 2013 have been primarily used to directly quantify seal and crust thickness however the risk with any visual assessment method is an underestimation of the thickness of the disturbed layer whilst the unobserved remaining disturbed part can still affect the flow processes in the upper soil layer bresson et al 2004 showed the potential of x ray techniques to characterise the bulk densit of structural crusts here we describe the development of a method for a formally prescribed quantification of soil seal thickness which uses x ray computed tomography ct data in an innovative way and enables a non subjective assessment of seal formation and consolidation one of the principal constraints when describing and characterising sealed soils is the temporal and spatial variability of physical seal hydraulic properties and associated seal structure augeard et al 2007 to overcome this limitation assouline and mualem 1997 2000 developed and tested a model for soil sealing that takes into account several soil and rainfall related factors involved in seal formation this model provided a much needed theoretical basis for interpreting results from infiltration experiments in sealed soils and was successfully applied to simulate flow processes under sealing conditions small scale experiments with simulated rainfall have shown that relatively stable seals might form in a relatively short time bu et al 2013 neave and rayburg 2007 nevertheless beyond this time seal development might continue and a dynamic balance between seal destruction and formation might be established with regards to spatial variability it is likely that gradual changes of structure within the seal are more likely to occur rather than the two discrete layer structure firstly described by mcintyre 1958a b over the last few decades several studies have been conducted to investigate the processes and factors involved in seal formation see assouline 2004 however experiments that provide additional evidence of the micro scale modifications of soil surface structure and wider implications for soil hydrodynamics at the initial stages of seal formation are still required accordingly we conducted a laboratory experiment and induced surface seal development in three agricultural soils of contrasting texture with controlled rainfall events of constant intensity and kinetic energy ke and short storm duration time increments micro morphological zones within the seal were identified non destructively using x ray ct and the micro morphological characteristics of the seal quantified hydrological characterisation of the developing seals was conducted by measuring water repellency a common feature of many soils doerr et al 2000 and previously observed on soil crusts fischer et al 2010 and by quantifying water infiltration dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and preparation three soils of contrasting chemical and physical properties a silty clay loam sandy silt loam and sandy loam denoted zcl szl sl hereafter table 1 were sampled from fields used in intensive horticultural production and known to be susceptible to surface sealing the fields were situated at three different locations in the uk the zcl and szl were obtained from butterwick 52 59 12 n 0 3 33 e and wragg marsh spalding 52 49 50 n 0 5 32 w lincolnshire and classified as wisbech series soil survey of england and wales and wisbech agney series respectively sl was classified as eardiston series and sampled from coughton ross on wye herefordshire 51 53 43 n 2 33 50 w for each soil a randomly selected 5 point bulk composite sample 60 kg was collected 0 30 cm depth soil was stored overnight at 10 c and then sieved moist to 2 mm sieved soil was stored at 4 c until required open topped microcosms were constructed using 50 mm lengths of 46 mm internal diameter pvc pipe a nylon mesh 1 mm aperture was glued to the bottom of the microcosm each microcosm was packed with fresh soil at a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 a factorial experimental design was implemented using the three soil types subjected to four rainfall durations up to 14 min maximum see below and three types of analysis unsaturated hydraulic conductivity x ray ct and water repellency each applied to three independent replicates total n 108 2 2 simulated rainfall application a rainfall tower was used to generate artificial rainfall which reproduces the physical characteristics of natural rainfall under controlled laboratory conditions in relation to drop size distribution kinetic energy ke and intensity the rainfall simulator consisted of a 0 5 m2 bed of hypodermic needles bd microlance 3 21 g 0 8 40 mm arranged in an offset 2 0 2 5 cm grid sited at 8 8 m elevation above the plane of impact withers et al 2007 a stainless steel 4 0 mm aperture mesh was located 1 m below the needle bed to break up the rain droplets to produce a randomly distributed range of droplet sizes a constant head of 15 mm reverse osmosis ro treated water above the needle drain points was created in the needle bed and the spatial arrangement of water releasing hypodermic needles changed until a uniform and replicable rainfall intensity drop size distribution and ke was achieved drop size distribution and drop fall velocities were quantified with a laser optical disdrometer lod model ott parsivel 2 ott messtechnik kempten germany the lod was positioned at five locations within the experimental area front middle back left and right for each point four measurements of 60 s duration were taken the temporal development of structural seals was induced by applying a controlled rainfall event of intensity 60 mm h 1 and ke of 18 4 j m 2 mm 1 for either 2 5 9 or 14 min duration hereafter denoted d2 d5 d9 d14 were d abbreviates duration this frequency of measurement was chosen to characterise the most dynamic stages of seal formation namely aggregate breakdown and particle re organization drop size ranged from 0 063 to 3 75 mm with a median drop size d50 of 2 04 mm 2 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity analysis philip 1957 1969 presented the first analytical solution to richards equation for vertical and horizontal infiltration this has an infinite series solution for cumulative infiltration that is a function of time however for simplification the infinite series solution is approximated by retaining only the first two terms in the infinite series resulting in the following equation 1 i t a 0 t 1 2 kt where i t is the cumulative infiltration at time t a 0 is the soil sorptivity and k is the soil hydraulic conductivity an infiltration experiment using a mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices washington usa was conducted in the laboratory soil cores were placed on a sand table set to a pressure head h of 0 03 m and the mini disk infiltrometer adjusted to the same pressure head value was used to supply water to the top of each core prior to analysis the samples were kept on the sand table for 24 h in order to equilibrate their matric potential a thin layer of sand garside 80ew leighton buzzard uk was applied to the soil surface to increase contact with the disk of the mini disk infiltrometer the infiltrometer was carefully placed on the contact sand and held in place with a ring stand and clamp the elapsed time and the water level in the reservoir of the mini disk infiltrometer were recorded at predetermined time intervals up to 2 h philip infiltration model was then fitted to the measured infiltration data using nonlinear parameter optimization in excel and the unsaturated k was derived capillary theory can be used to estimate the size of pores excluded from the transmission of infiltrating water at differing pressure heads sauer and logsdon 2002 assuming the pores are cylindrical for a certain pressure head h the pore radii can be predicted from 2 r 2 σ cos α ρ gh where σ is the surface tension of water assumed to be 0 073 n m 1 α is the contact angle between water and the pore wall assumed 0 α is the density of water mg m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 from equation 2 a pressure head of 0 03 m would exclude pores with diameters equal to or larger than 1 0 mm diameter luxmoore 1981 classified pore sizes of 10 µm as micropores from 10 to 1000 µm as mesopores and 1000 µm as macropores according to this classification measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at a pressure head of 0 03 m will give an estimate of the flow through meso and micropores 2 4 assessment of soil water repellency the soil cores were equilibrated to a constant temperature and relative humidity 20 1 c rh 50 10 for 24 h and water drop penetration time wdpt tests doerr 1998 were performed under these same conditions the surface of each soil core was divided into six parts using a pie shaped frame of which three sections were used for wdpt test for the wet surface and another three for the dry surface three drops of distilled water 20 μl were dispensed using a fixed volume pipette multipette plus eppendorf germany water was slowly dispensed to make a drop hang on the tip of the pipette which was then placed carefully on the soil surface to avoid any forced penetration by a high kinetic energy of the water drop after a set of wdpt tests for wet surfaces all samples were dried in a dry oven 25 5 c for 48 h another set of wdpt tests for dry surfaces was conducted on the unused areas using the same wdpt procedures 2 5 x ray computed tomography microcosms were scanned using a phoenix nanotom 180nf tomograph ge sensing inspection technologies gmbh wunstorf germany the field of view for each scan included the entire sample the scanner consisted of a 180 kv nanofocus x ray tube fitted with a diamond transmission target and a five megapixel flat panel detector hamamatsu photonics kk shizuoka japan a maximum x ray energy of 130 kv and 100 µa was used to scan each soil core a total of 1440 projection images were acquired over a 360 rotation the resulting isotropic voxel edge length was 24 µm and total scan time was 47 min per core reconstruction of the projection images to produce three dimensional 3 d volumetric data sets was performed using the software datos rec ge sensing inspection technologies gmbh wunstorf germany the reconstructed ct volumes were visualized and quantified using imagej software version 1 48 v rasband 2014 a volume of interest voi of cubic shape 1300 pixels size per axis was cropped in the ct scan image in the middle of the sample in order to exclude the sample frame 2 6 image processing segmentation and analysis scanned gray scale data of the voi s were segmented using the global thresholding method otsu s algorithm to separate solid and pore phases the otsu thresholding algorithm was provided in the imagej software version 1 48 v rasband 2014 a morphological filter permitted detection of the soil surface and thus to define layers as sections parallel to this detected surface fohrer et al 1999 seventeen layers of 10 voxels each i e 240 µm thick were then produced the detectable pore total volume 0 014 mm pores within each of those sections were measured using the bonej plugins doube et al 2010 the porosity was calculated in each section by dividing the pore total volume by the volume of the section 2 7 seal thickness quantification a new approach seal and crust thickness was derived using a method that employed values of porosity φ obtained from the ct data a reference volume of soil 1 voxel where by definition the disturbance by raindrop impact and the presence of washed in particles from the surface were considered negligible was identified in the lower part of the microcosms 36 3 mm below the soil surface and its porosity calculated reference porosity φ ref to identify seal thickness and micro morphology soil volumes were taken across the microcosm depth at increments of 24 µm consequently 17 adjacent layers were considered in total and the corresponding porosities were calculated for each soil type and rainfall duration these values of porosity were compared with the reference porosity fig 1 for a specific soil and rainfall duration the thickness of the seal corresponded to the depth at which the seal porosity returned to the median reference porosity x φ ref the median confidence interval ci for soils zcl szl and sl the x φ ref ci values were 24 4 4 11 5 and 32 1 9 respectively fig 1a c 2 8 statistical analyses one way anova was conducted to determine for each soil type the effects of rainfall duration on kun and total porosity of the seal layer the means were compared using student newman keuls snk test at the 0 05 level of significance anova assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances of the residuals were explored graphically using respectively normal q q plots and plots of the residuals versus fitted values the q q plot for kun revealed log normally distributed data therefore anova for this variable was performed on log transformed data all statistical analyses were executed using r r development core team 2010 3 results 3 1 quantifying seal thickness of different soils exposed to various durations of simulated rainfall fig 1 shows the porosity calculated for each soil and rainfall duration and in relation to the superimposed x φ ref ci of the undisturbed soil matrix and provides an alternative way to define soil and crust thickness for the zcl soil fig 1a at rainfall durations d2 d5 d9 and d14 the x φ ref ci was attained at 0 96 1 20 1 68 1 92 2 16 2 4 4 8 6 0 mm respectively which suggests that the average seal thickness equated to 1 08 1 8 2 28 and 5 4 mm respectively final average seal thickness values per rainfall duration and soil type derived using our imaging approach are represented in fig 2 for zcl the estimated seal thickness increased with rainfall duration from 1 08 mm for rainfall duration d2 to 1 8 mm at d5 2 28 mm at d9 and 5 4 mm at d14 similarly seal thickness in sl increased exponentially in the order d2 d5 d9 d14 1 56 3 12 3 6 5 4 mm respectively a different behaviour was observed for szl where the increment in seal thickness due to rainfall duration was very gradual the seal developed was 0 6 mm thick at d2 0 84 mm at d5 1 56 mm at d9 and 1 8 mm at d14 the reduction in median porosity of the first 5 mm of soil with respect to the undisturbed zone was the lowest for sl 38 and higher in zcl 58 and szl 67 3 2 spatial and temporal micro morphological variations in seals due to rainfall the dynamics of seal development and the predominant processes involved in rainfall induced surface sealing can be inferred from fig 3 an abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity as compared with the x φ ref located approximately 0 24 0 72 mm below the seal surface was identified for zcl at d2 d5 and d9 and for sl at all durations after 2 min rainfall duration d2 the immediate soil surface of sl 0 0 0 24 mm was associated with a 40 reduction in porosity as compared with the median reference porosity x φ ref this trend continued throughout the rainfall event further between 0 24 and 0 48 mm depth porosity decreased to 16 corresponding to a 52 reduction as compared with the x φ ref this abrupt extra dense zone was associated with a further 20 reduction in φ as compared with the soil surface this zone of intense porosity reduction progressively increases achieving at d9 a maximum depth of 0 72 0 96 mm with reductions in porosity relative to x φ ref ranging from 81 to 85 fig 3 below this zone of intense porosity reduction an incremental increase in porosity was observed with x φ ref being attained at 2 88 3 36 mm depth for d5 and 3 36 3 84 mm for d9 and d14 no significant differences in porosity values were observed between d9 and d14 for any of the depth intervals investigated fig 1c this suggested that optimum seal formation was attained following a 9 min storm duration as with the sl for the zcl the porosity of the uppermost soil layer progressively decreased with storm duration with porosity reductions as compared with x φ ref at d2 d5 d9 d14 of 40 73 and 87 respectively the abrupt and narrow zone of intense porosity reduction was again observed between 0 24 and 0 48 mm depth at all storm durations achieving a maximum reduction in porosity as compared with x φ ref of 90 fig 1a in comparison with sl no significant differences in porosity were observed between d9 and d14 for depth intervals 0 24 0 48 to 1 44 1 68 mm fig 1a however in contrast to sl further significant reductions in porosity were observed between d9 and d14 for all depth intervals between 1 68 1 92 and 4 80 6 00 mm this inferred a continued in washing of fines to depth szl did not present the zone of intense porosity reduction below the soil surface rather the highest porosity reduction was associated with the 0 0 24 mm layer the surface reduction in φ for szl as related to the x φ ref of 11 was equal to 84 91 90 and 91 at d2 d5 d9 and d14 respectively in addition at d5 d9 and d14 the porosity profiles with depth of szl showed a very similar trend fig 3 and similar porosities values were also observed for d5 d9 and d14 at all depth intervals fig 1b these results indicated that after 5 min additional rainfall did not significantly alter the sealing processes in szl and the optimum seal formation occurred at d5 3 3 resultant effects of sealing upon infiltration and water repellency phenomena generally increasing rainfall duration appeared to reduce the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 4 although this trend was marginally statistically significant for zcl and szl p 10 and 0 09 respectively and not significant for sl p 45 the highest reduction in hydraulic conductivity occurred between d5 and d9 for zcl and between d2 and d5 for szl from 9 0 to 3 4 mm h 1 and 6 4 to 4 0 mm h 1 respectively for sl k varied between 1 4 and 8 4 mm h 1 showing no relevant trend the lowest kun was observed in sl median of all durations equal to 2 mm h 1 followed by szl 4 1 mm h 1 and zcl 5 4 mm h 1 water drop penetration time wdpt data for wet surfaces only are shown in fig 5 dry surfaces and those of untreated control cores showed no notable water repellency with most drops penetrating without measurable delay wdpt range 0 6 s reduction or disappearance of water repellency at very low water contents has been previously documented de jonge et al 1999 for each soil and rainfall duration the relative frequencies of four penetration time classes were reported wdpt 5 s 5 s wdpt 10 s 10 s wdpt 15 s and 15 s wdpt 20 s drops lasting longer than 20 s were not observed for any soil surface on average the water repellency was greater in zcl than szl with the greatest penetration times ranging between 15 20 s and 10 15 s respectively sl showed no signs of water repellency at any rainfall durations wdpt 5 s in general with the exception of sl increasing rainfall duration increased the proportion of more repellent classes hence soil water repellency in zcl the relative frequency of the class 15 20 s increased from 0 at d2 to 22 at d5 44 at d9 and 67 at d14 similarly in szl the occurrence of penetration times between 5 and 10 s increased with duration as d2 d5 d9 i e 11 33 and 100 and decreased to 68 only at d14 where a longer time 10 15 s appeared based on the widely used wdpt classification system of bisdom et al 1993 all samples exhibited median penetration times classified either as wettable wdpt 5 s or slightly water repellent 5 60 s water repellency clearly differed between the three soil types fig 5 decreasing with the content of fine soil particle fractions table 1 specifically the content of silt and clay equal to 84 65 and 30 for zcl szl and sl respectively was positively related to the median wdpt measured for the three soils 13 6 and 0 s 4 discussion crusts and seals should not be seen as discrete layers but instead as disturbed layers that exhibit gradual changes in physical properties from the surface to some point beneath where the soil is still essentially undisturbed mualem et al 1990 the ability to detect this potential pattern was at the core of the methodological approach based on ct scan analysis for quantifying seal and crust thickness adopted in this study 4 1 seal thickness quantification and relationship with soil type and rainfall the seal thickness measured with the method here developed ranged between 0 6 mm and 5 4 mm similarly to bradford and huang 1992 thick seals formed readily in the sandy loam soil sl which also had the lowest om content comparatively thinner seals were observed in the sandy silt loam soil szl and this may in part be due to the higher om content that imparted higher aggregate stability zcl was mid range in terms of seal thickness and had an intermediate om content a wide range of seal thicknesses have been reported in the literature between 1 mm and 8 mm bu et al 2013 between 0 6 mm and 16 8 mm bedaiwy 2008 4 mm hyväluoma et al 2012 between 0 2 mm and 20 mm bresson and boiffin 1990 between 2 mm and 12 mm roth 1997 with the exclusion of hyväluoma et al 2012 all the aforementioned studies relied on visual examination for seal thickness quantification the subjectivity associated with visual examination might have contributed to such variability in seal thickness reported in previous work in conjunction with the obvious differences in soil type and experimental conditions used hyväluoma et al 2012 used ct images to delineate the extent of the surface seal they assessed the variation with depth of several soil properties some directly determined from ct scans porosity pore size distribution some derived after flow simulation through the pore structure obtained from the ct scans permeability tortuosity effective porosity they concluded that given the good agreement of the various metrics used in estimating seal thickness approximately 3 mm and 4 mm these could be used for quantifying the thickness of a compacted layer however these authors acknowledged that the small number of samples used four limited the validity of the results seal thickness was strongly influenced by the amount of rain impacting onto the soil surface i e the higher the rainfall duration the thicker the resultant seal it is well established that the rate of seal expansion and thickening is controlled by rainfall characteristics farres 1978 observed soil crust thickness increased with the cumulative rainfall and suggested an empirical relationship for this phenomenon bedaiwy 2008 determined that the increase of seal thickness followed closely the increase in rainfall ke 4 2 seal micro morphology and relationship with soil type and rainfall structural seals are formed at the soil surface by the destruction of soil aggregates exposed to the direct impact of rain drops compaction slaking particle segregation and pores filling and clogging by wash in of fine material mcintyre 1958a b assouline 2004 badorreck et al 2013 successfully used ct data to characterise and identify micro morphological crust types of undisturbed soil samples from an artificial catchment similarly in our study x ray ct analysis was able to reveal the dynamics and processes of seal formation and differentiate micro morphological zones within the seal in two out of three soils under study a zone of extreme porosity reduction was found at 0 24 0 72 mm below the soil surface our results corroborated with those of fohrer et al 1999 who derived the bulk density distribution with depth using a medical x ray ct scanner and observed the maximum value of bulk density at 1 mm below the surface this behaviour contrasted with previous results indicating that the maximum bulk density and consequently lowest porosity is reached at the soil surface itself fohrer et al 1999 were not able to distinguish if the increased bulk density below the surface was either caused by a systematic image reconstruction error or by a real sealing pattern this was because they used only one soil type and the phenomenon recurred in all the samples in our study szl did not present the extra dense layer below the surface for this soil the porosity was lowest at the immediate surface and incrementally increased with depth this indicated that the subsurface extra dense layer detected by tomography was not a technical artefact but a real micro morphological soil property to understand the reason for the presence absence of the zone of extreme porosity reduction below the soil surface raindrop impact phenomena and the associated process of soil detachment should be taken into account erpul et al 2008 and salles et al 2000 explained that when a drop hits the soil surface it penetrates the surface and compresses the soil at the same time during raindrop impact the pressure builds up at drop soil interface and the high pressure inside the raindrop forces the water to escape laterally the compressive stress is then transformed to shear stress across the solid liquid contact region because of the lateral water movement basically two stress components can be identified during raindrop impact compressive stress from the impact normal to the surface shear stress from the lateral movement or jetting tangential to the surface the interaction between the obstacles such as the bulge around the crater formed after drop hits and the irregularity of the soil surface itself and the lateral jet stream is believed to be the major mechanism for soil detachment huang et al 1982 1983 showed that the partition of compressive and shear forces depends on the surface properties with greater lateral jet development and in turn detachment on a rigid surface compared to an elastic surface more recently erpul et al 2003 2005 confirmed that the magnitude of compressive vs shear stress components is dependent on the strength of the raindrop impacted surface and affects detachment it appears therefore that soil properties have a significant effect on the process of soil detachment as result of drop impact al durrah and bradford 1982 reported that cohesion forces between soil particles strongly control the detached mass when the disruptive forces from a raindrop overcome the bonding energy of the soil aggregates and the particle mass soil detachment will take place lal 1981 evidence of a raindrop impact threshold have been presented by several authors brandt 1989 sharma et al 1991 salles et al 2000 in general a sandy soil is less cohesive than a silt loam soil and the minimum threshold rain energy needed to initiate soil detachment is lower salles et al 2000 it might be hypothesized that for the sandy silt loam soil szl the critical ke required to initiate and support detachment was higher than the value used in our experiment 18 4 j m 2 mm 1 and thus soil detachment was minimal furthermore due to specific textural characteristics the predominant force acting at the immediate soil surface might have been the compressive component and this resulted in a general slumping of the soil core and produced a porosity vs depth profile without zone of reduced porosity on the other hand zcl and sl textural characteristics might have been associated with a lower raindrop impact threshold at the same time the lateral jet development on the surfaces of zcl and sl might have been greater hence a greater shear stress which generated significant detachment the raindrop compressive stress would have still been acting under the zone of influence of the lateral jetting resulting in a rapid compaction consolidation of soil the loose soil particles at the immediate surface are expected to have a lower bulk density and higher porosity than the underling compressed zone and this could be the reason for the abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity below the surface observed in the porosity vs depth profiles of zcl and sl short rainfall durations 2 5 9 and 14 min were selected to characterise the more dynamic stage of seal formation it has already been established that relatively stable seals might form in a short time sang et al 2008 showed the cumulative porosity of the 0 2 mm layer for soil either treated with anionic polyacrylamide pam or untreated at four rainfall durations 7 5 15 30 60 min they reported the biggest drop in cumulative porosity between 7 5 and 15 min rainfall for both treated and untreated soil in our study a 5 min rainfall was sufficient to induce the formation of 1 8 0 84 and 3 12 mm seal in zcl szl and sl soils respectively the drastic reduction in porosity in the upper layers compared to the median porosity of undisturbed soil median reference porosity x φ ref provided robust evidence of seal establishment this was also supported by the steep decrement in water flow through meso and micropores indicated by unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured at 0 03 m pressure head between d2 and d9 4 3 infiltration dynamics and water repellency of developing seals rainfall had a rapid strong effect on the hydraulic properties of soil and this was clearly connected to the surface sealing process after only 9 min the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was reduced by around 60 of its initial value at this point in time the average seal thickness of the three soils was around 2 5 mm further seal expansion and modifications of the porous system due to the additional rainfall had a smaller impact on the kun despite being a sandy loam soil and having the highest seal porosity sl was associated with the lowest unsaturated hydraulic conductivity this was attributed to the fact that kun measurements at 0 03 m pressure head selectively excluded the water flow in pores 1 mm i e the macropores given the textural characteristics of sl it was likely that the relative abundance of macropores was higher than meso and micropores by excluding the macropores the pore fraction contributing the most to the infiltration in sl was excluded hence the low kun recorded this result stressed the importance of considering pores size when studying the hydrologic responses of surface seals it also highlighted that a minimum of two pressure head points characterising different pore size classes e g 0 005 0 03 m should be selected for a better representation of the unsaturated flow soil water repellency reduces the affinity of a soil to water such that it resists wetting for periods ranging from a few seconds to hours days or weeks it can be caused by hydrophobic organic compounds present on soil particle surfaces or as interstitial material doerr et al 2000 the importance of this reduced soil wettability on surface runoff generation has been widely highlighted cerda et al 1998 including that of low levels of water repellency which can also affect soil water distribution müller et al 2007 doerr et al 2003 have thus called for the inclusion of this variable in hydrological modelling to improve model predictions in catchments with water repellent soils although soil water repellency has often been thought to develop more readily in coarse textured soils due to their smaller surface area per unit volume crockford et al 1991 de bano 1981 our results support previous findings where water repellency increased in soil particle fractions of decreasing size de jonge et al 1999 doerr et al 1996 mataix solera and doerr 2004 rodríguez alleres et al 2007 modifications of the soil particle size distribution caused by the destruction of aggregates with raindrops impact might be the cause of the development of water repellency following rainfall and its increase with rainfall duration rainfall might have preferentially exposed the finest and more hydrophobic fractions as well as the interstitial organic matter and in turn affected soil water repellency 5 conclusions in this study we have developed and tested a new imaging approach for quantifying seal crust thickness which enabled us to characterise soil seal formation under simulated rainfall at a fine spatial and temporal scale the seals formed under the experimental conditions produced in the laboratory ranged between 0 6 and 5 4 mm in thickness and in general the increase of thickness followed the increase in rainfall duration the sandy loam soil which was also characterised by a very low om content developed thicker seals whilst the sandy silt loam soil with the higher om developed thinner seals by coupling short rainfall duration time increments with ct scan technology it was possible to illustrate the structural seal formation process and the temporal inter related dominance and significance of the associated sub processes critically in the zcl and sl soils we were able to identify a distinct and persistent zone of intense porosity reduction immediately below the seal surface 0 24 0 48 mm this result confirmed the existence of a raindrop impact threshold related to a critical ke that needs to be overcome in order to initiate and support soil detachment and that is specific for each soil type rainfall duration had a rapid strong effect on the hydraulic properties and water repellency of soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was reduced and wdpt increased as rainfall duration increased these results were related to rainfall induced aggregate breakdown processes and in general seal formation structural sealing can occur even at very short rainfall durations in this study 9 min rain was sufficient to induce the formation of an average a 2 5 mm thick seal in three different soils and cause a 60 reduction of infiltration these results demonstrate how the surface condition of intensively cultivated soils can have a profound effect on the potential ability of soils to act as a water reservoir with wider implications for flood risk management in catchments acknowledgements this work was supported

7550,this study delivers new insights into rainfall induced seal formation through a novel approach in the use of x ray computed tomography ct up to now seal and crust thickness have been directly quantified mainly through visual examination of sealed crusted surfaces and there has been no quantitative method to estimate this important property x ray ct images were quantitatively analysed to derive formal measures of seal and crust thickness a factorial experiment was established in the laboratory using open topped microcosms packed with soil the factors investigated were soil type three soils silty clay loam zcl sandy silt loam szl sandy loam sl and rainfall duration 2 14 min surface seal formation was induced by applying artificial rainfall events characterised by variable duration but constant kinetic energy intensity and raindrop size distribution soil porosities derived from ct scans were used to quantify the thickness of the rainfall induced surface seals and reveal temporal seal micro morphological variations with increasing rainfall duration in addition the water repellency and infiltration dynamics of the developing seals were investigated by measuring water drop penetration time wdpt and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kun the range of seal thicknesses detected varied from 0 6 to 5 4 mm soil textural characteristics and om content played a central role in the development of rainfall induced seals with coarser soil particles and lower om content resulting in thicker seals two different trends in soil porosity vs depth were identified i for sl soil porosity was lowest at the immediate soil surface it then increased constantly with depth till the median porosity of undisturbed soil was equalled ii for zcl and sl the highest reduction in porosity as compared to the median porosity of undisturbed soil was observed in a well defined zone of maximum porosity reduction c 0 24 0 48 mm below the soil surface this contrasting behaviour was related to different dynamics and processes of seal formation which depended on the soil properties the impact of rainfall induced surface sealing on the hydrological behaviour of soil as represented by wdtp and kun was rapid and substantial an average 60 reduction in kun occurred for all soils between 2 and 9 min rainfall and water repellent surfaces were identified for szl and zcl this highlights that the condition of the immediate surface of agricultural soils involving rainfall induced structural seals has a strong impact in the overall ability of soil to function as water reservoir keywords soil structural seal seal crust thickness quantification x ray computed tomography ct unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kun soil water repellency simulated rainfall 1 introduction a soil crust is a thin layer of consolidated material at the immediate soil surface with significantly different structural and mechanical characteristics than the underlying zone which develops as result of temporal and spatial interactions between physical biological and chemical properties and processes assouline 2004 bajracharya and lal 1999 neave and rayburg 2007 in general two broad classes of soil crusts are distinguished based on their predominant mechanism of formation viz biological and physical biological soil crusts develop from the intimate association between soil particles and microorganisms such as cyanobacteria green algae fungi bacteria lichens and bryophytes which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimetres of soil belnap and gardner 1993 they are typical of arid and semi arid regions but can occur in most ecosystems bowker et al 2010 jeffery et al 2009 knapen et al 2007 in contrast physical crusts have a physicochemical origin neave and rayburg 2007 rainfall impacting on the soil surface is one of the major drivers for physical seal formation the kinetic energy associated with raindrop impacts destroys soil aggregates with concomitant compaction slaking physico chemical dispersion and particle re organization porosity at the immediate soil surface is significantly reduced through the in filling and clogging of pores due to the wash in of fine material compaction associated with raindrop impacts and deposition of clay particles at the immediate soil surface post rainfall assouline 2004 this gives rise to a structural seal dehydration of this rainfall induced seal results in the formation of a structural crust throughout this paper the term seal is used when referring to the wetting phase and crust when reference is made to the dehydrated seal the soil water reservoir is a major component of water storage within a catchment any alteration of the hydraulic structure of soils has great impacts on evapotranspiration soil moisture content groundwater recharge runoff processes and river flow and in turn largely influences the catchment water balance soil crusts either biological or physical are extremely frequent both on cultivated bajracharya and lal 1999 bedaiwy 2008 knapen et al 2007 and uncultivated soils menon et al 2011 therefore the response of the soil surface to rainfall can have a significant impact on hydrological and ecological processes assouline et al 2015 recent record breaking weather phenomena and flooding events in the uk and across europe slingo et al 2014 schneider et al 2013 have renewed interest on the possible links between agricultural land management and flooding in this context the effects of biological and or physical sealing on agricultural soils and its implications for downstream flood risk could be of major significance hydrological models are regularly used for flood forecasting at the basis of hydrological modelling is the rainfall runoff relationship of the catchment this is a highly complex and non linear hydrological phenomenon chen and adams 2006 modarres and ouarda 2013 that describes the transformation of precipitation into discharge wagener and wheater 2004 the presence of a biological and or physical seal crust on the soil surface modifies the partitioning between infiltration and runoff and adds extra complexity to the system chen et al 2013 applied a rainfall runoff model to analyse the respective role of several factors including the presence of a physical seal layer on the hydrological response of a semiarid hillslope they found that the seal layer controlled runoff generation to such an extent that runoff was not generated when the seal was excluded from the simulation assouline and mualem 2006 investigated the combined effect of soil heterogeneity and surface seal formation on the rainfall runoff relationship of a small hypothetical bare catchment and showed that soil sealing had a bigger impact on runoff than soil heterogeneity the thickness of the disturbed layer is a key feature of a sealed surface which allows estimation of the extent of the impact of the sealing phenomenon wide ranges in seal thickness have been reported in the literature visual examination and measurement of the sealed crusted surface either directly with vernier calipers bedaiwy 2008 roth 1997 or via microphotographs bresson and boiffin 1990 bu et al 2013 have been primarily used to directly quantify seal and crust thickness however the risk with any visual assessment method is an underestimation of the thickness of the disturbed layer whilst the unobserved remaining disturbed part can still affect the flow processes in the upper soil layer bresson et al 2004 showed the potential of x ray techniques to characterise the bulk densit of structural crusts here we describe the development of a method for a formally prescribed quantification of soil seal thickness which uses x ray computed tomography ct data in an innovative way and enables a non subjective assessment of seal formation and consolidation one of the principal constraints when describing and characterising sealed soils is the temporal and spatial variability of physical seal hydraulic properties and associated seal structure augeard et al 2007 to overcome this limitation assouline and mualem 1997 2000 developed and tested a model for soil sealing that takes into account several soil and rainfall related factors involved in seal formation this model provided a much needed theoretical basis for interpreting results from infiltration experiments in sealed soils and was successfully applied to simulate flow processes under sealing conditions small scale experiments with simulated rainfall have shown that relatively stable seals might form in a relatively short time bu et al 2013 neave and rayburg 2007 nevertheless beyond this time seal development might continue and a dynamic balance between seal destruction and formation might be established with regards to spatial variability it is likely that gradual changes of structure within the seal are more likely to occur rather than the two discrete layer structure firstly described by mcintyre 1958a b over the last few decades several studies have been conducted to investigate the processes and factors involved in seal formation see assouline 2004 however experiments that provide additional evidence of the micro scale modifications of soil surface structure and wider implications for soil hydrodynamics at the initial stages of seal formation are still required accordingly we conducted a laboratory experiment and induced surface seal development in three agricultural soils of contrasting texture with controlled rainfall events of constant intensity and kinetic energy ke and short storm duration time increments micro morphological zones within the seal were identified non destructively using x ray ct and the micro morphological characteristics of the seal quantified hydrological characterisation of the developing seals was conducted by measuring water repellency a common feature of many soils doerr et al 2000 and previously observed on soil crusts fischer et al 2010 and by quantifying water infiltration dynamics 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and preparation three soils of contrasting chemical and physical properties a silty clay loam sandy silt loam and sandy loam denoted zcl szl sl hereafter table 1 were sampled from fields used in intensive horticultural production and known to be susceptible to surface sealing the fields were situated at three different locations in the uk the zcl and szl were obtained from butterwick 52 59 12 n 0 3 33 e and wragg marsh spalding 52 49 50 n 0 5 32 w lincolnshire and classified as wisbech series soil survey of england and wales and wisbech agney series respectively sl was classified as eardiston series and sampled from coughton ross on wye herefordshire 51 53 43 n 2 33 50 w for each soil a randomly selected 5 point bulk composite sample 60 kg was collected 0 30 cm depth soil was stored overnight at 10 c and then sieved moist to 2 mm sieved soil was stored at 4 c until required open topped microcosms were constructed using 50 mm lengths of 46 mm internal diameter pvc pipe a nylon mesh 1 mm aperture was glued to the bottom of the microcosm each microcosm was packed with fresh soil at a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 a factorial experimental design was implemented using the three soil types subjected to four rainfall durations up to 14 min maximum see below and three types of analysis unsaturated hydraulic conductivity x ray ct and water repellency each applied to three independent replicates total n 108 2 2 simulated rainfall application a rainfall tower was used to generate artificial rainfall which reproduces the physical characteristics of natural rainfall under controlled laboratory conditions in relation to drop size distribution kinetic energy ke and intensity the rainfall simulator consisted of a 0 5 m2 bed of hypodermic needles bd microlance 3 21 g 0 8 40 mm arranged in an offset 2 0 2 5 cm grid sited at 8 8 m elevation above the plane of impact withers et al 2007 a stainless steel 4 0 mm aperture mesh was located 1 m below the needle bed to break up the rain droplets to produce a randomly distributed range of droplet sizes a constant head of 15 mm reverse osmosis ro treated water above the needle drain points was created in the needle bed and the spatial arrangement of water releasing hypodermic needles changed until a uniform and replicable rainfall intensity drop size distribution and ke was achieved drop size distribution and drop fall velocities were quantified with a laser optical disdrometer lod model ott parsivel 2 ott messtechnik kempten germany the lod was positioned at five locations within the experimental area front middle back left and right for each point four measurements of 60 s duration were taken the temporal development of structural seals was induced by applying a controlled rainfall event of intensity 60 mm h 1 and ke of 18 4 j m 2 mm 1 for either 2 5 9 or 14 min duration hereafter denoted d2 d5 d9 d14 were d abbreviates duration this frequency of measurement was chosen to characterise the most dynamic stages of seal formation namely aggregate breakdown and particle re organization drop size ranged from 0 063 to 3 75 mm with a median drop size d50 of 2 04 mm 2 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity analysis philip 1957 1969 presented the first analytical solution to richards equation for vertical and horizontal infiltration this has an infinite series solution for cumulative infiltration that is a function of time however for simplification the infinite series solution is approximated by retaining only the first two terms in the infinite series resulting in the following equation 1 i t a 0 t 1 2 kt where i t is the cumulative infiltration at time t a 0 is the soil sorptivity and k is the soil hydraulic conductivity an infiltration experiment using a mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices washington usa was conducted in the laboratory soil cores were placed on a sand table set to a pressure head h of 0 03 m and the mini disk infiltrometer adjusted to the same pressure head value was used to supply water to the top of each core prior to analysis the samples were kept on the sand table for 24 h in order to equilibrate their matric potential a thin layer of sand garside 80ew leighton buzzard uk was applied to the soil surface to increase contact with the disk of the mini disk infiltrometer the infiltrometer was carefully placed on the contact sand and held in place with a ring stand and clamp the elapsed time and the water level in the reservoir of the mini disk infiltrometer were recorded at predetermined time intervals up to 2 h philip infiltration model was then fitted to the measured infiltration data using nonlinear parameter optimization in excel and the unsaturated k was derived capillary theory can be used to estimate the size of pores excluded from the transmission of infiltrating water at differing pressure heads sauer and logsdon 2002 assuming the pores are cylindrical for a certain pressure head h the pore radii can be predicted from 2 r 2 σ cos α ρ gh where σ is the surface tension of water assumed to be 0 073 n m 1 α is the contact angle between water and the pore wall assumed 0 α is the density of water mg m 3 and g is the gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 from equation 2 a pressure head of 0 03 m would exclude pores with diameters equal to or larger than 1 0 mm diameter luxmoore 1981 classified pore sizes of 10 µm as micropores from 10 to 1000 µm as mesopores and 1000 µm as macropores according to this classification measurements of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at a pressure head of 0 03 m will give an estimate of the flow through meso and micropores 2 4 assessment of soil water repellency the soil cores were equilibrated to a constant temperature and relative humidity 20 1 c rh 50 10 for 24 h and water drop penetration time wdpt tests doerr 1998 were performed under these same conditions the surface of each soil core was divided into six parts using a pie shaped frame of which three sections were used for wdpt test for the wet surface and another three for the dry surface three drops of distilled water 20 μl were dispensed using a fixed volume pipette multipette plus eppendorf germany water was slowly dispensed to make a drop hang on the tip of the pipette which was then placed carefully on the soil surface to avoid any forced penetration by a high kinetic energy of the water drop after a set of wdpt tests for wet surfaces all samples were dried in a dry oven 25 5 c for 48 h another set of wdpt tests for dry surfaces was conducted on the unused areas using the same wdpt procedures 2 5 x ray computed tomography microcosms were scanned using a phoenix nanotom 180nf tomograph ge sensing inspection technologies gmbh wunstorf germany the field of view for each scan included the entire sample the scanner consisted of a 180 kv nanofocus x ray tube fitted with a diamond transmission target and a five megapixel flat panel detector hamamatsu photonics kk shizuoka japan a maximum x ray energy of 130 kv and 100 µa was used to scan each soil core a total of 1440 projection images were acquired over a 360 rotation the resulting isotropic voxel edge length was 24 µm and total scan time was 47 min per core reconstruction of the projection images to produce three dimensional 3 d volumetric data sets was performed using the software datos rec ge sensing inspection technologies gmbh wunstorf germany the reconstructed ct volumes were visualized and quantified using imagej software version 1 48 v rasband 2014 a volume of interest voi of cubic shape 1300 pixels size per axis was cropped in the ct scan image in the middle of the sample in order to exclude the sample frame 2 6 image processing segmentation and analysis scanned gray scale data of the voi s were segmented using the global thresholding method otsu s algorithm to separate solid and pore phases the otsu thresholding algorithm was provided in the imagej software version 1 48 v rasband 2014 a morphological filter permitted detection of the soil surface and thus to define layers as sections parallel to this detected surface fohrer et al 1999 seventeen layers of 10 voxels each i e 240 µm thick were then produced the detectable pore total volume 0 014 mm pores within each of those sections were measured using the bonej plugins doube et al 2010 the porosity was calculated in each section by dividing the pore total volume by the volume of the section 2 7 seal thickness quantification a new approach seal and crust thickness was derived using a method that employed values of porosity φ obtained from the ct data a reference volume of soil 1 voxel where by definition the disturbance by raindrop impact and the presence of washed in particles from the surface were considered negligible was identified in the lower part of the microcosms 36 3 mm below the soil surface and its porosity calculated reference porosity φ ref to identify seal thickness and micro morphology soil volumes were taken across the microcosm depth at increments of 24 µm consequently 17 adjacent layers were considered in total and the corresponding porosities were calculated for each soil type and rainfall duration these values of porosity were compared with the reference porosity fig 1 for a specific soil and rainfall duration the thickness of the seal corresponded to the depth at which the seal porosity returned to the median reference porosity x φ ref the median confidence interval ci for soils zcl szl and sl the x φ ref ci values were 24 4 4 11 5 and 32 1 9 respectively fig 1a c 2 8 statistical analyses one way anova was conducted to determine for each soil type the effects of rainfall duration on kun and total porosity of the seal layer the means were compared using student newman keuls snk test at the 0 05 level of significance anova assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances of the residuals were explored graphically using respectively normal q q plots and plots of the residuals versus fitted values the q q plot for kun revealed log normally distributed data therefore anova for this variable was performed on log transformed data all statistical analyses were executed using r r development core team 2010 3 results 3 1 quantifying seal thickness of different soils exposed to various durations of simulated rainfall fig 1 shows the porosity calculated for each soil and rainfall duration and in relation to the superimposed x φ ref ci of the undisturbed soil matrix and provides an alternative way to define soil and crust thickness for the zcl soil fig 1a at rainfall durations d2 d5 d9 and d14 the x φ ref ci was attained at 0 96 1 20 1 68 1 92 2 16 2 4 4 8 6 0 mm respectively which suggests that the average seal thickness equated to 1 08 1 8 2 28 and 5 4 mm respectively final average seal thickness values per rainfall duration and soil type derived using our imaging approach are represented in fig 2 for zcl the estimated seal thickness increased with rainfall duration from 1 08 mm for rainfall duration d2 to 1 8 mm at d5 2 28 mm at d9 and 5 4 mm at d14 similarly seal thickness in sl increased exponentially in the order d2 d5 d9 d14 1 56 3 12 3 6 5 4 mm respectively a different behaviour was observed for szl where the increment in seal thickness due to rainfall duration was very gradual the seal developed was 0 6 mm thick at d2 0 84 mm at d5 1 56 mm at d9 and 1 8 mm at d14 the reduction in median porosity of the first 5 mm of soil with respect to the undisturbed zone was the lowest for sl 38 and higher in zcl 58 and szl 67 3 2 spatial and temporal micro morphological variations in seals due to rainfall the dynamics of seal development and the predominant processes involved in rainfall induced surface sealing can be inferred from fig 3 an abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity as compared with the x φ ref located approximately 0 24 0 72 mm below the seal surface was identified for zcl at d2 d5 and d9 and for sl at all durations after 2 min rainfall duration d2 the immediate soil surface of sl 0 0 0 24 mm was associated with a 40 reduction in porosity as compared with the median reference porosity x φ ref this trend continued throughout the rainfall event further between 0 24 and 0 48 mm depth porosity decreased to 16 corresponding to a 52 reduction as compared with the x φ ref this abrupt extra dense zone was associated with a further 20 reduction in φ as compared with the soil surface this zone of intense porosity reduction progressively increases achieving at d9 a maximum depth of 0 72 0 96 mm with reductions in porosity relative to x φ ref ranging from 81 to 85 fig 3 below this zone of intense porosity reduction an incremental increase in porosity was observed with x φ ref being attained at 2 88 3 36 mm depth for d5 and 3 36 3 84 mm for d9 and d14 no significant differences in porosity values were observed between d9 and d14 for any of the depth intervals investigated fig 1c this suggested that optimum seal formation was attained following a 9 min storm duration as with the sl for the zcl the porosity of the uppermost soil layer progressively decreased with storm duration with porosity reductions as compared with x φ ref at d2 d5 d9 d14 of 40 73 and 87 respectively the abrupt and narrow zone of intense porosity reduction was again observed between 0 24 and 0 48 mm depth at all storm durations achieving a maximum reduction in porosity as compared with x φ ref of 90 fig 1a in comparison with sl no significant differences in porosity were observed between d9 and d14 for depth intervals 0 24 0 48 to 1 44 1 68 mm fig 1a however in contrast to sl further significant reductions in porosity were observed between d9 and d14 for all depth intervals between 1 68 1 92 and 4 80 6 00 mm this inferred a continued in washing of fines to depth szl did not present the zone of intense porosity reduction below the soil surface rather the highest porosity reduction was associated with the 0 0 24 mm layer the surface reduction in φ for szl as related to the x φ ref of 11 was equal to 84 91 90 and 91 at d2 d5 d9 and d14 respectively in addition at d5 d9 and d14 the porosity profiles with depth of szl showed a very similar trend fig 3 and similar porosities values were also observed for d5 d9 and d14 at all depth intervals fig 1b these results indicated that after 5 min additional rainfall did not significantly alter the sealing processes in szl and the optimum seal formation occurred at d5 3 3 resultant effects of sealing upon infiltration and water repellency phenomena generally increasing rainfall duration appeared to reduce the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 4 although this trend was marginally statistically significant for zcl and szl p 10 and 0 09 respectively and not significant for sl p 45 the highest reduction in hydraulic conductivity occurred between d5 and d9 for zcl and between d2 and d5 for szl from 9 0 to 3 4 mm h 1 and 6 4 to 4 0 mm h 1 respectively for sl k varied between 1 4 and 8 4 mm h 1 showing no relevant trend the lowest kun was observed in sl median of all durations equal to 2 mm h 1 followed by szl 4 1 mm h 1 and zcl 5 4 mm h 1 water drop penetration time wdpt data for wet surfaces only are shown in fig 5 dry surfaces and those of untreated control cores showed no notable water repellency with most drops penetrating without measurable delay wdpt range 0 6 s reduction or disappearance of water repellency at very low water contents has been previously documented de jonge et al 1999 for each soil and rainfall duration the relative frequencies of four penetration time classes were reported wdpt 5 s 5 s wdpt 10 s 10 s wdpt 15 s and 15 s wdpt 20 s drops lasting longer than 20 s were not observed for any soil surface on average the water repellency was greater in zcl than szl with the greatest penetration times ranging between 15 20 s and 10 15 s respectively sl showed no signs of water repellency at any rainfall durations wdpt 5 s in general with the exception of sl increasing rainfall duration increased the proportion of more repellent classes hence soil water repellency in zcl the relative frequency of the class 15 20 s increased from 0 at d2 to 22 at d5 44 at d9 and 67 at d14 similarly in szl the occurrence of penetration times between 5 and 10 s increased with duration as d2 d5 d9 i e 11 33 and 100 and decreased to 68 only at d14 where a longer time 10 15 s appeared based on the widely used wdpt classification system of bisdom et al 1993 all samples exhibited median penetration times classified either as wettable wdpt 5 s or slightly water repellent 5 60 s water repellency clearly differed between the three soil types fig 5 decreasing with the content of fine soil particle fractions table 1 specifically the content of silt and clay equal to 84 65 and 30 for zcl szl and sl respectively was positively related to the median wdpt measured for the three soils 13 6 and 0 s 4 discussion crusts and seals should not be seen as discrete layers but instead as disturbed layers that exhibit gradual changes in physical properties from the surface to some point beneath where the soil is still essentially undisturbed mualem et al 1990 the ability to detect this potential pattern was at the core of the methodological approach based on ct scan analysis for quantifying seal and crust thickness adopted in this study 4 1 seal thickness quantification and relationship with soil type and rainfall the seal thickness measured with the method here developed ranged between 0 6 mm and 5 4 mm similarly to bradford and huang 1992 thick seals formed readily in the sandy loam soil sl which also had the lowest om content comparatively thinner seals were observed in the sandy silt loam soil szl and this may in part be due to the higher om content that imparted higher aggregate stability zcl was mid range in terms of seal thickness and had an intermediate om content a wide range of seal thicknesses have been reported in the literature between 1 mm and 8 mm bu et al 2013 between 0 6 mm and 16 8 mm bedaiwy 2008 4 mm hyväluoma et al 2012 between 0 2 mm and 20 mm bresson and boiffin 1990 between 2 mm and 12 mm roth 1997 with the exclusion of hyväluoma et al 2012 all the aforementioned studies relied on visual examination for seal thickness quantification the subjectivity associated with visual examination might have contributed to such variability in seal thickness reported in previous work in conjunction with the obvious differences in soil type and experimental conditions used hyväluoma et al 2012 used ct images to delineate the extent of the surface seal they assessed the variation with depth of several soil properties some directly determined from ct scans porosity pore size distribution some derived after flow simulation through the pore structure obtained from the ct scans permeability tortuosity effective porosity they concluded that given the good agreement of the various metrics used in estimating seal thickness approximately 3 mm and 4 mm these could be used for quantifying the thickness of a compacted layer however these authors acknowledged that the small number of samples used four limited the validity of the results seal thickness was strongly influenced by the amount of rain impacting onto the soil surface i e the higher the rainfall duration the thicker the resultant seal it is well established that the rate of seal expansion and thickening is controlled by rainfall characteristics farres 1978 observed soil crust thickness increased with the cumulative rainfall and suggested an empirical relationship for this phenomenon bedaiwy 2008 determined that the increase of seal thickness followed closely the increase in rainfall ke 4 2 seal micro morphology and relationship with soil type and rainfall structural seals are formed at the soil surface by the destruction of soil aggregates exposed to the direct impact of rain drops compaction slaking particle segregation and pores filling and clogging by wash in of fine material mcintyre 1958a b assouline 2004 badorreck et al 2013 successfully used ct data to characterise and identify micro morphological crust types of undisturbed soil samples from an artificial catchment similarly in our study x ray ct analysis was able to reveal the dynamics and processes of seal formation and differentiate micro morphological zones within the seal in two out of three soils under study a zone of extreme porosity reduction was found at 0 24 0 72 mm below the soil surface our results corroborated with those of fohrer et al 1999 who derived the bulk density distribution with depth using a medical x ray ct scanner and observed the maximum value of bulk density at 1 mm below the surface this behaviour contrasted with previous results indicating that the maximum bulk density and consequently lowest porosity is reached at the soil surface itself fohrer et al 1999 were not able to distinguish if the increased bulk density below the surface was either caused by a systematic image reconstruction error or by a real sealing pattern this was because they used only one soil type and the phenomenon recurred in all the samples in our study szl did not present the extra dense layer below the surface for this soil the porosity was lowest at the immediate surface and incrementally increased with depth this indicated that the subsurface extra dense layer detected by tomography was not a technical artefact but a real micro morphological soil property to understand the reason for the presence absence of the zone of extreme porosity reduction below the soil surface raindrop impact phenomena and the associated process of soil detachment should be taken into account erpul et al 2008 and salles et al 2000 explained that when a drop hits the soil surface it penetrates the surface and compresses the soil at the same time during raindrop impact the pressure builds up at drop soil interface and the high pressure inside the raindrop forces the water to escape laterally the compressive stress is then transformed to shear stress across the solid liquid contact region because of the lateral water movement basically two stress components can be identified during raindrop impact compressive stress from the impact normal to the surface shear stress from the lateral movement or jetting tangential to the surface the interaction between the obstacles such as the bulge around the crater formed after drop hits and the irregularity of the soil surface itself and the lateral jet stream is believed to be the major mechanism for soil detachment huang et al 1982 1983 showed that the partition of compressive and shear forces depends on the surface properties with greater lateral jet development and in turn detachment on a rigid surface compared to an elastic surface more recently erpul et al 2003 2005 confirmed that the magnitude of compressive vs shear stress components is dependent on the strength of the raindrop impacted surface and affects detachment it appears therefore that soil properties have a significant effect on the process of soil detachment as result of drop impact al durrah and bradford 1982 reported that cohesion forces between soil particles strongly control the detached mass when the disruptive forces from a raindrop overcome the bonding energy of the soil aggregates and the particle mass soil detachment will take place lal 1981 evidence of a raindrop impact threshold have been presented by several authors brandt 1989 sharma et al 1991 salles et al 2000 in general a sandy soil is less cohesive than a silt loam soil and the minimum threshold rain energy needed to initiate soil detachment is lower salles et al 2000 it might be hypothesized that for the sandy silt loam soil szl the critical ke required to initiate and support detachment was higher than the value used in our experiment 18 4 j m 2 mm 1 and thus soil detachment was minimal furthermore due to specific textural characteristics the predominant force acting at the immediate soil surface might have been the compressive component and this resulted in a general slumping of the soil core and produced a porosity vs depth profile without zone of reduced porosity on the other hand zcl and sl textural characteristics might have been associated with a lower raindrop impact threshold at the same time the lateral jet development on the surfaces of zcl and sl might have been greater hence a greater shear stress which generated significant detachment the raindrop compressive stress would have still been acting under the zone of influence of the lateral jetting resulting in a rapid compaction consolidation of soil the loose soil particles at the immediate surface are expected to have a lower bulk density and higher porosity than the underling compressed zone and this could be the reason for the abrupt and distinct zone of reduced porosity below the surface observed in the porosity vs depth profiles of zcl and sl short rainfall durations 2 5 9 and 14 min were selected to characterise the more dynamic stage of seal formation it has already been established that relatively stable seals might form in a short time sang et al 2008 showed the cumulative porosity of the 0 2 mm layer for soil either treated with anionic polyacrylamide pam or untreated at four rainfall durations 7 5 15 30 60 min they reported the biggest drop in cumulative porosity between 7 5 and 15 min rainfall for both treated and untreated soil in our study a 5 min rainfall was sufficient to induce the formation of 1 8 0 84 and 3 12 mm seal in zcl szl and sl soils respectively the drastic reduction in porosity in the upper layers compared to the median porosity of undisturbed soil median reference porosity x φ ref provided robust evidence of seal establishment this was also supported by the steep decrement in water flow through meso and micropores indicated by unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured at 0 03 m pressure head between d2 and d9 4 3 infiltration dynamics and water repellency of developing seals rainfall had a rapid strong effect on the hydraulic properties of soil and this was clearly connected to the surface sealing process after only 9 min the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was reduced by around 60 of its initial value at this point in time the average seal thickness of the three soils was around 2 5 mm further seal expansion and modifications of the porous system due to the additional rainfall had a smaller impact on the kun despite being a sandy loam soil and having the highest seal porosity sl was associated with the lowest unsaturated hydraulic conductivity this was attributed to the fact that kun measurements at 0 03 m pressure head selectively excluded the water flow in pores 1 mm i e the macropores given the textural characteristics of sl it was likely that the relative abundance of macropores was higher than meso and micropores by excluding the macropores the pore fraction contributing the most to the infiltration in sl was excluded hence the low kun recorded this result stressed the importance of considering pores size when studying the hydrologic responses of surface seals it also highlighted that a minimum of two pressure head points characterising different pore size classes e g 0 005 0 03 m should be selected for a better representation of the unsaturated flow soil water repellency reduces the affinity of a soil to water such that it resists wetting for periods ranging from a few seconds to hours days or weeks it can be caused by hydrophobic organic compounds present on soil particle surfaces or as interstitial material doerr et al 2000 the importance of this reduced soil wettability on surface runoff generation has been widely highlighted cerda et al 1998 including that of low levels of water repellency which can also affect soil water distribution müller et al 2007 doerr et al 2003 have thus called for the inclusion of this variable in hydrological modelling to improve model predictions in catchments with water repellent soils although soil water repellency has often been thought to develop more readily in coarse textured soils due to their smaller surface area per unit volume crockford et al 1991 de bano 1981 our results support previous findings where water repellency increased in soil particle fractions of decreasing size de jonge et al 1999 doerr et al 1996 mataix solera and doerr 2004 rodríguez alleres et al 2007 modifications of the soil particle size distribution caused by the destruction of aggregates with raindrops impact might be the cause of the development of water repellency following rainfall and its increase with rainfall duration rainfall might have preferentially exposed the finest and more hydrophobic fractions as well as the interstitial organic matter and in turn affected soil water repellency 5 conclusions in this study we have developed and tested a new imaging approach for quantifying seal crust thickness which enabled us to characterise soil seal formation under simulated rainfall at a fine spatial and temporal scale the seals formed under the experimental conditions produced in the laboratory ranged between 0 6 and 5 4 mm in thickness and in general the increase of thickness followed the increase in rainfall duration the sandy loam soil which was also characterised by a very low om content developed thicker seals whilst the sandy silt loam soil with the higher om developed thinner seals by coupling short rainfall duration time increments with ct scan technology it was possible to illustrate the structural seal formation process and the temporal inter related dominance and significance of the associated sub processes critically in the zcl and sl soils we were able to identify a distinct and persistent zone of intense porosity reduction immediately below the seal surface 0 24 0 48 mm this result confirmed the existence of a raindrop impact threshold related to a critical ke that needs to be overcome in order to initiate and support soil detachment and that is specific for each soil type rainfall duration had a rapid strong effect on the hydraulic properties and water repellency of soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was reduced and wdpt increased as rainfall duration increased these results were related to rainfall induced aggregate breakdown processes and in general seal formation structural sealing can occur even at very short rainfall durations in this study 9 min rain was sufficient to induce the formation of an average a 2 5 mm thick seal in three different soils and cause a 60 reduction of infiltration these results demonstrate how the surface condition of intensively cultivated soils can have a profound effect on the potential ability of soils to act as a water reservoir with wider implications for flood risk management in catchments acknowledgements this work was supported

7551,the exchange of proglacial river water with active layer pore water could alter water chemical compositions in glacial outwash plains and oceanic solute fluxes to evaluate effects of this exchange we sampled watson river and adjacent pore water during the 2013 melt season at two sandurs in western greenland one in sandflugtdalen and the other near the confluence with søndre strømfjord we measured temperature specific conductivity and head gradients between the river and bank over a week long period at sandflugtdalen as well as sediment hydraulic conductivity and chemical compositions of waters from both sites specific conductivity of pore water is four to ten times greater than river water as solutes are concentrated from weathering reactions cryoconcentration and evaporation pore water compositions are predominantly altered by carbonate dissolution and sulfide mineral oxidation high concentrations of hco3 and so4 result from solute recycling and dissolution of secondary ca mg carbonate sulfate salts initially formed by near surface evaporation in the summer and at depth by freeze in of the active layer and cryoconcentration in the winter high hydraulic conductivity 10 5 to 10 4 m s and diurnal fluctuations of river stage during our study caused exchange of river and pore water immediately adjacent to the river channel with a net loss of river water to the bank pore water 6 m from the river continuously flowed away from the river approximately 1 8 of the river discharge through the sandflugtdalen was lost to the river bank during our 6 75 day study based on calculations using darcy s law although not sampled some of this water should discharge to the river during low river stage early and late in the melt season elevated pore water solute concentrations in sandurs and water exchange at diurnal and seasonal frequency should impact fluxes of solutes to the ocean although understanding the magnitude of this effect will require long term evaluation throughout the melt season keywords hydrologic exchange flows bank storage glacial weathering chemical weathering proglacial greenland 1 introduction high physical weathering rates in glacial terrains produce freshly eroded fine grained reactive sediments that are commonly trapped in large outwash plains sandurs along glacial rivers the reactive characteristics of the sediment result in chemical weathering rates in proglacial watersheds that are similar to those of temperate watersheds with similar specific discharge despite low temperatures e g anderson et al 1997 chemical weathering reactions are dominated by preferential weathering of trace reactive mineral phases carbonate biotite and oxidation of sulfide minerals in subglacial and proglacial watersheds of alpine glaciers e g anderson 2007 tranter 2003 rates and magnitudes of weathering depend on which acid causes weathering and which minerals weather and are important for nutrient and radiogenic isotope fluxes to the ocean crocket et al 2012 hawkings et al 2016 2015 kurzweil et al 2010 as well as exchange with atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 martin 2017 spence and telmer 2005 much of the weathering in proglacial rivers may occur in sandurs because they trap comminuted sediment and thereby extend the sediment residence times however the impact of weathering in sandurs depends on pore water residence times and thus the rate and direction of exchange between pore water and river water this exchange between sandur pore water and proglacial rivers depends on sediment permeability and head gradients between the river and its bank it also may occur during flooding of the top of the sandur sediments and from percolation of precipitation snow and or rain into the exposed sandur in this paper we refer to this exchange as hydrologic exchange flow which describes all lateral and vertical exchange of river and subsurface waters rather than the more commonly used but more restricted term hyperheic exchange harvey and gooseff 2015 head gradients of proglacial streams should vary at diurnal and seasonal timescales as their flow varies with alternating freeze and thaw graly et al 2017 koch et al 2011 malard et al 1999 permeability may also vary in permafrost affected areas during freeze in of groundwater and restrict hydrologic exchange flow however streams in the arctic tundra of alaska were found to contribute bioreactive solutes at rates similar to temperate ecosystems edwardson et al 2003 altered pore water compositions and their contributions to river compositions should be enhanced by low water rock ratios and long residence times compared to water in the river channel nezat et al 2001 that produce steep gradients of biogeochemically reactive solutes boulton et al 1998 for example the proglacial discharge from finsterwalderbreen svalbard has elevated ca mg so4 and hco3 concentrations from sulfide oxidation and carbonate and gypsum dissolution in the river bank which enhance in stream solute concentrations by 30 50 cooper et al 2002 wadham et al 2001 delivery of these solutes from pore waters to the streams depends on flow conditions and the extent of subsurface exchange which varies over diurnal to seasonal timescales during the ablation season koch et al 2011 malard et al 1999 to assess the potential contributions from hydrologic exchange flow to a proglacial river draining a continental ice sheet we evaluate chemical alteration in pore waters and hydrologic exchange between proglacial surface and pore waters at two locations along the watson river near kangerlussuaq west greenland we also calculate temporary bank storage proximal exchange immediately adjacent to the river channel due to diurnal river stage fluctuations we use these observations to speculate on distal exchange caused by seasonal changes in river stage e g gooseff et al 2003 our data include hydrologic parameters major ion and minor element hydrochemistry that provide an assessment of weathering reactions and how proglacial hydrologic exchange flows may affect river water chemical composition and potential oceanic solute fluxes these data should be considered a reconnaissance study serving to expand our knowledge of hydrologic exchange flows in proglacial watersheds draining ice sheets to our knowledge this work represents the first study of hydrologic exchange flows and pore water chemistry conducted in a proglacial watershed draining the greenland ice sheet an actively retreating continental ice sheet our results could be important for understanding mechanisms for ocean and atmospheric fluxes during retreat of the northern hemisphere ice sheets since the last glacial maximum and for making predications of changes in fluxes as glaciers continue to retreat in a warming world 2 methods 2 1 site description the watson river flows 40 km from the convergence of isunnguata sermia and russell glacier at the western margin of the

locations at wr6 were located near the middle of the valley while the sampled sandur at wrk abuts a hill near the river bank glaciofluvial fine to coarse sands with intermittent gravel lenses predominate and give way to eolian sands with increasing vegetation and peat content with distance from the channel willemse et al 2003 the downstream site wrk consists of finer better sorted sands than wr6 within the depths sampled the sampling regions in this study have longitudinal gradients of 1 4 m km at sandflugtdalen wr6 while transverse gradients are 100 m km howat et al 2014 these gradients suggest lateral hydrologic exchange flows are likely larger than longitudinal hydrologic exchange flows and therefore we focus this study on lateral exchange long term 1958 1999 mean annual

et al 2005 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 water chemistry pore water samples were collected from wr6 14 15 july and wrk 16 july during the 2013 melt season fig 1a watson river water samples were collected at both sites on 8 july pore water samples were collected using an ams vapor probe charette and allen 2006 at discrete depths 20 96 cm below the water table cmbwt the vapor probe was installed in river bank sediments in a transect perpendicular to one of the larger braids in the river channel fig 1b during sampling the channel remained straight and stable although it widened with increased discharge during our sampling period both pore and river water were pumped into an overflow cup using a peristaltic pump fitted with tygon tubing temperature ph specific conductivity spc corrected to 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were measured with a ysi proplus handheld unit with the sonde installed in the overflow cup once readings stabilized sample water was filtered through a 0 45 μm trace metal grade canister filter into labeled bottles and preserved as required for each solute cation and dissolved metal samples were collected in acid washed 20 ml hdpe bottles and preserved with optima hno3 to ph 2 dissolved inorganic carbon dic samples were collected in 20 ml glass vials and preserved with a saturated solution of mercuric chloride anion and silica samples were collected in di washed 20 ml hdpe bottles with no preservative stable isotope samples were collected in 2 ml borosilicate glass vials with no preservative all bottles were triple rinsed with filtered site water before collecting the sample for analysis water isotope and dic samples were collected to minimize headspace in vials silica was analyzed within thirty days of collection at the laboratory facilities at kiss all other samples were stored at kiss in 4 c refrigerators samples were shipped chilled to the university of florida and stored at 4 c until analysis 2 2 2 hydraulic measurements hydraulic measurements were made at wr6 using four piezometers measuring 72 cm with a 23 5 cm screened interval and 3 2 cm internal diameter that were installed several meters upstream of the pore water sampling the separation limited artifacts that may have results from pumping of pore water the piezometers were spaced at 2 5 6 0 9 5 and 13 5 m from the edge of the channel and a fifth piezometer was installed in the river channel fig 1b piezometers were driven with a sledge hammer into pits dug into the sediment to ensure installation below the water table these piezometers were instrumented with conductivity temperature depth ctd sondes that recorded spc temperature and pressure once per minute for one week 7 14 july 2013 head differences dh between river and pore water were calculated by subtracting the atmospheric pressure corrected rennermalm et al 2014 pressures logged by the river ctd from the ctds installed in the bank sediment based on a datum of water level dug in a channel from the river to the farthest piezometer at the end of the experiment the distance between the piezometers dl was measured to calculate the head gradient dh dl between the ctds in the river and the bank sediments saturated zone hydraulic conductivity ksat was determined 20 m upstream of hydraulic conductivity calculation sites using a falling head slug test bouwer and rice 1976 these tests were conducted with piezometers similar to those in the monitoring transect ctds recording at 1 hz were mounted in the piezometers just below the water table and allowed to equilibrate river water was poured into the piezometer until they overflowed for at least five seconds then the system was allowed to return to baseline this process was repeated four times at each site and three sites were measured at both locations hydraulic conductivity was calculated assuming an unconfined aquifer with 1 k sat r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l 1 t ln h 0 h t bouwer and rice 1976 where rc and rw are the internal and external radii of the piezometer re is the effective radial distance over which the increase in head is dissipated l is the length of the screen in the piezometer h0 is the maximum head displacement at time t 0 and ht is the head displacement at time t because re is not known we estimate the re rw ratio based on the method of bouwer 1989 for partially penetrating wells 2 ln r e r w 1 1 ln l w r w a b ln l b l w r w l r w where lw is the distance from the bottom of the well to the water table lb is the distance from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer here assumed to be the top of the permafrost and a and b are dimensionless constants based on l rw the head gradients and hydraulic conductivity were used to estimate fluxes of river water into and out of the bank sediments based on darcy s law 3 q ak dh dl where q l3 t is the recharge into the sediment or discharge to the river depending on the sign of the head gradient and a is a unit area of the bed of the river we lack head gradient values for the wrk site and thus estimate recharge to the sediment and discharge to the river eq 3 only at wr6 2 3 laboratory methods silica was analyzed using the low range heteropoly blue method 0 1 6 mg l

calculated using speciated hco3 and co3 from phreeqc model were 4 for pore waters and 15 for watson river water greater average charge balance errors in watson river water are unsurprising given the low ionic strength of the water which approached the detection limit of the techniques 2 4 weathering reactions we analyze our data in part through comparisons with water compositions expected from

river fig 2 specific conductivity is greater in pore water than in river water and the pore water spc increases with distance from the river fig 2a at sites near the river the greatest spc occurs at the greatest depth sampled 90 cmbwt but at sites farthest from the river the greatest spc occurs at the shallowest depth and decreases with depth most pore water has greater spc at wrk than wr6 most pore water ph is greater than river water ph with the exception of the distal site at wrk fig 2 the trends in ph with depth and with distance from river are opposite to those seen in spc the lowest ph

cmbwt and decreases with depth and distance from the river fig 2c the distribution of major element concentrations follow systematic patterns between river water and pore water at wr6 and wrk fig 3 anions in river water are dominated by hco3 co3 while pore waters have a greater relative abundance of so4 fig 3a wrk is enriched in so4 relative to wr6 which has relative concentrations intermediate between wrk and river values relative so4 concentrations of pore water increase with distance from river for cations the watson river samples have greater relative concentrations of si and na k compared to pore waters which are enriched in ca mg fig 3b relationships between ph so4 and hco3 provide information about acid base reactions in the pore water fig 4 a significant inverse correlation exists between ph and so4 r2 0 70 p 0001 in all pore waters and both differ from river water values which have low so4 concentrations and approximately neutral ph fig 4a sulfate concentrations increase and ph values decrease with distance from the river channel and depth in the sediment near the river channel the highest so4 concentrations and lowest ph values occur in shallow pore water far from the river fig 4a appendix 1 river water and most wr6 pore water have excess hco3 relative to the expected 2 1 molar ratio reaction 5 with the exception of samples from 20 and 45 cmbwt at the distal location wr6 pwe fig 4b in contrast wrk pore water sites have excess so4 except at the 20 cmbwt depth at the proximal site mineral weathering can be identified based on relationships between ca ca mg sr and so4 fig 5 a good correlation exists between sr and ca at wr6 r2 0 95 p 0001 and wrk r2 0 97 p 0001 with slopes of 0 78 μm nm and 0 69 μm nm respectively fig 5a slopes of the regression indicate average ca sr ratios are lower in wrk compared to wr6 pore waters particularly far from the river river water has ca sr ratios of 0 99 wr6 and 0 95 wrk near the intersection of compositions expected by weathering of carbonate and silicate mineral end members watson river water has ca mg hco3 ratios consistent with both carbonate and silicate weathering fig 5b but pore water ca mg concentrations are greater relative to hco3 concentration than expected from carbonate and silicate weathering the ca mg ex values e g values corrected for a source from carbonate dissolution eq 8 correlate significantly with so4 concentrations at both sites wr6 slope 0 79 r2 0 96 p 0001 wrk slope 0 96 r2 0 99 p 0001 fig 5c both ca mg ex and so4 concentrations generally increase with distance from the river at both pore water sites watson river δ18o and δd values are low relative to regional precipitation and most pore waters which decrease with depth in the sediment fig 6 pore water precipitation and river water are all lower and plot closer to the global meteoric water line relative to waters from a nearby nonglacial watershed 3 2 temperature and specific conductivity of pore water time series measurements show systematic variations away from the river as well as diurnal variations of most chemical and hydrologic variables fig 7 daily maximum pore water temperature lags daily maximum air temperature at all piezometers fig 7a and decreases with distance from the river fig 7c the temperature variations are out of phase with the river water variations but in phase with the river elevation the large increase in river elevation on 12 july corresponds with a drop of 6 c to near river values in temperature at piezometer b the spc probe in piezometer b failed but ctds at piezometers d and e recorded the greatest spc values and greatest variation of all sites piezometer d decreases from 172 to 78 μs cm over the week long deployment while piezometer e increases from 136 to 201 μs cm over the same time period fig 7d the increase in spc at piezometer e coincides with the increase in river elevation recorded on 12 july fig 7d similarly the river ctd recorded a subtle decrease in average spc from 15 to 12 5 μs cm corresponding with an increase in river elevation minor diurnal variations in spc are present at all sites fig 7e although muted compared to the magnitude of change in spc over the sampling period detrended spc data fig 7e was produced by subtracting the best fit line of unmodified spc data in matlab these detrended data show piezometer a varies diurnally from 11 to 17 μs cm piezometer c varies diurnally from 57 to 76 μs cm although the maxima are offset from the river by 12 h 3 3 hydraulic conductivity and discharge recharge to banks average ksat is greater by an order of magnitude at wr6 average 2 2 0 64 10 4 m s than at wrk average 4 9 3 7 10 5 m s table 1 these values lie within the range of ksat reported in other glaciofluvial environments and moraine sediments cooper et al 2002 schwartz and zhang 2003 no pattern exists between distance from river and magnitude of ksat head gradients were oriented from the watson river channel toward the bank during the week long ctd deployment for all locations except piezometer b where head gradients changed orientation on a diurnal basis fig 7b in the following discussion head gradients oriented toward the river channel will be positive and indicate discharge from the sediment and away from the river will be negative and indicate recharge to the bank the diurnal variation in head gradients is out of phase with the river elevation daily minimum river water elevation corresponds to daily maximum head gradient the maximum head gradients lead the minimum river elevation while the minimum negative head gradients lead the maximum river elevations by several hours up to the large negative dh dl deflection and rise of 15 cm in river elevation on 12 july fig 7a based on darcy s law eq 3 estimated average flow away from the river is 9 8 10 8 4 2 10 8 and 7 6 10 8 m3 sec at piezometers c d and e respectively over the sample period at piezometer b the average net flow recharge plus discharge is 8 3 10 8 m3 sec into the river bank with a recharge value of 1 4 10 7 m3 sec and discharge of 5 4 10 8 m3 sec multiplying these average discharge and recharge values by the length of observation around 6 7 days yields the total flux into the sediment per m2 of the river bottom 5 6 10 2 2 4 10 2 and 4 4 10 2 m3 per m2 of river channel at piezometers c d and e respectively at piezometer b the total net flow per m2 of the river bottom is 4 8 10 2 m3 with total recharge of 7 9 10 2 m3 and discharge of 3 1 10 2 m3 assuming net flow at piezometer b is similar across the sandflugtdalen with an approximate wetted river bottom of around 5 2 km2 the total flow into the river bank over the study period is 2 5 105 m3 4 discussion specific conductivity values which reflects solute concentrations are four to ten times greater in pore water relative to river water e g fig 2a indicating extensive diagenetic reactions occur in sandur sediments reactions that alter the pore water chemistry could control fluxes of solutes to the river depending on the reaction and exchange rates consequently fluxes to the river will also depend on the hydrogeologic characteristics of the sediments and head gradients which control hydrologic exchange flows between river and pore water e g harvey and gooseff 2015 therefore in the following discussion we evaluate potential sources of water to the active layer adjacent to the river define reactions that could alter the pore water compositions estimate potential exchanges between the river and pore waters and speculate on potential changes in solute fluxes that may result from this exchange 4 1 sources of water to the active layer sources to sandur pore water in addition to watson river water could include flow from deep groundwater or proximal non glacial watersheds i e those watersheds separated from the ice sheet by hydrologic divides scribner et al 2015 active layer melt and precipitation deep groundwater exists along fractures in bedrocks but is separated from active layer groundwater and surface water by continuous permafrost nielsen 2010 small non glacial deglaciated tributaries enter the watson river along its length but the magnitude of this discharge is minimal compared to ice derived drainage aebly and fritz 2009 ryu and jacobson 2012 numerous lakes surround the watson river watershed but all are separated from the watershed by topographic highs preventing their discharge to the river therefore the most likely source of pore water other than the watson river is direct recharge from annual precipitation despite the negative water balance given high ksat values compared to other media table 1 schwartz and zhang 2003 direct recharge by precipitation should be rapid when it occurs thereby limiting immediate evaporation mixing between water recharged through the land surface and exchanged with the watson river is shown by stable isotope ratios that are bracketed by watson river water and precipitation fig 6 pore water δ18o and δd values in sediment near the river trend toward watson river values while pore water farther from the river has values closer to those of precipitation reflecting a gradient in mixing proportions of river water and recharged precipitation additional precipitation could recharge the sandur from surrounding highlands because the orthogonal land surface slope to the river along the sandurs is two orders of magnitude greater than the longitudinal slope 4 2 geochemical processes in river versus pore water pore water solute concentrations generally increase with distance from the river fig 7d and depth fig 2a consistent with other permafrost affected rivers e g cooper et al 2002 gooseff et al 2013 2003 ward et al 1999 this distribution of solutes could reflect two end member conditions either little hydrologic exchange coupled with long pore water residence times that allow extensive weathering reactions or active hydrologic exchange associated with rapid weathering both of these end member processes likely occur and their relative magnitudes likely evolve through the melt season depending on temperature and river discharge conditions the rates of weathering reactions depends on mineralogical compositions of outwash sediments which reflect comminuted and homogenized bedrock bedrock of the nmb consists predominantly of quartz and feldspars along with minor amounts of mica calcite pyrite and heavy minerals hindshaw et al 2014 although sediment compositions are dominated by silicate minerals the dominant pore waters reactions are carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation e g reactions 4 6 based on low relative si concentration and elevated so4 concentrations fig 3 similar to alpine proglacial catchments e g anderson 2007 and surrounding deglaciated watersheds scribner et al 2015 other secondary mineral precipitates e g reaction 8 must also be considered in the pore water chemistry because summer evaporation and winter cryoconcentration can lead to precipitation of evaporite minerals barrett et al 2009 cooper et al 2002 killawee et al 1998 tranter 2003 4 2 1 preferential weathering both sulfuric and carbonic acid may drive weathering watson river water hco3 so4 ratios 2 indicate carbonic acid weathering dominates in the river e g tranter et al 2002 hydration of atmospheric co2 is the most likely source of the carbonic acid as little dissolved organic carbon is available for remineralization in greenland ice sheet proglacial rivers bhatia et al 2013 lawson et al 2014 carbonic acid also controls weathering in the pore water at wr6 where hco3 so4 ratios are 2 at wrk however where hco3 so4 ratios are 2 sulfide mineral oxidation and production of sulfuric acid or dissolution of sulfate salts may contribute so4 fig 4b the inverse correlation between ph and so4 concentrations supports oxidation of sulfide minerals and production of sulfuric acid figs 3a and 4a which could enhance both carbonate and silicate mineral weathering e g tranter 2003 at wrk low ph and hco3 so4 ratios fig 4 suggest the loss of easily weathered carbonate minerals that would buffer ph this loss of carbonate could occur as sediments pass through multiple sandurs on their journey downstream increasing their residence time in the system a similar shift from predominately carbonate dissolution to sulfide oxidation occurs with increasing exposure age and rainfall in deglaciated watersheds in a transect from kangerlussuaq to sisimiut in western greenland scribner et al 2015 the preferential removal of trace carbonate minerals from the sandur sediment reflects the large scale weathering evolution across glacial landscapes anderson et al 2000 scribner et al 2015 and suggests that much of this weathering could occur in pore water of sandur sediments of proglacial rivers the relative impact of silicate versus carbonate mineral weathering can be assessed by comparing ca sr ratios because these two mineral groups have distinct proportions of ca sr scribner et al 2015 we compare sr and ca ratios with regional end members for silicate and carbonate mineral weathering derived from analysis of watson river bedload material silicate minerals in the region have an average ca sr ratio of 0 18 µmol nmol while carbonate minerals as inferred from a weak acid leachate of bedload sediments have an average ca sr ratio of 0 88 µmol nmol carbonate weathering appears to dominate the watson river considering ca sr ratios are 0 99 at wr6 and 0 95 at wrk appendix 2 which is consistent with alpine glacial systems e g anderson 2007 these findings are also consistent with ryu and jacobson 2012 who estimate 28 68 of cations in watson river water are due to carbonate weathering however wimpenny et al 2011 estimated only 2 14 of solutes in the watson are due to carbonate weathering based on δ26mg composition while yde et al 2014 dismiss carbonate weathering as a major source of solutes based on ca na and mg na that cluster near silicate rock compositions in contrast with watson river water wr6 and wrk pore waters have average ca sr ratios of 0 84 0 05 μm nm and 0 65 0 06 μm nm respectively appendix 1 reflecting both more silicate weathering in the pore water than river water and a downstream increase in pore water silicate weathering both of these processes reflect the loss of easily weathered carbonate minerals with long residence times in the river in addition the increase in silicate weathering at wrk over wr6 could reflect hydrologic control because the order of magnitude greater average ksat values at wr6 than wrk table 1 could slow hydrologic exchange flows both the change in minerals weathered and acids involved in weathering could alter how proglacial river systems affect the global carbon cycle silicates weathered by sulfuric acid do not play a role in the global carbon cycle but silicates weathered by carbonic acid represent a net sink of atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 while carbonate minerals weathered by sulfuric acid represent a net source of co2 to the atmosphere galy and france lanord 1999 martin 2017 ryu and jacobson 2012 downstream carbonic acid weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals in the watson river sequesters 75 of dissolved co2 ryu and jacobson 2012 even in granitoid terrains where carbonates are rare carbonates weather preferentially relative to silicates anderson 2007 white et al 2005 1999 the increase in so4 and decrease in ph suggest that sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate in the pore water would increase pco2 of the pore water and that the generated co2 could be transferred to the river with hydrologic exchange flow 4 2 2 influence of evaporation cryoconcentration in addition to mineral weathering reactions pore water compositions can be modified by evaporation and cryoconcentration evaporative concentration which is enhanced by the negative water balance in the region hasholt and sogaard 1978 nielsen 2010 increases solute concentrations this concentration mechanism affects the portion of the water table near the land surface where capillary action moves shallow groundwater toward the land surface barrett et al 2009 tranter 2003 during the winter cryoconcentration increases solutes at depth by surface down and permafrost up active layer freeze in cooper et al 2002 tranter 2003 both evaporation and cryoconcentration could precipitate secondary minerals including calcite and sulfate salts in water contained in the active layer regardless of whether such precipitation occurs in the phreatic zone or meniscus water in the vadose zone cooper et al 2002 killawee et al 1998 tranter 2003 the region lacks primary evaporite deposits at the surface to contribute to water compositions ryu and jacobson 2012 although gypsum has been found at depths 300 m pere 2014 continuous permafrost limits the interaction with active layer pore waters nielsen 2010 therefore the primary source of so4 in these systems must be the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the sub or pro glacial environments precipitation of sulfate salts by freezing or evaporation could then concentrate the sulfate during subsequent dissolution by melt waters during the summer thaws tranter 2003 dissolution of secondary ca mg sulfate salts is reflected in pore water with ca mg concentrations in excess of those expected from silicate or carbonate weathering fig 5b assuming a ca mg ex so4 ratio of 1 fig 5c dissolution is likely as pore water samples are undersaturated with respect to both calcite and gypsum appendix 1 and 2 excess ca mg concentrations increase away from the river fig 5c similar to the spc values fig 7d indicating alteration of pore water compositions by evaporation and cryoconcentration the ca mg ex concentration in the pore water represents 2 56 of the total cation concentration making it a substantial contributor to its composition assuming all excess ca and mg present in pore water is due to the dissolution of secondary gypsum 2 165 mg of gypsum per liter of water must dissolve to reach current pore water concentrations solute concentrations that increase with distance from the river figs 2a and 7d suggest that hydrologic exchange flow diminishes with distance from the channel at least over the sampling period and evapoconcentration increases solute concentrations similar to streams in the dry valley of antarctica gooseff et al 2003 and at finsternwalderbreen in svalbard cooper et al 2002 however the relationship between increased solute concentrations in pore waters with distance from the river could also depend on the river stage as sandurs flood with increased melting and discharge hydrologic exchange flows could alter pore water concentrations because we sampled only over a short period we are unable to quantitatively assess the impact of seasonal flooding of the sandurs 4 3 evidence for river pore water exchange and storage glacial meltwater streams have unsteady flow due to pulses of glacial melt at diurnal frequencies e g koch et al 2011 runkel et al 1998 and through the melt season e g hasholt et al 2013 this variable flow alters head gradients and direction and magnitudes of hydrologic exchange flows peak watson river discharge at søndre strømfjord lags peak ice sheet melt by 10 h hasholt et al 2013 and causes the 6 h lag in river stage and peak air temperature at wk6 fig 7a the diurnal variations in river stage result in periodic changes between positive and negative head gradient values at piezometer b and indicate water alternates between flow into and out of the bank this periodic reversal of flow ceased on 12 july when river stage rose over a 6 h period and increased the head gradient by more than the diurnal head gradient fluctuations fig 7b this change was not from local precipitation as 1 mm of rain fell during 7 14 july cappelen 2014 rather rising stage resulted from changes in the magnitude of regional glacial melt and or the reorganization of the subglacial hydrological system e g bartholomew et al 2011 chandler et al 2013 graly et al 2017 this increase was documented by increased discharge at an upstream gauging station rennermalm et al 2014 the increase in stage caused flow into the bank for 30 h and flow of river water into the bank is supported by a simultaneous decrease in temperature at piezometer b from 8 c to near river values of 3 c fig 7c although this event occurred near the end of our record it appears the system equilibrated and returned to diurnal positive head gradients at piezometer b while at a higher overall stage fig 7 negative head gradients at the distal piezometers c d and e indicate a flow direction always away from the river outside of the zone with hydrologic exchange flows fig 7b these head gradients reflect the overall increase in river stage during the sampling period the distal piezometers also did not record the overall decrease in temperature corresponding with the rise in river stage on 12 july further indicating river water did not reach these piezometers fig 7c furthermore spc values recorded at the distal piezometers never approach river water values fig 7d instead the spc records reflect flow away from the river consistent with the negative head gradients over the period of record spc at piezometer d decreases from 175 μs cm to near piezometer c values of 50 μs cm and piezometer e increases from 150 μs cm to values similar to the initial piezometer d value of 175 μs cm these trends suggest low conductivity water flowed from piezometer c to d while high conductivity water flowed from d to e however flow away from the river is modified by diurnal variations in river stage as reflected in dh dl values that vary in phase with dh dl observed at piezometer b fig 7b the watson river is ungauged at the sandflugtdalen so we lack information on the discharge during our observations although average discharge into søndre strømfjord is 117 m3 sec hasholt et al 2013 which includes discharge from a proglacial drainage of about equal size to the watson river and suggests that discharge upstream of the confluence would be around half the total discharge or around 60 m3 sec watson river discharge was measured upstream of sandflugtdalen to be around 9 m3 sec rennermalm pers comm 2017 using these two values as bounds on flow through sandflugtdalen the total volume of river water discharged was between 5 2 and 35 106 m3 comparing this value with estimates of total water lost to the sediment during our period of observation approximately 1 8 of the river flow recharged the river bank 4 4 implications for hydrologic exchange flows and solute fluxes over the study period hydrologic exchange flow between river and pore water was limited to within a few meters of the river channel and depends on river flow river discharge varies diurnally driving proximal exchange in fig 8 a and out fig 8b of the bank near the channel rapid changes in discharge such the event on 12 july temporarily flood the river bank providing dilute river water recharge to distal pore waters that evolve by carbonate dissolution sulfide oxidation and further dissolution of secondary salts farther from the river the flow direction is always away from the channel which isolates the water e g gooseff et al 2003 and alters the pore water compositions through carbonate dissolution sulfide oxidation and dissolution of secondary salts the isolation of this water is reflected in increasingly altered compositions with distance from the river fig 2a while the present data set cannot constrain hydrologic exchange flows and geochemical evolution of pore and river waters on a seasonal timescale over the course of the melt season changes in discharge could drive conditions similar to those we observed at diurnal frequency fig 8 however as changing melt conditions change river channel location e g channel migration curvature etc could also affect the timing and location of dilute river water infiltration into the subsurface that cannot be predicted by our data since river discharge depends on ice sheet conditions areas of the sandur could be inundated one year but not in subsequent years effectively trapping water in the subsurface despite the high ksat of sediment in the outwash plain thus low water rock ratios relatively high ksat and long subsurface flow paths allow weathering to alter the pore water compositions the diurnal variations in head gradients and known variations in discharge also allow us to predict that distal exchange could be seasonally important to the solute load of the watson river seasonal variations in river stage should allow surface water to infiltrate the subsurface during high discharge and pore waters to flow to the river during low discharge e g koch et al 2011 lower river discharge occurs early and late in the melt season and correlates to cooler temperatures and a decrease in glacial melt at these times regional head gradients should be oriented toward the river channel causing flow of pore waters into the river this flow will be modified by the extent of thaw out or freeze in of the active layer and the heterogeneity of sandur sediment the discharge could be on the same order of magnitude as the recharge estimated here to be around 1 8 of the total river flow although pore water volumes could be modified by evaporation or direct recharge because the chemical compositions of the pore water are four to ten times greater than the river even this small discharge relative to the river flow could impact the river water chemistry and solute fluxes currently proglacial watersheds provide 0 6 1 of global runoff to the ocean the greenland ice sheet is responsible for approximately one third of modern proglacial runoff tranter 2003 as the climate warms and enhanced melting continues solute fluxes to the ocean are also expected to increase for example discharge from ice sheets provides a significant source of bioavailable and particulate iron to coastal oceans and is also expected to increase as discharge increases bhatia et al 2013 hawkings et al 2014 as active layer thaw depths increase in a warming climate the volume of the subsurface available for reaction will also increase though the hydrologic exchange flow is not limited by active layer depth during peak melt edwardson et al 2003 the extent of hydrologic exchange flow should increase until a threshold depth is reached as determined by head gradients and stream morphology zarnetske et al 2008 however the significance of these fluxes will be modulated by the magnitude of discharge in the watson river as melting becomes more extensive 5 conclusions this study provides an initial assessment of hydrologic exchange flows in a proglacial river draining the greenland ice sheet and potential solute fluxes based geochemistry of surface and pore waters and hydrogeologic observations the relative importance of sulfuric acid compared to carbonic acid to weathering increases downstream and solute compositions indicate carbonate weathering dominates relative to silicate weathering in both river and pore water these shifts in weathering acid and weathered minerals will impact drawdown of atmospheric co2 although this study only represents a snapshot of the dynamics of river pore water exchange pore water solute concentrations that are elevated over those in the river and high ksat of bank sediments highlight the potential for solute fluxes from the bank through the river and ultimately to the ocean from the proglacial watershed hydrologic exchange flows were limited to within 6 m of the river channel at the time of observation and narrowed with increasing discharge this flow reversed direction at diurnal periodicity because of diurnal variations in the river stage in contrast head gradients were always oriented away from the river although with diurnal variation in magnitude indicating continuous flow away from the river channel pore water far from the river should therefore flow to the river only during periods of low river stage these preliminary observations indicate that weathering of extensive sediment deposits in sandurs are likely important contributors to proglacial river water compositions weathering in sandur pore waters could thus have an important impact on ocean water chemistry during continental ice sheet melting and may impart a seasonal

7551,the exchange of proglacial river water with active layer pore water could alter water chemical compositions in glacial outwash plains and oceanic solute fluxes to evaluate effects of this exchange we sampled watson river and adjacent pore water during the 2013 melt season at two sandurs in western greenland one in sandflugtdalen and the other near the confluence with søndre strømfjord we measured temperature specific conductivity and head gradients between the river and bank over a week long period at sandflugtdalen as well as sediment hydraulic conductivity and chemical compositions of waters from both sites specific conductivity of pore water is four to ten times greater than river water as solutes are concentrated from weathering reactions cryoconcentration and evaporation pore water compositions are predominantly altered by carbonate dissolution and sulfide mineral oxidation high concentrations of hco3 and so4 result from solute recycling and dissolution of secondary ca mg carbonate sulfate salts initially formed by near surface evaporation in the summer and at depth by freeze in of the active layer and cryoconcentration in the winter high hydraulic conductivity 10 5 to 10 4 m s and diurnal fluctuations of river stage during our study caused exchange of river and pore water immediately adjacent to the river channel with a net loss of river water to the bank pore water 6 m from the river continuously flowed away from the river approximately 1 8 of the river discharge through the sandflugtdalen was lost to the river bank during our 6 75 day study based on calculations using darcy s law although not sampled some of this water should discharge to the river during low river stage early and late in the melt season elevated pore water solute concentrations in sandurs and water exchange at diurnal and seasonal frequency should impact fluxes of solutes to the ocean although understanding the magnitude of this effect will require long term evaluation throughout the melt season keywords hydrologic exchange flows bank storage glacial weathering chemical weathering proglacial greenland 1 introduction high physical weathering rates in glacial terrains produce freshly eroded fine grained reactive sediments that are commonly trapped in large outwash plains sandurs along glacial rivers the reactive characteristics of the sediment result in chemical weathering rates in proglacial watersheds that are similar to those of temperate watersheds with similar specific discharge despite low temperatures e g anderson et al 1997 chemical weathering reactions are dominated by preferential weathering of trace reactive mineral phases carbonate biotite and oxidation of sulfide minerals in subglacial and proglacial watersheds of alpine glaciers e g anderson 2007 tranter 2003 rates and magnitudes of weathering depend on which acid causes weathering and which minerals weather and are important for nutrient and radiogenic isotope fluxes to the ocean crocket et al 2012 hawkings et al 2016 2015 kurzweil et al 2010 as well as exchange with atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 martin 2017 spence and telmer 2005 much of the weathering in proglacial rivers may occur in sandurs because they trap comminuted sediment and thereby extend the sediment residence times however the impact of weathering in sandurs depends on pore water residence times and thus the rate and direction of exchange between pore water and river water this exchange between sandur pore water and proglacial rivers depends on sediment permeability and head gradients between the river and its bank it also may occur during flooding of the top of the sandur sediments and from percolation of precipitation snow and or rain into the exposed sandur in this paper we refer to this exchange as hydrologic exchange flow which describes all lateral and vertical exchange of river and subsurface waters rather than the more commonly used but more restricted term hyperheic exchange harvey and gooseff 2015 head gradients of proglacial streams should vary at diurnal and seasonal timescales as their flow varies with alternating freeze and thaw graly et al 2017 koch et al 2011 malard et al 1999 permeability may also vary in permafrost affected areas during freeze in of groundwater and restrict hydrologic exchange flow however streams in the arctic tundra of alaska were found to contribute bioreactive solutes at rates similar to temperate ecosystems edwardson et al 2003 altered pore water compositions and their contributions to river compositions should be enhanced by low water rock ratios and long residence times compared to water in the river channel nezat et al 2001 that produce steep gradients of biogeochemically reactive solutes boulton et al 1998 for example the proglacial discharge from finsterwalderbreen svalbard has elevated ca mg so4 and hco3 concentrations from sulfide oxidation and carbonate and gypsum dissolution in the river bank which enhance in stream solute concentrations by 30 50 cooper et al 2002 wadham et al 2001 delivery of these solutes from pore waters to the streams depends on flow conditions and the extent of subsurface exchange which varies over diurnal to seasonal timescales during the ablation season koch et al 2011 malard et al 1999 to assess the potential contributions from hydrologic exchange flow to a proglacial river draining a continental ice sheet we evaluate chemical alteration in pore waters and hydrologic exchange between proglacial surface and pore waters at two locations along the watson river near kangerlussuaq west greenland we also calculate temporary bank storage proximal exchange immediately adjacent to the river channel due to diurnal river stage fluctuations we use these observations to speculate on distal exchange caused by seasonal changes in river stage e g gooseff et al 2003 our data include hydrologic parameters major ion and minor element hydrochemistry that provide an assessment of weathering reactions and how proglacial hydrologic exchange flows may affect river water chemical composition and potential oceanic solute fluxes these data should be considered a reconnaissance study serving to expand our knowledge of hydrologic exchange flows in proglacial watersheds draining ice sheets to our knowledge this work represents the first study of hydrologic exchange flows and pore water chemistry conducted in a proglacial watershed draining the greenland ice sheet an actively retreating continental ice sheet our results could be important for understanding mechanisms for ocean and atmospheric fluxes during retreat of the northern hemisphere ice sheets since the last glacial maximum and for making predications of changes in fluxes as glaciers continue to retreat in a warming world 2 methods 2 1 site description the watson river flows 40 km from the convergence of isunnguata sermia and russell glacier at the western margin of the greenland ice sheet into søndre strømfjord fig 1 a draining a proglacial area of 600 km2 average summer discharge to søndre strømfjord was 117 m3 s between 2007 and 2010 hasholt et al 2013 correlating with increased ice melt and evolution of an efficient subglacial drainage system bartholomew et al 2010 chandler et al 2013 we investigated two portions of the outwash plain sandflugtdalen 67 06 n 50 39 w and a smaller sandur across the watson river from the kangerlussuaq international science support kiss facility 67 00 n 50 68 w hereafter referred to as wr6 and wrk respectively sampling locations at wr6 were located near the middle of the valley while the sampled sandur at wrk abuts a hill near the river bank glaciofluvial fine to coarse sands with intermittent gravel lenses predominate and give way to eolian sands with increasing vegetation and peat content with distance from the channel willemse et al 2003 the downstream site wrk consists of finer better sorted sands than wr6 within the depths sampled the sampling regions in this study have longitudinal gradients of 1 4 m km at sandflugtdalen wr6 while transverse gradients are 100 m km howat et al 2014 these gradients suggest lateral hydrologic exchange flows are likely larger than longitudinal hydrologic exchange flows and therefore we focus this study on lateral exchange long term 1958 1999 mean annual

et al 2005 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 water chemistry pore water samples were collected from wr6 14 15 july and wrk 16 july during the 2013 melt season fig 1a watson river water samples were collected at both sites on 8 july pore water samples were collected using an ams vapor probe charette and allen 2006 at discrete depths 20 96 cm below the water table cmbwt the vapor probe was installed in river bank sediments in a transect perpendicular to one of the larger braids in the river channel fig 1b during sampling the channel remained straight and stable although it widened with increased discharge during our sampling period both pore and river water were pumped into an overflow cup using a peristaltic pump fitted with tygon tubing temperature ph specific conductivity spc corrected to 25 c and dissolved oxygen do were measured with a ysi proplus handheld unit with the sonde installed in the overflow cup once readings stabilized sample water was filtered through a 0 45 μm trace metal grade canister filter into labeled bottles and preserved as required for each solute cation and dissolved metal samples were collected in acid washed 20 ml hdpe bottles and preserved with optima hno3 to ph 2 dissolved inorganic carbon dic samples were collected in 20 ml glass vials and preserved with a saturated solution of mercuric chloride anion and silica samples were collected in di washed 20 ml hdpe bottles with no preservative stable isotope samples were collected in 2 ml borosilicate glass vials with no preservative all bottles were triple rinsed with filtered site water before collecting the sample for analysis water isotope and dic samples were collected to minimize headspace in vials silica was analyzed within thirty days of collection at the laboratory facilities at kiss all other samples were stored at kiss in 4 c refrigerators samples were shipped chilled to the university of florida and stored at 4 c until analysis 2 2 2 hydraulic measurements hydraulic measurements were made at wr6 using four piezometers measuring 72 cm with a 23 5 cm screened interval and 3 2 cm internal diameter that were installed several meters upstream of the pore water sampling the separation limited artifacts that may have results from pumping of pore water the piezometers were spaced at 2 5 6 0 9 5 and 13 5 m from the edge of the channel and a fifth piezometer was installed in the river channel fig 1b piezometers were driven with a sledge hammer into pits dug into the sediment to ensure installation below the water table these piezometers were instrumented with conductivity temperature depth ctd sondes that recorded spc temperature and pressure once per minute for one week 7 14 july 2013 head differences dh between river and pore water were calculated by subtracting the atmospheric pressure corrected rennermalm et al 2014 pressures logged by the river ctd from the ctds installed in the bank sediment based on a datum of water level dug in a channel from the river to the farthest piezometer at the end of the experiment the distance between the piezometers dl was measured to calculate the head gradient dh dl between the ctds in the river and the bank sediments saturated zone hydraulic conductivity ksat was determined 20 m upstream of hydraulic conductivity calculation sites using a falling head slug test bouwer and rice 1976 these tests were conducted with piezometers similar to those in the monitoring transect ctds recording at 1 hz were mounted in the piezometers just below the water table and allowed to equilibrate river water was poured into the piezometer until they overflowed for at least five seconds then the system was allowed to return to baseline this process was repeated four times at each site and three sites were measured at both locations hydraulic conductivity was calculated assuming an unconfined aquifer with 1 k sat r c 2 ln r e r w 2 l 1 t ln h 0 h t bouwer and rice 1976 where rc and rw are the internal and external radii of the piezometer re is the effective radial distance over which the increase in head is dissipated l is the length of the screen in the piezometer h0 is the maximum head displacement at time t 0 and ht is the head displacement at time t because re is not known we estimate the re rw ratio based on the method of bouwer 1989 for partially penetrating wells 2 ln r e r w 1 1 ln l w r w a b ln l b l w r w l r w where lw is the distance from the bottom of the well to the water table lb is the distance from the water table to the bottom of the aquifer here assumed to be the top of the permafrost and a and b are dimensionless constants based on l rw the head gradients and hydraulic conductivity were used to estimate fluxes of river water into and out of the bank sediments based on darcy s law 3 q ak dh dl where q l3 t is the recharge into the sediment or discharge to the river depending on the sign of the head gradient and a is a unit area of the bed of the river we lack head gradient values for the wrk site and thus estimate recharge to the sediment and discharge to the river eq 3 only at wr6 2 3 laboratory methods silica was analyzed using the low range heteropoly blue method 0 1 6 mg l

calculated using speciated hco3 and co3 from phreeqc model were 4 for pore waters and 15 for watson river water greater average charge balance errors in watson river water are unsurprising given the low ionic strength of the water which approached the detection limit of the techniques 2 4 weathering reactions we analyze our data in part through comparisons with water compositions expected from

micromolar concentrations 3 results 3 1 river water versus pore water composition specific conductivity ph and temperature show systematic variations with depth in the sediment and distance from the river fig 2 specific conductivity is greater in pore water than in river water and the pore water spc increases with distance from the river fig 2a at sites near the river the greatest spc occurs at the greatest depth sampled 90 cmbwt but at sites farthest from the river the greatest spc occurs at the shallowest depth and decreases with depth most pore water has greater spc at wrk than wr6 most pore water ph is greater than river water ph with the exception of the distal site at wrk fig 2 the trends in ph with depth and with distance from river are opposite to those seen in spc the lowest ph values occur at in the deepest sample at any one site and decrease away from the river at both wr6 and wrk temperature in the pore water is generally greater than the river water near the surface 20 cmbwt and decreases with depth and distance from the river fig 2c the distribution of major element concentrations follow systematic patterns between river water and pore water at wr6 and wrk fig 3 anions in river water are dominated by hco3 co3 while pore waters have a greater relative abundance of so4 fig 3a wrk is enriched in so4 relative to wr6 which has relative concentrations intermediate between wrk and river values relative so4 concentrations of pore water increase with distance from river for cations the watson river samples have greater relative concentrations of si and na k compared to pore waters which are enriched in ca mg fig 3b relationships between ph so4 and hco3 provide information about acid base reactions in the pore water fig 4 a significant inverse correlation exists between ph and so4 r2 0 70 p 0001 in all pore waters and both differ from river water values which have low so4 concentrations and approximately neutral ph fig 4a sulfate concentrations increase and ph values decrease with distance from the river channel and depth in the sediment near the river channel the highest so4 concentrations and lowest ph values occur in shallow pore water far from the river fig 4a appendix 1 river water and most wr6 pore water have excess hco3 relative to the expected 2 1 molar ratio reaction 5 with the exception of samples from 20 and 45 cmbwt at the distal location wr6 pwe fig 4b in contrast wrk pore water sites have excess so4 except at the 20 cmbwt depth at the proximal site mineral weathering can be identified based on relationships between ca ca mg sr and so4 fig 5 a good correlation exists between sr and ca at wr6 r2 0 95 p 0001 and wrk r2 0 97 p 0001 with slopes of 0 78 μm nm and 0 69 μm nm respectively fig 5a slopes of the regression indicate average ca sr ratios are lower in wrk compared to wr6 pore waters particularly far from the river river water has ca sr ratios of 0 99 wr6 and 0 95 wrk near the intersection of compositions expected by weathering of carbonate and silicate mineral end members watson river water has ca mg hco3 ratios consistent with both carbonate and silicate weathering fig 5b but pore water ca mg concentrations are greater relative to hco3 concentration than expected from carbonate and silicate weathering the ca mg ex values e g values corrected for a source from carbonate dissolution eq 8 correlate significantly with so4 concentrations at both sites wr6 slope 0 79 r2 0 96 p 0001 wrk slope 0 96 r2 0 99 p 0001 fig 5c both ca mg ex and so4 concentrations generally increase with distance from the river at both pore water sites watson river δ18o and δd values are low relative to regional precipitation and most pore waters which decrease with depth in the sediment fig 6 pore water precipitation and river water are all lower and plot closer to the global meteoric water line relative to waters from a nearby nonglacial watershed 3 2 temperature and specific conductivity of pore water time series measurements show systematic variations away from the river as well as diurnal variations of most chemical and hydrologic variables fig 7 daily maximum pore water temperature lags daily maximum air temperature at all piezometers fig 7a and decreases with distance from the river fig 7c the temperature variations are out of phase with the river water variations but in phase with the river elevation the large increase in river elevation on 12 july corresponds with a drop of 6 c to near river values in temperature at piezometer b the spc probe in piezometer b failed but ctds at piezometers d and e recorded the greatest spc values and greatest variation of all sites piezometer d decreases from 172 to 78 μs cm over the week long deployment while piezometer e increases from 136 to 201 μs cm over the same time period fig 7d the increase in spc at piezometer e coincides with the increase in river elevation recorded on 12 july fig 7d similarly the river ctd recorded a subtle decrease in average spc from 15 to 12 5 μs cm corresponding with an increase in river elevation minor diurnal variations in spc are present at all sites fig 7e although muted compared to the magnitude of change in spc over the sampling period detrended spc data fig 7e was produced by subtracting the best fit line of unmodified spc data in matlab these detrended data show piezometer a varies diurnally from 11 to 17 μs cm piezometer c varies diurnally from 57 to 76 μs cm although the maxima are offset from the river by 12 h 3 3 hydraulic conductivity and discharge recharge to banks average ksat is greater by an order of magnitude at wr6 average 2 2 0 64 10 4 m s than at wrk average 4 9 3 7 10 5 m s table 1 these values lie within the range of ksat reported in other glaciofluvial environments and moraine sediments cooper et al 2002 schwartz and zhang 2003 no pattern exists between distance from river and magnitude of ksat head gradients were oriented from the watson river channel toward the bank during the week long ctd deployment for all locations except piezometer b where head gradients changed orientation on a diurnal basis fig 7b in the following discussion head gradients oriented toward the river channel will be positive and indicate discharge from the sediment and away from the river will be negative and indicate recharge to the bank the diurnal variation in head gradients is out of phase with the river elevation daily minimum river water elevation corresponds to daily maximum head gradient the maximum head gradients lead the minimum river elevation while the minimum negative head gradients lead the maximum river elevations by several hours up to the large negative dh dl deflection and rise of 15 cm in river elevation on 12 july fig 7a based on darcy s law eq 3 estimated average flow away from the river is 9 8 10 8 4 2 10 8 and 7 6 10 8 m3 sec at piezometers c d and e respectively over the sample period at piezometer b the average net flow recharge plus discharge is 8 3 10 8 m3 sec into the river bank with a recharge value of 1 4 10 7 m3 sec and discharge of 5 4 10 8 m3 sec multiplying these average discharge and recharge values by the length of observation around 6 7 days yields the total flux into the sediment per m2 of the river bottom 5 6 10 2 2 4 10 2 and 4 4 10 2 m3 per m2 of river channel at piezometers c d and e respectively at piezometer b the total net flow per m2 of the river bottom is 4 8 10 2 m3 with total recharge of 7 9 10 2 m3 and discharge of 3 1 10 2 m3 assuming net flow at piezometer b is similar across the sandflugtdalen with an approximate wetted river bottom of around 5 2 km2 the total flow into the river bank over the study period is 2 5 105 m3 4 discussion specific conductivity values which reflects solute concentrations are four to ten times greater in pore water relative to river water e g fig 2a indicating extensive diagenetic reactions occur in sandur sediments reactions that alter the pore water chemistry could control fluxes of solutes to the river depending on the reaction and exchange rates consequently fluxes to the river will also depend on the hydrogeologic characteristics of the sediments and head gradients which control hydrologic exchange flows between river and pore water e g harvey and gooseff 2015 therefore in the following discussion we evaluate potential sources of water to the active layer adjacent to the river define reactions that could alter the pore water compositions estimate potential exchanges between the river and pore waters and speculate on potential changes in solute fluxes that may result from this exchange 4 1 sources of water to the active layer sources to sandur pore water in addition to watson river water could include flow from deep groundwater or proximal non glacial watersheds i e those watersheds separated from the ice sheet by hydrologic divides scribner et al 2015 active layer melt and precipitation deep groundwater exists along fractures in bedrocks but is separated from active layer groundwater and surface water by continuous permafrost nielsen 2010 small non glacial deglaciated tributaries enter the watson river along its length but the magnitude of this discharge is minimal compared to ice derived drainage aebly and fritz 2009 ryu and jacobson 2012 numerous lakes surround the watson river watershed but all are separated from the watershed by topographic highs preventing their discharge to the river therefore the most likely source of pore water other than the watson river is direct recharge from annual precipitation despite the negative water balance given high ksat values compared to other media table 1 schwartz and zhang 2003 direct recharge by precipitation should be rapid when it occurs thereby limiting immediate evaporation mixing between water recharged through the land surface and exchanged with the watson river is shown by stable isotope ratios that are bracketed by watson river water and precipitation fig 6 pore water δ18o and δd values in sediment near the river trend toward watson river values while pore water farther from the river has values closer to those of precipitation reflecting a gradient in mixing proportions of river water and recharged precipitation additional precipitation could recharge the sandur from surrounding highlands because the orthogonal land surface slope to the river along the sandurs is two orders of magnitude greater than the longitudinal slope 4 2 geochemical processes in river versus pore water pore water solute concentrations generally increase with distance from the river fig 7d and depth fig 2a consistent with other permafrost affected rivers e g cooper et al 2002 gooseff et al 2013 2003 ward et al 1999 this distribution of solutes could reflect two end member conditions either little hydrologic exchange coupled with long pore water residence times that allow extensive weathering reactions or active hydrologic exchange associated with rapid weathering both of these end member processes likely occur and their relative magnitudes likely evolve through the melt season depending on temperature and river discharge conditions the rates of weathering reactions depends on mineralogical compositions of outwash sediments which reflect comminuted and homogenized bedrock bedrock of the nmb consists predominantly of quartz and feldspars along with minor amounts of mica calcite pyrite and heavy minerals hindshaw et al 2014 although sediment compositions are dominated by silicate minerals the dominant pore waters reactions are carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation e g reactions 4 6 based on low relative si concentration and elevated so4 concentrations fig 3 similar to alpine proglacial catchments e g anderson 2007 and surrounding deglaciated watersheds scribner et al 2015 other secondary mineral precipitates e g reaction 8 must also be considered in the pore water chemistry because summer evaporation and winter cryoconcentration can lead to precipitation of evaporite minerals barrett et al 2009 cooper et al 2002 killawee et al 1998 tranter 2003 4 2 1 preferential weathering both sulfuric and carbonic acid may drive weathering watson river water hco3 so4 ratios 2 indicate carbonic acid weathering dominates in the river e g tranter et al 2002 hydration of atmospheric co2 is the most likely source of the carbonic acid as little dissolved organic carbon is available for remineralization in greenland ice sheet proglacial rivers bhatia et al 2013 lawson et al 2014 carbonic acid also controls weathering in the pore water at wr6 where hco3 so4 ratios are 2 at wrk however where hco3 so4 ratios are 2 sulfide mineral oxidation and production of sulfuric acid or dissolution of sulfate salts may contribute so4 fig 4b the inverse correlation between ph and so4 concentrations supports oxidation of sulfide minerals and production of sulfuric acid figs 3a and 4a which could enhance both carbonate and silicate mineral weathering e g tranter 2003 at wrk low ph and hco3 so4 ratios fig 4 suggest the loss of easily weathered carbonate minerals that would buffer ph this loss of carbonate could occur as sediments pass through multiple sandurs on their journey downstream increasing their residence time in the system a similar shift from predominately carbonate dissolution to sulfide oxidation occurs with increasing exposure age and rainfall in deglaciated watersheds in a transect from kangerlussuaq to sisimiut in western greenland scribner et al 2015 the preferential removal of trace carbonate minerals from the sandur sediment reflects the large scale weathering evolution across glacial landscapes anderson et al 2000 scribner et al 2015 and suggests that much of this weathering could occur in pore water of sandur sediments of proglacial rivers the relative impact of silicate versus carbonate mineral weathering can be assessed by comparing ca sr ratios because these two mineral groups have distinct proportions of ca sr scribner et al 2015 we compare sr and ca ratios with regional end members for silicate and carbonate mineral weathering derived from analysis of watson river bedload material silicate minerals in the region have an average ca sr ratio of 0 18 µmol nmol while carbonate minerals as inferred from a weak acid leachate of bedload sediments have an average ca sr ratio of 0 88 µmol nmol carbonate weathering appears to dominate the watson river considering ca sr ratios are 0 99 at wr6 and 0 95 at wrk appendix 2 which is consistent with alpine glacial systems e g anderson 2007 these findings are also consistent with ryu and jacobson 2012 who estimate 28 68 of cations in watson river water are due to carbonate weathering however wimpenny et al 2011 estimated only 2 14 of solutes in the watson are due to carbonate weathering based on δ26mg composition while yde et al 2014 dismiss carbonate weathering as a major source of solutes based on ca na and mg na that cluster near silicate rock compositions in contrast with watson river water wr6 and wrk pore waters have average ca sr ratios of 0 84 0 05 μm nm and 0 65 0 06 μm nm respectively appendix 1 reflecting both more silicate weathering in the pore water than river water and a downstream increase in pore water silicate weathering both of these processes reflect the loss of easily weathered carbonate minerals with long residence times in the river in addition the increase in silicate weathering at wrk over wr6 could reflect hydrologic control because the order of magnitude greater average ksat values at wr6 than wrk table 1 could slow hydrologic exchange flows both the change in minerals weathered and acids involved in weathering could alter how proglacial river systems affect the global carbon cycle silicates weathered by sulfuric acid do not play a role in the global carbon cycle but silicates weathered by carbonic acid represent a net sink of atmospheric co2 berner et al 1983 while carbonate minerals weathered by sulfuric acid represent a net source of co2 to the atmosphere galy and france lanord 1999 martin 2017 ryu and jacobson 2012 downstream carbonic acid weathering of silicate and carbonate minerals in the watson river sequesters 75 of dissolved co2 ryu and jacobson 2012 even in granitoid terrains where carbonates are rare carbonates weather preferentially relative to silicates anderson 2007 white et al 2005 1999 the increase in so4 and decrease in ph suggest that sulfuric acid weathering of carbonate in the pore water would increase pco2 of the pore water and that the generated co2 could be transferred to the river with hydrologic exchange flow 4 2 2 influence of evaporation cryoconcentration in addition to mineral weathering reactions pore water compositions can be modified by evaporation and cryoconcentration evaporative concentration which is enhanced by the negative water balance in the region hasholt and sogaard 1978 nielsen 2010 increases solute concentrations this concentration mechanism affects the portion of the water table near the land surface where capillary action moves shallow groundwater toward the land surface barrett et al 2009 tranter 2003 during the winter cryoconcentration increases solutes at depth by surface down and permafrost up active layer freeze in cooper et al 2002 tranter 2003 both evaporation and cryoconcentration could precipitate secondary minerals including calcite and sulfate salts in water contained in the active layer regardless of whether such precipitation occurs in the phreatic zone or meniscus water in the vadose zone cooper et al 2002 killawee et al 1998 tranter 2003 the region lacks primary evaporite deposits at the surface to contribute to water compositions ryu and jacobson 2012 although gypsum has been found at depths 300 m pere 2014 continuous permafrost limits the interaction with active layer pore waters nielsen 2010 therefore the primary source of so4 in these systems must be the oxidation of sulfide minerals in the sub or pro glacial environments precipitation of sulfate salts by freezing or evaporation could then concentrate the sulfate during subsequent dissolution by melt waters during the summer thaws tranter 2003 dissolution of secondary ca mg sulfate salts is reflected in pore water with ca mg concentrations in excess of those expected from silicate or carbonate weathering fig 5b assuming a ca mg ex so4 ratio of 1 fig 5c dissolution is likely as pore water samples are undersaturated with respect to both calcite and gypsum appendix 1 and 2 excess ca mg concentrations increase away from the river fig 5c similar to the spc values fig 7d indicating alteration of pore water compositions by evaporation and cryoconcentration the ca mg ex concentration in the pore water represents 2 56 of the total cation concentration making it a substantial contributor to its composition assuming all excess ca and mg present in pore water is due to the dissolution of secondary gypsum 2 165 mg of gypsum per liter of water must dissolve to reach current pore water concentrations solute concentrations that increase with distance from the river figs 2a and 7d suggest that hydrologic exchange flow diminishes with distance from the channel at least over the sampling period and evapoconcentration increases solute concentrations similar to streams in the dry valley of antarctica gooseff et al 2003 and at finsternwalderbreen in svalbard cooper et al 2002 however the relationship between increased solute concentrations in pore waters with distance from the river could also depend on the river stage as sandurs flood with increased melting and discharge hydrologic exchange flows could alter pore water concentrations because we sampled only over a short period we are unable to quantitatively assess the impact of seasonal flooding of the sandurs 4 3 evidence for river pore water exchange and storage glacial meltwater streams have unsteady flow due to pulses of glacial melt at diurnal frequencies e g koch et al 2011 runkel et al 1998 and through the melt season e g hasholt et al 2013 this variable flow alters head gradients and direction and magnitudes of hydrologic exchange flows peak watson river discharge at søndre strømfjord lags peak ice sheet melt by 10 h hasholt et al 2013 and causes the 6 h lag in river stage and peak air temperature at wk6 fig 7a the diurnal variations in river stage result in periodic changes between positive and negative head gradient values at piezometer b and indicate water alternates between flow into and out of the bank this periodic reversal of flow ceased on 12 july when river stage rose over a 6 h period and increased the head gradient by more than the diurnal head gradient fluctuations fig 7b this change was not from local precipitation as 1 mm of rain fell during 7 14 july cappelen 2014 rather rising stage resulted from changes in the magnitude of regional glacial melt and or the reorganization of the subglacial hydrological system e g bartholomew et al 2011 chandler et al 2013 graly et al 2017 this increase was documented by increased discharge at an upstream gauging station rennermalm et al 2014 the increase in stage caused flow into the bank for 30 h and flow of river water into the bank is supported by a simultaneous decrease in temperature at piezometer b from 8 c to near river values of 3 c fig 7c although this event occurred near the end of our record it appears the system equilibrated and returned to diurnal positive head gradients at piezometer b while at a higher overall stage fig 7 negative head gradients at the distal piezometers c d and e indicate a flow direction always away from the river outside of the zone with hydrologic exchange flows fig 7b these head gradients reflect the overall increase in river stage during the sampling period the distal piezometers also did not record the overall decrease in temperature corresponding with the rise in river stage on 12 july further indicating river water did not reach these piezometers fig 7c furthermore spc values recorded at the distal piezometers never approach river water values fig 7d instead the spc records reflect flow away from the river consistent with the negative head gradients over the period of record spc at piezometer d decreases from 175 μs cm to near piezometer c values of 50 μs cm and piezometer e increases from 150 μs cm to values similar to the initial piezometer d value of 175 μs cm these trends suggest low conductivity water flowed from piezometer c to d while high conductivity water flowed from d to e however flow away from the river is modified by diurnal variations in river stage as reflected in dh dl values that vary in phase with dh dl observed at piezometer b fig 7b the watson river is ungauged at the sandflugtdalen so we lack information on the discharge during our observations although average discharge into søndre strømfjord is 117 m3 sec hasholt et al 2013 which includes discharge from a proglacial drainage of about equal size to the watson river and suggests that discharge upstream of the confluence would be around half the total discharge or around 60 m3 sec watson river discharge was measured upstream of sandflugtdalen to be around 9 m3 sec rennermalm pers comm 2017 using these two values as bounds on flow through sandflugtdalen the total volume of river water discharged was between 5 2 and 35 106 m3 comparing this value with estimates of total water lost to the sediment during our period of observation approximately 1 8 of the river flow recharged the river bank 4 4 implications for hydrologic exchange flows and solute fluxes over the study period hydrologic exchange flow between river and pore water was limited to within a few meters of the river channel and depends on river flow river discharge varies diurnally driving proximal exchange in fig 8 a and out fig 8b of the bank near the channel rapid changes in discharge such the event on 12 july temporarily flood the river bank providing dilute river water recharge to distal pore waters that evolve by carbonate dissolution sulfide oxidation and further dissolution of secondary salts farther from the river the flow direction is always away from the channel which isolates the water e g gooseff et al 2003 and alters the pore water compositions through carbonate dissolution sulfide oxidation and dissolution of secondary salts the isolation of this water is reflected in increasingly altered compositions with distance from the river fig 2a while the present data set cannot constrain hydrologic exchange flows and geochemical evolution of pore and river waters on a seasonal timescale over the course of the melt season changes in discharge could drive conditions similar to those we observed at diurnal frequency fig 8 however as changing melt conditions change river channel location e g channel migration curvature etc could also affect the timing and location of dilute river water infiltration into the subsurface that cannot be predicted by our data since river discharge depends on ice sheet conditions areas of the sandur could be inundated one year but not in subsequent years effectively trapping water in the subsurface despite the high ksat of sediment in the outwash plain thus low water rock ratios relatively high ksat and long subsurface flow paths allow weathering to alter the pore water compositions the diurnal variations in head gradients and known variations in discharge also allow us to predict that distal exchange could be seasonally important to the solute load of the watson river seasonal variations in river stage should allow surface water to infiltrate the subsurface during high discharge and pore waters to flow to the river during low discharge e g koch et al 2011 lower river discharge occurs early and late in the melt season and correlates to cooler temperatures and a decrease in glacial melt at these times regional head gradients should be oriented toward the river channel causing flow of pore waters into the river this flow will be modified by the extent of thaw out or freeze in of the active layer and the heterogeneity of sandur sediment the discharge could be on the same order of magnitude as the recharge estimated here to be around 1 8 of the total river flow although pore water volumes could be modified by evaporation or direct recharge because the chemical compositions of the pore water are four to ten times greater than the river even this small discharge relative to the river flow could impact the river water chemistry and solute fluxes currently proglacial watersheds provide 0 6 1 of global runoff to the ocean the greenland ice sheet is responsible for approximately one third of modern proglacial runoff tranter 2003 as the climate warms and enhanced melting continues solute fluxes to the ocean are also expected to increase for example discharge from ice sheets provides a significant source of bioavailable and particulate iron to coastal oceans and is also expected to increase as discharge increases bhatia et al 2013 hawkings et al 2014 as active layer thaw depths increase in a warming climate the volume of the subsurface available for reaction will also increase though the hydrologic exchange flow is not limited by active layer depth during peak melt edwardson et al 2003 the extent of hydrologic exchange flow should increase until a threshold depth is reached as determined by head gradients and stream morphology zarnetske et al 2008 however the significance of these fluxes will be modulated by the magnitude of discharge in the watson river as melting becomes more extensive 5 conclusions this study provides an initial assessment of hydrologic exchange flows in a proglacial river draining the greenland ice sheet and potential solute fluxes based geochemistry of surface and pore waters and hydrogeologic observations the relative importance of sulfuric acid compared to carbonic acid to weathering increases downstream and solute compositions indicate carbonate weathering dominates relative to silicate weathering in both river and pore water these shifts in weathering acid and weathered minerals will impact drawdown of atmospheric co2 although this study only represents a snapshot of the dynamics of river pore water exchange pore water solute concentrations that are elevated over those in the river and high ksat of bank sediments highlight the potential for solute fluxes from the bank through the river and ultimately to the ocean from the proglacial watershed hydrologic exchange flows were limited to within 6 m of the river channel at the time of observation and narrowed with increasing discharge this flow reversed direction at diurnal periodicity because of diurnal variations in the river stage in contrast head gradients were always oriented away from the river although with diurnal variation in magnitude indicating continuous flow away from the river channel pore water far from the river should therefore flow to the river only during periods of low river stage these preliminary observations indicate that weathering of extensive sediment deposits in sandurs are likely important contributors to proglacial river water compositions weathering in sandur pore waters could thus have an important impact on ocean water chemistry during continental ice sheet melting and may impart a seasonal

7552,in order to continually improve the current understanding of flow and transport in crystalline bedrock environments developing and improving fracture system characterization techniques is an important area of study the presented research examines the installation of flexible impermeable flute liners as a means for assessing cross hole fracture connectivity flute liners are used to generate a new style of hydraulic pulse with pressure response monitored in a nearby network of open boreholes drilled in gneissic rock of the canadian shield in eastern ontario canada borehole liners were installed in six existing 10 15 cm diameter boreholes located 10 35 m apart and drilled to depths ranging between 25 45 m liner installation tests were completed consecutively with the number of observation wells available for each test ranging between one and six the collected pressure response data have been analyzed to identify significant groundwater flow paths between source and observation boreholes as well as to estimate inter well transmissivity and storativity using a conventional type curve analysis while the applied solution relies on a number of general assumptions it has been found that reasonable comparison can be made to previously completed pulse interference and pumping tests results of this research indicate areas where method refinement is necessary but nonetheless highlight the potential for use in crystalline bedrock environments this method may provide value to future site characterization efforts given that it is complementary to and can be used in conjunction with other currently employed borehole liner applications such as the removal of cross connection at contaminated sites and the assessment of discrete fracture distributions when boreholes are sealed recreating natural hydraulic gradient conditions keywords crystalline bedrock borehole liners cross hole testing hydraulic testing fracture connectivity 1 introduction crystalline bedrock aquifers occur in many regions of the world and are exposed in vast areas such as the precambrian rocks of the canadian shield baltic shield and brazilian shield while wells drilled in crystalline rock may be associated with limited yield in some locations they are nonetheless important for water supply especially in many developing countries where surface water is often inadequate

can be particularly vulnerable to contamination e g kim et al 2016 vitale et al 2017 crystalline bedrock aquifers generally contain negligible matrix porosity and as a result groundwater flow is transmitted nearly exclusively through fractures within a largely impervious rock matrix although the effective porosity of these pathways is quite small in the order of 10 4 10 5 average linear groundwater velocities can be significant creating the potential for rapid contaminant transport and widespread contaminant migration allen and morrison 1973 singhal and gupta 1999 conboy and goss 2000 levison and novakowski 2009 these conditions may be enhanced by minimal matrix diffusion storage and associated solute degradation as well as rapid recharge of groundwater and associated contaminants in areas with thin overburden which is common in crystalline bedrock environments grisak and pickens 1981 gerhart 1986 bodin et al 2003 gleeson et al 2009 levison and novakowski 2012 levison et al 2012 praamsma 2016 given this inherent vulnerability characterization of crystalline bedrock aquifers to gain an enhanced understanding of groundwater flow and contaminant transport is a necessary task however fully understanding this vulnerability is complicated by inherent fracture network complexity berkowitz 2002 in crystalline bedrock environments past investigations undertaken to better understand groundwater flow and solute transport for applications including the development of nuclear waste repositories reveal the potential for highly heterogeneous fracture networks and

flowmeter tests and commonly used pumping tests and pulse interference tests e g gernand and heidtman 1997 paillet 1998 andersson et al 2004 nakao et al 2005 stephenson et al 2006 worley 2012 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 in fractured bedrock environments extraction or injection stimulus in a pumping test can be associated with significant fluid displacement given minimal effective porosity this may be undesirable at a contaminated site given the additional costs associated with water storage and treatment following fluid removal furthermore long duration pumping tests are often influenced by external boundary conditions raven 1986 that may confound results where inter well formation properties are of greatest interest pulse interference tests serve as a potential alternative to pumping tests e g novakowski 1989 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 these tests involve monitoring the response in one or more observation wells to a change in head in a source well the high diffusivity of fractured bedrock enables the generation of a detectable pressure perturbation over greater distances than that which could be observed in porous media novakowski 1989 the source of this perturbation may take the form of a slug sageev 1986 novakowski 1989 or a sequence of flow rate changes mckinley et al 1968 as is commonly applied in the oil and gas industry pulse interference tests may be completed under open hole conditions or with isolated test sections he et al 2006 illman and tartakovsky 2006 stephenson et al 2006 cheng et al 2009 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 the isolated form of a pulse interference test is generally more desirable than open hole testing because it allows for the examination of targeted vertical borehole intervals and or discrete fractures however this testing approach is both time and resource demanding given the potential drawbacks associated with both pumping tests and pulse interference tests benefits stand to be gained from the exploration of novel cross hole testing methods in this study we examine a unique hydraulic pulse generated by the downhole installation of flute blank liners as a new method of cross hole hydraulic testing flute liners are impermeable urethane coated nylon fabric sleeves closed at the bottom end designed by flexible liner underground technologies llc with the original purpose of providing a complete seal along the borehole wall keller et al 2013 accordingly these liners can be used at contaminated sites to seal boreholes immediately after they are drilled to prevent hydraulic cross connection between fractures intersected by the borehole e g parker et al 2012 meyer et al 2014 flute liners are also currently used to facilitate the identification of hydraulically active fractures using temperature pehme et al 2007 2010 2013 and may also be used to create temporary sensor deployments for the design of multi level systems pehme et al 2014 during the installation of a liner water is forced outward from the borehole into the surrounding aquifer the generated hydraulic pulse can be considered a form of progressive large scale slug test where the rate of liner descent and discharge of water exiting the source well is dependent on the transmissivity of the remaining open borehole interval and fracture intersections cherry et al 2007 keller et al 2013 as the liner descends progressively deeper fractures are cut off from flow generating a pulse that should be detectable in surrounding observation holes through measurements of liner descent velocity and driving head flute transmissivity profiling keller et al 2013 can be used to identify the location of permeable fracture features along the borehole wall as well as estimate the transmissivity of these features this profiling method is an efficient approach for examining a borehole s transmissivity distribution especially when used in combination with short interval straddle packer testing quinn et al 2015 however the procedure is still under refinement and is limited to the scale of a single borehole to date analysis of the potential pulse interference component has not been conducted the objective of this study is to investigate the use of liner installations to assess cross hole fracture connectivity and inter well hydraulic properties and to do so in a manner that is complementary to and can be used in conjunction with other currently employed borehole liner applications the proposed method takes advantage of a pre existing hydrogeological tool to generate a new style of hydraulic pulse we hypothesize that pressure responses generated during liner installation can be used to identify hydraulic connections between boreholes furthermore the pressure responses generated during installation can be analyzed with type curve fitting methods used in pumping test analysis to approximate values of transmissivity and storativity for the inter well connections examined this method may be valuable in future characterization of crystalline bedrock aquifers by providing a means of cross hole data collection that is rapid convenient and relatively inexpensive knowledge gained from this approach regarding fracture connectivity and hydraulic parameters across a given site has potential to guide wellhead protection studies and groundwater remediation strategies 2 methods six borehole liner installation tests were conducted at a fractured bedrock field site in eastern ontario canada the following section describes the research site and past aquifer characterization activities and also presents the applied methodology for site structural analysis liner installation testing and analysis of the collected pressure response data 2 1 site description and characterization field investigations were completed during 2015 2016 at a research site located near tamworth ontario canada this site is underlain by precambrian bedrock of the canadian shield below less than 1 5 m of sandy loam overburden dillon consulting ltd 2004 gao et al 2006 bedrock in this area consists predominantly of heterogeneous thinly layered metasedimentary gneissic rocks of the grenville supergroup easton 1992 ontario geological survey 2011 the surface topography is flat lying the site has a cluster of eight bedrock boreholes fig 1 which were drilled over the period of 2009 2015 the cluster includes seven vertical boreholes and one inclined borehole which range in diameter and depth from 10 to 15 cm and 25 to 45 m respectively radial distances between boreholes span 10 35 m these boreholes were drilled using percussion kf2 kf3 kf4 kf5 and kf9 and hq triple tube kf6 kf7 and kf8 methods with the exception of kf5 which was converted into a set of nested piezometers all boreholes on site are cased to a shallow depth through the overburden approximately 1 3 mbgs and remain open through the bedrock kf5 has three isolated monitoring intervals kf5 upper 10 7 mbgs middle 15 5 20 2 mbgs and lower 25 3 38 2 mbgs these monitoring intervals consist of slotted 51 mm pvc pipe and are backfilled with sand separated by bentonite confining layers the water table at the cluster varies seasonally between approximately 0 5 3 5 mbgs transmissive zones in all boreholes at the site have been identified using constant head injection tests completed in a contiguous manner along the entire length of each hole with straddle packer systems spanning interval lengths of approximately 2 2 4 m elmhirst 2011 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 boreholes kf2 kf3 and kf4 and the connections between these were also examined using a number of pulse interference tests slug tests and pumping tests elmhirst 2011 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 in the present study a suite of borehole geophysics and hydro geophysical testing was completed within all boreholes including profiles of formation conductivity natural gamma acoustic televiewer atv and full waveform sonic fws as well as open hole temperature and active line source als testing pehme et al 2013 in lined boreholes 2 2 structural analysis detailed structural interpretation of the atv logs collected from each borehole was completed using wellcad software advanced logic technology version 5 1 through the interactive selection of individual fractures information regarding fracture depth dip direction aperture and structure class i e degree of openness and continuity across the downhole image log were recorded fracture picks were selected as consistently as possible between logs despite differences in image resolution resulting from drilling percussion drilled versus cored boreholes there is an inherent bias in the orientation of fracture features that will be intersected by a one dimensional survey for example vertical boreholes are certain to sample horizontal and sub horizontal features and have a progressively lower probability of intersecting high angle or vertical features in order to account for this bias identified and analyzed in terzaghi 1965 and to generate a more representative fracture distribution the following weighting factor w was applied to each discontinuity priest 1985 priest 1993 1 w 1 cos δ where δ is the acute angle between the fracture normal and the sampling line i e borehole axis as δ approaches 90 representing a fracture that is parallel to the borehole axis the weighting factor will approach infinity creating unrealistic representations of the fracture network consequently a maximum weighting factor of 7 was applied in the present analysis which represents a δ of approximately 81 8 e g priest 1993 jones et al 1999 buoro et al 2009 zetterlund et al 2012 it should be noted that this creates a blind zone in the fracture distribution where the data set is limited by the orientation of the borehole and where correction of this sampling bias is restricted using the corrected fracture data lower hemisphere equal area stereographic projections contoured using the 1 area method were used to visually identify fracture pole clusters representative of sets of parallel subparallel fractures in this study fracture data from atv image logs are integral in the interpretation of each liner installation test and for this reason fracture mapping data from ground surface outcrops have been excluded for the sake of coherency it should be noted that atv data can be associated with a number of shortcomings which are discussed further in section 3 2 3 flute liner installations flute blank liners were installed in kf2 kf3 kf4 kf6 kf8 and kf9 in the fall of 2015 using the eversion process discussed in cherry et al 2007 and keller et al 2013 installation begins with the liner inside out on a spool the open end of which is attached to the top of the well casing a small portion of the liner is then everted and forced down the borehole by hand through the addition of water to the inside annulus of the liner a driving head is created above the original blended head of the hole where the blended head reflects the combined influence of all transmissive regions along the borehole length the rate at which water is added to the liner is controlled to maintain an approximately constant level i e a constant applied head differential between the inside of the liner and the formation this allows the liner to descend into the hole and forces water from within the borehole into the surrounding formation in doing so a continuous seal is created along the length of the borehole the velocity at which the liner moves downhole is proportional to the transmissivity of the remaining length of open borehole below the descending liner keller et al 2013 boreholes were lined in the following order kf2 kf3 kf4 kf9 kf8 and lastly kf6 fig 1 where each liner installation is treated as a separate test in the adjacent network of open boreholes a combination of solinst leveloggers and van essen micro divers installed approximately 1 m below the surface of the water table were used to monitor fluctuations in pressure resulting from hydraulic pulses generated during each liner installation for ease of presentation a single value of observed pressure response was selected from the system of nested piezometers at kf5 for each liner installation test specifically the interval with the greatest observed pressure response ignoring vertical flow components evident through consideration of all monitoring intervals this is based on previously completed constant head injection testing in kf5 elmhirst 2011 which reveals that the lower half of kf5 has negligible transmissivity below testing limit accordingly the pressure response observed in the lowest interval of kf5 is consistently less than logger accuracy therefore placing emphasis on the pressure response observed in either the upper or middle interval of kf5 is deemed reasonable in the upper and middle zones of kf5 no apparent differences in timing of response were observed however the magnitude of peak response and the differences in peak response between these two monitoring points vary among tests flute liners are custom manufactured according to the specifications of the borehole for which they are to be installed e g length diameter stickup height the inside of the liner and the tether extending from the liner base to the top of casing is marked with eversion points ep s every 10 ft 3 0 m of liner descent to indicate the downhole position of the bottom of the liner during installation the progress of liner descent during installation in each hole was monitored manually based on these ep marks to create a coarse record of liner position versus time despite having a relatively low resolution 10 ft ep markings often represent a reasonable interval for data recording especially at the beginning of a liner installation when fractures with significant transmissivity remain open and rapid liner descent may be experienced observed to be as fast as 0 1 m s 2 4 analysis of observation well data from a qualitative perspective the magnitude and timing of variations in observation well pressure response to liner decent were used to examine flow within the borehole cluster and more specifically identify potential fracture connections between boreholes however there is currently no available quantitative analytical solution to accurately model the exact unique conditions created by the installation of a borehole liner as an input pulse a fundamental complication of the liner installation test method is that the injection interval is continuously changing throughout the course of a test the process of which is illustrated in fig 2 in recognizing that there is no existing analytical solution available to simulate a transient change in the length of tested interval at a measured rate this condition was not considered in the analysis the maximum open source hole length from the bottom of the casing to the bottom of the borehole is assumed to represent the length of the tested interval in each test i e the full length of the borehole is treated as constantly open the pressure pulse due to the liner descent is therefore assumed to be felt along the full borehole interval where the entire borehole water column represents a slug source forced into the formation across the complete borehole length given that this method of analysis does not accommodate the sealing of source hole flow paths as a liner is installed only the response of the most transmissive flow path at a given time step is measured in terms of the determined cross hole transmissivity similarly the reduction in well to well transmissivity that occurs as a transmissive fracture in the source hole is sealed is not accounted for the pressure response detected in adjacent observation wells for a given liner installation was modelled analytically using the moench 1997 solution this solution is a porous media model that has been applied herein to a heterogeneous fractured rock setting by assuming an equivalent porous media epm for the examined volume of aquifer it is recognized that in using this approach the accuracy of parameter estimates may be less reliable where few large fractures dominate the flow network e g muldoon and bradbury 2005 gellasch et al 2013 the moench 1997 solution enables the estimation of transmissivity and storativity between wells that may be fully or partially penetrating in a homogeneous anisotropic unconfined aquifer the principle of superposition in time is used to simulate variable rate tests whereby the variable rate is treated as a sequence of steps the unconfined moench 1997 solution accommodates water table fluctuation in response to a source well perturbation and incorporates the potential for delayed water table response in the observation wells in applying this solution it is assumed that the aquifer has infinite areal extent and uniform thickness the potentiometric surface is initially horizontal before each liner installation test and flow is unsteady fractured bedrock settings typically have low storativity and as a result wellbore storage effects may be substantial given that the volume of water stored in a large diameter well may be much larger than the volume of water moving within the formation novakowski 1990 wellbore storage is likely to affect the timing and amplitude of response in open observation wells during a liner installation test and it is recognized that by not accounting for this process transmissivity may be underestimated and storativity overestimated moench 1997 novakowski 1989 prats and scott 1975 wellbore storage will not manifest in the source well during liner descent as there is no free water surface wellbore storage did not manifest in the pressure response at the observation wells as would be expected i e a unit slope at early time streltsova 1988 likely due to the changing length of test section and flow rate throughout the course of a given installation nonetheless it is assumed to be occurring and is included in the moench 1997 solution each liner installation was modelled as an injection test where water from within the borehole is forced outward into the aquifer as the liner descends downhole the start of each liner installation test injection was assumed to be the time at which the borehole liner reaches the water table in making this assumption the dissipation of air pressure through fractures in the unsaturated zone while the liner is above the water table is believed to have a negligible influence on the other boreholes within the cluster variable discharge rates occurring throughout each test i e the volumetric flow rate q m3 s exiting the source hole between subsequent time steps were determined by multiplying the liner s descent velocity by the open hole s horizontal cross sectional area persaud 2017 keller et al 2013 the time required for a liner to be fully installed at this site ranged from 0 5 to 4 days per hole depending on whether the bottom of the borehole was transmissive or not as a result liner installations were conducted concurrently i e another installation was typically started while the previous installation was still being finished with the rationale of maximizing time efficiency possible interference between installations was ignored given the low discharge rates 10 6 10 5 m3 s typically occurring from the initial installation at these times of test overlap 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural trends as a first step to analyzing the liner installation tests atv identified fractures were examined to develop an understanding of the structural patterns at the site that may be relevant to the generated hydraulic response data contoured stereographic projections of terzaghi corrected fracture data suggest the presence of four main fracture sets table 1 at the research site which are observed to be relatively consistent regardless of borehole orientation fig 3 the most dominant of these fracture sets with regards to prevalence is sh1 sub horizontal ne sw striking which accounts for approximately 50 of the grouped fractures from both the inclined and vertical boreholes note that while categorized here as a sub horizontal fracture set the degree of dip is not small the fracture set data presented here is used in the following section to assess a possible relationship between fractures identified in each liner installation test and dominant fracture orientations 3 2 fracture network conceptualization 3 2 1 flow processes flute transmissivity profiling keller et al 2013 uses profiles of liner velocity during descent to detect permeable fracture features encountered in the hole being lined under the assumption of a constant driving head changes in velocity are attributed to the sealing of conductive features within a low porosity matrix where the precise location of transmissive zones is dependent on the intervals of recorded time ultimately this single hole testing approach proposes a method for identifying total borehole transmissivity and possible depth assigned transmissivity with flow examined radially outward from the source well alone in contrast the presented approach emphasizes fracture connectivity and hydraulic properties between the hole being lined and an observation well as a result of this focus liner descent data were collected at a much coarser resolution relative to that implemented in keller et al 2013 for single borehole profiling and accordingly an alternative approach for examining these data must be proposed to determine whether possible fracture connections between the source and observation wells in each liner installation test can be identified the shapes of individual hydraulic response curves were examined observation well pressure response data collected at a frequency of one reading per second provides a means for identifying the location of potentially connected fractures assuming a near instantaneous response to the sealing of a permeable source well fracture feature it was recognized that a peak in observation well pressure response generally occurs nearly simultaneous with the time at which the liner is descending through a high transmissivity zone in the source well while troughs in pressure response are associated with the time at which the liner descends through a low transmissivity zone fig 4 furthermore there appears to be a direct coincidence between the time at which there are peaks in liner descent velocity and observation well pressure response during an installation it is suspected that a peak in observation well pressure response occurs as a high transmissivity zone or fracture feature in the source hole is sealed by the descending liner causing both the liner descent velocity and observation well pressure response to decline ensuing troughs in observation well pressure response coinciding with low source hole transmissivity are suspected to represent the redirection of flow to more transmissive features lower in the hole causing an increase in observation well pressure note that there is a slight time lag in these response fluctuations as a function of distance from the source well which is typical of pulse interference tests there is also a difference in behavior exhibited by kf3 whose diffuse response suggests that it may intersect a less permeable fracture zone relative to the remaining observation wells see further discussion in persaud 2017 the proposed correlations between observation well pressure response source well transmissivity and liner descent velocity suggest that during liner installation flow out of the source hole generally occurs in the region immediately below the descending liner which is in contrast with the previous assumption that steady flow is occurring in all permeable features along the length of remaining open borehole keller et al 2013 this indicates that it should be possible to target fractures that represent dominant flow paths out of the source hole based on the timing of observation well pressure fluctuations at distinct depths of liner installation in the source well it should be noted that the observed open well hydraulic response data indicates that there is one or more fractures in the source well that are hydraulically connected to the observation well at some location but does not reveal where specifically that connection exists therefore while these dominant flow paths out of the source hole may be interpreted to represent a probable connection between boreholes that connection may or may not be direct given the likelihood for fracture intersections and redirection of flow 3 2 2 fracture correlations identification of significant fractures controlling flow out of the source hole was accomplished by first matching the downhole position of the liner during installation with associated peaks in the observed pressure response s atv images from the source hole were then used to identify prominent fractures at these particular depths as an example the location of source hole fracture picks plotted as a function of liner depth underlie observation well pressure response profiles for the kf2 liner installation test in fig 4 the depth of targeted source hole fractures sealed by the descending liner does not always coincide perfectly with the timing of an associated pressure response peak this may be reflective of the aquifer s behavior however in this particular study it is more likely attributed to inaccuracies in liner descent data downhole position with time note that the selection of peaks in observation well pressure response is a somewhat subjective process assuming continuous connecting planes between the source hole and observation well suspected beginnings of preferential flow paths out the source well were correlated to the respective observation boreholes used for each test under open hole conditions vertical flow associated with hydraulic cross connection between fractures may mask many active flowing fractures pehme et al 2010 so the analysis of fractures envisioned to be dominant conduits across open boreholes is associated with some bias nonetheless the targeted source hole fractures indicate a potential starting point for fluid flow outward from the source hole in the absence of an existing fracture network interpretation this information is valuable for establishing an initial possible scenario that is simply informed by downhole liner position during installation and co occurrence of observation well pressure response through time for fracture correlations between two vertical boreholes a visual correlation approach was completed using the cross section functionality available in wellcad in this manner potential fracture surfaces were identified manually between two appropriately scaled and oriented borehole structure logs however for fracture correlations between an inclined and vertical borehole a mathematical approach was necessary to account for the greater spatial complexity associated with an inclined borehole s path this mathematical approach involved determining the intersection point between the targeted fracture plane and borehole line provided that the depth of intersection exists along the observation borehole length a potential match to the source hole fracture was sought from the atv structure data intersection points of a given fracture at the source well and observation well s were used to calculate a linear plane of best fit for each fracture surface steps involved in the fracture identification and correlation process are illustrated in fig 5 see persaud 2017 for more details fig 6 shows the results of the completed fracture correlations which are constrained to the tested well combinations where only two intersection points are available a line is used to show the suspect connection rather than a plane the fracture surface functions created for visualization purposes are centered on the source well of each respective test and have been solved arbitrarily over 5 m in the y direction n s given that the exact extent of each fracture plane across the site unknown nonetheless nine of the 28 source hole fractures correlated in the presented analysis are suspected to represent two dominant fracture planes targeted in nearly all tests as a dominant flow path and are believed to intersect all boreholes fig 6 3 2 3 comparison to site structural trends the identified source hole flow paths were plotted in stereonet form fig 7 to identify a possible relationship between these targeted fracture features and the four major fracture sets identified at the site table 1 it is evident that the correlated fractures are predominantly parallel to sh1 ne sw striking this fracture set is suspected to represent fracturing along regionally observed foliation planes hewitt 1961 and is most likely associated with glacial unloading which is commonly observed in crystalline bedrock environments stauffer and gendzwill 1987 holzhausen 1989 karasaki et al 2000 sukhija et al 2006 gleeson and novakowski 2009 while fractures belonging to sh1 are likely to represent the most conductive flow paths potential underrepresentation of sub vertical fracture connections especially via fracture intersections should be noted discrete sub horizontal fractures are more readily recognized and intersected than high angle fractures in the presented analysis using predominantly vertical boreholes while the completed fracture correlation process has allowed for the development of a fracture network conceptual model for each completed liner installation test there are a number of uncertainties associated with targeting fractures based on observation well pressure response with long open intervals the observed pressure response during a given liner installation is generally dissipated with increasing distance from the source well and as a result the greater the separation distance the less certain the type and number of fracture connections it is also difficult to know with absolute confidence if a distinct peak in an observed pressure response indicates the sealing of a single fracture feature especially in the case of numerous closely spaced fractures high angle fractures further complicate the ability to target dominant features given the greater time span that may be involved in sealing such fractures furthermore while not an issue in the crystalline rock of the canadian shield the ability to infer fracture features may be confounded by zones of significant rock matrix permeability along a length of continuous bedding in sedimentary rock moreover the fracture correlation process in itself is associated with challenges related to spatial and vertical scaling issues errors in interpreting fracture orientation and depth from atv data differences in atv image quality and inherent fracture aperture and surface variability differences in fracture orientation between the targeted source hole feature and the correlated observation hole feature average approximately 18 8 3 7 for fracture strike and 9 1 1 4 for dip in order to confirm the inferred fracture connections comparative data are needed specifically pulse interference tests with isolated test sections could be used to target specific fracture features e g stephenson et al 2006 and would also allow for the assessment of response differences between low angle versus high angle fracture features and fractures of varying aperture uncertainties associated with the use of atv image logs for fracture identification should also be acknowledged it remains uncertain whether a fracture that appears dominant in an atv log actually conducts flow under ambient conditions in the presented testing approach flow is examined under forced gradient conditions and is therefore observed where it may not naturally exist the number of fractures actually conducting and controlling flow on site under natural gradient conditions is likely to be less than those identified in the atv analysis in the future als logging pehme et al 2007 2010 2013 could be used to verify the location of fractures most important to ambient flow 3 3 hydraulic parameter estimation the moench 1997 solution was applied to each observation well using interactive curve fitting in contrast to typical pumping test analysis emphasis was placed on fitting type curves to intermediate time data this time interval generally ranging between 100 and 1000 s was found to be most favorable for achieving a good fit and suggests that within this frame of data there exists an optimal balance between the assumption of a constant test section length and the heterogeneity of fractures in the remaining length of open borehole that are available for flow transmittance between the source and observation well in question under normal pumping test conditions early time data are strongly affected by changing fluid path lines as the cone of hydraulic response evolves and as a result the need for curve fitting that is constrained by late time stabilized data is typically emphasized as a critical factor for parameter estimation particularly where observation wells are located at a great distance from the source well meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 osiensky et al 2000 however in the completed liner installation tests fluid path lines are expected to change continuously as fractures in the source well are sealed and the flow field readjusts making this an unavoidable process fortunately observation wells are in close proximity to the source hole of each test relatively large values of t r2 are observed creating the potential for obtaining representative transmissivity values at an inter well scale in the absence of unstable late time data the best fit moench 1997 solution generally captures gross features in the observed pressure responses for each liner installation test fig 8 goodness of fit was assessed both qualitatively and through the calculation of fit statistics displayed in fig 8 where it was sought to minimize the difference between measured and modelled head values however estimated values of transmissivity and aquifer storage were found to be non unique an issue which is not uncommon in cross hole testing e g paillet 1998 stephenson and novakowski 2006 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 transmissivity estimates for the borehole pairs examined in each liner installation test are presented in table 2 which includes the geometric mean of all installations 2 2 10 4 m2 s this value of transmissivity which considers potential fracture network heterogeneity in the examined formation provides a bulk estimate of transmissivity for the entire site total storativity between the examined borehole pairs was estimated to range between 4 1 10 5 and 3 4 10 3 table 3 these values roughly approximate specific yield given the low specific storage in an unconfined setting and are found within the wide range of values reported for fractured crystalline rock formations e g milloy 2007 levison and novakowski 2012 chesnaux 2013 miles and novakowski 2016 a more favorable model fit is often found for observation wells that are located farther from the source well in a given liner installation test this suggests some presence of scale effects in the completed testing methodology where at a greater distance from the source i e greater volume of aquifer sampled there is perhaps an averaging of aquifer anisotropy alternatively it is simply possible that the changing length of injection interval at the source well has less of an effect on more distant observation wells 3 4 comparison to previous hydraulic testing pulse interference and pumping tests completed by elmhirst 2011 and elmhirst and novakowski 2012 have been used for comparison to the liner installation test completed in kf2 with a focus on observations in kf3 and kf4 at the time of the referenced studies only the three original boreholes kf2 kf3 and kf4 existed at the site the compared pulse interference and pumping tests were completed under open borehole conditions at both the source and observation wells for the pulse interference tests a solid weighted cylinder was used to apply a slug condition at the source well generating an initial displacement of typically 0 7 m with peak interference responses observed to range between 20 and 100 mm depending on the source and observation well pairs elmhirst 2011 in comparison the completed liner installation tests feature peak pressure responses for the kf2 kf3 kf2 kf4 and kf3 kf4 well pairs ranging between 20 and 330 mm eight pulse interference tests were completed between both kf2 kf3 and kf2 kf4 for the pumping tests two 48 h constant discharge tests were conducted with pumping in kf2 and measurements in kf2 kf3 and kf4 in making this comparison between hydraulic testing methods differences in source well conditions should be noted open hole in the pulse interference and pumping tests and isolated interval decreasing with time in the liner installation tests general variability between testing results may also be an artefact of the analytical solutions used for analysis the pulse interference tests were analyzed using a double porosity approach elmhirst and novakowski 2012 while both the pumping tests and liner installation tests were analyzed using an epm approach moench 1997 however regardless of the chosen analytical solution it should be reiterated that in the case of the liner installation tests existing analytical solutions are inadequate for simulating the changing length of test section that occurs throughout the borehole lining process despite the aforementioned comparison limitations transmissivity estimates from the liner installation tests differ by less than an order of magnitude from the pulse interference and pumping tests for each examined well pair fig 9 in comparison greater discrepancy is observed when comparing the estimated values of specific yield between each testing approach fig 9 the liner installation test results for the inter well regions between kf2 kf3 and kf2 kf4 overestimate specific yield relative to both the pumping test and pulse interference test results it may be possible that the continuously changing flow paths throughout a liner installation test facilitate greater sampling of the formation s fracture porosity rather than just the preferential flow paths that may be sampled in an entirely open hole test which is assumed to largely represent the specific yield in a low permeability matrix setting it should also be noted that when independently fitting both specific storage and specific yield there is likely to be some non uniqueness in the simulation the liner installation test transmissivity and specific yield estimates preserve relative magnitude differences between the two inter well regions that are observed in the other hydraulic testing results i e a greater specific yield and lower transmissivity is estimated for kf2 kf3 with a lower specific yield and greater transmissivity estimated for kf2 kf4 the small formation volume sampled between kf2 and kf4 is assumed to be greatly fractured and conductive relative to the portion of the formation between kf2 and kf3 where highly transmissive fractures are sampled it is anticipated that the water released from storage will come predominantly from these features therefore reducing the formation volume that is contributing flow thus tests that produce the highest transmissivity estimates should also produce lower storage estimates elmhirst 2011 despite a small sample size of hydraulic parameter estimates available for comparison it is proposed that the pulse interference response generated during a borehole liner installation has potential value to be further advanced and developed as a form of cross hole testing the moench 1997 solution provides a reasonable approximation of inter well transmissivity and storativity and can be used to generally assess relative permeability differences between boreholes with the exception of possible non uniqueness effects however in order to apply this testing approach as a robust alternative or complementary cross hole testing method in fractured crystalline bedrock development of an improved analytical solution and or exploration of a numerical modelling approach is warranted for example as has been completed for the interpretation of cross borehole flow experiments e g paillet 1998 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 4 conclusions liner installations have been presented as a method of convenient data collection to assess cross hole fracture connectivity in crystalline bedrock boreholes hydraulic pressure responses observed during the installation of six borehole liners at the examined field site have depicted a new interpretation of flow processes occurring during downhole liner descent this understanding has been used to develop a possible conceptual model for dominant fracture connections between source and observation wells that is informed by the observed open hole pressure responses to individual liner installations to confirm these interpretations and advance the fracture network conceptual model further improvements to the executed field techniques are needed including better control on the progress of liner descent i e higher resolution record of liner depth during installation as well as pressure monitoring below the descending liner to properly assess the suspected flow and pressure distribution in the remaining length of open borehole testing in other bedrock environments particularly those with greater matrix porosity or with fewer fractures as well as comparative data collection e g from isolated pulse interference tests and als logging among other tests will reveal the full potential for this method and validate the suggested analysis and interpretation approach application of the moench 1997 solution reveals the potential for modelling the pulse interference response generated during borehole liner installations to generally approximate inter well transmissivity and storativity however this solution is unable to account for the changing length of open borehole as a liner is installed and issues with non unique curve fitting were experienced when estimating hydraulic parameters for the examined borehole pairs it is recommended that future studies make use of a new analytical solution or numerical

7552,in order to continually improve the current understanding of flow and transport in crystalline bedrock environments developing and improving fracture system characterization techniques is an important area of study the presented research examines the installation of flexible impermeable flute liners as a means for assessing cross hole fracture connectivity flute liners are used to generate a new style of hydraulic pulse with pressure response monitored in a nearby network of open boreholes drilled in gneissic rock of the canadian shield in eastern ontario canada borehole liners were installed in six existing 10 15 cm diameter boreholes located 10 35 m apart and drilled to depths ranging between 25 45 m liner installation tests were completed consecutively with the number of observation wells available for each test ranging between one and six the collected pressure response data have been analyzed to identify significant groundwater flow paths between source and observation boreholes as well as to estimate inter well transmissivity and storativity using a conventional type curve analysis while the applied solution relies on a number of general assumptions it has been found that reasonable comparison can be made to previously completed pulse interference and pumping tests results of this research indicate areas where method refinement is necessary but nonetheless highlight the potential for use in crystalline bedrock environments this method may provide value to future site characterization efforts given that it is complementary to and can be used in conjunction with other currently employed borehole liner applications such as the removal of cross connection at contaminated sites and the assessment of discrete fracture distributions when boreholes are sealed recreating natural hydraulic gradient conditions keywords crystalline bedrock borehole liners cross hole testing hydraulic testing fracture connectivity 1 introduction crystalline bedrock aquifers occur in many regions of the world and are exposed in vast areas such as the precambrian rocks of the canadian shield baltic shield and brazilian shield while wells drilled in crystalline rock may be associated with limited yield in some locations they are nonetheless important for water supply especially in many developing countries where surface water is often inadequate howard and karundu 1992 chilton and foster 1995 adekunle et al 2007 kulabako et al 2007 neves and morales 2007 holland and witthüser 2011 foster 2012 boisson et al 2015 unfortunately these aquifers can be particularly vulnerable to contamination e g kim et al 2016 vitale et al 2017 crystalline bedrock aquifers generally contain negligible matrix porosity and as a result groundwater flow is transmitted nearly exclusively through fractures within a largely impervious rock matrix although the effective porosity of these pathways is quite small in the order of 10 4 10 5 average linear groundwater velocities can be significant creating the potential for rapid contaminant transport and widespread contaminant migration allen and morrison 1973 singhal and gupta 1999 conboy and goss 2000 levison and novakowski 2009 these conditions may be enhanced by minimal matrix diffusion storage and associated solute degradation as well as rapid recharge of groundwater and associated contaminants in areas with thin overburden which is common in crystalline bedrock environments grisak and pickens 1981 gerhart 1986 bodin et al 2003 gleeson et al 2009 levison and novakowski 2012 levison et al 2012 praamsma 2016 given this inherent vulnerability characterization of crystalline bedrock aquifers to gain an enhanced understanding of groundwater flow and contaminant transport is a necessary task however fully understanding this vulnerability is complicated by inherent fracture network complexity berkowitz 2002 in crystalline bedrock environments past investigations undertaken to better understand groundwater flow and solute transport for applications including the development of nuclear waste repositories reveal the potential for highly heterogeneous fracture networks and highlight the difficulties in understanding network characteristics such as flow path length and geometry at various spatial scales e g smith et al 2001 hodgkinson et al 2009 cvetkovic and frampton 2010 henkel et al 2010 follin et al 2014 cuss et al 2015 a number of systematic characterization methods and approaches have been developed for fractured bedrock site characterization e g raven 1986

flowmeter tests and commonly used pumping tests and pulse interference tests e g gernand and heidtman 1997 paillet 1998 andersson et al 2004 nakao et al 2005 stephenson et al 2006 worley 2012 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 in fractured bedrock environments extraction or injection stimulus in a pumping test can be associated with significant fluid displacement given minimal effective porosity this may be undesirable at a contaminated site given the additional costs associated with water storage and treatment following fluid removal furthermore long duration pumping tests are often influenced by external boundary conditions raven 1986 that may confound results where inter well formation properties are of greatest interest pulse interference tests serve as a potential alternative to pumping tests e g novakowski 1989 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 these tests involve monitoring the response in one or more observation wells to a change in head in a source well the high diffusivity of fractured bedrock enables the generation of a detectable pressure perturbation over greater distances than that which could be observed in porous media novakowski 1989 the source of this perturbation may take the form of a slug sageev 1986 novakowski 1989 or a sequence of flow rate changes mckinley et al 1968 as is commonly applied in the oil and gas industry pulse interference tests may be completed under open hole conditions or with isolated test sections he et al 2006 illman and tartakovsky 2006 stephenson et al 2006 cheng et al 2009 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 the isolated form of a pulse interference test is generally more desirable than open hole testing because it allows for the examination of targeted vertical borehole intervals and or discrete fractures however this testing approach is both time and resource demanding given the potential drawbacks associated with both pumping tests and pulse interference tests benefits stand to be gained from the exploration of novel cross hole testing methods in this study we examine a unique hydraulic pulse generated by the downhole installation of flute blank liners as a new method of cross hole hydraulic testing flute liners are impermeable urethane coated nylon fabric sleeves closed at the bottom end designed by flexible liner underground technologies llc with the original purpose of providing a complete seal along the borehole wall keller et al 2013 accordingly these liners can be used at contaminated sites to seal boreholes immediately after they are drilled to prevent hydraulic cross connection between fractures intersected by the borehole e g parker et al 2012 meyer et al 2014 flute liners are also currently used to facilitate the identification of hydraulically active fractures using temperature pehme et al 2007 2010 2013 and may also be used to create temporary sensor deployments for the design of multi level systems pehme et al 2014 during the installation of a liner water is forced outward from the borehole into the surrounding aquifer the generated hydraulic pulse can be considered a form of progressive large scale slug test where the rate of liner descent and discharge of water exiting the source well is dependent on the transmissivity of the remaining open borehole interval and fracture intersections cherry et al 2007 keller et al 2013 as the liner descends progressively deeper fractures are cut off from flow generating a pulse that should be detectable in surrounding observation holes through measurements of liner descent velocity and driving head flute transmissivity profiling keller et al 2013 can be used to identify the location of permeable fracture features along the borehole wall as well as estimate the transmissivity of these features this profiling method is an efficient approach for examining a borehole s transmissivity distribution especially when used in combination with short interval straddle packer testing quinn et al 2015 however the procedure is still under refinement and is limited to the scale of a single borehole to date analysis of the potential pulse interference component has not been conducted the objective of this study is to investigate the use of liner installations to assess cross hole fracture connectivity and inter well hydraulic properties and to do so in a manner that is complementary to and can be used in conjunction with other currently employed borehole liner applications the proposed method takes advantage of a pre existing hydrogeological tool to generate a new style of hydraulic pulse we hypothesize that pressure responses generated during liner installation can be used to identify hydraulic connections between boreholes furthermore the pressure responses generated during installation can be analyzed with type curve fitting methods used in pumping test analysis to approximate values of transmissivity and storativity for the inter well connections examined this method may be valuable in future characterization of crystalline bedrock aquifers by providing a means of cross hole data collection that is rapid convenient and relatively inexpensive knowledge gained from this approach regarding fracture connectivity and hydraulic parameters across a given site has potential to guide wellhead protection studies and groundwater remediation strategies 2 methods six borehole liner installation tests were conducted at a fractured bedrock field site in eastern ontario canada the following section describes the research site and past aquifer characterization activities and also presents the applied methodology for site structural analysis liner installation testing and analysis of the collected pressure response data 2 1 site description and characterization field investigations were completed during 2015 2016 at a research site located near tamworth ontario canada this site is underlain by precambrian bedrock of the canadian shield below less than 1 5 m of sandy loam overburden dillon consulting ltd 2004 gao et al 2006 bedrock in this area consists predominantly of heterogeneous thinly layered metasedimentary gneissic rocks of the grenville supergroup easton 1992 ontario geological survey 2011 the surface topography is flat lying the site has a cluster of eight bedrock boreholes fig 1 which were drilled over the period of 2009 2015 the cluster includes seven vertical boreholes and one inclined borehole which range in diameter and depth from 10 to 15 cm and 25 to 45 m respectively radial distances between boreholes span 10 35 m these boreholes were drilled using percussion kf2 kf3 kf4 kf5 and kf9 and hq triple tube kf6 kf7 and kf8 methods with the exception of kf5 which was converted into a set of nested piezometers all boreholes on site are cased to a shallow depth through the overburden approximately 1 3 mbgs and remain open through the bedrock kf5 has three isolated monitoring intervals kf5 upper 10 7 mbgs middle 15 5 20 2 mbgs and lower 25 3 38 2 mbgs these monitoring intervals consist of slotted 51 mm pvc pipe and are backfilled with sand separated by bentonite confining layers the water table at the cluster varies seasonally between approximately 0 5 3 5 mbgs transmissive zones in all boreholes at the site have been identified using constant head injection tests completed in a contiguous manner along the entire length of each hole with straddle packer systems spanning interval lengths of approximately 2 2 4 m elmhirst 2011 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 boreholes kf2 kf3 and kf4 and the connections between these were also examined using a number of pulse interference tests slug tests and pumping tests elmhirst 2011 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 in the present study a suite of borehole geophysics and hydro geophysical testing was completed within all boreholes including profiles of formation conductivity natural gamma acoustic televiewer atv and full waveform sonic fws as well as open hole temperature and active line source als testing pehme et al 2013 in lined boreholes 2 2 structural analysis detailed structural interpretation of the atv logs collected from each borehole was completed using wellcad software advanced logic technology version 5 1 through the interactive selection of individual fractures information regarding fracture depth dip direction aperture and structure class i e degree of openness and continuity across the downhole image log were recorded fracture picks were selected as consistently as possible between logs despite differences in image resolution resulting from drilling percussion drilled versus cored boreholes there is an inherent bias in the orientation of fracture features that will be intersected by a one dimensional survey for example vertical boreholes are certain to sample horizontal and sub horizontal features and have a progressively lower probability of intersecting high angle or vertical features in order to account for this bias identified and analyzed in terzaghi 1965 and to generate a more representative fracture distribution the following weighting factor w was applied to each discontinuity priest 1985 priest 1993 1 w 1 cos δ where δ is the acute angle between the fracture normal and the sampling line i e borehole axis as δ approaches 90 representing a fracture that is parallel to the borehole axis the weighting factor will approach infinity creating unrealistic representations of the fracture network consequently a maximum weighting factor of 7 was applied in the present analysis which represents a δ of approximately 81 8 e g priest 1993 jones et al 1999 buoro et al 2009 zetterlund et al 2012 it should be noted that this creates a blind zone in the fracture distribution where the data set is limited by the orientation of the borehole and where correction of this sampling bias is restricted using the corrected fracture data lower hemisphere equal area stereographic projections contoured using the 1 area method were used to visually identify fracture pole clusters representative of sets of parallel subparallel fractures in this study fracture data from atv image logs are integral in the interpretation of each liner installation test and for this reason fracture mapping data from ground surface outcrops have been excluded for the sake of coherency it should be noted that atv data can be associated with a number of shortcomings which are discussed further in section 3 2 3 flute liner installations flute blank liners were installed in kf2 kf3 kf4 kf6 kf8 and kf9 in the fall of 2015 using the eversion process discussed in cherry et al 2007 and keller et al 2013 installation begins with the liner inside out on a spool the open end of which is attached to the top of the well casing a small portion of the liner is then everted and forced down the borehole by hand through the addition of water to the inside annulus of the liner a driving head is created above the original blended head of the hole where the blended head reflects the combined influence of all transmissive regions along the borehole length the rate at which water is added to the liner is controlled to maintain an approximately constant level i e a constant applied head differential between the inside of the liner and the formation this allows the liner to descend into the hole and forces water from within the borehole into the surrounding formation in doing so a continuous seal is created along the length of the borehole the velocity at which the liner moves downhole is proportional to the transmissivity of the remaining length of open borehole below the descending liner keller et al 2013 boreholes were lined in the following order kf2 kf3 kf4 kf9 kf8 and lastly kf6 fig 1 where each liner installation is treated as a separate test in the adjacent network of open boreholes a combination of solinst leveloggers and van essen micro divers installed approximately 1 m below the surface of the water table were used to monitor fluctuations in pressure resulting from hydraulic pulses generated during each liner installation for ease of presentation a single value of observed pressure response was selected from the system of nested piezometers at kf5 for each liner installation test specifically the interval with the greatest observed pressure response ignoring vertical flow components evident through consideration of all monitoring intervals this is based on previously completed constant head injection testing in kf5 elmhirst 2011 which reveals that the lower half of kf5 has negligible transmissivity below testing limit accordingly the pressure response observed in the lowest interval of kf5 is consistently less than logger accuracy therefore placing emphasis on the pressure response observed in either the upper or middle interval of kf5 is deemed reasonable in the upper and middle zones of kf5 no apparent differences in timing of response were observed however the magnitude of peak response and the differences in peak response between these two monitoring points vary among tests flute liners are custom manufactured according to the specifications of the borehole for which they are to be installed e g length diameter stickup height the inside of the liner and the tether extending from the liner base to the top of casing is marked with eversion points ep s every 10 ft 3 0 m of liner descent to indicate the downhole position of the bottom of the liner during installation the progress of liner descent during installation in each hole was monitored manually based on these ep marks to create a coarse record of liner position versus time despite having a relatively low resolution 10 ft ep markings often represent a reasonable interval for data recording especially at the beginning of a liner installation when fractures with significant transmissivity remain open and rapid liner descent may be experienced observed to be as fast as 0 1 m s 2 4 analysis of observation well data from a qualitative perspective the magnitude and timing of variations in observation well pressure response to liner decent were used to examine flow within the borehole cluster and more specifically identify potential fracture connections between boreholes however there is currently no available quantitative analytical solution to accurately model the exact unique conditions created by the installation of a borehole liner as an input pulse a fundamental complication of the liner installation test method is that the injection interval is continuously changing throughout the course of a test the process of which is illustrated in fig 2 in recognizing that there is no existing analytical solution available to simulate a transient change in the length of tested interval at a measured rate this condition was not considered in the analysis the maximum open source hole length from the bottom of the casing to the bottom of the borehole is assumed to represent the length of the tested interval in each test i e the full length of the borehole is treated as constantly open the pressure pulse due to the liner descent is therefore assumed to be felt along the full borehole interval where the entire borehole water column represents a slug source forced into the formation across the complete borehole length given that this method of analysis does not accommodate the sealing of source hole flow paths as a liner is installed only the response of the most transmissive flow path at a given time step is measured in terms of the determined cross hole transmissivity similarly the reduction in well to well transmissivity that occurs as a transmissive fracture in the source hole is sealed is not accounted for the pressure response detected in adjacent observation wells for a given liner installation was modelled analytically using the moench 1997 solution this solution is a porous media model that has been applied herein to a heterogeneous fractured rock setting by assuming an equivalent porous media epm for the examined volume of aquifer it is recognized that in using this approach the accuracy of parameter estimates may be less reliable where few large fractures dominate the flow network e g muldoon and bradbury 2005 gellasch et al 2013 the moench 1997 solution enables the estimation of transmissivity and storativity between wells that may be fully or partially penetrating in a homogeneous anisotropic unconfined aquifer the principle of superposition in time is used to simulate variable rate tests whereby the variable rate is treated as a sequence of steps the unconfined moench 1997 solution accommodates water table fluctuation in response to a source well perturbation and incorporates the potential for delayed water table response in the observation wells in applying this solution it is assumed that the aquifer has infinite areal extent and uniform thickness the potentiometric surface is initially horizontal before each liner installation test and flow is unsteady fractured bedrock settings typically have low storativity and as a result wellbore storage effects may be substantial given that the volume of water stored in a large diameter well may be much larger than the volume of water moving within the formation novakowski 1990 wellbore storage is likely to affect the timing and amplitude of response in open observation wells during a liner installation test and it is recognized that by not accounting for this process transmissivity may be underestimated and storativity overestimated moench 1997 novakowski 1989 prats and scott 1975 wellbore storage will not manifest in the source well during liner descent as there is no free water surface wellbore storage did not manifest in the pressure response at the observation wells as would be expected i e a unit slope at early time streltsova 1988 likely due to the changing length of test section and flow rate throughout the course of a given installation nonetheless it is assumed to be occurring and is included in the moench 1997 solution each liner installation was modelled as an injection test where water from within the borehole is forced outward into the aquifer as the liner descends downhole the start of each liner installation test injection was assumed to be the time at which the borehole liner reaches the water table in making this assumption the dissipation of air pressure through fractures in the unsaturated zone while the liner is above the water table is believed to have a negligible influence on the other boreholes within the cluster variable discharge rates occurring throughout each test i e the volumetric flow rate q m3 s exiting the source hole between subsequent time steps were determined by multiplying the liner s descent velocity by the open hole s horizontal cross sectional area persaud 2017 keller et al 2013 the time required for a liner to be fully installed at this site ranged from 0 5 to 4 days per hole depending on whether the bottom of the borehole was transmissive or not as a result liner installations were conducted concurrently i e another installation was typically started while the previous installation was still being finished with the rationale of maximizing time efficiency possible interference between installations was ignored given the low discharge rates 10 6 10 5 m3 s typically occurring from the initial installation at these times of test overlap 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural trends as a first step to analyzing the liner installation tests atv identified fractures were examined to develop an understanding of the structural patterns at the site that may be relevant to the generated hydraulic response data contoured stereographic projections of terzaghi corrected fracture data suggest the presence of four main fracture sets table 1 at the research site which are observed to be relatively consistent regardless of borehole orientation fig 3 the most dominant of these fracture sets with regards to prevalence is sh1 sub horizontal ne sw striking which accounts for approximately 50 of the grouped fractures from both the inclined and vertical boreholes note that while categorized here as a sub horizontal fracture set the degree of dip is not small the fracture set data presented here is used in the following section to assess a possible relationship between fractures identified in each liner installation test and dominant fracture orientations 3 2 fracture network conceptualization 3 2 1 flow processes flute transmissivity profiling keller et al 2013 uses profiles of liner velocity during descent to detect permeable fracture features encountered in the hole being lined under the assumption of a constant driving head changes in velocity are attributed to the sealing of conductive features within a low porosity matrix where the precise location of transmissive zones is dependent on the intervals of recorded time ultimately this single hole testing approach proposes a method for identifying total borehole transmissivity and possible depth assigned transmissivity with flow examined radially outward from the source well alone in contrast the presented approach emphasizes fracture connectivity and hydraulic properties between the hole being lined and an observation well as a result of this focus liner descent data were collected at a much coarser resolution relative to that implemented in keller et al 2013 for single borehole profiling and accordingly an alternative approach for examining these data must be proposed to determine whether possible fracture connections between the source and observation wells in each liner installation test can be identified the shapes of individual hydraulic response curves were examined observation well pressure response data collected at a frequency of one reading per second provides a means for identifying the location of potentially connected fractures assuming a near instantaneous response to the sealing of a permeable source well fracture feature it was recognized that a peak in observation well pressure response generally occurs nearly simultaneous with the time at which the liner is descending through a high transmissivity zone in the source well while troughs in pressure response are associated with the time at which the liner descends through a low transmissivity zone fig 4 furthermore there appears to be a direct coincidence between the time at which there are peaks in liner descent velocity and observation well pressure response during an installation it is suspected that a peak in observation well pressure response occurs as a high transmissivity zone or fracture feature in the source hole is sealed by the descending liner causing both the liner descent velocity and observation well pressure response to decline ensuing troughs in observation well pressure response coinciding with low source hole transmissivity are suspected to represent the redirection of flow to more transmissive features lower in the hole causing an increase in observation well pressure note that there is a slight time lag in these response fluctuations as a function of distance from the source well which is typical of pulse interference tests there is also a difference in behavior exhibited by kf3 whose diffuse response suggests that it may intersect a less permeable fracture zone relative to the remaining observation wells see further discussion in persaud 2017 the proposed correlations between observation well pressure response source well transmissivity and liner descent velocity suggest that during liner installation flow out of the source hole generally occurs in the region immediately below the descending liner which is in contrast with the previous assumption that steady flow is occurring in all permeable features along the length of remaining open borehole keller et al 2013 this indicates that it should be possible to target fractures that represent dominant flow paths out of the source hole based on the timing of observation well pressure fluctuations at distinct depths of liner installation in the source well it should be noted that the observed open well hydraulic response data indicates that there is one or more fractures in the source well that are hydraulically connected to the observation well at some location but does not reveal where specifically that connection exists therefore while these dominant flow paths out of the source hole may be interpreted to represent a probable connection between boreholes that connection may or may not be direct given the likelihood for fracture intersections and redirection of flow 3 2 2 fracture correlations identification of significant fractures controlling flow out of the source hole was accomplished by first matching the downhole position of the liner during installation with associated peaks in the observed pressure response s atv images from the source hole were then used to identify prominent fractures at these particular depths as an example the location of source hole fracture picks plotted as a function of liner depth underlie observation well pressure response profiles for the kf2 liner installation test in fig 4 the depth of targeted source hole fractures sealed by the descending liner does not always coincide perfectly with the timing of an associated pressure response peak this may be reflective of the aquifer s behavior however in this particular study it is more likely attributed to inaccuracies in liner descent data downhole position with time note that the selection of peaks in observation well pressure response is a somewhat subjective process assuming continuous connecting planes between the source hole and observation well suspected beginnings of preferential flow paths out the source well were correlated to the respective observation boreholes used for each test under open hole conditions vertical flow associated with hydraulic cross connection between fractures may mask many active flowing fractures pehme et al 2010 so the analysis of fractures envisioned to be dominant conduits across open boreholes is associated with some bias nonetheless the targeted source hole fractures indicate a potential starting point for fluid flow outward from the source hole in the absence of an existing fracture network interpretation this information is valuable for establishing an initial possible scenario that is simply informed by downhole liner position during installation and co occurrence of observation well pressure response through time for fracture correlations between two vertical boreholes a visual correlation approach was completed using the cross section functionality available in wellcad in this manner potential fracture surfaces were identified manually between two appropriately scaled and oriented borehole structure logs however for fracture correlations between an inclined and vertical borehole a mathematical approach was necessary to account for the greater spatial complexity associated with an inclined borehole s path this mathematical approach involved determining the intersection point between the targeted fracture plane and borehole line provided that the depth of intersection exists along the observation borehole length a potential match to the source hole fracture was sought from the atv structure data intersection points of a given fracture at the source well and observation well s were used to calculate a linear plane of best fit for each fracture surface steps involved in the fracture identification and correlation process are illustrated in fig 5 see persaud 2017 for more details fig 6 shows the results of the completed fracture correlations which are constrained to the tested well combinations where only two intersection points are available a line is used to show the suspect connection rather than a plane the fracture surface functions created for visualization purposes are centered on the source well of each respective test and have been solved arbitrarily over 5 m in the y direction n s given that the exact extent of each fracture plane across the site unknown nonetheless nine of the 28 source hole fractures correlated in the presented analysis are suspected to represent two dominant fracture planes targeted in nearly all tests as a dominant flow path and are believed to intersect all boreholes fig 6 3 2 3 comparison to site structural trends the identified source hole flow paths were plotted in stereonet form fig 7 to identify a possible relationship between these targeted fracture features and the four major fracture sets identified at the site table 1 it is evident that the correlated fractures are predominantly parallel to sh1 ne sw striking this fracture set is suspected to represent fracturing along regionally observed foliation planes hewitt 1961 and is most likely associated with glacial unloading which is commonly observed in crystalline bedrock environments stauffer and gendzwill 1987 holzhausen 1989 karasaki et al 2000 sukhija et al 2006 gleeson and novakowski 2009 while fractures belonging to sh1 are likely to represent the most conductive flow paths potential underrepresentation of sub vertical fracture connections especially via fracture intersections should be noted discrete sub horizontal fractures are more readily recognized and intersected than high angle fractures in the presented analysis using predominantly vertical boreholes while the completed fracture correlation process has allowed for the development of a fracture network conceptual model for each completed liner installation test there are a number of uncertainties associated with targeting fractures based on observation well pressure response with long open intervals the observed pressure response during a given liner installation is generally dissipated with increasing distance from the source well and as a result the greater the separation distance the less certain the type and number of fracture connections it is also difficult to know with absolute confidence if a distinct peak in an observed pressure response indicates the sealing of a single fracture feature especially in the case of numerous closely spaced fractures high angle fractures further complicate the ability to target dominant features given the greater time span that may be involved in sealing such fractures furthermore while not an issue in the crystalline rock of the canadian shield the ability to infer fracture features may be confounded by zones of significant rock matrix permeability along a length of continuous bedding in sedimentary rock moreover the fracture correlation process in itself is associated with challenges related to spatial and vertical scaling issues errors in interpreting fracture orientation and depth from atv data differences in atv image quality and inherent fracture aperture and surface variability differences in fracture orientation between the targeted source hole feature and the correlated observation hole feature average approximately 18 8 3 7 for fracture strike and 9 1 1 4 for dip in order to confirm the inferred fracture connections comparative data are needed specifically pulse interference tests with isolated test sections could be used to target specific fracture features e g stephenson et al 2006 and would also allow for the assessment of response differences between low angle versus high angle fracture features and fractures of varying aperture uncertainties associated with the use of atv image logs for fracture identification should also be acknowledged it remains uncertain whether a fracture that appears dominant in an atv log actually conducts flow under ambient conditions in the presented testing approach flow is examined under forced gradient conditions and is therefore observed where it may not naturally exist the number of fractures actually conducting and controlling flow on site under natural gradient conditions is likely to be less than those identified in the atv analysis in the future als logging pehme et al 2007 2010 2013 could be used to verify the location of fractures most important to ambient flow 3 3 hydraulic parameter estimation the moench 1997 solution was applied to each observation well using interactive curve fitting in contrast to typical pumping test analysis emphasis was placed on fitting type curves to intermediate time data this time interval generally ranging between 100 and 1000 s was found to be most favorable for achieving a good fit and suggests that within this frame of data there exists an optimal balance between the assumption of a constant test section length and the heterogeneity of fractures in the remaining length of open borehole that are available for flow transmittance between the source and observation well in question under normal pumping test conditions early time data are strongly affected by changing fluid path lines as the cone of hydraulic response evolves and as a result the need for curve fitting that is constrained by late time stabilized data is typically emphasized as a critical factor for parameter estimation particularly where observation wells are located at a great distance from the source well meier et al 1998 sánchez vila et al 1999 osiensky et al 2000 however in the completed liner installation tests fluid path lines are expected to change continuously as fractures in the source well are sealed and the flow field readjusts making this an unavoidable process fortunately observation wells are in close proximity to the source hole of each test relatively large values of t r2 are observed creating the potential for obtaining representative transmissivity values at an inter well scale in the absence of unstable late time data the best fit moench 1997 solution generally captures gross features in the observed pressure responses for each liner installation test fig 8 goodness of fit was assessed both qualitatively and through the calculation of fit statistics displayed in fig 8 where it was sought to minimize the difference between measured and modelled head values however estimated values of transmissivity and aquifer storage were found to be non unique an issue which is not uncommon in cross hole testing e g paillet 1998 stephenson and novakowski 2006 elmhirst and novakowski 2012 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 transmissivity estimates for the borehole pairs examined in each liner installation test are presented in table 2 which includes the geometric mean of all installations 2 2 10 4 m2 s this value of transmissivity which considers potential fracture network heterogeneity in the examined formation provides a bulk estimate of transmissivity for the entire site total storativity between the examined borehole pairs was estimated to range between 4 1 10 5 and 3 4 10 3 table 3 these values roughly approximate specific yield given the low specific storage in an unconfined setting and are found within the wide range of values reported for fractured crystalline rock formations e g milloy 2007 levison and novakowski 2012 chesnaux 2013 miles and novakowski 2016 a more favorable model fit is often found for observation wells that are located farther from the source well in a given liner installation test this suggests some presence of scale effects in the completed testing methodology where at a greater distance from the source i e greater volume of aquifer sampled there is perhaps an averaging of aquifer anisotropy alternatively it is simply possible that the changing length of injection interval at the source well has less of an effect on more distant observation wells 3 4 comparison to previous hydraulic testing pulse interference and pumping tests completed by elmhirst 2011 and elmhirst and novakowski 2012 have been used for comparison to the liner installation test completed in kf2 with a focus on observations in kf3 and kf4 at the time of the referenced studies only the three original boreholes kf2 kf3 and kf4 existed at the site the compared pulse interference and pumping tests were completed under open borehole conditions at both the source and observation wells for the pulse interference tests a solid weighted cylinder was used to apply a slug condition at the source well generating an initial displacement of typically 0 7 m with peak interference responses observed to range between 20 and 100 mm depending on the source and observation well pairs elmhirst 2011 in comparison the completed liner installation tests feature peak pressure responses for the kf2 kf3 kf2 kf4 and kf3 kf4 well pairs ranging between 20 and 330 mm eight pulse interference tests were completed between both kf2 kf3 and kf2 kf4 for the pumping tests two 48 h constant discharge tests were conducted with pumping in kf2 and measurements in kf2 kf3 and kf4 in making this comparison between hydraulic testing methods differences in source well conditions should be noted open hole in the pulse interference and pumping tests and isolated interval decreasing with time in the liner installation tests general variability between testing results may also be an artefact of the analytical solutions used for analysis the pulse interference tests were analyzed using a double porosity approach elmhirst and novakowski 2012 while both the pumping tests and liner installation tests were analyzed using an epm approach moench 1997 however regardless of the chosen analytical solution it should be reiterated that in the case of the liner installation tests existing analytical solutions are inadequate for simulating the changing length of test section that occurs throughout the borehole lining process despite the aforementioned comparison limitations transmissivity estimates from the liner installation tests differ by less than an order of magnitude from the pulse interference and pumping tests for each examined well pair fig 9 in comparison greater discrepancy is observed when comparing the estimated values of specific yield between each testing approach fig 9 the liner installation test results for the inter well regions between kf2 kf3 and kf2 kf4 overestimate specific yield relative to both the pumping test and pulse interference test results it may be possible that the continuously changing flow paths throughout a liner installation test facilitate greater sampling of the formation s fracture porosity rather than just the preferential flow paths that may be sampled in an entirely open hole test which is assumed to largely represent the specific yield in a low permeability matrix setting it should also be noted that when independently fitting both specific storage and specific yield there is likely to be some non uniqueness in the simulation the liner installation test transmissivity and specific yield estimates preserve relative magnitude differences between the two inter well regions that are observed in the other hydraulic testing results i e a greater specific yield and lower transmissivity is estimated for kf2 kf3 with a lower specific yield and greater transmissivity estimated for kf2 kf4 the small formation volume sampled between kf2 and kf4 is assumed to be greatly fractured and conductive relative to the portion of the formation between kf2 and kf3 where highly transmissive fractures are sampled it is anticipated that the water released from storage will come predominantly from these features therefore reducing the formation volume that is contributing flow thus tests that produce the highest transmissivity estimates should also produce lower storage estimates elmhirst 2011 despite a small sample size of hydraulic parameter estimates available for comparison it is proposed that the pulse interference response generated during a borehole liner installation has potential value to be further advanced and developed as a form of cross hole testing the moench 1997 solution provides a reasonable approximation of inter well transmissivity and storativity and can be used to generally assess relative permeability differences between boreholes with the exception of possible non uniqueness effects however in order to apply this testing approach as a robust alternative or complementary cross hole testing method in fractured crystalline bedrock development of an improved analytical solution and or exploration of a numerical modelling approach is warranted for example as has been completed for the interpretation of cross borehole flow experiments e g paillet 1998 klepikova et al 2013 roubinet et al 2015 4 conclusions liner installations have been presented as a method of convenient data collection to assess cross hole fracture connectivity in crystalline bedrock boreholes hydraulic pressure responses observed during the installation of six borehole liners at the examined field site have depicted a new interpretation of flow processes occurring during downhole liner descent this understanding has been used to develop a possible conceptual model for dominant fracture connections between source and observation wells that is informed by the observed open hole pressure responses to individual liner installations to confirm these interpretations and advance the fracture network conceptual model further improvements to the executed field techniques are needed including better control on the progress of liner descent i e higher resolution record of liner depth during installation as well as pressure monitoring below the descending liner to properly assess the suspected flow and pressure distribution in the remaining length of open borehole testing in other bedrock environments particularly those with greater matrix porosity or with fewer fractures as well as comparative data collection e g from isolated pulse interference tests and als logging among other tests will reveal the full potential for this method and validate the suggested analysis and interpretation approach application of the moench 1997 solution reveals the potential for modelling the pulse interference response generated during borehole liner installations to generally approximate inter well transmissivity and storativity however this solution is unable to account for the changing length of open borehole as a liner is installed and issues with non unique curve fitting were experienced when estimating hydraulic parameters for the examined borehole pairs it is recommended that future studies make use of a new analytical solution or numerical approach designed to better simulate the unique conditions occurring during a liner installation test in order to achieve a reliable fit to the obtained pressure response data acknowledgments the

7553,elevated nitrate in shallow aquifers is common in agricultural areas and remediation requires an understanding of nitrogen n leaching at a variety of spatial scales characterization of the drivers of nitrate leaching at the mesoscale level 102 103 km2 is needed to bridge from field scale observations to the landscape scale context allowing informed water resource management decisions here we explore patterns in nitrate leaching rates across a depositional landform in the northern great plains within the upper missouri basin where the predominant land use is non irrigated small grain production and nitrate n concentrations above 10 mg l 1 are common the shallow moccasin terrace 260 km2 aquifer is bounded in vertical extent by underlying shale and is isolated from mountain front stream recharge such that aquifer recharge is dominated by infiltration of precipitation through agricultural soils this configuration presents a simple landform scale water balance that we leveraged to estimate leaching rates using groundwater nitrate concentrations and surface water discharge and quantify uncertainty using a monte carlo approach based on spatial variation in observations of groundwater nitrate concentrations a participatory research approach allowed local farmer knowledge of the landscape to be incorporated into the study design improved selection of and access to sample sites and enhanced prospects for addressing nitrate leaching through collaborative understanding of system hydrology mean landform scale nitrate n leaching rates were 11 and 18 kg ha 1 yr 1 during the 2012 2014 study for the two largest catchments draining the terrace over a standard three year crop rotation these leaching rates represent 19 31 of typical fertilizer n application rates however leaching losses are likely derived not only from fertilizer but also from soil organic n mineralization and are apparently higher during the post fallow phase of the crop rotation groundwater apparent age is relatively young 0 5 yr based on tritium helium analysis but whole aquifer turnover time calculations are an order of magnitude longer 20 23 yr suggesting changes in groundwater may lag behind changes in land management by years to decades keywords nitrate groundwater soils participatory cropping systems fallow 1 introduction an estimated sixty percent of n inputs for production of goods and services in the united states us is lost due to inefficiency where one third of these losses are routed to ground and surface water houlton et al 2013 nitrogen losses associated with low n use efficiency have thus polluted drinking water sources and compromised aquatic ecosystem integrity across the globe and n pollution is expected to increase in regions with increasing population or development spalding and exner 1993 vitousek 1994 smith 2003 diaz and rosenberg 2008 total n concentration in streams draining areas of agricultural land use are commonly six times greater than background levels dubrovsky et al 2010 such effects are particularly evident in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin marb where n flux to the gulf of mexico increased threefold in the second half of the 20th century goolsby and battaglin 2001 these n fluxes are more than 60 nitrate n which is thought to be transported to ground and surface water primarily from microbial mineralization of soil organic n son and fertilizer leached from agricultural soils goolsby et al 1999 in this study we examine causes of high nitrate no3 levels in groundwater and streams within an extensively cultivated 260 km2 26 000 ha landform in the upper missouri basin headwaters of the marb we link observations of water quality in cultivated soil ground and surface waters at this intermediate scale mesoscale 102 103 km2 to estimate nitrate leaching rates characterize the drivers of n loss and suggest implications for water resource quality management in the region despite the general understanding that mineralized son and fertilizer play an important role in generating the large nitrate loads to the marb goolsby et al 1999 there remains considerable uncertainty about the subsurface dynamics that control these fluxes understanding subsurface n processing and transport to groundwater is particularly important for mitigating surface water n loads in catchments with a high baseflow index where the majority of stream flow generation is sourced from groundwater dubrovsky et al 2010 tesoriero et al 2013 in addition groundwater nitrate levels are above the 10 mg l 1 drinking water standard ward et al 2005 in 20 of shallow domestic wells in us agricultural areas dubrovsky et al 2010 the number of wells exceeding the standard increased by 5 between 1990 and 2000 dubrovsky et al 2010 and average nitrate n in agricultural area wells has increased 1 2 mg l 1 per decade since the 1940s puckett et al 2011 these increases have led to mounting health and economic costs borne by private well owners and municipal water suppliers ward et al 2005 bauder and smith 2011 keeler and polasky 2014 nitrogen loss to ground and surface water can be characterized at a range of spatial scales each integrating different sets of transport and loss mechanisms in stream n yields of 1 to 26 kg n ha 1 yr 1 estimated for large basins 103 km2 or 105 ha within the marb represent an integration of all n sources and pathways as well as processing and loss within riparian corridors during transport goolsby et al 1999 these values are highly relevant for prioritization of efforts to manage eutrophication in the gulf of mexico but have limited utility for understanding the undoubtedly diverse mechanisms of n dynamics across the central north american continent in contrast specific soil leaching dynamics are more readily isolated at the point scale 1 m2 while leaching rates measured at this scale can range over two orders of magnitude beaudoin et al 2005 aggregation of point observations at the field scale 1 102 ha has effectively allowed estimates of leaching rates 5 to 69 kg n ha 1 yr 1 that can be tied to drivers like crop type soil character and inter annual variation in conditions beaudoin et al 2005 campbell et al 2006 john et al 2017 thus nitrate leaching rates and drivers identified at point and field scales can directly inform farm n management decisions at the same time there is no assurance that those rates and drivers are representative of landscape scale 104 ha variability conversely nitrate observations that aggregate landscape scale processes can identify water quality impairment and general sources but the heterogeneity of pathways from sources along with n losses in transit impede efforts to quantify leaching rates and isolate specific drivers kunstmann and kastens 2006 hansen et al 2007 dubrovsky et al 2010 pizzol et al 2015 the question remains how do n dynamics operating in soil at the point scale 1 m2 manifest in patterns of n fluxes observed at the spatially aggregated scale of entire agricultural catchments to address this central question we evaluated mesoscale aquifer systems defined by local geomorphic and hydrogeologic context weissmann et al 1999 hancock and anderson 2002 montgomery 2004 our study area lies within a central montana watershed with elevated and increasing nitrate concentrations in groundwater in particular we sought a simplified hydrologic system where stream flow generation is dominated by groundwater sources i e minimal infiltration excess overland flow and interflow and groundwater recharge is dominated by infiltration from overlying soils i e an aquifer with no groundwater inputs from surrounding areas we selected a 260 km2 strath terrace hosting a shallow unconfined aquifer with elevated nitrate almost exclusively managed for non irrigated cereal production miller 2013 the terrace represents a process domain montgomery 1999 with well defined boundaries and a shallow oxygenated high conductivity aquifer the system allows landscape scale estimates of leaching based on time series observations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater wells and surface water discharge q our first hypothesis was that ground and surface water chemistry is primarily controlled by the aggregate character of terrace soils draining to the sampling location because groundwater recharge is derived exclusively from local soils as a result we expected chemistry of ground and surface water to reflect chemistry of soils within a catchment we hypothesized that the physical character of this landform promotes oxygenated conditions and short residence times in the shallow aquifer resulting in minimal denitrification in groundwater we further hypothesized that high n loading and biotic activity in the riparian corridors likely result in substantial denitrification thus we expected groundwater nitrate concentrations would be similar to soil water concentrations measured in lysimeters during leaching periods but that surface water concentrations would be lower than groundwater concentrations due to losses in the riparian corridors our approach to addressing these hypotheses and the overarching research question was to characterize soil connectivity to ground and surface water sampling locations based on chemical tracers estimate the landscape scale nitrate budget for the terrace aquifer and constrain the residence time of water in the aquifer to understand the potential time scale of nitrate concentration response to management changes this research was framed using a community based participatory approach described in detail in a companion paper jackson smith et al in review and in the supplemental materials our approach engaged agricultural producers in understanding sources of nitrate in ground and surface water and testing farm management practices for effectiveness at reducing nitrate leaching john et al 2017 2

dominate the study area usda 2014 cropland in fallow represents an elevated risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater and has been implicated as a likely cause of elevated groundwater nitrate in this region custer 1976 bauder et al 1993 schmidt and mulder 2010 groundwater nitrate contamination in the judith river watershed is most evident in shallow alluvial aquifers within gravel terraces and alluvial fans at lower elevation and lower relief areas of the watershed schmidt and mulder 2010 fig 1d terraces and fans are underlain by a relatively impermeable shale unit approximately 300 m thick

mountain front surface runoff covino and mcglynn 2007 or groundwater flow carling et al 2012 that occurs in other systems highly conductive gravel substrate and a relatively shallow aquifer thickness in the moccasin terrace result in relatively young groundwater with estimated mean residence times on the order of one to ten years miller 2013 vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination is a function of its proximity to the surface 1 10 m depth to water table and overlying soils with high infiltration capacity and low field capacity the majority of the terrace surface 89 is covered with clay loam soils with relatively thin zones of fine textured horizons ca 30 100 cm over horizons dominated by alluvial gravels and cobbles ca 1 20 cm diameter where the transition to these alluvial gravels is shallow clay accumulation is limited and soils are classified as judith series where the transition is deeper clay content is higher in b horizons and soils are classified as danvers series

up of shale derived soils that are rich in gypsum calcium and sulfate and sodium supplemental materials 2 2 water sample collection we selected water sampling locations to capture nitrate flux and associated major ion chemistry along flow paths from soils to groundwater and surface water optimal sample site locations were developed in conversation with local producers and community members supplemental materials and through observations made during early sampling of the stream network miller 2013 all water samples were field filtered at 0 45 µm transported cold and frozen prior to analysis except for inorganic and organic carbon analysis which occurred on never frozen samples within two weeks of sample collection see supplemental materials for a more detailed description of water sample collection methods soil water sampling with porous cup tension lysimeters ptfe silica prenart equipment frederiksberg denmark was conducted within privately owned managed fields ca 80 acres 32 ha installation sampling was coordinated with cooperating farmers to minimize disruption of farming operations and ensure that samples represented the outcome of uninterrupted standard field scale farming practices eighteen lysimeters were installed in calcareous soils near grove spring fig 2b on the moccasin terrace and in similar nearby soils under the same management lysimeters were installed in fine textured material just above the gravely horizons 50 to 100 cm depth below undisturbed upper soil horizons during seasons when soil water content was relatively high lysimeters were visited one to three times per month and an internal tension of approximately 100 kpa was applied with a hand pump to sample soil water only data from samples greater than 2 0 ml collected within 48 h of pressurization are reported here excluding samples smaller than 2 0 ml removed from consideration soil water nitrate concentrations during drier conditions when leaching was less likely to be occurring lysimeter samples were separated into crop rotation categories based on land use in the preceding growing season ending 15 october for example a sample collected any time between 15 october 2012 and 14 october 2013 is categorized as post fallow or post grain depending on whether the field was in fallow or grain during the 2012 growing season groundwater sampling sites fig 2b were wells and springs selected to represent subsurface contributing areas with a range of mean groundwater flow path lengths and different overlying soil types delineation of subsurface contributing areas to sampling sites was based on flow directions estimated from surface topography miller 2013 nitrate data from montana department of agriculture mda monitoring well m1 for the period 1994 2015 two samples per year were obtained from mda unpublished data schmidt and mulder 2010 schmidt 2009 and historic water level data were downloaded from the montana bureau of mines and geology mbmg groundwater information center mbmg 2016 surface water was sampled in order to capture n export from the landscape louse and porter creeks were identified as the largest streams draining the terrace fig 2b we sampled porter creek at a single location at the outlet from the terrace porter site louse creek was sampled at two locations at an upstream location draining the higher elevations of the terrace railroad site and at the outlet from the terrace kolin site water sampling at ground and surface water sites was conducted 12 15 times per year during 2012 2014 five of the sites were established in 2012 miller 2013 and the other five were established in 2013 table 2 2 3 water sample analysis and major ion composition chemical analysis of all water samples was conducted in the department of land resources and environmental sciences environmental analytical laboratory eal on the msu campus major anions chloride nitrate sulfate were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics

and nitrate additionally by cadmium reduction and colorimetry lachat quickchem 8500 seal quaatro see supplemental materials for detailed analytical methods and data quality assurance procedures differences in major ion composition were used to assess connectivity among soil ground and surface waters in order to infer source waters based on relative variations in major ion composition of a given sample dilution effects were removed by calculating ion ratios which represent the fraction of the molar concentration of an individual ion relative to the summed molarity for all major ions variation in ion ratios among sites was evaluated using principle component analysis pca conducted within r statistical software with the prcomp function with data scaled to unit variance r version 2 15 2 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria for the pca ion ratios were aggregated as annual means within sites for the 2013 14 intensive data collection period tests for statistical difference in concentrations for different sites or domains i e soil versus groundwater were conducted with paired kruskal wallis rank sum test using kruskal test function within r statistical software r version 2 15 2 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 2 4 groundwater catchment delineation discharge stream baseflow and area normalization groundwater catchments were delineated to allow normalization of volumetric stream flow observations from the porter and kolin sites to the area of their respective drainage and to subsequently produce leaching estimates described in section 2 5 we interpret area normalized stream flow at low flow conditions as an indicator of baseflow yield and subsequently groundwater recharge assuming that the change in storage in groundwater over the three year study was negligible compared to the total volume of recharge or discharge over that time area normalizations are based on annually cultivated catchment area alone and the perennially vegetated catchment area is therefore excluded see supplemental fig 1 for a conceptual representation of this area normalization approach this approach produces more accurate areal recharge rates for the cultivated soils considering research that suggests recharge rates are much higher through annually cultivated soils than through perennially vegetated soils scanlon et al 2005 because we assume no recharge through perennially vegetated soils there is some possibility of over estimating recharge rates through annually cultivated soils during the limited time when water content in perennially vegetated soils exceeds field capacity nitrate leaching rates for annually cultivated soils are estimated with the same area normalization approach but are less subject to over estimation this approach assumes section 2 5 supplemental fig 1 that virtually all nitrate in groundwater comes from annually cultivated soils this assumption is supported by both higher recharge rates driving more leaching and higher nitrate concentrations in annually cultivated soils relative to perennially vegetated soils consistent with this assumption soil nitrate concentrations in the top 15 cm in three perennially vegetated fields were approximately an order of magnitude lower than those in adjacent annually cultivated fields during the fallow phase of the crop rotation data now shown delineations of groundwater catchments were derived from surface derived topographic divides and subsurface divides determined by the topographic surface of underlying shales delineation by surface topography was based on a one third arc second 10 m national elevation dataset usgs 2012 digital elevation model dem processed in arcmap spatial analyst using the flow direction and watershed tools based on the sample site locations the shale surface dem was estimated in arcmap by kriging shale surface elevations from well logs geologic maps coupled with aerial imagery and mapped locations of shale derived soil series ordinary spherical semivariogram kriging model supplemental materials ground surface and shale surface derived catchment delineations were manually combined based on assessment of the most likely driver of flow direction in a given area the ground surface derived delineation was selected where shale was near the surface and where the shale surface delineation was ambiguous the shale surface delineation was selected in places where shale topography was unambiguous and departed from ground surface shape most notably around the spring 555 sample site fig 2a stream discharge q m3 s 1 at the porter and kolin sites was measured manually during water sampling visits using the velocity cross section method with a marsh mcbirney flomate electromagnetic flow meter in 2013 manual staff gages were installed along with stilling wells containing capacitance rod stage recorders trutrack inc for periods prior to stage recorder installation and when ice affected stage daily q was estimated using linear interpolation between the measured or modeled values bracketing the period we quantified aquifer efflux by estimating baseflow with a simple manual hydrograph separation method using linear interpolation between inflection points identified on the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph this manual linear approach was used rather than a more objective approach e g lyne and hollick 1979 lim et al 2005 to ensure that allocation of flow to the groundwater source was conservatively low during high flow periods in march june when flow data were less reliable selection of methods producing conservatively low values provides confidence that nitrate flux estimates produced from baseflow estimates represent a lower bound on nitrate leaching losses 2 5 nitrate loading to ground surface water and leaching rates to estimate cultivated soil nitrate load kg n yr 1 to the riparian corridor nlrc prior to hypothesized riparian losses each daily mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration mean across seven groundwater sites was multiplied by daily stream baseflow these loads were area normalized to the annually cultivated land area within each catchment described in section 2 4 and supplemental fig 1 in order to estimate leaching rates kg n ha 1 yr 1 daily mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentrations used for load calculations were derived by first calculating monthly mean concentrations for each of the seven groundwater sites monthly mean values for the sites were then averaged to produce the monthly mean aggregate groundwater values and linear interpolation between these values produced the daily mean aggregate groundwater concentrations during the intensive april 2013 to september 2014 sampling period the seven groundwater sites selected to represent variability in terrace groundwater were included in this calculation before and after the intensive sampling period two groundwater sites were included in the monthly mean aggregate groundwater concentration uncertainty in the monthly mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration was assessed using residual differences between the monthly mean aggregate groundwater values and monthly means for the individual sites during the 2013 14 high intensity sampling period a monte carlo ensemble of groundwater concentration time series was created with 1000 randomly generated realizations from this distribution the ensemble of groundwater concentrations in combination with daily stream baseflow values determined the ensemble of loads that provide some constraint on uncertainty in daily and annual mean nlrc estimates descriptive statistics i e 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles from the resulting monte carlo ensembles of concentrations daily loads and time aggregated loads provide a rough estimate of how error in characterizing a single aggregate nitrate concentration from the observed spatial variation in groundwater may propagate to uncertainty in the total load estimates from the terrace to estimate nitrate n losses from the riparian corridor stream concentrations were subtracted from mean groundwater concentrations during periods when the majority of stream flow was originating from longer term storage this calculation was conducted for stream concentrations and the set of groundwater concentrations collected on the same sampling trip 2 6 groundwater residence time we sampled for apparent groundwater age using 3h 3he cook and solomon 1997 in may 2014 at the m1 monitoring well and at two springs indian and grove sites gas sampling was conducted with copper tube diffusion samplers deployed in the well and in flow through buckets at the orifice of the springs with 24 h equilibration time before being crimp sealed sanford et al 1996 at the time of gas sampler deployment 1 l polypropylene bottles were filled with water for associated 3h analysis gas and water samples were shipped to the university of utah stable isotope laboratory for analysis tritium analysis was performed using a helix sft sector field mass spectrometer with the helium ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 groundwater turnover time was also estimated based on a fully mixed reservoir assumption dividing the estimated total volume of the groundwater reservoir l3 by the total discharge from that reservoir l3 t 1 steady state aquifer outflow is estimated as the average annual baseflow discharge for each catchment over the three year study section 2 4 aquifer volumes for each catchment were estimated from the product of catchment area section 2 4 specific yield of 0 3 anderson and woessner 1992 and saturated thickness saturated thickness was estimated by first calculating the thickness of gravel overlying shale as the shale surface dem subtracted from the ground surface dem the fraction of the gravel that was saturated was estimated using values observed in seven well logs mbmg 2016 within terrace boundaries where shale depth and depth of water below ground surface were available 3 results 3 1 catchment delineation and soil type composition the kolin groundwater catchment area is the largest within the landform at 9670 ha 37 terrace area followed by porter 3630 ha and 14 pioneer spring 750 ha 3 and spring 555 320 ha 1 fig 2a b table 1 for three of these four catchments kolin porter pioneer surface topography based delineation was not notably different from the shale surface approach while for spring 555 the catchment area was much larger 500 based on inference from the shale surface the four groundwater catchment areas combined kolin porter pioneer spring 555 capture 55 of the terrace area indicating that the majority of water leaving the terrace is characterized by the ion chemistry data presented here shale soils compose 13 of the louse creek catchment above railroad and 8 of the catchment above kolin fig 2b table 1 the spring 555 catchment has the highest fraction of shale derived soils 16 while porter creek catchment has no shale derived soil 3 2 nitrate concentrations in soil water and groundwater the mean nitrate n concentration observed in m1 during the three year study 18 6 6 7 mg l 1 was generally consistent with predictions from the increasing trend in the well from ca 10 to ca 20 mg l 1 during the 1994 2015 observation period fig 3 the three year mean for m1 was also not significantly different kruskal wallis p 20 from the aggregate mean concentration for the other six groundwater sites over the three year period 20 9 6 6 mg l 1 however the mean concentration in m1 for 2014 9 9 4 7 mg l 1 was notably lower than for 2012 21 4 0 9 mg l 1 and 2013 23 4 0 9 mg l 1 and lower than mean concentration in aggregate terrace groundwater for 2014 17 1 mg l 1 table 2 the lower 2014 mean concentration in m1 was confirmed to be a local dilution event based on a corresponding change in specific conductance this type of transient dilution is also suggested by the historic data in the form of occasional concentrations lower than the overall increasing trend fig 3 lower nitrate concentrations in m1 consistently occur during the january july period when snow melt and the heaviest seasonal precipitation occurs and only one of the other groundwater sites pioneer displays a spring dilution pattern of similar magnitude the fact that dilution effects are relatively localized in time and space suggests that they do not have a substantial influence on the long term state of the aquifer given the seasonal timing of these transient dilution events the long term trend in aquifer status was assessed with only the concentrations for august to december samples concentrations during this period tend to be more stable and presumably less subject to temporary dilution during large recharge events regression of nitrate concentrations from this smaller data set with time r2 0 79 p 05 fig 3 indicates nitrate n concentrations have generally increased by 0 67 0 09 mg l 1 yr 1 in the well for the past two decades the range of nitrate n concentrations observed in groundwater 1 5 33 5 mg l 1 was approximately half that observed in lysimeters 1 61 mg l 1 suggesting an averaging effect in groundwater with respect to incoming soil leachate concentration however the aggregate mean groundwater nitrate concentration 20 4 6 4 mg l 1 was significantly higher p 05 than the aggregate mean lysimeter nitrate concentration 16 6 13 1 mg l 1 when lysimeter samples were separated based on phase of cropping cycle post fallow concentrations 25 4 14 0 mg l 1 were significantly higher p 05 than post grain concentrations 11 6 7 7 mg l 1 mean groundwater nitrate n concentration was intermediate between mean lysimeter concentrations grouped by crop phase fig 4 groundwater concentration was significantly higher p 05 than lysimeter concentrations post grain but not significantly different p 08 from lysimeter concentrations post fallow these results agreed with expectations in the simple sense that aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration was not lower than aggregate lysimeter concentration but concentrations were similar not significantly different only when cropping stage was considered 3 3 major ion composition of terrace waters and hydrologic connectivity the highest total ion concentrations observed in ground and surface waters were in the well at the headwaters site 20 9 mm and the spring at the 555 site 17 8 mm table 3 fig 5 these molar concentrations are approximately twice that of the five other groundwater sites higher molarities at the headwaters site are attributable mostly to higher sodium na concentrations but sulfate is notably higher at both the headwaters and 555 sites relative to the other groundwater sites the railroad site has the highest total ion concentration of the surface water sites 16 8 mm a pca of the molar ratios resulted in 77 of the total variation in composition explained by the first two components pc1 58 pc2 19 analytes contributing the most loading on pc1 were sulfate so4 2 and sodium on the negative side and calcium ca2 and bicarbonate hco3 on the positive side fig 6 a table 4 analytes with the most important loading on pc2 are nitrate on the positive side and magnesium mg2 and bicarbonate on the negative side sampling sites with the lowest mean pc1 scores higher sodium and sulfate molar ratios are spring 555 and headwaters site which are located in the higher elevations of the terrace fig 2 table 4 with higher occurrence of shale soils the railroad catchment which encompass the shale soil areas in the upper half of the terrace also has low pc1 scores the kolin catchment encompasses the railroad catchment but also drains extensive calcareous soils downstream and has a higher pc1 score than railroad on the other extreme of pc1 the highest scores higher proportion calcium and bicarbonate are for the lysimeter soil water samples and pioneer spring followed by the other springs draining the downgradient half of the terrace where calcareous soils are dominant porter creek draining much of the southern regions of the terrace has a pc1 score similar to grove and indian springs which drain that portion of the terrace where very little shale soil is present this general alignment of pc1 score and prevalence of shale soil is consistent across the terrace demonstrated by a strong negative relationship slope 0 25 r2 0 94 p 05 between percent shale soil within a catchment and pc1 score in surface water fig 6b alignment of water sample site pc1 scores sodium and sulfate versus calcium and bicarbonate with the extent of shale soil versus calcareous soil upgradient agrees with our prediction that ground and surface water chemistry will uniquely reflect chemistry of soils within a catchment differences in nitrate concentration are the next most notable driver of variation in ion ratios reflected in pc2 scores soil nitrate concentrations are highly dynamic which is why lysimeter samples produced both the highest and lowest pc2 scores higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater relative to surface water are evident in groundwater sites generally having higher pc2 scores a finding consistent with our prediction of lower surface water nitrate after riparian losses 3 4 stream discharge groundwater levels and recharge kolin and porter creek catchment discharges fig 7 d e table 4 experienced annual peaks between march and june across the study period coincident with peak water levels in the m1 well fig 7a b peak groundwater and stream discharge levels aligned with timing and magnitude of april june precipitation in 2012 and 2013 while peaks in 2014 coincided with snow melt and rain on snow events in february march on aug 23rd of 2014 110 mm of rain fell at the carc agrimet station on a single day amounting to more than twice the previous maximum daily precipitation 41 mm on 5 24 2011 since installation of the station in 2001 annual average baseflow for both streams table 5 was highest in 2012 following high annual precipitation in 2011 and baseflow was lowest in 2013 after low annual precipitation in 2012 the lowest measured baseflow in louse creek was just before the 23 august 2014 rain event which brought groundwater levels and louse creek flows back up to levels similar to early 2012 while groundwater and stream discharge respond to precipitation on a timescale of days to months influence of previous year precipitation on average annual baseflow suggests that stream discharge is integrating recharge rates across the current and previous year therefore while area normalized annual average baseflows are presented table 5 as an estimate of annual recharge these may be over or under estimated due to baseflow contributions from inter annual storage therefore we also report the three year mean values kolin 54 mm yr 1 porter 87 mm yr 1 as an estimate of average annual recharge that is less influenced by inter annual storage 3 5 nitrate leaching rates and riparian losses daily mean nlrc values for kolin fig 7f 11 1 0 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 are on average 60 of those for porter fig 7g 18 4 0 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the same aggregate groundwater nitrate concentrations are used to calculate the nlrc values for both catchments so the different nlrc values stem from differences in area normalized baseflow between the catchments uncertainty in concentration and nlrc values gray shading fig 7c f g are based on residual differences between the monthly aggregate groundwater mean and monthly means for the individual sites normal distribution standard deviation 6 2 mg l 1 parallel to groundwater recharge estimates annual average nlrc values are presented table 5 but the three year mean values provide estimates of average annual load that are less influenced by inter annual storage the 2012 14 mean nitrate n concentration for porter creek 19 3 1 8 mg l 1 was similar to that for aggregate groundwater 20 4 6 4 mg l 1 while three year mean concentrations in louse creek at both railroad 12 1 3 7 mg l 1 and kolin 10 0 2 4 mg l 1 were approximately half that in aggregate groundwater fig 4 table 2 a pattern also apparent in the time series data fig 7c instantaneous nitrate n loads were calculated for each visit to the kolin and porter sites fig 7f g using measured concentration and measured q values ranged from 31 3 to 373 8 with a mean of 109 kg n day 1 for kolin while values for porter creek ranged from 73 8 to 295 7 with a mean of 131 kg n day 1 normalizing these values to the cultivated area within the catchments produces a mean of 5 3 3 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for kolin and a mean of 18 6 7 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for porter fig 7f g these values represent nitrate n loads leaving the moccasin terrace after potential losses in the stream riparian system and hence constitute a conservative lower bound on n yields from the landscape over time during the study riparian nitrate loss was estimated for six site visit trips during the period from july to november 2013 when no storm related peaks in the stream hydrographs were present apparent riparian nitrate loss during this period averaged 53 range 43 60 for kolin and 16 range 10 23 for porter creek supplemental fig 2 apparent riparian losses normalized to cultivated area within the catchments during this period averaged 3 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 range 3 0 4 3 for kolin and 2 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 range 1 8 4 8 porter creek but were higher on average for kolin supplemental fig 2 3 6 groundwater residence time groundwater residence time estimated by 3h 3he apparent age for the open m1 well bore was 1 7 0 5 yr on 9 august 2012 miller 2013 and was 5 2 0 57 yr on 25 may 2014 table 6 depth specific sampling in m1 using packers on 24 may 2014 produced ages of 3 9 0 56 yr for the bottom of the well 5 2 5 7 m and 1 2 0 65 yr for the top of the screening interval 2 6 3 4 m grove and indian springs sampled for 3h 3he apparent ages on 24 may 2014 produced values of 0 8 0 5 and 0 8 0 9 yr effectively zero respectively the mean of 3h 3he apparent age values observed in 2014 in the open m1 well bore and the two springs was 1 8 yr st dev 3 1 yr estimated turnover times based on aquifer volume and discharge were approximately an order of magnitude longer at 23 and 20 yr for kolin and porter catchments respectively table 7 4 discussion our results provide a landscape scale perspective on the fate and transport of nitrate from soils to groundwater to stream networks in a non irrigated agrosystem we found that n loss to nitrate leaching represents up to one third of typical fertilizer n inputs over a three year crop rotation but that fallow within a crop rotation may allow for a disproportionate amount of nitrate leaching to groundwater these results allow assessment of the differences between the two largest stream catchments draining the moccasin terrace which were evaluated with respect to leaching rate and riparian denitrification losses this study highlights opportunities for targeting reductions in deleterious leaching losses and enhancement of beneficial n losses due to riparian denitrification 4 1 connection of soil ground and surface waters within moccasin terrace delineation of the process domains controlling nitrate dynamics in lower relief sedimentary basins requires consideration of the relationship between stratigraphy and the land surface that characterizes the hydrogeologic and geomorphic context montgomery 1999 montgomery 2004 capell et al 2011 tesoriero et al 2013 particularly in contrast with studies in mountain catchments where n transport to streams may be assumed to follow hydraulic gradients suggested by surface topography alone e g gardner and mcglynn 2009 within the moccasin terrace process domain the alignment between surface water chemistry and catchment soil chemistry fig 6b suggests accuracy in our approach to groundwater catchment delineation in addition the alignment of ground and surface water chemical composition with ssurgo map unit chemical composition for upgradient soils fig 2b fig 6a provides support for our first hypothesis that ground and surface water chemical composition are primarily controlled by the aggregate character of terrace soils draining to a sampling location 4 2 nitrogen concentrations and soil groundwater connections the mean groundwater nitrate n concentration we observed for the moccasin aquifer 20 4 mg l 1 is above the 75th percentile for a montana statewide agricultural well network schmidt 2009 is near the 95th percentile of us concentrations reported by puckett et al 2011 and is approximately double the highest 2000 2004 median us well network concentrations reported by rupert 2008 it is similar however to mean values reported for other shallow groundwater underlying dryland small grain production in montana 20 mg l 1 nimick and thamke 1998 and eastern washington 19 3 mg l 1 kelley et al 2013 the high concentrations are likely a function of the proximity of easily leachable soils to the shallow moccasin aquifer where limited volume and reduced denitrification potential result in vulnerability to nitrate pollution furthermore this aquifer lacks inputs of low nitrate recharge water from mountain front stream recharge or from extensive irrigation both of which can dilute groundwater nitrate in systems where they are present consistent with global patterns of pronounced seasonality in groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2014 the moccasin aquifer receives most recharge in the pre growing season months this is evident from the rise in groundwater level with spring precipitation observed annually fig 7 juxtaposed with a general lack of response to precipitation during the growing season flux to groundwater can be expected to be larger from soils with high water storage from the previous season nippgen et al 2016 and soil moisture storage is purposefully created with fallow land use zeleke et al 2014 higher recharge from post fallow fields coupled with higher nitrate concentrations in post fallow soil water 25 4 mg l 1 than post grain soil water 11 6 mg l 1 suggests that fallow rotations may result in disproportionately high leaching of n to groundwater while fallow land use makes up only 25 of the cultivated terrace surface table 1 its importance to n leaching is supported by nitrate n concentrations in groundwater 20 4 mg l 1 that are more similar to post fallow than post grain soils fig 4 similarity between post fallow lysimeter and groundwater nitrate concentrations provides support for our first hypothesis that minimal denitrification occurs in groundwater in future work the range of lysimeter nitrate concentrations kelley 2015 mariotti et al 2015 we observed could be coupled with daily deep percolation rates to provide more insight about crop rotation effects on leaching in the simplest terms however significantly lower soil nitrate concentrations observed post grain versus post fallow suggest that replacing fallow with continuous cropping potentially in the form of water and n efficient cover crops or legumes would be a step toward reducing groundwater nitrate n concentrations below the drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 4 3 nitrate leaching rates landform average nitrate leaching rates presented here 11 18 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for the moccasin terrace are 19 31 of average standard fertilizer n application over a three year rotation in the study area 90 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for each of two crop years and zero for fallow year during the study john et al 2017 however these values should not be interpreted as applied fertilizer lost directly to leaching mineralization of son during fallow periods is an important component of leaching loss at this site that remains difficult to quantify custer 1976 miller 2013 john et al 2017 our results agree with general findings by john et al 2017 that leaching rates are higher post fallow than post crop pea but average leaching rates in that 2013 2014 field scale study were notably higher 50 kg n ha 1 yr 1 than our leaching estimates one possible explanation for the discrepancy is the set of conservative assumptions in our approach section 2 4 and supplemental material section 4 3 including possible denitrification at a few groundwater sites during periods where measured dissolved oxygen was below 2 mg l 1 supplemental fig 3 uncertainty in the field based approach is another possible explanation along with the fact that our study integrates leaching losses over years to decades while the field scale study quantifies leaching for 2013 and 2014 the fact that our leaching values are lower than those of john et al 2017 provides support for our suggestion that leaching estimates presented in this study are conservatively low notably values presented here are comparable to rates 13 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 from a study in eastern washington that used a 12 ha tile drainage network to delineate a process domain within a small grain landscape where leaching was 12 15 of applied fertilizer rates kelley et al 2017 area normalized baseflow in the kolin catchment is approximately one third lower than in porter a result that propagates into the estimated leaching rate differences between the two catchments table 5 this difference may reflect greater soil water storage capacity and or less groundwater storage capacity within the kolin catchment relative to porter the kolin catchment has a larger fraction of area mapped as the thicker danvers series calcareous soils fig 2b table 1 while the porter catchment has a higher fraction of the thinner judith series calcareous soils more potential for water storage in the thicker soils of the kolin catchment could retain more infiltrated precipitation within the root zone making it available for loss to evapotranspiration and reducing deep percolation leaching at the same time the mean depth to shale and associated aquifer volume is less in the kolin catchment than the porter catchment table 1 in the higher elevations of the kolin catchment where shale is at or near the surface soils may be subject to saturation excess overland flow halting the recharge of groundwater from deep percolation leaching the kolin catchment is likely to have a combination of both higher soil moisture storage capacity and less groundwater storage capacity resulting in lower deep percolation and leaching rates relative to the porter catchment it is also possible that differences in riparian corridor evapotranspiration between the two catchments i e more at kolin are contributing to lower area normalized baseflow for kolin 4 4 riparian n losses our results suggest substantial losses of nitrate in the riparian corridor as has been observed in previous studies lowrance et al 1984 hedin et al 1998 bohlke et al 2002 mulholland et al 2009 zarnetske et al 2011 a finding that supports our second hypothesis the estimated loss rate of 14 for porter is similar to that predicted by mulholland et al 2008 for small streams 100 l s 1 while the 53 estimate for louse creek above kolin is far higher than predicted from other studies higher loss rates in louse creek corridor may be due to difference in the fraction of groundwater discharged through more diffuse seeps versus more focused springs groundwater discharging through seeps has prolonged contact with soil that can facilitate denitrification williams et al 2015 while higher discharge rates through coarse substrate springs likely promotes less denitrification persistence of losses into november supplemental fig 2 beyond the peak season for in stream primary productivity suggests that denitrification in this riparian system may play a larger role relative to plant uptake this dominance of denitrification is atypical across biomes mulholland et al 2008 but may be common in systems not limited by n these findings merit further exploration based on the isotopic composition of nitrate 4 5 groundwater nitrate over time and expected timescale of response to changing inputs the rate of increase in nitrate n concentrations in the m1 well from 1994 to 2014 0 67 0 09 mg l 1 yr 1 is two to fivefold higher than the rates of increase reported in national studies dubrovsky et al 2010 puckett et al 2011 over the same period water levels in groundwater have been variable but do not show a trend fig 3 suggesting that recharge rates have not changed therefore the most likely explanation for increases in groundwater nitrate concentrations is that leached nitrate concentrations in recharge have increased apparent groundwater ages of 1 8 3 1 yr based on 3h 3he values are aligned with some of the youngest reported in other studies 2yr from williams et al 2015 and suggest that groundwater nitrate concentration only lags a few years behind changes in leachate concentration however the fact that apparent groundwater age is ten fold less than calculated turnover time based on aquifer volume 20 23 yr suggests that a substantial proportion of the aquifer is bypassed by flows that mix more slowly with the total volume paleo channels carved in the shale surface during terrace formation hancock and anderson 2002 or differentially sorted gravel channels within gravel deposits ritter 1967 stamm et al 2013 may constitute important pathways of preferential flow through the terrace aquifer areas of lower hydrologic conductivity outside preferential flow paths will turn over more slowly aquifer zones with longer turnover times will add to lag time in groundwater nitrate concentration response to changes in leachate concentration from management changes collection of 3h 3he time series data for springs and wells could help characterize differences in groundwater age distributions over seasons and different aquifer zones which could help refine understanding of expected lag times in groundwater response to inputs county level data for judith basin county indicates that in the 1990s the rate of n applied in fertilizer surpassed the rate of n removed in grain miller 2013 the low spatial resolution of the county level data and the dynamic role of soil organic matter as a soil n storage reservoir preclude simple conclusions about nitrate concentration in leachate from the yield and fertilizer data nonetheless the multi decadal n data for yield and fertilizer input provides interesting context for interpreting the concentration trend in the m1 monitoring well and warrants further exploration 4 6 value of participatory approach to hydrologic investigation for purposes of exploring hydrologic drivers of nitrate leaching in agricultural settings the participatory approach of this work allowed us to benefit from local farmer knowledge of the landscape provided access to sampling sites that otherwise would not have been possible and facilitated development of effective strategies to communicate results to the agricultural community thus potentially influencing changes in behavior to mitigate nitrate pollution in this area jackson smith et al in review basins draining montana rank below the 15th percentile of marb basins for total n yield but our study area includes nitrate concentrations ranking among the highest in national assessments goolsby et al 1999 dubrovsky et al 2010 puckett et al 2011 thus while montana s role in eutrophication of the gulf of mexico is small groundwater nitrate pollution challenges are large from the perspective of communities within the state and as reflected in an increasing number of regional studies globally bohlke and denver 1995 flipo et al 2007 wong et al 2015 ameur et al 2016 niu et al 2017 work at the mesoscale landscape level to characterize and address groundwater contamination issues is important both from the perspective of isolating process domains within which a similar set of hydrologic and agronomic drivers are at play but also for leveraging a scale at which management and environmental effects can be explicitly connected and effectively addressed by local communities wilbanks 2015 5 conclusions in conclusion the moccasin terrace exhibits close connections between soil water and groundwater and between groundwater and streams this setting provides a unique opportunity to directly observe landscape scale movement of soil solutes as they travel through groundwater storage and are exported via stream discharge our results indicate nitrate leaching rates up to one third the rate of fertilizer n input over a standard three year crop rotation but losses may be more heavily weighted to the post fallow period within the rotation and mineralized son is likely an important source of leached n the possible influence of the practice of fallowing on groundwater nitrate concentrations suggests that replacing grain fallow rotations with continuous crop rotations could reduce groundwater nitrate levels tracer based apparent groundwater ages ranging up to five years suggest that groundwater nitrate concentrations could respond relatively quickly to changing nitrate concentrations in leachate however whole aquifer turnover times on the order of decades suggest longer lag times are possible reduced groundwater nitrate concentrations should directly reduce n loads to surface water especially in catchments with high baseflow index such as those in our study area additional surface water quality benefits may be achievable if drivers for the higher riparian n loss rates observed for kolin versus porter catchment can be further characterized and addressed with management our research approach included individual profile scale observations to infer soil processes within a field scale management context which we combined with ground and surface water observations to infer landscape scale processes this multi scale approach allows inference about n processing that would not have been possible with observations only in soils wells or streams moreover our participatory study design facilitated local farmer input and collaboration resulting in improved access to and understanding of research sites the demonstrated connection between soil ground and surface water in the study area became a working model in an open dialog that allowed agricultural producers to evaluate their role in landscape scale water quality issues and to help identify management strategies that would be practical and effective this type of multi scale process based research coupled with a participatory approach to developing shared understanding of both management choices and environmental consequences could improve progress toward

7553,elevated nitrate in shallow aquifers is common in agricultural areas and remediation requires an understanding of nitrogen n leaching at a variety of spatial scales characterization of the drivers of nitrate leaching at the mesoscale level 102 103 km2 is needed to bridge from field scale observations to the landscape scale context allowing informed water resource management decisions here we explore patterns in nitrate leaching rates across a depositional landform in the northern great plains within the upper missouri basin where the predominant land use is non irrigated small grain production and nitrate n concentrations above 10 mg l 1 are common the shallow moccasin terrace 260 km2 aquifer is bounded in vertical extent by underlying shale and is isolated from mountain front stream recharge such that aquifer recharge is dominated by infiltration of precipitation through agricultural soils this configuration presents a simple landform scale water balance that we leveraged to estimate leaching rates using groundwater nitrate concentrations and surface water discharge and quantify uncertainty using a monte carlo approach based on spatial variation in observations of groundwater nitrate concentrations a participatory research approach allowed local farmer knowledge of the landscape to be incorporated into the study design improved selection of and access to sample sites and enhanced prospects for addressing nitrate leaching through collaborative understanding of system hydrology mean landform scale nitrate n leaching rates were 11 and 18 kg ha 1 yr 1 during the 2012 2014 study for the two largest catchments draining the terrace over a standard three year crop rotation these leaching rates represent 19 31 of typical fertilizer n application rates however leaching losses are likely derived not only from fertilizer but also from soil organic n mineralization and are apparently higher during the post fallow phase of the crop rotation groundwater apparent age is relatively young 0 5 yr based on tritium helium analysis but whole aquifer turnover time calculations are an order of magnitude longer 20 23 yr suggesting changes in groundwater may lag behind changes in land management by years to decades keywords nitrate groundwater soils participatory cropping systems fallow 1 introduction an estimated sixty percent of n inputs for production of goods and services in the united states us is lost due to inefficiency where one third of these losses are routed to ground and surface water houlton et al 2013 nitrogen losses associated with low n use efficiency have thus polluted drinking water sources and compromised aquatic ecosystem integrity across the globe and n pollution is expected to increase in regions with increasing population or development spalding and exner 1993 vitousek 1994 smith 2003 diaz and rosenberg 2008 total n concentration in streams draining areas of agricultural land use are commonly six times greater than background levels dubrovsky et al 2010 such effects are particularly evident in the mississippi atchafalaya river basin marb where n flux to the gulf of mexico increased threefold in the second half of the 20th century goolsby and battaglin 2001 these n fluxes are more than 60 nitrate n which is thought to be transported to ground and surface water primarily from microbial mineralization of soil organic n son and fertilizer leached from agricultural soils goolsby et al 1999 in this study we examine causes of high nitrate no3 levels in groundwater and streams within an extensively cultivated 260 km2 26 000 ha landform in the upper missouri basin headwaters of the marb we link observations of water quality in cultivated soil ground and surface waters at this intermediate scale mesoscale 102 103 km2 to estimate nitrate leaching rates characterize the drivers of n loss and suggest implications for water resource quality management in the region despite the general understanding that mineralized son and fertilizer play an important role in generating the large nitrate loads to the marb goolsby et al 1999 there remains considerable uncertainty about the subsurface dynamics that control these fluxes understanding subsurface n processing and transport to groundwater is particularly important for mitigating surface water n loads in catchments with a high baseflow index where the majority of stream flow generation is sourced from groundwater dubrovsky et al 2010 tesoriero et al 2013 in addition groundwater nitrate levels are above the 10 mg l 1 drinking water standard ward et al 2005 in 20 of shallow domestic wells in us agricultural areas dubrovsky et al 2010 the number of wells exceeding the standard increased by 5 between 1990 and 2000 dubrovsky et al 2010 and average nitrate n in agricultural area wells has increased 1 2 mg l 1 per decade since the 1940s puckett et al 2011 these increases have led to mounting health and economic costs borne by private well owners and municipal water suppliers ward et al 2005 bauder and smith 2011 keeler and polasky 2014 nitrogen loss to ground and surface water can be characterized at a range of spatial scales each integrating different sets of transport and loss mechanisms in stream n yields of 1 to 26 kg n ha 1 yr 1 estimated for large basins 103 km2 or 105 ha within the marb represent an integration of all n sources and pathways as well as processing and loss within riparian corridors during transport goolsby et al 1999 these values are highly relevant for prioritization of efforts to manage eutrophication in the gulf of mexico but have limited utility for understanding the undoubtedly diverse mechanisms of n dynamics across the central north american continent in contrast specific soil leaching dynamics are more readily isolated at the point scale 1 m2 while leaching rates measured at this scale can range over two orders of magnitude beaudoin et al 2005 aggregation of point observations at the field scale 1 102 ha has effectively allowed estimates of leaching rates 5 to 69 kg n ha 1 yr 1 that can be tied to drivers like crop type soil character and inter annual variation in conditions beaudoin et al 2005 campbell et al 2006 john et al 2017 thus nitrate leaching rates and drivers identified at point and field scales can directly inform farm n management decisions at the same time there is no assurance that those rates and drivers are representative of landscape scale 104 ha variability conversely nitrate observations that aggregate landscape scale processes can identify water quality impairment and general sources but the heterogeneity of pathways from sources along with n losses in transit impede efforts to quantify leaching rates and isolate specific drivers kunstmann and kastens 2006 hansen et al 2007 dubrovsky et al 2010 pizzol et al 2015 the question remains how do n dynamics operating in soil at the point scale 1 m2 manifest in patterns of n fluxes observed at the spatially aggregated scale of entire agricultural catchments to address this central question we evaluated mesoscale aquifer systems defined by local geomorphic and hydrogeologic context weissmann et al 1999 hancock and anderson 2002 montgomery 2004 our study area lies within a central montana watershed with elevated and increasing nitrate concentrations in groundwater in particular we sought a simplified hydrologic system where stream flow generation is dominated by groundwater sources i e minimal infiltration excess overland flow and interflow and groundwater recharge is dominated by infiltration from overlying soils i e an aquifer with no groundwater inputs from surrounding areas we selected a 260 km2 strath terrace hosting a shallow unconfined aquifer with elevated nitrate almost exclusively managed for non irrigated cereal production miller 2013 the terrace represents a process domain montgomery 1999 with well defined boundaries and a shallow oxygenated high conductivity aquifer the system allows landscape scale estimates of leaching based on time series observations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater wells and surface water discharge q our first hypothesis was that ground and surface water chemistry is primarily controlled by the aggregate character of terrace soils draining to the sampling location because groundwater recharge is derived exclusively from local soils as a result we expected chemistry of ground and surface water to reflect chemistry of soils within a catchment we hypothesized that the physical character of this landform promotes oxygenated conditions and short residence times in the shallow aquifer resulting in minimal denitrification in groundwater we further hypothesized that high n loading and biotic activity in the riparian corridors likely result in substantial denitrification thus we expected groundwater nitrate concentrations would be similar to soil water concentrations measured in lysimeters during leaching periods but that surface water concentrations would be lower than groundwater concentrations due to losses in the riparian corridors our approach to addressing these hypotheses and the overarching research question was to characterize soil connectivity to ground and surface water sampling locations based on chemical tracers estimate the landscape scale nitrate budget for the terrace aquifer and constrain the residence time of water in the aquifer to understand the potential time scale of nitrate concentration response to management changes this research was framed using a community based participatory approach described in detail in a companion paper jackson smith et al in review and in the supplemental materials our approach engaged agricultural producers in understanding sources of nitrate in ground and surface water and testing farm management practices for effectiveness at reducing nitrate leaching john et al 2017 2

alluvial fans at lower elevation and lower relief areas of the watershed schmidt and mulder 2010 fig 1d terraces and fans are underlain by a relatively impermeable shale unit approximately 300 m thick

both components exhibit high calcium carbonate below the a horizon soil web nrcs osd website fig 2 b and we refer to them here as calcareous loam soils the largest fraction of remaining area 7 is made up of shale derived soils that are rich in gypsum calcium and sulfate and sodium supplemental materials 2 2 water sample collection we selected water sampling locations to capture nitrate flux and associated major ion chemistry along flow paths from soils to groundwater and surface water optimal sample site locations were developed in conversation with local producers and community members supplemental materials and through observations made during early sampling of the stream network miller 2013 all water samples were field filtered at 0 45 µm transported cold and frozen prior to analysis except for inorganic and organic carbon analysis which occurred on never frozen samples within two weeks of sample collection see supplemental materials for a more detailed description of water sample collection methods soil water sampling with porous cup tension lysimeters ptfe silica prenart equipment frederiksberg denmark was conducted within privately owned managed fields ca 80 acres 32 ha installation sampling was coordinated with cooperating farmers to minimize disruption of farming operations and ensure that samples represented the outcome of uninterrupted standard field scale farming practices eighteen lysimeters were installed in calcareous soils near grove spring fig 2b on the moccasin terrace and in similar nearby soils under the same management lysimeters were installed in fine textured material just above the gravely horizons 50 to 100 cm depth below undisturbed upper soil horizons during seasons when soil water content was relatively high lysimeters were visited one to three times per month and an internal tension of approximately 100 kpa was applied with a hand pump to sample soil water only data from samples greater than 2 0 ml collected within 48 h of pressurization are reported here excluding samples smaller than 2 0 ml removed from consideration soil water nitrate concentrations during drier conditions when leaching was less likely to be occurring lysimeter samples were separated into crop rotation categories based on land use in the preceding growing season ending 15 october for example a sample collected any time between 15 october 2012 and 14 october 2013 is categorized as post fallow or post grain depending on whether the field was in fallow or grain during the 2012 growing season groundwater sampling sites fig 2b were wells and springs selected to represent subsurface contributing areas with a range of mean groundwater flow path lengths and different overlying soil types delineation of subsurface contributing areas to sampling sites was based on flow directions estimated from surface topography miller 2013 nitrate data from montana department of agriculture mda monitoring well m1 for the period 1994 2015 two samples per year were obtained from mda unpublished data schmidt and mulder 2010 schmidt 2009 and historic water level data were downloaded from the montana bureau of mines and geology mbmg groundwater information center mbmg 2016 surface water was sampled in order to capture n export from the landscape louse and porter creeks were identified as the largest streams draining the terrace fig 2b we sampled porter creek at a single location at the outlet from the terrace porter site louse creek was sampled at two locations at an upstream location draining the higher elevations of the terrace railroad site and at the outlet from the terrace kolin site water sampling at ground and surface water sites was conducted 12 15 times per year during 2012 2014 five of the sites were established in 2012 miller 2013 and the other five were established in 2013 table 2 2 3 water sample analysis and major ion composition chemical analysis of all water samples was conducted in the department of land resources and environmental sciences environmental analytical laboratory eal on the msu campus major anions chloride nitrate sulfate were analyzed by ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 as18 column major cations and total sulfur by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy perkin elmer 5300 dv dissolved organic and inorganic carbon by combustion shimadzu toc vcsh and nitrate additionally by cadmium reduction and colorimetry lachat quickchem 8500 seal quaatro see supplemental materials for detailed analytical methods and data quality assurance procedures differences in major ion composition were used to assess connectivity among soil ground and surface waters in order to infer source waters based on relative variations in major ion composition of a given sample dilution effects were removed by calculating ion ratios which represent the fraction of the molar concentration of an individual ion relative to the summed molarity for all major ions variation in ion ratios among sites was evaluated using principle component analysis pca conducted within r statistical software with the prcomp function with data scaled to unit variance r version 2 15 2 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria for the pca ion ratios were aggregated as annual means within sites for the 2013 14 intensive data collection period tests for statistical difference in concentrations for different sites or domains i e soil versus groundwater were conducted with paired kruskal wallis rank sum test using kruskal test function within r statistical software r version 2 15 2 the r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 2 4 groundwater catchment delineation discharge stream baseflow and area normalization groundwater catchments were delineated to allow normalization of volumetric stream flow observations from the porter and kolin sites to the area of their respective drainage and to subsequently produce leaching estimates described in section 2 5 we interpret area normalized stream flow at low flow conditions as an indicator of baseflow yield and subsequently groundwater recharge assuming that the change in storage in groundwater over the three year study was negligible compared to the total volume of recharge or discharge over that time area normalizations are based on annually cultivated catchment area alone and the perennially vegetated catchment area is therefore excluded see supplemental fig 1 for a conceptual representation of this area normalization approach this approach produces more accurate areal recharge rates for the cultivated soils considering research that suggests recharge rates are much higher through annually cultivated soils than through perennially vegetated soils scanlon et al 2005 because we assume no recharge through perennially vegetated soils there is some possibility of over estimating recharge rates through annually cultivated soils during the limited time when water content in perennially vegetated soils exceeds field capacity nitrate leaching rates for annually cultivated soils are estimated with the same area normalization approach but are less subject to over estimation this approach assumes section 2 5 supplemental fig 1 that virtually all nitrate in groundwater comes from annually cultivated soils this assumption is supported by both higher recharge rates driving more leaching and higher nitrate concentrations in annually cultivated soils relative to perennially vegetated soils consistent with this assumption soil nitrate concentrations in the top 15 cm in three perennially vegetated fields were approximately an order of magnitude lower than those in adjacent annually cultivated fields during the fallow phase of the crop rotation data now shown delineations of groundwater catchments were derived from surface derived topographic divides and subsurface divides determined by the topographic surface of underlying shales delineation by surface topography was based on a one third arc second 10 m national elevation dataset usgs 2012 digital elevation model dem processed in arcmap spatial analyst using the flow direction and watershed tools based on the sample site locations the shale surface dem was estimated in arcmap by kriging shale surface elevations from well logs geologic maps coupled with aerial imagery and mapped locations of shale derived soil series ordinary spherical semivariogram kriging model supplemental materials ground surface and shale surface derived catchment delineations were manually combined based on assessment of the most likely driver of flow direction in a given area the ground surface derived delineation was selected where shale was near the surface and where the shale surface delineation was ambiguous the shale surface delineation was selected in places where shale topography was unambiguous and departed from ground surface shape most notably around the spring 555 sample site fig 2a stream discharge q m3 s 1 at the porter and kolin sites was measured manually during water sampling visits using the velocity cross section method with a marsh mcbirney flomate electromagnetic flow meter in 2013 manual staff gages were installed along with stilling wells containing capacitance rod stage recorders trutrack inc for periods prior to stage recorder installation and when ice affected stage daily q was estimated using linear interpolation between the measured or modeled values bracketing the period we quantified aquifer efflux by estimating baseflow with a simple manual hydrograph separation method using linear interpolation between inflection points identified on the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph this manual linear approach was used rather than a more objective approach e g lyne and hollick 1979 lim et al 2005 to ensure that allocation of flow to the groundwater source was conservatively low during high flow periods in march june when flow data were less reliable selection of methods producing conservatively low values provides confidence that nitrate flux estimates produced from baseflow estimates represent a lower bound on nitrate leaching losses 2 5 nitrate loading to ground surface water and leaching rates to estimate cultivated soil nitrate load kg n yr 1 to the riparian corridor nlrc prior to hypothesized riparian losses each daily mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration mean across seven groundwater sites was multiplied by daily stream baseflow these loads were area normalized to the annually cultivated land area within each catchment described in section 2 4 and supplemental fig 1 in order to estimate leaching rates kg n ha 1 yr 1 daily mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentrations used for load calculations were derived by first calculating monthly mean concentrations for each of the seven groundwater sites monthly mean values for the sites were then averaged to produce the monthly mean aggregate groundwater values and linear interpolation between these values produced the daily mean aggregate groundwater concentrations during the intensive april 2013 to september 2014 sampling period the seven groundwater sites selected to represent variability in terrace groundwater were included in this calculation before and after the intensive sampling period two groundwater sites were included in the monthly mean aggregate groundwater concentration uncertainty in the monthly mean aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration was assessed using residual differences between the monthly mean aggregate groundwater values and monthly means for the individual sites during the 2013 14 high intensity sampling period a monte carlo ensemble of groundwater concentration time series was created with 1000 randomly generated realizations from this distribution the ensemble of groundwater concentrations in combination with daily stream baseflow values determined the ensemble of loads that provide some constraint on uncertainty in daily and annual mean nlrc estimates descriptive statistics i e 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles from the resulting monte carlo ensembles of concentrations daily loads and time aggregated loads provide a rough estimate of how error in characterizing a single aggregate nitrate concentration from the observed spatial variation in groundwater may propagate to uncertainty in the total load estimates from the terrace to estimate nitrate n losses from the riparian corridor stream concentrations were subtracted from mean groundwater concentrations during periods when the majority of stream flow was originating from longer term storage this calculation was conducted for stream concentrations and the set of groundwater concentrations collected on the same sampling trip 2 6 groundwater residence time we sampled for apparent groundwater age using 3h 3he cook and solomon 1997 in may 2014 at the m1 monitoring well and at two springs indian and grove sites gas sampling was conducted with copper tube diffusion samplers deployed in the well and in flow through buckets at the orifice of the springs with 24 h equilibration time before being crimp sealed sanford et al 1996 at the time of gas sampler deployment 1 l polypropylene bottles were filled with water for associated 3h analysis gas and water samples were shipped to the university of utah stable isotope laboratory for analysis tritium analysis was performed using a helix sft sector field mass spectrometer with the helium ingrowth method clarke et al 1976 groundwater turnover time was also estimated based on a fully mixed reservoir assumption dividing the estimated total volume of the groundwater reservoir l3 by the total discharge from that reservoir l3 t 1 steady state aquifer outflow is estimated as the average annual baseflow discharge for each catchment over the three year study section 2 4 aquifer volumes for each catchment were estimated from the product of catchment area section 2 4 specific yield of 0 3 anderson and woessner 1992 and saturated thickness saturated thickness was estimated by first calculating the thickness of gravel overlying shale as the shale surface dem subtracted from the ground surface dem the fraction of the gravel that was saturated was estimated using values observed in seven well logs mbmg 2016 within terrace boundaries where shale depth and depth of water below ground surface were available 3 results 3 1 catchment delineation and soil type composition the kolin groundwater catchment area is the largest within the landform at 9670 ha 37 terrace area followed by porter 3630 ha and 14 pioneer spring 750 ha 3 and spring 555 320 ha 1 fig 2a b table 1 for three of these four catchments kolin porter pioneer surface topography based delineation was not notably different from the shale surface approach while for spring 555 the catchment area was much larger 500 based on inference from the shale surface the four groundwater catchment areas combined kolin porter pioneer spring 555 capture 55 of the terrace area indicating that the majority of water leaving the terrace is characterized by the ion chemistry data presented here shale soils compose 13 of the louse creek catchment above railroad and 8 of the catchment above kolin fig 2b table 1 the spring 555 catchment has the highest fraction of shale derived soils 16 while porter creek catchment has no shale derived soil 3 2 nitrate concentrations in soil water and groundwater the mean nitrate n concentration observed in m1 during the three year study 18 6 6 7 mg l 1 was generally consistent with predictions from the increasing trend in the well from ca 10 to ca 20 mg l 1 during the 1994 2015 observation period fig 3 the three year mean for m1 was also not significantly different kruskal wallis p 20 from the aggregate mean concentration for the other six groundwater sites over the three year period 20 9 6 6 mg l 1 however the mean concentration in m1 for 2014 9 9 4 7 mg l 1 was notably lower than for 2012 21 4 0 9 mg l 1 and 2013 23 4 0 9 mg l 1 and lower than mean concentration in aggregate terrace groundwater for 2014 17 1 mg l 1 table 2 the lower 2014 mean concentration in m1 was confirmed to be a local dilution event based on a corresponding change in specific conductance this type of transient dilution is also suggested by the historic data in the form of occasional concentrations lower than the overall increasing trend fig 3 lower nitrate concentrations in m1 consistently occur during the january july period when snow melt and the heaviest seasonal precipitation occurs and only one of the other groundwater sites pioneer displays a spring dilution pattern of similar magnitude the fact that dilution effects are relatively localized in time and space suggests that they do not have a substantial influence on the long term state of the aquifer given the seasonal timing of these transient dilution events the long term trend in aquifer status was assessed with only the concentrations for august to december samples concentrations during this period tend to be more stable and presumably less subject to temporary dilution during large recharge events regression of nitrate concentrations from this smaller data set with time r2 0 79 p 05 fig 3 indicates nitrate n concentrations have generally increased by 0 67 0 09 mg l 1 yr 1 in the well for the past two decades the range of nitrate n concentrations observed in groundwater 1 5 33 5 mg l 1 was approximately half that observed in lysimeters 1 61 mg l 1 suggesting an averaging effect in groundwater with respect to incoming soil leachate concentration however the aggregate mean groundwater nitrate concentration 20 4 6 4 mg l 1 was significantly higher p 05 than the aggregate mean lysimeter nitrate concentration 16 6 13 1 mg l 1 when lysimeter samples were separated based on phase of cropping cycle post fallow concentrations 25 4 14 0 mg l 1 were significantly higher p 05 than post grain concentrations 11 6 7 7 mg l 1 mean groundwater nitrate n concentration was intermediate between mean lysimeter concentrations grouped by crop phase fig 4 groundwater concentration was significantly higher p 05 than lysimeter concentrations post grain but not significantly different p 08 from lysimeter concentrations post fallow these results agreed with expectations in the simple sense that aggregate groundwater nitrate concentration was not lower than aggregate lysimeter concentration but concentrations were similar not significantly different only when cropping stage was considered 3 3 major ion composition of terrace waters and hydrologic connectivity the highest total ion concentrations observed in ground and surface waters were in the well at the headwaters site 20 9 mm and the spring at the 555 site 17 8 mm table 3 fig 5 these molar concentrations are approximately twice that of the five other groundwater sites higher molarities at the headwaters site are attributable mostly to higher sodium na concentrations but sulfate is notably higher at both the headwaters and 555 sites relative to the other groundwater sites the railroad site has the highest total ion concentration of the surface water sites 16 8 mm a pca of the molar ratios resulted in 77 of the total variation in composition explained by the first two components pc1 58 pc2 19 analytes contributing the most loading on pc1 were sulfate so4 2 and sodium on the negative side and calcium ca2 and bicarbonate hco3 on the positive side fig 6 a table 4 analytes with the most important loading on pc2 are nitrate on the positive side and magnesium mg2 and bicarbonate on the negative side sampling sites with the lowest mean pc1 scores higher sodium and sulfate molar ratios are spring 555 and headwaters site which are located in the higher elevations of the terrace fig 2 table 4 with higher occurrence of shale soils the railroad catchment which encompass the shale soil areas in the upper half of the terrace also has low pc1 scores the kolin catchment encompasses the railroad catchment but also drains extensive calcareous soils downstream and has a higher pc1 score than railroad on the other extreme of pc1 the highest scores higher proportion calcium and bicarbonate are for the lysimeter soil water samples and pioneer spring followed by the other springs draining the downgradient half of the terrace where calcareous soils are dominant porter creek draining much of the southern regions of the terrace has a pc1 score similar to grove and indian springs which drain that portion of the terrace where very little shale soil is present this general alignment of pc1 score and prevalence of shale soil is consistent across the terrace demonstrated by a strong negative relationship slope 0 25 r2 0 94 p 05 between percent shale soil within a catchment and pc1 score in surface water fig 6b alignment of water sample site pc1 scores sodium and sulfate versus calcium and bicarbonate with the extent of shale soil versus calcareous soil upgradient agrees with our prediction that ground and surface water chemistry will uniquely reflect chemistry of soils within a catchment differences in nitrate concentration are the next most notable driver of variation in ion ratios reflected in pc2 scores soil nitrate concentrations are highly dynamic which is why lysimeter samples produced both the highest and lowest pc2 scores higher nitrate concentrations in groundwater relative to surface water are evident in groundwater sites generally having higher pc2 scores a finding consistent with our prediction of lower surface water nitrate after riparian losses 3 4 stream discharge groundwater levels and recharge kolin and porter creek catchment discharges fig 7 d e table 4 experienced annual peaks between march and june across the study period coincident with peak water levels in the m1 well fig 7a b peak groundwater and stream discharge levels aligned with timing and magnitude of april june precipitation in 2012 and 2013 while peaks in 2014 coincided with snow melt and rain on snow events in february march on aug 23rd of 2014 110 mm of rain fell at the carc agrimet station on a single day amounting to more than twice the previous maximum daily precipitation 41 mm on 5 24 2011 since installation of the station in 2001 annual average baseflow for both streams table 5 was highest in 2012 following high annual precipitation in 2011 and baseflow was lowest in 2013 after low annual precipitation in 2012 the lowest measured baseflow in louse creek was just before the 23 august 2014 rain event which brought groundwater levels and louse creek flows back up to levels similar to early 2012 while groundwater and stream discharge respond to precipitation on a timescale of days to months influence of previous year precipitation on average annual baseflow suggests that stream discharge is integrating recharge rates across the current and previous year therefore while area normalized annual average baseflows are presented table 5 as an estimate of annual recharge these may be over or under estimated due to baseflow contributions from inter annual storage therefore we also report the three year mean values kolin 54 mm yr 1 porter 87 mm yr 1 as an estimate of average annual recharge that is less influenced by inter annual storage 3 5 nitrate leaching rates and riparian losses daily mean nlrc values for kolin fig 7f 11 1 0 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 are on average 60 of those for porter fig 7g 18 4 0 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 the same aggregate groundwater nitrate concentrations are used to calculate the nlrc values for both catchments so the different nlrc values stem from differences in area normalized baseflow between the catchments uncertainty in concentration and nlrc values gray shading fig 7c f g are based on residual differences between the monthly aggregate groundwater mean and monthly means for the individual sites normal distribution standard deviation 6 2 mg l 1 parallel to groundwater recharge estimates annual average nlrc values are presented table 5 but the three year mean values provide estimates of average annual load that are less influenced by inter annual storage the 2012 14 mean nitrate n concentration for porter creek 19 3 1 8 mg l 1 was similar to that for aggregate groundwater 20 4 6 4 mg l 1 while three year mean concentrations in louse creek at both railroad 12 1 3 7 mg l 1 and kolin 10 0 2 4 mg l 1 were approximately half that in aggregate groundwater fig 4 table 2 a pattern also apparent in the time series data fig 7c instantaneous nitrate n loads were calculated for each visit to the kolin and porter sites fig 7f g using measured concentration and measured q values ranged from 31 3 to 373 8 with a mean of 109 kg n day 1 for kolin while values for porter creek ranged from 73 8 to 295 7 with a mean of 131 kg n day 1 normalizing these values to the cultivated area within the catchments produces a mean of 5 3 3 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for kolin and a mean of 18 6 7 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for porter fig 7f g these values represent nitrate n loads leaving the moccasin terrace after potential losses in the stream riparian system and hence constitute a conservative lower bound on n yields from the landscape over time during the study riparian nitrate loss was estimated for six site visit trips during the period from july to november 2013 when no storm related peaks in the stream hydrographs were present apparent riparian nitrate loss during this period averaged 53 range 43 60 for kolin and 16 range 10 23 for porter creek supplemental fig 2 apparent riparian losses normalized to cultivated area within the catchments during this period averaged 3 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 range 3 0 4 3 for kolin and 2 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 range 1 8 4 8 porter creek but were higher on average for kolin supplemental fig 2 3 6 groundwater residence time groundwater residence time estimated by 3h 3he apparent age for the open m1 well bore was 1 7 0 5 yr on 9 august 2012 miller 2013 and was 5 2 0 57 yr on 25 may 2014 table 6 depth specific sampling in m1 using packers on 24 may 2014 produced ages of 3 9 0 56 yr for the bottom of the well 5 2 5 7 m and 1 2 0 65 yr for the top of the screening interval 2 6 3 4 m grove and indian springs sampled for 3h 3he apparent ages on 24 may 2014 produced values of 0 8 0 5 and 0 8 0 9 yr effectively zero respectively the mean of 3h 3he apparent age values observed in 2014 in the open m1 well bore and the two springs was 1 8 yr st dev 3 1 yr estimated turnover times based on aquifer volume and discharge were approximately an order of magnitude longer at 23 and 20 yr for kolin and porter catchments respectively table 7 4 discussion our results provide a landscape scale perspective on the fate and transport of nitrate from soils to groundwater to stream networks in a non irrigated agrosystem we found that n loss to nitrate leaching represents up to one third of typical fertilizer n inputs over a three year crop rotation but that fallow within a crop rotation may allow for a disproportionate amount of nitrate leaching to groundwater these results allow assessment of the differences between the two largest stream catchments draining the moccasin terrace which were evaluated with respect to leaching rate and riparian denitrification losses this study highlights opportunities for targeting reductions in deleterious leaching losses and enhancement of beneficial n losses due to riparian denitrification 4 1 connection of soil ground and surface waters within moccasin terrace delineation of the process domains controlling nitrate dynamics in lower relief sedimentary basins requires consideration of the relationship between stratigraphy and the land surface that characterizes the hydrogeologic and geomorphic context montgomery 1999 montgomery 2004 capell et al 2011 tesoriero et al 2013 particularly in contrast with studies in mountain catchments where n transport to streams may be assumed to follow hydraulic gradients suggested by surface topography alone e g gardner and mcglynn 2009 within the moccasin terrace process domain the alignment between surface water chemistry and catchment soil chemistry fig 6b suggests accuracy in our approach to groundwater catchment delineation in addition the alignment of ground and surface water chemical composition with ssurgo map unit chemical composition for upgradient soils fig 2b fig 6a provides support for our first hypothesis that ground and surface water chemical composition are primarily controlled by the aggregate character of terrace soils draining to a sampling location 4 2 nitrogen concentrations and soil groundwater connections the mean groundwater nitrate n concentration we observed for the moccasin aquifer 20 4 mg l 1 is above the 75th percentile for a montana statewide agricultural well network schmidt 2009 is near the 95th percentile of us concentrations reported by puckett et al 2011 and is approximately double the highest 2000 2004 median us well network concentrations reported by rupert 2008 it is similar however to mean values reported for other shallow groundwater underlying dryland small grain production in montana 20 mg l 1 nimick and thamke 1998 and eastern washington 19 3 mg l 1 kelley et al 2013 the high concentrations are likely a function of the proximity of easily leachable soils to the shallow moccasin aquifer where limited volume and reduced denitrification potential result in vulnerability to nitrate pollution furthermore this aquifer lacks inputs of low nitrate recharge water from mountain front stream recharge or from extensive irrigation both of which can dilute groundwater nitrate in systems where they are present consistent with global patterns of pronounced seasonality in groundwater recharge jasechko et al 2014 the moccasin aquifer receives most recharge in the pre growing season months this is evident from the rise in groundwater level with spring precipitation observed annually fig 7 juxtaposed with a general lack of response to precipitation during the growing season flux to groundwater can be expected to be larger from soils with high water storage from the previous season nippgen et al 2016 and soil moisture storage is purposefully created with fallow land use zeleke et al 2014 higher recharge from post fallow fields coupled with higher nitrate concentrations in post fallow soil water 25 4 mg l 1 than post grain soil water 11 6 mg l 1 suggests that fallow rotations may result in disproportionately high leaching of n to groundwater while fallow land use makes up only 25 of the cultivated terrace surface table 1 its importance to n leaching is supported by nitrate n concentrations in groundwater 20 4 mg l 1 that are more similar to post fallow than post grain soils fig 4 similarity between post fallow lysimeter and groundwater nitrate concentrations provides support for our first hypothesis that minimal denitrification occurs in groundwater in future work the range of lysimeter nitrate concentrations kelley 2015 mariotti et al 2015 we observed could be coupled with daily deep percolation rates to provide more insight about crop rotation effects on leaching in the simplest terms however significantly lower soil nitrate concentrations observed post grain versus post fallow suggest that replacing fallow with continuous cropping potentially in the form of water and n efficient cover crops or legumes would be a step toward reducing groundwater nitrate n concentrations below the drinking water standard of 10 mg l 1 4 3 nitrate leaching rates landform average nitrate leaching rates presented here 11 18 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for the moccasin terrace are 19 31 of average standard fertilizer n application over a three year rotation in the study area 90 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for each of two crop years and zero for fallow year during the study john et al 2017 however these values should not be interpreted as applied fertilizer lost directly to leaching mineralization of son during fallow periods is an important component of leaching loss at this site that remains difficult to quantify custer 1976 miller 2013 john et al 2017 our results agree with general findings by john et al 2017 that leaching rates are higher post fallow than post crop pea but average leaching rates in that 2013 2014 field scale study were notably higher 50 kg n ha 1 yr 1 than our leaching estimates one possible explanation for the discrepancy is the set of conservative assumptions in our approach section 2 4 and supplemental material section 4 3 including possible denitrification at a few groundwater sites during periods where measured dissolved oxygen was below 2 mg l 1 supplemental fig 3 uncertainty in the field based approach is another possible explanation along with the fact that our study integrates leaching losses over years to decades while the field scale study quantifies leaching for 2013 and 2014 the fact that our leaching values are lower than those of john et al 2017 provides support for our suggestion that leaching estimates presented in this study are conservatively low notably values presented here are comparable to rates 13 7 kg n ha 1 yr 1 from a study in eastern washington that used a 12 ha tile drainage network to delineate a process domain within a small grain landscape where leaching was 12 15 of applied fertilizer rates kelley et al 2017 area normalized baseflow in the kolin catchment is approximately one third lower than in porter a result that propagates into the estimated leaching rate differences between the two catchments table 5 this difference may reflect greater soil water storage capacity and or less groundwater storage capacity within the kolin catchment relative to porter the kolin catchment has a larger fraction of area mapped as the thicker danvers series calcareous soils fig 2b table 1 while the porter catchment has a higher fraction of the thinner judith series calcareous soils more potential for water storage in the thicker soils of the kolin catchment could retain more infiltrated precipitation within the root zone making it available for loss to evapotranspiration and reducing deep percolation leaching at the same time the mean depth to shale and associated aquifer volume is less in the kolin catchment than the porter catchment table 1 in the higher elevations of the kolin catchment where shale is at or near the surface soils may be subject to saturation excess overland flow halting the recharge of groundwater from deep percolation leaching the kolin catchment is likely to have a combination of both higher soil moisture storage capacity and less groundwater storage capacity resulting in lower deep percolation and leaching rates relative to the porter catchment it is also possible that differences in riparian corridor evapotranspiration between the two catchments i e more at kolin are contributing to lower area normalized baseflow for kolin 4 4 riparian n losses our results suggest substantial losses of nitrate in the riparian corridor as has been observed in previous studies lowrance et al 1984 hedin et al 1998 bohlke et al 2002 mulholland et al 2009 zarnetske et al 2011 a finding that supports our second hypothesis the estimated loss rate of 14 for porter is similar to that predicted by mulholland et al 2008 for small streams 100 l s 1 while the 53 estimate for louse creek above kolin is far higher than predicted from other studies higher loss rates in louse creek corridor may be due to difference in the fraction of groundwater discharged through more diffuse seeps versus more focused springs groundwater discharging through seeps has prolonged contact with soil that can facilitate denitrification williams et al 2015 while higher discharge rates through coarse substrate springs likely promotes less denitrification persistence of losses into november supplemental fig 2 beyond the peak season for in stream primary productivity suggests that denitrification in this riparian system may play a larger role relative to plant uptake this dominance of denitrification is atypical across biomes mulholland et al 2008 but may be common in systems not limited by n these findings merit further exploration based on the isotopic composition of nitrate 4 5 groundwater nitrate over time and expected timescale of response to changing inputs the rate of increase in nitrate n concentrations in the m1 well from 1994 to 2014 0 67 0 09 mg l 1 yr 1 is two to fivefold higher than the rates of increase reported in national studies dubrovsky et al 2010 puckett et al 2011 over the same period water levels in groundwater have been variable but do not show a trend fig 3 suggesting that recharge rates have not changed therefore the most likely explanation for increases in groundwater nitrate concentrations is that leached nitrate concentrations in recharge have increased apparent groundwater ages of 1 8 3 1 yr based on 3h 3he values are aligned with some of the youngest reported in other studies 2yr from williams et al 2015 and suggest that groundwater nitrate concentration only lags a few years behind changes in leachate concentration however the fact that apparent groundwater age is ten fold less than calculated turnover time based on aquifer volume 20 23 yr suggests that a substantial proportion of the aquifer is bypassed by flows that mix more slowly with the total volume paleo channels carved in the shale surface during terrace formation hancock and anderson 2002 or differentially sorted gravel channels within gravel deposits ritter 1967 stamm et al 2013 may constitute important pathways of preferential flow through the terrace aquifer areas of lower hydrologic conductivity outside preferential flow paths will turn over more slowly aquifer zones with longer turnover times will add to lag time in groundwater nitrate concentration response to changes in leachate concentration from management changes collection of 3h 3he time series data for springs and wells could help characterize differences in groundwater age distributions over seasons and different aquifer zones which could help refine understanding of expected lag times in groundwater response to inputs county level data for judith basin county indicates that in the 1990s the rate of n applied in fertilizer surpassed the rate of n removed in grain miller 2013 the low spatial resolution of the county level data and the dynamic role of soil organic matter as a soil n storage reservoir preclude simple conclusions about nitrate concentration in leachate from the yield and fertilizer data nonetheless the multi decadal n data for yield and fertilizer input provides interesting context for interpreting the concentration trend in the m1 monitoring well and warrants further exploration 4 6 value of participatory approach to hydrologic investigation for purposes of exploring hydrologic drivers of nitrate leaching in agricultural settings the participatory approach of this work allowed us to benefit from local farmer knowledge of the landscape provided access to sampling sites that otherwise would not have been possible and facilitated development of effective strategies to communicate results to the agricultural community thus potentially influencing changes in behavior to mitigate nitrate pollution in this area jackson smith et al in review basins draining montana rank below the 15th percentile of marb basins for total n yield but our study area includes nitrate concentrations ranking among the highest in national assessments goolsby et al 1999 dubrovsky et al 2010 puckett et al 2011 thus while montana s role in eutrophication of the gulf of mexico is small groundwater nitrate pollution challenges are large from the perspective of communities within the state and as reflected in an increasing number of regional studies globally bohlke and denver 1995 flipo et al 2007 wong et al 2015 ameur et al 2016 niu et al 2017 work at the mesoscale landscape level to characterize and address groundwater contamination issues is important both from the perspective of isolating process domains within which a similar set of hydrologic and agronomic drivers are at play but also for leveraging a scale at which management and environmental effects can be explicitly connected and effectively addressed by local communities wilbanks 2015 5 conclusions in conclusion the moccasin terrace exhibits close connections between soil water and groundwater and between groundwater and streams this setting provides a unique opportunity to directly observe landscape scale movement of soil solutes as they travel through groundwater storage and are exported via stream discharge our results indicate nitrate leaching rates up to one third the rate of fertilizer n input over a standard three year crop rotation but losses may be more heavily weighted to the post fallow period within the rotation and mineralized son is likely an important source of leached n the possible influence of the practice of fallowing on groundwater nitrate concentrations suggests that replacing grain fallow rotations with continuous crop rotations could reduce groundwater nitrate levels tracer based apparent groundwater ages ranging up to five years suggest that groundwater nitrate concentrations could respond relatively quickly to changing nitrate concentrations in leachate however whole aquifer turnover times on the order of decades suggest longer lag times are possible reduced groundwater nitrate concentrations should directly reduce n loads to surface water especially in catchments with high baseflow index such as those in our study area additional surface water quality benefits may be achievable if drivers for the higher riparian n loss rates observed for kolin versus porter catchment can be further characterized and addressed with management our research approach included individual profile scale observations to infer soil processes within a field scale management context which we combined with ground and surface water observations to infer landscape scale processes this multi scale approach allows inference about n processing that would not have been possible with observations only in soils wells or streams moreover our participatory study design facilitated local farmer input and collaboration resulting in improved access to and understanding of research sites the demonstrated connection between soil ground and surface water in the study area became a working model in an open dialog that allowed agricultural producers to evaluate their role in landscape scale water quality issues and to help identify management strategies that would be practical and effective this type of multi scale process based research coupled with a participatory approach to developing shared understanding of both management choices and environmental consequences could improve progress toward

7554,reconstruction of missing runoff data is of important significance to solve contradictions between the common situation of gaps and the fundamental necessity of complete time series for reliable hydrological research the conventional empirical orthogonal functions eof approach has been documented to be useful for interpolating hydrological series based upon spatiotemporal decomposition of runoff variation patterns without additional measurements e g precipitation land cover this study develops a new eof based approach abbreviated as ceof that conditions eof expansion on the oscillations at outlet or any other reference station of a target basin and creates a set of residual series by removing the dependence on this reference series in order to redefine the amplitude functions components this development allows a transparent hydrological interpretation of the dimensionless components and thereby strengthens their capacities to explain various runoff regimes in a basin the two approaches are demonstrated on an application of discharge observations from the ganjiang basin china two alternatives for determining amplitude functions based on centred and standardised series respectively are tested the convergence in the reconstruction of observations at different sites as a function of the number of components and its relation to the characteristics of the site are analysed results indicate that the ceof approach offers an efficient way to restore runoff records with only one to four components it shows more superiority in nested large basins than at headwater sites and often performs better than the eof approach when using standardised series especially in improving infilling accuracy for low flows comparisons against other interpolation methods i e nearest neighbour linear regression inverse distance weighting further confirm the advantage of the eof based approaches in avoiding spatial and temporal inconsistencies in estimated series keywords empirical orthogonal functions amplitude functions reconstruction gap filling runoff time series 1 introduction availability of complete runoff time series is essential for hydrological studies on such as hydraulic infrastructures design water resources management and flood or drought forecasting unfortunately there usually exists such a predicament that data are poorly recorded due to accidental or human induced causes the loss of information resulting from the adverse impact of scarce records threatens the reliability of hydrological studies which consequently poses great demands on reconstruction of missing data gottschalk et al 2015 problem of interpolation for gaps in incomplete time series has long been an interesting topic in hydrologic environmental and other geoscientific studies several methods are proposed and applied successfully within their own applicable scopes such as the auto regression model and its various derivatives tencaliec et al 2015 wang et al 2015 multiple linear regression linking with simultaneous covariates precipitation soil moisture land cover etc daly et al 1994 weighting average method based on spatial proximity between observation and prediction locations arnell 1995 kurtzman et al 2009 spectral analysis kondrashov and ghil 2006 mariethoz et al 2012 bayesian inference tingley and huybers 2010 copula modelling bárdossy and pegram 2014 and the classical methods of objective analysis like gandin interpolation gandin 1965 and empirical orthogonal functions eof approach gottschalk et al 2015 in addition to the aforementioned methods interpolation of missing data has also been achieved by using process based approaches e g running a rainfall runoff model hisdal and tveito 1993 wagner et al 2012 or by incorporating artificial intelligence like artificial neural network coulibaly and evora 2007 kim and pachepsky 2010 or fuzzy logic theory abebe et al 2000 it has been widely acknowledged that improvements for the accuracy of reconstructed time series for a large basin are still challenging tasks in consideration of the inherent deficiencies in some existing approaches such as computational complexity a certain level of subjectivity in calibration and validation of models or absence of prerequisite for other covariate measurements pappas et al 2014 tencaliec et al 2015 selection of a suitable infilling method often depends on the type of interpolated variables in different disciplines spatial and temporal distribution features of gaps and application conditions of interpolation formulation gottschalk et al 2011 in this paper reconstruction of missing runoff series is investigated with an emphasis on the eof approach in different publications this approach is also perceived as principal component analysis factor analysis and karhunen loève expansion in stochastic approach gottschalk et al 2015 it allows an analysis of spatiotemporal variation by characterising the variance covariance correlation structure of runoff series seen as a random process that evolves in space and time over a common period and decomposing observed series into a linear combination of orthogonal patterns and uncorrelated components amplitude functions in spatial and temporal domain the determined amplitude functions invariant across sites in a target region can be then applied for a large scale interpolation of incomplete runoff series at any site in this region for not only intermittent time slices but also successively long term time periods the eof approach being originally popular in the scientific progress of meteorology and climatology has increasingly received attention in hydrology as a useful tool for e g dimensionality reduction pattern recognition of hydrological characteristics classification of runoff pattern description of runoff characteristics gottschalk 1985 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1995 krasovskaia et al 1999 2003 johnston and shmagin 2008 ionita et al 2014 li et al 2017 and more importantly as a powerful stochastic interpolation scheme for mapping of river runoff series across space and time creutin and obled 1982 obled and creutin 1987 hisdal and tveito 1992 1993 gottschalk 1993 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1995 sauquet et al 2000 2008 beckers and rixen 2003 henn et al 2013 gottschalk et al 2015 obled and braud 1989 for example hisdal and tveito 1993 compared the eof approach with linear regression and hydrological model for reconstructing daily runoff series from nine basins in southern norway and concluded that the eof approach yielded results as good as the other two beckers and rixen 2003 interpolated the incomplete oceanographic datasets based on the ordinary eof approach henn et al 2013 studied the eof approach for filling in gaps in hourly near surface air temperature data and found that the approach was sensitive to the vertical separation of stations and spatial correlation between them gottschalk et al 2015 applied the ordinary eof approach to interpolate the monthly runoff in the upper magdalena river colombia for gauging stations with missing records and for ungauged sites they pointed out that the moderately good results in some mountain headwater stations could be ascribed to the relatively weaker representation of the amplitude functions at these sites where runoff series might tend to present irregular variability since the amplitude functions are rarely explained with a clear hydrological meaning investigation on how to enhance their physical significance becomes necessary to improve the capacity for accounting for various runoff regimes in a basin with the above background the main aim of this paper is to develop the new algorithm based on the eof approach namely the conditioned eof ceof approach to improve the accuracy of reconstruction of missing data the mathematical treatment of this algorithm is presented in section 3 following a brief presentation of the theoretical background of the conventional eof approach in section 2 section 4 describes how to reconstruct complete time series using the eof and ceof approaches and further employs other five interpolation schemes for comparisons all the approaches are evaluated through an application to monthly discharge observations from the 28 gauging stations in the gan river ganjiang china in section 5 we summarise the study in section 6 with the discussion and conclusions 2 background for empirical orthogonal functions the theoretical background of the conventional eof approach is briefly recalled supposing an application to river discharge observations readers interested in more details can refer to gottschalk et al 2015 define the drainage area down to a gauging outlet station as the total domain ω the discharge series at the outlet is denoted by q t ω the denested non overlapping areas ω i i 1 m related to m gauging sites upstream of this outlet station are extracted using ω i a i s ω s so that i 1 m ω i ω where s denotes all sites upstream of site i and a i is the drainage area of site i when i is a headwater site without any upstream site ω i is exactly equal to a i the discharge q t ω i for a denested drainage area ω i is defined as the net discharge after subtracting the inflows from upstream areas except for headwater sites i e q t ω i q t a i s q t a s which can be written as the integral of flows over space u across this area smooth variations are assumed so that the integration can be separated 1 q t ω i u ω i q t u d u m q ω i u ω i x t u d u m q ω i x t ω i where q t ω i is expressed as the sum of long term mean value of the discharge m q ω i for a denested area ω i and the fluctuations around this mean namely the centred discharge series x t ω i in terms of the eof expansion this centred discharge can be linearly decomposed into double orthogonal series of spatial and temporal functions 2 x t ω i k 1 m ψ k t β k ω i where the temporal functions ψ k t k 1 m are known as principal components representing time series that are not directly linked to any specific points of the domain ω the spatial functions β k ω i i e empirical orthogonal functions are the weight coefficients of the kth amplitude function ψ k t for a denested basin ω i in holmström 1970 β k ω i and ψ k t are also termed as weights and amplitude functions respectively they both are dimensionless with values in the range the centred series x t ω i for an area ω i are thus obtained as a linear combination of different amplitude functions projected on the weight vectors for this area the basic equation to determine β k ω i for the case with discharge q expressed in m3 s is written down as 3 j 1 m cov q ω i ω j β k ω j λ k β k ω i i 1 m the covariance matrix cov q ω i ω j in eq 3 between denested time series at gauging stations i and j can be directly estimated from the sample spatial variance covariance matrix c ω i ω j with the known variance covariance matrix we are able to determine β k ω j i e the eigenvectors of this matrix using a standard algebraic eigenvalue numerical procedure for solving eq 3 the scalars λ k are eigenvalues associated with β k ω j and traditionally ordered in a descending sequence i e λ k λ k 1 the kth amplitude functions are then formulated by a weighted average of the observed series at all sites 4 ψ k t i 1 m x t ω i β k ω i the eigenvalues λ k also represent the variance of ψ k t i e σ ψ k 2 λ k a larger value of λ k signifies a less loss of information when using ψ k t to describe original runoff observations gottschalk et al 2015 naturally the 1st function ψ 1 t is best able to describe original observations as it has the highest contribution to variance so how to improve the representativeness of the amplitude functions for an entire basin particularly ψ 1 t is pertinent for this study which will be later expatiated in section 3 the eof theory applies to centred series loève 1945 x t ω i cf eq 1 it is possible to go one step further and apply the eof expansion on standardised series to obtain a new set of amplitude functions eq 1 is then replaced by 1 q t ω i u ω i q t u d u m q ω i σ q ω i u ω i x t u d u m q ω i σ q ω i x t ω i where σ q ω i is the standard deviation of the discharge series for a denested area ω i and x t ω i is the standardised discharge series according to the conventional eof expansion the decomposition of x t ω i is identical with eq 2 but for that case the variance covariance matrix in eq 3 is replaced by the spatial correlation matrix r ω i ω j between discharge series the estimated amplitude functions and weights are of course different between the two cases when centring and standardising johnson and wichern 2007 gottschalk et al 2015 3 conditioned empirical orthogonal functions a modified version of the conventional eof approach hereinafter named the conditioned eof approach ceof is proposed to redefine the amplitude functions obtained from the eof expansion that is originally performed on observed discharge series q t ω i the ceof approach is developed on the condition that coerces the temporal oscillations of the first amplitude function to be exactly identical to those of a reference station within a basin the second third etc amplitude function will thus reveal the deviation in oscillations of the upstream stations in comparison with this reference station this development is expected to simplify the interpretation of the amplitude functions from a hydrologic perspective and allows a simple representation of the importance of the respective amplitude function for explaining temporal variations in runoff when moving upstream along the river system without loss of generality the following interpretation is made for the outlet site taken as this reference station which is confirmed to be reasonable for the application in section 5 in the ceof approach we first reproduce a new set of residual time series q r t ω i by eliminating the linear dependence of original series q t ω i for each denested basin ω i i 1 m on the centred oscillations of the outlet site 5 q r t ω i q t ω i m q ω i ρ q t ω i q t ω σ q ω i σ q ω q t ω m q ω it follows theoretically from eq 5 that q r t ω i has two main mathematical properties first the temporal mean values of each of m denested residual series q r t ω i for any ω i are zero q r t ω i may be somewhat mutually correlated but the correlation between q r t ω i as well as any linear weighted sum of these residual series and the discharge series observed at outlet certainly satisfies ρ q r t ω i q t ω 0 see appendix a i e m denested residual series are all independent of the outlet discharge q t ω second it is provable that the sum of q r t ω i across all m stations at any time instant t would be equal to zero see appendix b i e algebraically a flow value in any time t at one certain station can be estimated as a linear combination of values at the rest of the stations the above mathematical properties of q r t ω i have important implications that we can transform q r t ω i into a set of mutually orthogonal series which all will preserve the orthogonality with the outlet series q t ω or rather there is potentiality for the outlet series to be the proxy as the first amplitude function in accordance with the theoretical properties of eof expansion e g orthogonality shown in section 2 in this context we develop the ceof approach to create such a set of orthogonal series following the procedures as below 1 applying the eof expansion in eq 2 to the residual series q r t ω i and calculating the variance covariance for centred series or correlation for standardised series matrix for q r t ω i 2 using this matrix to estimate the weights of respective amplitude functions via eq 3 due to the singularity in this matrix as indicated by eq 9 the solution will give one eigenvalue equal to zero corresponding to one amplitude function with values of zero hence we obtain m 1 nonzero orthogonal amplitude functions ψ k r t k 1 m 1 for q r t ω i from eq 4 3 the conditioned amplitude functions ϕ k t k 1 m are defined to constitute this orthogonal set the first is identical with the outlet series ϕ 1 t q t ω the second to the m th are equal to the m 1 amplitude functions found for the residual series i e ϕ k t ψ k 1 r t k 2 m 4 implement and evaluation of time series reconstruction 4 1 eof based interpolation scheme the point of departure for the eof based reconstruction of runoff time series is the orthogonal set of amplitude functions afs for a target basin which can be used for estimating q t ω l for a site if the weights β k ω l of them are known at this site ω l denotes the drainage area upstream of the site with a distance l from the outlet of this basin in this study both eof and ceof approaches are applied with two ways for determining afs centred and standardised series for ease of presentation we designate these four specific analyses hereinafter eof centred series eof standardised series ceof centred series and ceof standardised series because the conditioned afs ϕ k t given by the ceof approach in section 3 are altered from those ψ k t we have to re determine the weights β k ω l of the kth af ϕ k t for a target area ω l according to eq 18 in gottschalk et al 2015 β k ω l can be determined directly with the given afs for the respective four analyses 6 β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ ψ k σ q for eof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ ψ k for eof standardised series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ ϕ k σ q for ceof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ ϕ k for ceof standardised series where ρ is the correlation between the discharge series q t ω l for an area ω l and the respective af i e ψ k t or ϕ k t their standard deviation is denoted by σ ψ k and σ ϕ k respectively for practical reasons we will replace the afs ψ k t and or ϕ k t k 1 m by their respective standardised values namely ψ k t ψ k t σ ψ k and or ϕ k t ϕ k t σ ϕ k such that all standardised afs have a mean value equal to zero and a standard deviation of one the weights β k ω l corresponding to these standardised afs are then obtained as 7 β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ q for eof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t for eof standardised series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ q for ceof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t for ceof standardised series where β k ω l are identical to the correlations for the case of standardised series being dimensionless and satisfying ρ q t ω l ψ k t ρ q t ω l ψ k t the formula for reconstruction of discharge time series is given by returning back the standardised afs ψ k t and the weights β k ω l to eqs 1 and 1 for the eof approach note that the final expressions are the same for centred and standardised series 8 q t ω l m q x ω l m q k 1 m β k ω l ψ k t eof centred series m q σ q x ω l m q σ q k 1 m β k ω l ψ k t eof standardised series m q σ q k 1 m ρ q t ω l ψ k t ψ k t and in a similar way but replacing ψ k t with ϕ k t for the ceof approach the formula becomes for both centred and standardised series 9 q t ω l m q σ q k 1 m ρ q t ω l ϕ k t ϕ k t in this paper we consider two situations for application of eqs 8 and 9 in the first situation the discharge series for an area ω l is one of the m records that are used for estimating afs as shown by eqs 8 and 9 the accuracy of reconstructions will increase with the growing number of components k ψ 1 t ψ 2 t ψ k t or ϕ 1 t ϕ 2 t ϕ k t when using all m components i e k m the full pattern of variation for original series at any of the m sites is able to be recovered it is then of interest to understand how the different afs contribute to the reconstruction of the original series or in other terms how quick the explained variances of the afs converge towards 100 coverage as a function of k the relative explained variance r k 2 for k components in a basin ω l is calculated by also valid using ϕ k t 10 r k 2 k 1 k ρ q t ω l ψ 1 t 2 k 1 m l i m k m r k 2 1 in the second situation there exists an observation record of discharge at a site but it contains gaps compared to that of the m records used for determining afs this task is to reconstruct missing data by applying eqs 8 and 9 with the three types of inputs the mean value m q the standard deviation σ q and the correlations with the standardised afs which can be estimated from the available though incomplete runoff records besides the approaches are certainly useful for predicting unknown runoff time series at ungauged sites gottschalk et al 2015 and in that case would need a spatial mapping of runoff statistics gottschalk et al 2006 gottschalk et al 2011 4 2 comparison against common interpolation methods the potentiality of the eof based approaches is further examined in comparison with other interpolation methods i e nearest neighbour including three schemes aliased as nn nna nnm respectively linear regression lr and inverse weighting distance idw which are very commonly applied methods in the literature woodhouse et al 2006 similarly these chosen methods also establish interpolators based on a linear weighting relationship between the target and control stations and do not need external covariates for data infilling details concerning their respective formulation and characteristics are briefly summarised in table 2 a twofold cross validation is routinely used to facilitate the evaluation of interpolation results for all stations that actually have available complete runoff series records the original observation series of a target station is randomly divided into two datasets of equal size with one set used to calibrate interpolators and the other treated as missing data for validation this operation is conducted alternatively in successive rounds such that each of the two subsets can be estimated and then compared with original data it is worth noting that a practical issue of generating negative estimations might appear in the eof based and lr methods as their linear interpolation weights can be either positive or negative but never happens for nearest neighbour and idw table 2 a possible solution could be for example to use logarithmically transformed data for new modelling procedures with the interpolation formulas changed to q t ω l exp m ln q σ ln q k 1 m ρ ln q t ω l ϕ k t ϕ k t for ceof similar formula using ψ k t for eof and q t ω l exp b 0 z b z ln q z t ω l z for lr recently many variants of the compared methods e g regression inverse distance weighting and another several existing infilling techniques including hydrological models covariates dependent regression etc have also been discussed e g wagner et al 2012 bárdossy and pegram 2014 most available comparative studies are concerned more with precipitation variables but those for runoff variables are seldom involved and only restricted on a small number of methods except harvey et al 2012 who provided a comprehensive comparison of 15 methods for infilling daily mean streamflow 4 3 evaluation criteria the overall performance for reconstruction is quantitatively evaluated by two coefficients of efficiency proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse and gupta et al 2009 kge respectively 11 nse 1 t 1 n q obs t q esi t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs t 2 12 kge 1 r 1 2 μ esi μ obs 1 2 σ esi σ obs 1 2 where nse is the most widely used criterion in calibration and validation of hydrologic models for measuring the agreement between estimated esi and observed obs series of length n kge shows a decomposition of nse incorporating three components the correlation r the bias and the measure of relative variability in the estimated and observed series μ and σ are mean and standard deviation of a series respectively additionally how well the statistical properties of runoff time series can be recovered is taken into account by assessing the relative error re assuming a benchmark of 100 in the average standard deviation median minimum and maximum between esi and obs hydrographs 13 re 100 θ esi θ obs θ obs 100 where θ is a general representation for the above statistics 5 application in this section the eof and ceof approaches are evaluated through an application to runoff data from the study area of the ganjiang basin china and further compared with other five common interpolation schemes described in section 4 2 5 1 study area and data the ganjiang is a major tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 originating from wuyi mountain and flowing across jiangxi province from south to north with a total length of 766 km it serves as the important artery of water transport in jiangxi province and also the major stream segment of yue gan canal the ganjiang basin is the largest sub catchment of the poyang lake water system and connected with the yangtze river through the poyang lake situated in the southeast of china this basin has a total drainage area about 83 500 km2 with a ladder like geomorphologic pattern along rivers the mountains and hills govern the headstream of the basin in the south covering 64 7 of the entire drainage area while lower reaches comprise mostly the valley plains in the north this basin belongs to a subtropical humid monsoon climate with abundant precipitation average 1580 mm yr for the entire basin there is a markedly uneven temporal spatial distribution of rainfall the heavy rainfalls frequently occur in the plum rain season from april to june and between july and september the strong rainfall zone above 1800 mm yr on average clusters in the mountainous reach while the weak rainfall zone below 1400 mm yr on average in the central part and the lower reach in this study waizhou station defines the outlet site and the catchment upstream of this site covering about 97 of the total drainage area of the ganjiang basin represents the study area in this area we have available observation records of monthly runoff time series from 1965 to 1987 totally 23 years 276 monthly data for 28 gauging stations the geographic locations of these gauging stations are shown in fig 1 most of them are headwater sites and only five are situated on the major tributaries of the ganjiang waizhou xiajiang ji an dongbei fengkengkou the size of the sub catchments upstream of the respective stations varies from 230 to 80 948 km2 the runoff data of respective stations are officially provided by the yangtze river water resources commission the 23 out of 28 gauging stations offer complete discharge records for the period 1965 1987 which have been earlier applied for testing the two parameter monthly water balance model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and also successfully used in other studies e g xiong et al 2014 yu et al 2015 the rest five gauging stations have incomplete records with different number of missing monthly data 12 65 gaps table 1 summarises the basic statistical information for the 28 runoff series according to their respective available records 5 2 eof based decomposition analysis of amplitude functions and weights define the ganjiang basin being the total domain ω controlled by waizhou outlet station the basin is divided into 23 denested areas related to the respective gauging station in them without asterisk in table 1 the 23 complete time series of length 276 constitute one observation sample set which is then transformed into centred series by eq 1 and standardised series by eq 1 to calculate the variance covariance and correlation matrices respectively by inserting the matrices to eqs 3 and 4 this sample set is decomposed into afs and weights both are outcomes of a pure numerical operation of standard algebraic eigenvalue problem the above calculations conform to the eof centred series and eof standardised series analyses for the ceof approach given in section 3 the observation sample set is replaced by the set of residual series q r t ω i before conducting an eof expansion in order to obtain the conditioned afs and weights we choose the outlet waizhou as the reference station and accordingly its time series as the first af because the discharge series at this station highly correlates with most stations elsewhere within the ganjiang basin and it also follows a strong upstream downstream dependence of the discharge in a large basin the set of afs remains the same dimensionality as the sample residual set with a total number of 23 and a length of 276 for each af see an example in fig 2 the 1st af has the most important influence to reflect the average variation pattern of monthly discharge note that it is identical to the series at the outlet waizhou for the ceof approach while the 2nd and higher order afs indicate different shifts from this pattern krasovskaia et al 1999 with large discrepancies that are related to the relatively large influence of the basins with high discharge in case of centred series and are related to the even influence given to all series irrespective of the magnitude of discharge in case of standardised series gottschalk et al 2015 we analyse the monthly variation patterns of each afs by averaging the 276 values according to respective months and interpret the hydrological implication of these dimensionless afs fig 3 presents the results of the first four afs in the four eof analyses the 1st af shows an similar variation pattern with a convex curve that gives high flows during summer months and low flows during dry seasons and that shown in fig 3c and d exactly reflects the average monthly runoff variations in outlet waizhou in fig 3a and c where centred data are used the variation patterns of afs vary not much between the eof and ceof approaches the 2nd af is basically dominated by a marked peak for july the 3rd af by a peak in april and the 4th af by a change in sign having negative values for the period february to june and positive for the rest of the year this result would lead to different effects on the runoff variation pattern for example the oscillation of the 2nd af would show a later annual high peak for its positive correlation with series q t ω l and an earlier peak for a negative correlation for the 3rd af a positive correlation would give the result of more discharge in early spring and vice versa the 4th function can be associated with relatively higher discharge during the first half of the year if the correlation is negative and the result is reversed for a positive correlation when using standardised series fig 3b and d the 2nd af is dominated by double peaks in april and july i e at the start and the end of the high flow period the peaks will be less pronounced for a negative correlation but more peaked when the correlation is positive large differences begin from the 3rd af in fig 3b the 3rd af is characterised by a negative peak in april and a positive one in june thus giving rise to an earlier high flow for a negative correlation and a later one if the correlation is positive however the results become opposite in fig 3d the 4th af presents an earlier positive peak and a later negative one the ceof standardised series analysis has an obvious lag time for the positive peak when comparing with the eof standardised series analysis the relative explained variance as a function of the number of components is investigated for all observed 23 series using eq 10 this information is helpful to obtain an insight into the overall performance of recovering time series a preferred approach should yield the lowest bias of estimation largest explained variance with the fewest components fig 4 gives the average median minimum and maximum explained variances across the 23 series for the eof centred series eof standardised series ceof centred series and ceof standardised series analyses the graphs confirm that the variance in the original series in all cases can be recovered to 100 but the number of necessary components to reach a satisfactory level of accuracy differs among the stations and among the analyses overall the eof and ceof approaches with standardised series perform better than those with centred series although the results are reversed to an advantage for centred data for very large nested basins e g ji an but the difference is less than 1 being negligibly small for example they can offer an explained variance that approximates or exceeds 0 9 in about 20 out of 23 stations with at most four components it is noted that the obvious differences occur in minimum explained variances which mostly result from one small headwater station chuzhou this station has a rather different oscillation pattern as its coefficient of variation is minor compared to most other stations therefore a low importance will be given to this station when estimating afs from centred data and the relative explained variance will accordingly converge slowly towards full coverage of 100 only when all components are included with standardised data all stations are given equal importance and the convergence at chuzhou station is thus quicker than using centred data although it is still the lowest among all stations the weights of the kth afs are calculated using eq 7 for all the 28 stations by the four eof analyses for conciseness fig 5 only depicts the weights of the first four afs determined by the ceof centred series analysis the values of the 1st weight show an increasing tendency in a downstream direction and the lower one is found in the headwater stations especially for those in mountain regions at high elevations with the growing order of afs the variation patterns of their weights along river networks become more complex but the outlet waizhou always show a value around

basin is implemented using eqs 8 and 9 according to the four eof analyses under two situations section 4 1 i e for the complete 23 observation series and 5 series with real missing data table 1 the performance of the different analyses is compared by addressing whether an acceptably high accuracy as measured by nse and kge coefficients for estimations of observed time series can be reached how quick the rate of convergence measured as a function of the number of components and how many stations can reach this level and how well the statistical properties average standard deviation median minimum and maximum of observed time series would be recovered 5 3 1 validation for original series with complete records fig 6 shows the nse and kge values of the estimated time series for the 23 stations using one to four components from the respective eof analyses it is found that the coefficients nse and kge present an increasing rate of convergence towards high efficiency in a downstream direction the fastest convergence occurs in the stations on the main stream of the ganjiang e g waizhou ji an dongbei where a very adequate result beyond 0 9 for both nse and kge is reached by only one to two components however the values of nse and kge tend to increase slowly in some small headwater stations e g chuzhou dutou this may be because these headwater stations are all situated at high elevation in non perennial basins with runoff regimes mainly influenced by snowmelt and low temperature and characterised by extremely low flows even approaching zero in many months in comparison with large basins such irregular runoff regimes would possibly be more easily hidden since no extra upstream information can be accessed and presumably fewer components are insufficient to accurately catch the runoff variations in those headwater stations in fig 6 results with standardised series in red or green colour are often better more stations show higher nse or kge values than those with centred series for all stations except individual ones e g chuzhou dutou when using one to four components we further compare the results between the eof standardised series and ceof standardised series analyses in the case of four components only one clear difference not less than 0 1 occurs when looking at the nse value in chuzhou station in this station the former analysis gives the higher nse value but the ceof standardised series analysis shows a slight advantage in the total number of stations with higher performances i e 57 13 out of 23 stations for nse and 61 14 stations for kge fig 7 shows the boxplots for relative errors res in the five statistics across the 23 estimated series when using one to four components from different eof analyses overall the identified best two analyses i e eof standardised series and ceof standardised series are able to provide better restorations of statistics to approach 100 benchmark there appear no remarkable differences in res 20 between them but similar to what are found in nse and kge values the latter analysis shows a slight preponderance in the total number of stations with lower bias in reproducing statistical properties of original runoff data in fig 7a the average is exactly unbiased estimation for observed data as essentially depending on eqs 8 and 9 an overestimation in the median and an underestimation in the standard deviation are noted in fig 7a and c most of their biases can be controlled within 10 limits when four components are used this result is indirectly reflected in extreme flow estimations that the minimum maximum does exhibit significant overestimations underestimations such results become more prominent in individual headwater stations especially when estimating the minima while stations with large areas still produce very good results within an error margin of 3 using only one to two components it is commonly known that the low and high flows are more unstable with a changing pattern from one station to the other gottschalk et al 2015 and thus easily lead to a less accurate prediction for extreme values fig 8 gives an illustration of reconstructed versus observed series in ji an dongbei dutou and chuzhou stations including both large nested and small headwater basins when using four components determined by the identified best two analyses 5 3 2 validation for incomplete series with gaps appling the afs ϕ k t and ψ k t obtained from the 23 complete series to eqs 8 and 9 with the inputs of estimated mean and standard deviation columns 2 and 3 in table 1 the missing data in the five stations ruijin anhe luxi xiajiang mukou are restored fig 9 shows the nse and kge coefficients as a function of the number of components determined by the four eof analyses here only one to six components are presented for detecting the rate of convergence towards a satisfactory efficiency the result indicates that an increase in the number of components does not necessarily mean an improvement in accuracy for gap filling one typical example herein is found in mukou station where the highest efficiency around 0 85 is given with two components but then a reduction in accuracy happens while using more components the large nested basin upstream of xiajiang station quickly achieves very adequate interpolation with only one component that the estimation is almost identical to the observation both nse and kge are above 0 95 except for the eof centred series analysis the headwater stations ruijin and luxi also have a quicker convergence to approach 0 9 and 0 87 respectively when using four components anhe station presents a moderately good result of efficiency around 0 8 with two components fig 10 evaluates the res of the estimated average standard deviation median minimum and maximum with respect to the observed values using different number of components for the five stations i e four for ruijin two for anhe four for luxi one for xiajiang and two for mukou in these five stations all statistics except minimum flow show the appropriate results with errors controlled within 20 using no more than four components large deviations in the minimum estimations exist at ruijin luxi xiajiang and mukou stations for this the ceof approach shows certain superiority over the eof approach offering lower deviations of roughly 3 50 from the 100 benchmark but the improvements brought by it still do not meet a high accuracy for ruijin and luxi stations the ceof approach shows a faster convergence towards unbiased estimation for statistics within 10 limits of res via only one component at xiajiang station whereas the eof approach needs more two to three components for this level in this large basin the differences between the use of centred and standardised series are negligible i e they yield equally good results in small headwater stations ruijin luxi and mukou the ceof approach performs better with standardised series than using centred series fig 11 depicts the results of complete time series reconstructed by the ceof standardised series analysis in comparison with the observed series 5 4 assessment of different interpolation methods table 3 summarises the results of nse kge and re values for the 28 stations when comparing the optimal interpolation schemes of eof and ceof approaches cf section 5 3 to the other five common schemes i e nn nna nnm lr and idw shown in table 2 the results indicate that the eof based approaches perform much better than the remaining compared methods rankings ceof eof lr nnm idw nn especially in case of large temporal or spatial variability in runoff series basically these five schemes interpolate runoff time series by simply repeating calculations separately for each individual target time or site but overlooking the specific nature of runoff data i e being continuously ordered along river networks with local support gottschalk et al 2015 they include no procedures comparable with eof based approaches that can maintain space time statistical relationships in upstream downstream runoff data and guarantee temporal and spatial consistency in estimated series this therefore leads to the poor application result that enormous estimation deviations from observed values often occur when control stations though geographically close are located at the confluence or different tributary of rivers showing considerably different runoff variation patterns from the target station e g chuzhou vs its nearby station dongbei utilising spatial correlation of runoff is shown to be slightly better than only considering geometrical positions see table 3 for lr and idw results the results of the low performances in individual small headwater stations e g chuzhou given by the eof based approaches are found to be even worse when using the five compared schemes such problematic results might imply dangers of lacking of a direct or strong physical basis for explaining the causality of hydrological processes when applying the data driven methods to interpolate runoff time series which should be further studied 6 discussion and conclusion in this study problem for reconstruction of missing runoff time series is tackled focusing on a stochastic interpolation approach of empirical orthogonal functions eof gottschalk et al 2015 developed a theoretically strict formulation of the eof approach for application to interpolation of discharge data and showed several advantages of the approach this approach expands discharge series that develop in time across a set of observation points in a drainage basin into a spatiotemporal random process it is theoretically sound and applicable to a large basin characterised by complex hydrological regimes and different situations of data missing it can efficiently achieve large amount of spatiotemporal interpolations in a short runtime because the algorithms are simple i e a standard algebraic problem apart from these advantages the eof approach is capable to address the case when complete records of other measurements that are heavily relied on by some interpolation methods are not available either for instance long historical precipitation observations as a main driver to run rainfall runoff models we introduce further advantages by allowing the eof expansion to be conditioned on the oscillations at the outlet station of a target drainage basin or any reference station and develop the conditioned eof ceof approach gottschalk et al 2015 showed that following the rather elaborated scheme of the eof approach the oscillation of the first amplitude function was almost identical to that of the series at the outlet by applying the proposed ceof approach this is achieved in a much simpler way with less computational efforts a motivation for introducing ceof approach has been to allow a more transparent hydrological interpretation of the dimensionless amplitude functions and the weights the very strong upstream downstream dependence of the discharge in a river system is revealed through the high correlation with the first amplitude function everywhere in the basin although with a decay moving upstream from the outlet amplitude functions of higher order show the deviations from this main pattern that can be interpreted in terms of a concentrated high flow an earlier or later start of the high flow season and a more or less base flow during the dry season the devise of these new amplitude functions thus enables a clear representation of the importance of respective amplitude functions for explaining temporal variations in runoff at different sites and further to make a more accurate interpolation as expected the basic novelty of this approach is to create a set of residual series by removing the dependence with the outlet series from all denested series the residual series yield a zero sum across all series for each time step and this gives rise to a singular variance covariance correlation matrix with one eigenvalue equal to zero the number of amplitude functions that are determined from the residual series is thus one less than the number of discharge series available this makes sense as the first amplitude function has already been defined namely the oscillations at the reference station and other functions of the eof expansion reveal the deviations in oscillations at other stations in the basin with respect to this reference oscillation the obtained new amplitude functions are linear combinations of all original series this implies that these functions in their turn can be combined to linear weighted sums that recover exactly the observed series the formula for reconstructing complete runoff time series becomes easily understandable with three parameters i e the mean the standard deviation and the eof expansion in terms of correlation coefficients and standardised amplitude functions the above theoretical facts for the ceof approach have been demonstrated on the application to runoff time series in the 28 stations of the ganjiang basin we compare the performance of the eof and ceof approaches for interpolation problem and analyse their convergences towards high efficiencies as a function of the number of amplitude functions components the ceof approach presents a slightly better ability to reconstruct missing data than the eof approach in terms of a larger total number of stations with better results when infilling the gaps in incomplete series the accuracy of estimations varies among stations depending on the hydrological regimes location of stations lengths of data missing etc for example the results for larger nested basins are always better than those for small headwater basins with quicker convergences no more than three components and lower relative errors in both hydrographs and statistical properties this result has been early reported in gottschalk et al 2015 with deep interpretations the key issue that matters the efficiency of the eof approach mainly lies in the accuracy of estimation in low flows for which the developed ceof approach has presented certain improvements in most stations in this study in the eof ceof approaches there are two alternatives for estimating the amplitude functions centred and standardised series it is known that analyses with centred series give a correct account of the variance contribution for the individual series to the total variance across all series at different sites while they show equal importance for the sites with standardised series so using standardised series can improve the estimation efficiency for small basins where the oscillation diverges from the general one with fewer components than applying centred series that gives low weights for these basins but for large basins they both give good results the outcomes in our experience may change from one application to another the recommendation is therefore to use both alternatives for determining amplitude functions and then evaluate which of them will yield the best results comparative studies with other five common interpolation schemes i e nn nna nnm lr and idw highlight the principle advantage of eof based approaches in generating runoff time series at as many sites as expected that are consistent with respect to statistical properties in time and space e g mean standard deviation spatial correlation and that furthermore preserve upstream downstream relations for large data scarce basins the eof based approaches have the added capability of indicating the quality of data e g suspected errors and outliers stations with rather different variation pattern than all other stations and thus the possible precision in estimated series at different sites eq 10 so although the unsatisfactory result that individual small headwater stations have low infilling accuracies exists in all the compared methods it can be earlier foreseen and improved by the eof based methods to better fix this problem due to the weakness in estimating rather different runoff variation patterns incorporating the proposed ceof approach with a priori process based knowledge to explain the

gottschalk et al 2015 when applying to short time scale a very slow convergence for interpolation may be expected i e many components will be needed for an acceptably high accuracy due to the possible impact of river basin dynamics such as the time lag of respective upstream sub basin to reach downstream site however such impact is not prominent in this study as the concave form of the autocorrelation curves gottschalk et al 2011 shown in fig 12 demonstrates that the time of concentration in the ganjiang basin is less than the temporal resolution of one month we use here with the

7554,reconstruction of missing runoff data is of important significance to solve contradictions between the common situation of gaps and the fundamental necessity of complete time series for reliable hydrological research the conventional empirical orthogonal functions eof approach has been documented to be useful for interpolating hydrological series based upon spatiotemporal decomposition of runoff variation patterns without additional measurements e g precipitation land cover this study develops a new eof based approach abbreviated as ceof that conditions eof expansion on the oscillations at outlet or any other reference station of a target basin and creates a set of residual series by removing the dependence on this reference series in order to redefine the amplitude functions components this development allows a transparent hydrological interpretation of the dimensionless components and thereby strengthens their capacities to explain various runoff regimes in a basin the two approaches are demonstrated on an application of discharge observations from the ganjiang basin china two alternatives for determining amplitude functions based on centred and standardised series respectively are tested the convergence in the reconstruction of observations at different sites as a function of the number of components and its relation to the characteristics of the site are analysed results indicate that the ceof approach offers an efficient way to restore runoff records with only one to four components it shows more superiority in nested large basins than at headwater sites and often performs better than the eof approach when using standardised series especially in improving infilling accuracy for low flows comparisons against other interpolation methods i e nearest neighbour linear regression inverse distance weighting further confirm the advantage of the eof based approaches in avoiding spatial and temporal inconsistencies in estimated series keywords empirical orthogonal functions amplitude functions reconstruction gap filling runoff time series 1 introduction availability of complete runoff time series is essential for hydrological studies on such as hydraulic infrastructures design water resources management and flood or drought forecasting unfortunately there usually exists such a predicament that data are poorly recorded due to accidental or human induced causes the loss of information resulting from the adverse impact of scarce records threatens the reliability of hydrological studies which consequently poses great demands on reconstruction of missing data gottschalk et al 2015 problem of interpolation for gaps in incomplete time series has long been an interesting topic in hydrologic environmental and other geoscientific studies several methods are proposed and applied successfully within their own applicable scopes such as the auto regression model and its various derivatives tencaliec et al

modelling bárdossy and pegram 2014 and the classical methods of objective analysis like gandin interpolation gandin 1965 and empirical orthogonal functions eof approach gottschalk et al 2015 in addition to the aforementioned methods interpolation of missing data has also been achieved by using process based approaches e g running a rainfall runoff model hisdal and tveito 1993 wagner et al 2012 or by incorporating artificial intelligence like artificial neural network coulibaly and evora 2007 kim and pachepsky 2010 or fuzzy logic theory abebe et al 2000 it has been widely acknowledged that improvements for the accuracy of reconstructed time series for a large basin are still challenging tasks in consideration of the inherent deficiencies in some existing approaches such as computational complexity a certain level of subjectivity in calibration and validation of models or absence of prerequisite for other covariate measurements pappas et al 2014 tencaliec et al 2015 selection of a suitable infilling method often depends on the type of interpolated variables in different disciplines spatial and temporal distribution features of gaps and application conditions of interpolation formulation gottschalk et al 2011 in this paper reconstruction of missing runoff series is investigated with an emphasis on the eof approach in different publications this approach is also perceived as principal component analysis factor analysis and karhunen loève expansion in stochastic approach gottschalk et al 2015 it allows an analysis of spatiotemporal variation by characterising the variance covariance correlation structure of runoff series seen as a random process that evolves in space and time over a common period and decomposing observed series into a linear combination of orthogonal patterns and uncorrelated components amplitude functions in spatial and temporal domain the determined amplitude functions invariant across sites in a target region can be then applied for a large scale interpolation of incomplete runoff series at any site in this region for not only intermittent time slices but also successively long term time periods the eof approach being originally popular in the scientific progress of meteorology and climatology has increasingly received attention in hydrology as a useful tool for e g dimensionality reduction pattern recognition of hydrological characteristics classification of runoff pattern description of runoff characteristics gottschalk 1985 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1995 krasovskaia et al 1999 2003 johnston and shmagin 2008 ionita et al 2014 li et al 2017 and more importantly as a powerful stochastic interpolation scheme for mapping of river runoff series across space and time creutin and obled 1982 obled and creutin 1987 hisdal and tveito 1992 1993 gottschalk 1993 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1995 sauquet et al 2000 2008 beckers and rixen 2003 henn et al 2013 gottschalk et al 2015 obled and braud 1989 for example hisdal and tveito 1993 compared the eof approach with linear regression and hydrological model for reconstructing daily runoff series from nine basins in southern norway and concluded that the eof approach yielded results as good as the other two beckers and rixen 2003 interpolated the incomplete oceanographic datasets based on the ordinary eof approach henn et al 2013 studied the eof approach for filling in gaps in hourly near surface air temperature data and found that the approach was sensitive to the vertical separation of stations and spatial correlation between them gottschalk et al 2015 applied the ordinary eof approach to interpolate the monthly runoff in the upper magdalena river colombia for gauging stations with missing records and for ungauged sites they pointed out that the moderately good results in some mountain headwater stations could be ascribed to the relatively weaker representation of the amplitude functions at these sites where runoff series might tend to present irregular variability since the amplitude functions are rarely explained with a clear hydrological meaning investigation on how to enhance their physical significance becomes necessary to improve the capacity for accounting for various runoff regimes in a basin with the above background the main aim of this paper is to develop the new algorithm based on the eof approach namely the conditioned eof ceof approach to improve the accuracy of reconstruction of missing data the mathematical treatment of this algorithm is presented in section 3 following a brief presentation of the theoretical background of the conventional eof approach in section 2 section 4 describes how to reconstruct complete time series using the eof and ceof approaches and further employs other five interpolation schemes for comparisons all the approaches are evaluated through an application to monthly discharge observations from the 28 gauging stations in the gan river ganjiang china in section 5 we summarise the study in section 6 with the discussion and conclusions 2 background for empirical orthogonal functions the theoretical background of the conventional eof approach is briefly recalled supposing an application to river discharge observations readers interested in more details can refer to gottschalk et al 2015 define the drainage area down to a gauging outlet station as the total domain ω the discharge series at the outlet is denoted by q t ω the denested non overlapping areas ω i i 1 m related to m gauging sites upstream of this outlet station are extracted using ω i a i s ω s so that i 1 m ω i ω where s denotes all sites upstream of site i and a i is the drainage area of site i when i is a headwater site without any upstream site ω i is exactly equal to a i the discharge q t ω i for a denested drainage area ω i is defined as the net discharge after subtracting the inflows from upstream areas except for headwater sites i e q t ω i q t a i s q t a s which can be written as the integral of flows over space u across this area smooth variations are assumed so that the integration can be separated 1 q t ω i u ω i q t u d u m q ω i u ω i x t u d u m q ω i x t ω i where q t ω i is expressed as the sum of long term mean value of the discharge m q ω i for a denested area ω i and the fluctuations around this mean namely the centred discharge series x t ω i in terms of the eof expansion this centred discharge can be linearly decomposed into double orthogonal series of spatial and temporal functions 2 x t ω i k 1 m ψ k t β k ω i where the temporal functions ψ k t k 1 m are known as principal components representing time series that are not directly linked to any specific points of the domain ω the spatial functions β k ω i i e empirical orthogonal functions are the weight coefficients of the kth amplitude function ψ k t for a denested basin ω i in holmström 1970 β k ω i and ψ k t are also termed as weights and amplitude functions respectively they both are dimensionless with values in the range the centred series x t ω i for an area ω i are thus obtained as a linear combination of different amplitude functions projected on the weight vectors for this area the basic equation to determine β k ω i for the case with discharge q expressed in m3 s is written down as 3 j 1 m cov q ω i ω j β k ω j λ k β k ω i i 1 m the covariance matrix cov q ω i ω j in eq 3 between denested time series at gauging stations i and j can be directly estimated from the sample spatial variance covariance matrix c ω i ω j with the known variance covariance matrix we are able to determine β k ω j i e the eigenvectors of this matrix using a standard algebraic eigenvalue numerical procedure for solving eq 3 the scalars λ k are eigenvalues associated with β k ω j and traditionally ordered in a descending sequence i e λ k λ k 1 the kth amplitude functions are then formulated by a weighted average of the observed series at all sites 4 ψ k t i 1 m x t ω i β k ω i the eigenvalues λ k also represent the variance of ψ k t i e σ ψ k 2 λ k a larger value of λ k signifies a less loss of information when using ψ k t to describe original runoff observations gottschalk et al 2015 naturally the 1st function ψ 1 t is best able to describe original observations as it has the highest contribution to variance so how to improve the representativeness of the amplitude functions for an entire basin particularly ψ 1 t is pertinent for this study which will be later expatiated in section 3 the eof theory applies to centred series loève 1945 x t ω i cf eq 1 it is possible to go one step further and apply the eof expansion on standardised series to obtain a new set of amplitude functions eq 1 is then replaced by 1 q t ω i u ω i q t u d u m q ω i σ q ω i u ω i x t u d u m q ω i σ q ω i x t ω i where σ q ω i is the standard deviation of the discharge series for a denested area ω i and x t ω i is the standardised discharge series according to the conventional eof expansion the decomposition of x t ω i is identical with eq 2 but for that case the variance covariance matrix in eq 3 is replaced by the spatial correlation matrix r ω i ω j between discharge series the estimated amplitude functions and weights are of course different between the two cases when centring and standardising johnson and wichern 2007 gottschalk et al 2015 3 conditioned empirical orthogonal functions a modified version of the conventional eof approach hereinafter named the conditioned eof approach ceof is proposed to redefine the amplitude functions obtained from the eof expansion that is originally performed on observed discharge series q t ω i the ceof approach is developed on the condition that coerces the temporal oscillations of the first amplitude function to be exactly identical to those of a reference station within a basin the second third etc amplitude function will thus reveal the deviation in oscillations of the upstream stations in comparison with this reference station this development is expected to simplify the interpretation of the amplitude functions from a hydrologic perspective and allows a simple representation of the importance of the respective amplitude function for explaining temporal variations in runoff when moving upstream along the river system without loss of generality the following interpretation is made for the outlet site taken as this reference station which is confirmed to be reasonable for the application in section 5 in the ceof approach we first reproduce a new set of residual time series q r t ω i by eliminating the linear dependence of original series q t ω i for each denested basin ω i i 1 m on the centred oscillations of the outlet site 5 q r t ω i q t ω i m q ω i ρ q t ω i q t ω σ q ω i σ q ω q t ω m q ω it follows theoretically from eq 5 that q r t ω i has two main mathematical properties first the temporal mean values of each of m denested residual series q r t ω i for any ω i are zero q r t ω i may be somewhat mutually correlated but the correlation between q r t ω i as well as any linear weighted sum of these residual series and the discharge series observed at outlet certainly satisfies ρ q r t ω i q t ω 0 see appendix a i e m denested residual series are all independent of the outlet discharge q t ω second it is provable that the sum of q r t ω i across all m stations at any time instant t would be equal to zero see appendix b i e algebraically a flow value in any time t at one certain station can be estimated as a linear combination of values at the rest of the stations the above mathematical properties of q r t ω i have important implications that we can transform q r t ω i into a set of mutually orthogonal series which all will preserve the orthogonality with the outlet series q t ω or rather there is potentiality for the outlet series to be the proxy as the first amplitude function in accordance with the theoretical properties of eof expansion e g orthogonality shown in section 2 in this context we develop the ceof approach to create such a set of orthogonal series following the procedures as below 1 applying the eof expansion in eq 2 to the residual series q r t ω i and calculating the variance covariance for centred series or correlation for standardised series matrix for q r t ω i 2 using this matrix to estimate the weights of respective amplitude functions via eq 3 due to the singularity in this matrix as indicated by eq 9 the solution will give one eigenvalue equal to zero corresponding to one amplitude function with values of zero hence we obtain m 1 nonzero orthogonal amplitude functions ψ k r t k 1 m 1 for q r t ω i from eq 4 3 the conditioned amplitude functions ϕ k t k 1 m are defined to constitute this orthogonal set the first is identical with the outlet series ϕ 1 t q t ω the second to the m th are equal to the m 1 amplitude functions found for the residual series i e ϕ k t ψ k 1 r t k 2 m 4 implement and evaluation of time series reconstruction 4 1 eof based interpolation scheme the point of departure for the eof based reconstruction of runoff time series is the orthogonal set of amplitude functions afs for a target basin which can be used for estimating q t ω l for a site if the weights β k ω l of them are known at this site ω l denotes the drainage area upstream of the site with a distance l from the outlet of this basin in this study both eof and ceof approaches are applied with two ways for determining afs centred and standardised series for ease of presentation we designate these four specific analyses hereinafter eof centred series eof standardised series ceof centred series and ceof standardised series because the conditioned afs ϕ k t given by the ceof approach in section 3 are altered from those ψ k t we have to re determine the weights β k ω l of the kth af ϕ k t for a target area ω l according to eq 18 in gottschalk et al 2015 β k ω l can be determined directly with the given afs for the respective four analyses 6 β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ ψ k σ q for eof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ ψ k for eof standardised series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ ϕ k σ q for ceof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ ϕ k for ceof standardised series where ρ is the correlation between the discharge series q t ω l for an area ω l and the respective af i e ψ k t or ϕ k t their standard deviation is denoted by σ ψ k and σ ϕ k respectively for practical reasons we will replace the afs ψ k t and or ϕ k t k 1 m by their respective standardised values namely ψ k t ψ k t σ ψ k and or ϕ k t ϕ k t σ ϕ k such that all standardised afs have a mean value equal to zero and a standard deviation of one the weights β k ω l corresponding to these standardised afs are then obtained as 7 β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t σ q for eof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ψ k t for eof standardised series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t σ q for ceof centred series β k ω l ρ q t ω l ϕ k t for ceof standardised series where β k ω l are identical to the correlations for the case of standardised series being dimensionless and satisfying ρ q t ω l ψ k t ρ q t ω l ψ k t the formula for reconstruction of discharge time series is given by returning back the standardised afs ψ k t and the weights β k ω l to eqs 1 and 1 for the eof approach note that the final

ϕ k t in this paper we consider two situations for application of eqs 8 and 9 in the first situation the discharge series for an area ω l is one of the m records that are used for estimating afs as shown by eqs 8 and 9 the accuracy of reconstructions will increase with the growing number of components k ψ 1 t ψ 2 t ψ k t or ϕ 1 t ϕ 2 t ϕ k t when using all m components i e k m the full pattern of variation for original series at any of the m sites is able to be recovered it is then of interest to understand how the different afs contribute to the reconstruction of the original series or in other terms how quick the explained variances of the afs converge towards 100 coverage as a function of k the relative explained variance r k 2 for k components in a basin ω l is calculated by also valid using ϕ k t 10 r k 2 k 1 k ρ q t ω l ψ 1 t 2 k 1 m l i m k m r k 2 1 in the second situation there exists an observation record of discharge at a site but it contains gaps compared to that of the m records used for determining afs this task is to reconstruct missing data by applying eqs 8 and 9 with the three types of inputs the mean value m q the standard deviation σ q and the correlations with the standardised afs which can be estimated from the available though incomplete runoff records besides the approaches are certainly useful for predicting unknown runoff time series at ungauged sites gottschalk et al 2015 and in that case would need a spatial mapping of runoff statistics gottschalk et al 2006 gottschalk et al 2011 4 2 comparison against common interpolation methods the potentiality of the eof based approaches is further examined in comparison with other interpolation methods i e nearest neighbour including three schemes aliased as nn nna nnm respectively linear regression lr and inverse weighting distance idw which are very commonly applied methods in the literature woodhouse et al 2006 similarly these chosen methods also establish interpolators based on a linear weighting relationship between the target and control stations and do not need external covariates for data infilling details concerning their respective formulation and characteristics are briefly summarised in table 2 a twofold cross validation is routinely used to facilitate the evaluation of interpolation results for all stations that actually have available complete runoff series records the original observation series of a target station is randomly divided into two datasets of equal size with one set used to calibrate interpolators and the other treated as missing data for validation this operation is conducted alternatively in successive rounds such that each of the two subsets can be estimated and then compared with original data it is worth noting that a practical issue of generating negative estimations might appear in the eof based and lr methods as their linear interpolation weights can be either positive or negative but never happens for nearest neighbour and idw table 2 a possible solution could be for example to use logarithmically transformed data for new modelling procedures with the interpolation formulas changed to q t ω l exp m ln q σ ln q k 1 m ρ ln q t ω l ϕ k t ϕ k t for ceof similar formula using ψ k t for eof and q t ω l exp b 0 z b z ln q z t ω l z for lr recently many variants of the compared methods e g regression inverse distance weighting and another several existing infilling techniques including hydrological models covariates dependent regression etc have also been discussed e g wagner et al 2012 bárdossy and pegram 2014 most available comparative studies are concerned more with precipitation variables but those for runoff variables are seldom involved and only restricted on a small number of methods except harvey et al 2012 who provided a comprehensive comparison of 15 methods for infilling daily mean streamflow 4 3 evaluation criteria the overall performance for reconstruction is quantitatively evaluated by two coefficients of efficiency proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse and gupta et al 2009 kge respectively 11 nse 1 t 1 n q obs t q esi t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs t 2 12 kge 1 r 1 2 μ esi μ obs 1 2 σ esi σ obs 1 2 where nse is the most widely used criterion in calibration and validation of hydrologic models for measuring the agreement between estimated esi and observed obs series of length n kge shows a decomposition of nse incorporating three components the correlation r the bias and the measure of relative variability in the estimated and observed series μ and σ are mean and standard deviation of a series respectively additionally how well the statistical properties of runoff time series can be recovered is taken into account by assessing the relative error re assuming a benchmark of 100 in the average standard deviation median minimum and maximum between esi and obs hydrographs 13 re 100 θ esi θ obs θ obs 100 where θ is a general representation for the above statistics 5 application in this section the eof and ceof approaches are evaluated through an application to runoff data from the study area of the ganjiang basin china and further compared with other five common interpolation schemes described in section 4 2 5 1 study area and data the ganjiang is a major tributary of the yangtze river fig 1 originating from wuyi mountain and flowing across jiangxi province from south to north with a total length of 766 km it serves as the important artery of water transport in jiangxi province and also the major stream segment of yue gan canal the ganjiang basin is the largest sub catchment of the poyang lake water system and connected with the yangtze river through the poyang lake situated in the southeast of china this basin has a total drainage area about 83 500 km2 with a ladder like geomorphologic pattern along rivers the mountains and hills govern the headstream of the basin in the south covering 64 7 of the entire drainage area while lower reaches comprise mostly the valley plains in the north this basin belongs to a subtropical humid monsoon climate with abundant precipitation average 1580 mm yr for the entire basin there is a markedly uneven temporal spatial distribution of rainfall the heavy rainfalls frequently occur in the plum rain season from april to june and between july and september the strong rainfall zone above 1800 mm yr on average clusters in the mountainous reach while the weak rainfall zone below 1400 mm yr on average in the central part and the lower reach in this study waizhou station defines the outlet site and the catchment upstream of this site covering about 97 of the total drainage area of the ganjiang basin represents the study area in this area we have available observation records of monthly runoff time series from 1965 to 1987 totally 23 years 276 monthly data for 28 gauging stations the geographic locations of these gauging stations are shown in fig 1 most of them are headwater sites and only five are situated on the major tributaries of the ganjiang waizhou xiajiang ji an dongbei fengkengkou the size of the sub catchments upstream of the respective stations varies from 230 to 80 948 km2 the runoff data of respective stations are officially provided by the yangtze river water resources commission the 23 out of 28 gauging stations offer complete discharge records for the period 1965 1987 which have been earlier applied for testing the two parameter monthly water balance model proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and also successfully used in other studies e g xiong et al 2014 yu et al 2015 the rest five gauging stations have incomplete records with different number of missing monthly data 12 65 gaps table 1 summarises the basic statistical information for the 28 runoff series according to their respective available records 5 2 eof based decomposition analysis of amplitude functions and weights define the ganjiang basin being the total domain ω controlled by waizhou outlet station the basin is divided into 23 denested areas related to the respective gauging station in them without asterisk in table 1 the 23 complete time series of length 276 constitute one observation sample set which is then transformed into centred series by eq 1 and standardised series by eq 1 to calculate the variance covariance and correlation matrices respectively by inserting the matrices to eqs 3 and 4 this sample set is decomposed into afs and weights both are outcomes of a pure numerical operation of standard algebraic eigenvalue problem the above calculations conform to the eof centred series and eof standardised series analyses for the ceof approach given in section 3 the observation sample set is replaced by the set of residual series q r t ω i before conducting an eof expansion in order to obtain the conditioned afs and weights we choose the outlet waizhou as the reference station and accordingly its time series as the first af because the discharge series at this station highly correlates with most stations elsewhere within the ganjiang basin and it also follows a strong upstream downstream dependence of the discharge in a large basin the set of afs remains the same dimensionality as the sample residual set with a total number of 23 and a length of 276 for each af see an example in fig 2 the 1st af has the most important influence to reflect the average variation pattern of monthly discharge note that it is identical to the series at the outlet waizhou for the ceof approach while the 2nd and higher order afs indicate different shifts from this pattern krasovskaia et al 1999 with large discrepancies that are related to the relatively large influence of the basins with high discharge in case of centred series and are related to the even influence given to all series irrespective of the magnitude of discharge in case of standardised series gottschalk et al 2015 we analyse the monthly variation patterns of each afs by averaging the 276 values according to respective months and interpret the hydrological implication of these dimensionless afs fig 3 presents the results of the first four afs in the four eof analyses the 1st af shows an similar variation pattern with a convex curve that gives high flows during summer months and low flows during dry seasons and that shown in fig 3c and d exactly reflects the average monthly runoff variations in outlet waizhou in fig 3a and c where centred data are used the variation patterns of afs vary not much between the eof and ceof approaches the 2nd af is basically dominated by a marked peak for july the 3rd af by a peak in april and the 4th af by a change in sign having negative values for the period february to june and positive for the rest of the year this result would lead to different effects on the runoff variation pattern for example the oscillation of the 2nd af would show a later annual high peak for its positive correlation with series q t ω l and an earlier peak for a negative correlation for the 3rd af a positive correlation would give the result of more discharge in early spring and vice versa the 4th function can be associated with relatively higher discharge during the first half of the year if the correlation is negative and the result is reversed for a positive correlation when using standardised series fig 3b and d the 2nd af is dominated by double peaks in april and july i e at the start and the end of the high flow period the peaks will be less pronounced for a negative correlation but more peaked when the correlation is positive large differences begin from the 3rd af in fig 3b the 3rd af is characterised by a negative peak in april and a positive one in june thus giving rise to an earlier high flow for a negative correlation and a later one if the correlation is positive however the results become opposite in fig 3d the 4th af presents an earlier positive peak and a later negative one the ceof standardised series analysis has an obvious lag time for the positive peak when comparing with the eof standardised series analysis the relative explained variance as a function of the number of components is investigated for all observed 23 series using eq 10 this information is helpful to obtain an insight into the overall performance of recovering time series a preferred approach should yield the lowest bias of estimation largest explained variance with the fewest components fig 4 gives the average median minimum and maximum explained variances across the 23 series for the eof centred series eof standardised series ceof centred series and ceof standardised series analyses the graphs confirm that the variance in the original series in all cases can be recovered to 100 but the number of necessary components to reach a satisfactory level of accuracy differs among the stations and among the analyses overall the eof and ceof approaches with standardised series perform better than those with centred series although the results are reversed to an advantage for centred data for very large nested basins e g ji an but the difference is less than 1 being negligibly small for example they can offer an explained variance that approximates or exceeds 0 9 in about 20 out of 23 stations with at most four components it is noted that the obvious differences occur in minimum explained variances which mostly result from one small headwater station chuzhou this station has a rather different oscillation pattern as its coefficient of variation is minor compared to most other stations therefore a low importance will be given to this station when estimating afs from centred data and the relative explained variance will accordingly converge slowly towards full coverage of 100 only when all components are included with standardised data all stations are given equal importance and the convergence at chuzhou station is thus quicker than using centred data although it is still the lowest among all stations the weights of the kth afs are calculated using eq 7 for all the 28 stations by the four eof analyses for conciseness fig 5 only depicts the weights of the first four afs determined by the ceof centred series analysis the values of the 1st weight show an increasing tendency in a downstream direction and the lower one is found in the headwater stations especially for those in mountain regions at high elevations with the growing order of afs the variation patterns of their weights along river networks become more complex but the outlet waizhou always show a value around zero due to the orthogonality i e β k ω l 0 ρ q t ω l 0 ϕ k t ρ ϕ 1 t ϕ k t 0 k 1 5 3 reconstruction of runoff time series using eof ceof approach reconstruction of runoff time series in the ganjiang basin is implemented using eqs 8 and 9 according to the four eof analyses under two situations section 4 1 i e for the complete 23 observation series and 5 series with real missing data table 1 the performance of the different analyses is compared by addressing whether an acceptably high accuracy as measured by nse and kge coefficients for estimations of observed time series can be reached how quick the rate of convergence measured as a function of the number of components and how many stations can reach this level and how well the statistical properties average standard deviation median minimum and maximum of observed time series would be recovered 5 3 1 validation for original series with complete records fig 6 shows the nse and kge values of the estimated time series for the 23 stations using one to four components from the respective eof analyses it is found that the coefficients nse and kge present an increasing rate of convergence towards high efficiency in a downstream direction the fastest convergence occurs in the stations on the main stream of the ganjiang e g waizhou ji an dongbei where a very adequate result beyond 0 9 for both nse and kge is reached by only one to two components however the values of nse and kge tend to increase slowly in some small headwater stations e g chuzhou dutou this may be because these headwater stations are all situated at high elevation in non perennial basins with runoff regimes mainly influenced by snowmelt and low temperature and characterised by extremely low flows even approaching zero in many months in comparison with large basins such irregular runoff regimes would possibly be more easily hidden since no extra upstream information can be accessed and presumably fewer components are insufficient to accurately catch the runoff variations in those headwater stations in fig 6 results with standardised series in red or green colour are often better more stations show higher nse or kge values than those with centred series for all stations except individual ones e g chuzhou dutou when using one to four components we further compare the results between the eof standardised series and ceof standardised series analyses in the case of four components only one clear difference not less than 0 1 occurs when looking at the nse value in chuzhou station in this station the former analysis gives the higher nse value but the ceof standardised series analysis shows a slight advantage in the total number of stations with higher performances i e 57 13 out of 23 stations for nse and 61 14 stations for kge fig 7 shows the boxplots for relative errors res in the five statistics across the 23 estimated series when using one to four components from different eof analyses overall the identified best two analyses i e eof standardised series and ceof standardised series are able to provide better restorations of statistics to approach 100 benchmark there appear no remarkable differences in res 20 between them but similar to what are found in nse and kge values the latter analysis shows a slight preponderance in the total number of stations with lower bias in reproducing statistical properties of original runoff data in fig 7a the average is exactly unbiased estimation for observed data as essentially depending on eqs 8 and 9 an overestimation in the median and an underestimation in the standard deviation are noted in fig 7a and c most of their biases can be controlled within 10 limits when four components are used this result is indirectly reflected in extreme flow estimations that the minimum maximum does exhibit significant overestimations underestimations such results become more prominent in individual headwater stations especially when estimating the minima while stations with large areas still produce very good results within an error margin of 3 using only one to two components it is commonly known that the low and high flows are more unstable with a changing pattern from one station to the other gottschalk et al 2015 and thus easily lead to a less accurate prediction for extreme values fig 8 gives an illustration of reconstructed versus observed series in ji an dongbei dutou and chuzhou stations including both large nested and small headwater basins when using four components determined by the identified best two analyses 5 3 2 validation for incomplete series with gaps appling the afs ϕ k t and ψ k t obtained from the 23 complete series to eqs 8 and 9 with the inputs of estimated mean and standard deviation columns 2 and 3 in table 1 the missing data in the five stations ruijin anhe luxi xiajiang mukou are restored fig 9 shows the nse and kge coefficients as a function of the number of components determined by the four eof analyses here only one to six components are presented for detecting the rate of convergence towards a satisfactory efficiency the result indicates that an increase in the number of components does not necessarily mean an improvement in accuracy for gap filling one typical example herein is found in mukou station where the highest efficiency around 0 85 is given with two components but then a reduction in accuracy happens while using more components the large nested basin upstream of xiajiang station quickly achieves very adequate interpolation with only one component that the estimation is almost identical to the observation both nse and kge are above 0 95 except for the eof centred series analysis the headwater stations ruijin and luxi also have a quicker convergence to approach 0 9 and 0 87 respectively when using four components anhe station presents a moderately good result of efficiency around 0 8 with two components fig 10 evaluates the res of the estimated average standard deviation median minimum and maximum with respect to the observed values using different number of components for the five stations i e four for ruijin two for anhe four for luxi one for xiajiang and two for mukou in these five stations all statistics except minimum flow show the appropriate results with errors controlled within 20 using no more than four components large deviations in the minimum estimations exist at ruijin luxi xiajiang and mukou stations for this the ceof approach shows certain superiority over the eof approach offering lower deviations of roughly 3 50 from the 100 benchmark but the improvements brought by it still do not meet a high accuracy for ruijin and luxi stations the ceof approach shows a faster convergence towards unbiased estimation for statistics within 10 limits of res via only one component at xiajiang station whereas the eof approach needs more two to three components for this level in this large basin the differences between the use of centred and standardised series are negligible i e they yield equally good results in small headwater stations ruijin luxi and mukou the ceof approach performs better with standardised series than using centred series fig 11 depicts the results of complete time series reconstructed by the ceof standardised series analysis in comparison with the observed series 5 4 assessment of different interpolation methods table 3 summarises the results of nse kge and re values for the 28 stations when comparing the optimal interpolation schemes of eof and ceof approaches cf section 5 3 to the other five common schemes i e nn nna nnm lr and idw shown in table 2 the results indicate that the eof based approaches perform much better than the remaining compared methods rankings ceof eof lr nnm idw nn especially in case of large temporal or spatial variability in runoff series basically these five schemes interpolate runoff time series by simply repeating calculations separately for each individual target time or site but overlooking the specific nature of runoff data i e being continuously ordered along river networks with local support gottschalk et al 2015 they include no procedures comparable with eof based approaches that can maintain space time statistical relationships in upstream downstream runoff data and guarantee temporal and spatial consistency in estimated series this therefore leads to the poor application result that enormous estimation deviations from observed values often occur when control stations though geographically close are located at the confluence or different tributary of rivers showing considerably different runoff variation patterns from the target station e g chuzhou vs its nearby station dongbei utilising spatial correlation of runoff is shown to be slightly better than only considering geometrical positions see table 3 for lr and idw results the results of the low performances in individual small headwater stations e g chuzhou given by the eof based approaches are found to be even worse when using the five compared schemes such problematic results might imply dangers of lacking of a direct or strong physical basis for explaining the causality of hydrological processes when applying the data driven methods to interpolate runoff time series which should be further studied 6 discussion and conclusion in this study problem for reconstruction of missing runoff time series is tackled focusing on a stochastic interpolation approach of empirical orthogonal functions eof gottschalk et al 2015 developed a theoretically strict formulation of the eof approach for application to interpolation of discharge data and showed several advantages of the approach this approach expands discharge series that develop in time across a set of observation points in a drainage basin into a spatiotemporal random process it is theoretically sound and applicable to a large basin characterised by complex hydrological regimes and different situations of data missing it can efficiently achieve large amount of spatiotemporal interpolations in a short runtime because the algorithms are simple i e a standard algebraic problem apart from these advantages the eof approach is capable to address the case when complete records of other measurements that are heavily relied on by some interpolation methods are not available either for instance long historical precipitation observations as a main driver to run rainfall runoff models we introduce further advantages by allowing the eof expansion to be conditioned on the oscillations at the outlet station of a target drainage basin or any reference station and develop the conditioned eof ceof approach gottschalk et al 2015 showed that following the rather elaborated scheme of the eof approach the oscillation of the first amplitude function was almost identical to that of the series at the outlet by applying the proposed ceof approach this is achieved in a much simpler way with less computational efforts a motivation for introducing ceof approach has been to allow a more transparent hydrological interpretation of the dimensionless amplitude functions and the weights the very strong upstream downstream dependence of the discharge in a river system is revealed through the high correlation with the first amplitude function everywhere in the basin although with a decay moving upstream from the outlet amplitude functions of higher order show the deviations from this main pattern that can be interpreted in terms of a concentrated high flow an earlier or later start of the high flow season and a more or less base flow during the dry season the devise of these new amplitude functions thus enables a clear representation of the importance of respective amplitude functions for explaining temporal variations in runoff at different sites and further to make a more accurate interpolation as expected the basic novelty of this approach is to create a set of residual series by removing the dependence with the outlet series from all denested series the residual series yield a zero sum across all series for each time step and this gives rise to a singular variance covariance correlation matrix with one eigenvalue equal to zero the number of amplitude functions that are determined from the residual series is thus one less than the number of discharge series available this makes sense as the first amplitude function has already been defined namely the oscillations at the reference station and other functions of the eof expansion reveal the deviations in oscillations at other stations in the basin with respect to this reference oscillation the obtained new amplitude functions are linear combinations of all original series this implies that these functions in their turn can be combined to linear weighted sums that recover exactly the observed series the formula for reconstructing complete runoff time series becomes easily understandable with three parameters i e the mean the standard deviation and the eof expansion in terms of correlation coefficients and standardised amplitude functions the above theoretical facts for the ceof approach have been demonstrated on the application to runoff time series in the 28 stations of the ganjiang basin we compare the performance of the eof and ceof approaches for interpolation problem and analyse their convergences towards high efficiencies as a function of the number of amplitude functions components the ceof approach presents a slightly better ability to reconstruct missing data than the eof approach in terms of a larger total number of stations with better results when infilling the gaps in incomplete series the accuracy of estimations varies among stations depending on the hydrological regimes location of stations lengths of data missing etc for example the results for larger nested basins are always better than those for small headwater basins with quicker convergences no more than three components and lower relative errors in both hydrographs and statistical properties this result has been early reported in gottschalk et al 2015 with deep interpretations the key issue that matters the efficiency of the eof approach mainly lies in the accuracy of estimation in low flows for which the developed ceof approach has presented certain improvements in most stations in this study in the eof ceof approaches there are two alternatives for estimating the amplitude functions centred and standardised series it is known that analyses with centred series give a correct account of the variance contribution for the individual series to the total variance across all series at different sites while they show equal importance for the sites with standardised series so using standardised series can improve the estimation efficiency for small basins where the oscillation diverges from the general one with fewer components than applying centred series that gives low weights for these basins but for large basins they both give good results the outcomes in our experience may change from one application to another the recommendation is therefore to use both alternatives for determining amplitude functions and then evaluate which of them will yield the best results comparative studies with other five common interpolation schemes i e nn nna nnm lr and idw highlight the principle advantage of eof based approaches in generating runoff time series at as many sites as expected that are consistent with respect to statistical properties in time and space e g mean standard deviation spatial correlation and that furthermore preserve upstream downstream relations for large data scarce basins the eof based approaches have the added capability of indicating the quality of data e g suspected errors and outliers stations with rather different variation pattern than all other stations and thus the possible precision in estimated series at different sites eq 10 so although the unsatisfactory result that individual small headwater stations have low infilling accuracies exists in all the compared methods it can be earlier foreseen and improved by the eof based methods to better fix this problem due to the weakness in estimating rather different runoff variation patterns incorporating the proposed ceof approach with a priori process based knowledge to explain the physical generating mechanism of runoff would be promising for future studies acknowledgements the financially support by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51525902 and

gottschalk et al 2015 when applying to short time scale a very slow convergence for interpolation may be expected i e many components will be needed for an acceptably high accuracy due to the possible impact of river basin dynamics such as the time lag of respective upstream sub basin to reach downstream site however such impact is not prominent in this study as the concave form of the
