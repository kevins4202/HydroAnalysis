seof to a single 265 nm light emitting diode led increases irradiation area by 1000x and provides continuous low irradiance of uv c light to a large surface area a zone of inhibition protocol was developed to quantify bacterial growth prevention on an agar plate around one seof the inhibition zone increased linearly with irradiance time until achieving a maximum inhibition zone of 2 5 to 3 cm which received 4 3 mj cm2 of 265 nm light in 2 hours the surviving lawn edge bacterial colonies did not develop uv resistance after two generations of exposure the agar plate remained bio available after uv exposure and bacteria could be grown on pre illuminated area in the absence of uv c light whereas we previously demonstrated seofs can inactivate planktonic bacteria herein we show the

martín sómer et al 2017 oguma et al 2013 song et al 2016 as such there is a need for technologies that distribute light from leds over larger surface areas to prevent biofilm growth we previously showed that a single led can be connected to one side emitting optical fiber seof that can distribute light outward along its entire length to irradiate 150 cm2 lanzarini lopes et al 2019a multiple 10 seofs can be connected to each led thus further increasing the surface area coverage furthermore seofs are bendable and can also be configured into tight or complex geometries recently we fabricated an uv c seof and illustrated potential for planktonic inactivation of escherichia coli e coli lanzarini lopes et al 2019a these optical fibers contain a uv light guiding silica core 1 mm diameter coated with silica nanoparticles 50 to 400 nm diameter and a uv transparent polymer coating cytoptm the polymer coating enables seofs to be flexible without breaking uv c light 265 nm launched from a led travels through the silica core and is scattered by the nanoparticles on the core cladding interface resulting in side emission through the uv transparent coating into its surrounding environment water air higher nanoparticle concentrations on the optical fiber surface of the silica core lead to higher side emission of light however seofs have not yet been shown to control surface bacteria growth and the light intensity µw cm2 required to prevent bacterial growth on surfaces is unknown the objective of this study is to demonstrate the potential of uv c seof for surface inactivation of pathogenic bacteria as illustrated in fig 1 the seof was placed over an agar plate and the zone of inhibition around the fiber was measured to monitor surface microbial growth p aeruginosa was used as the model organism because it is a biofilm forming pathogen vanysacker et al 2013 e coli was also studied for comparison as an indicator organism the lawn edge colonies were re exposed to uv light to study second and third generation increase in uv resistance lastly the bioavailability of the uv radiated agar was assessed by re spreading bacteria over the previous inhibition zone the paper concludes with potential design considerations for using optical fibers for surface microbial inhibition in water applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 uv c seof fabrication as previously described lanzarini lopes et al 2019a a four step process was used to fabricate uv c seofs briefly the coating and cladding was removed from a 1 mm diameter uv transmitting optical fiber ft10000umt thorlabs newton nj usa polished and attached to a ferrule connector o neal tugaoen et al 2018 the selected optical fiber glass is solarized had relatively low uv absorption 15 for 10 cm length and had enough physical strength such that the as received fiber cladding and coating could be manually removed a 10 cm fiber was coated with 400 nm aminated silica spheres suspended in ethanol siand 25m 10 mg ml nanocomposix san diego ca usa the fiber was then submerged in a solution of 0 1 m na2so4 239313 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and coated with a uv transparent polymer cytoptm ctx 109ae bellex international corp wilmington de usa 2 2 coupling uv c led to seof a led was placed approximately 0 5 mm from the proximal end i e nearest the light source of the optical fiber to maximize light input fig 2 shows a schematic of the uv led coupled to the uv c seof mounting parts were purchased from thorlabs unless otherwise noted a 50 mw max power at 500 ma 265 nm led a in fig 2 267 nm peak 40 nm spectral width mounted to a 12 12 mm printed circuit board was purchased from crystal is kl265 50t sm wdm2 island ny usa a 15 mm2 copper plate b followed by a 14 mm2 x 7 mm anodized aluminum heatsink c b07217n5ls amazon seattle wa usa was attached to the back of the led to assure proper semiconductor cooling after soldering copper wires to the electrodes the led was secured to a lens tube d sm1l05 12 7 mm length 25 4 mm diameter by a 6 4 mm expanded ptfe joint sealant e g7816551 zoro buffalo grove il usa shaped as an o ring the uv c side emitting optical fiber f was secured to a stainless steel ferrule multimode fiber connector g 110408 and attached to a fiber adapter plate h sm05sma finally the lens tube adapter i sm1a6fw connected the fiber components to the led in the final set up j the uv c seof is nearly touching the led to optimize light coupling into the fiber the optical fiber and uv led laid horizontal a fan ht 900 honeywell charlotte nc usa was directed to the led to dissipate heat in our apparatus small fans are connected to the back of the led but in scaled up applications other heat sinks i e as used on cell phones could be applied for small scale applications and larger scale applications would require finned heat sinks to dissipate heat from the leds a 450 ma current was delivered to the uv c led for all experiments 2 3 irradiance measurements both the uvc seof light distribution profile and light intensity incident on the agar plate where measured using a spectrophotoradiometer avaspec 2048l avantes louisville co usa calibrated over the wavelength range of 200 to 1100 nm for the light distribution profile uv c irradiance was measured along the length and perpendicular distance from the seof surface the spectrophtoradiometer s sensor tip 5 mm2 was placed normal to the fiber fig 2 the light intensity at the surface was measured by facing the sensor tip upwards 3 mm below the optical fiber the intensity was measured at distances of 0 1 cm 1 45 cm and 2 cm from the optical fiber the total irradiance is obtained by integrating the output spectrum between 250 nm and 280 nm triplicate measurements were taken at each position along independent optical fibers in this study light intensity was measured in air on a black laboratory bench top both the absorbance of air and reflectivity of the benchtop are negligible and should not influence the light distribution profile light attenuation will change for applications in water and other mediums 2 4 cell culture luria bertani lb broth media was prepared according to manufacturer instructions briefly 25 g of lb broth powder 22091 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa was added to 1 l of ultrapure water and autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c p aeruginosa atcc 15692 and e coli atcc 25922 were grown in the media on a shaker plate at 140 rpm in an isotemp incubator maxq 400 fisher scientific hampton nh usa at 37 c for 12 hours the culture was diluted in lb broth 1 10 and grown in the same conditions until it reached an absorption of 1 cm 1 as measured by a spectrophotometer odyssey dr 2500 hach loveland co usa the culture was washed 3 times and resuspended in the wash solution to eliminate uv absorption by the media the wash solution was prepared by diluting 0 9 wt of sodium chloride s7653 sigma aldrich in nano purified water and autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c the process was repeated for each experiment 2 5 uv c exposure and zone of inhibition analysis the zone of inhibition of the uv c seof was measured by placing the fiber on an agar plate spread with a p aeruginosa culture the lb broth agar plates were prepared by dissolving 10 g of tryptic soy agar 2291 sigma aldrich in 1 l of lb broth media the solution was autoclaved cooled and poured in 10 cm2 gridded polystyrene square petri dishes 741470 carolina burlington nc usa once the media solidified 50 µl of the p aeruginosa or e coli solution was spread across the agar to form a lawn as previously described in inhibition zone studies hudzicki 2009 the uv c seof was immediately positioned directly above the agar through two small holes on the side of the plate the plate remained closed to avoid unwanted contamination the plates were exposed to uv c for 0 30 60 120 249 and 480 min in random order triplicates data were obtained using different optical fibers and plates student t test was used to measure the statistical significance of the results where key t test assumptions were met two controls were analyzed in the first control no fiber was added to the plate to visualize a healthy lawn formation in the second control the fiber was placed on the plate without turning on the led this assured that the material properties of the fiber did not have germicidal effects additionally a bare optical fiber was analyzed for comparison this fiber was stripped of the previous coating and coated with the uv transparent polymer without sio2 modification after uv c exposure the plates were incubated at 37 1 c for 24 h the distance between the optical fiber and the p aeruginosa lawns on either side of the optical fiber was measured and recorded as the zone of inhibition the measurement was taken at 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm along the optical fiber length to understand how light attenuation affects zone of inhibition 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv irradiance decreases with distance from seof irradiance was measured along the length l of the seof at 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm and at 0 1 2 3 4 and 6 cm distance d perpendicular to the optical fiber fig 3 shows that there was 19 decrease in the side emitted irradiance from the proximal l 0 cm to distal l 8 cm end when directly adjacent to the fiber d 0 cm because the path of side emitted photons is not directly normal to the optical fiber the localized irradiance is a sum of the irradiance from the entire length of the optical fiber at a given distance from the optical fiber at d 2 0 cm a larger fraction of light rays will reach the spectrophotometer at the center l 4 cm position fig 3 inset shows that light attenuated as distance from the optical fiber increased the localized irradiance dropped from an average of 30 µw cm2 at d 0 cm to 0 5 µw cm2 at d 6 cm light intensity i decreases with distance as the light must spread out over a larger surface for a linear source the relationship is inversely proportional to the distance from the optical fiber this phenomenon is modeled through eq 1 where i 0 is the measured light intensity at d 0 and r 0 is the radius of the optical fiber 0 5 mm it should be noted that 0 5 mm is added at each distance to account for a 0 5 mm air gap between the sensor tip and the sensor 1 i i 0 r 0 r 0 d the model closely follows the data acquired at each distance and is important in understanding the light distribution profile along the length and distance from the fiber however the delivered light to the surface further decreases with distance because the incident angle of photons will continue to increase until the irradiance approaches zero therefore the light intensity that reached the lawn in this study was measured by facing the sensor tip upwards 3 mm below the optical fiber at 1 cm 1 45 cm and 2 cm approximately 19 0 51 µw cm2 15 0 3 µw cm2 and 12 0 17 µw cm2 of the light measured normal to the fiber reaches the lawn surface beyond 2 cm the light intensity on the surface is below detection limit 3 2 uv c seof inhibits microbial growth a uv c seof was placed 3 mm above an agar plate covered with a culture of either p aeruginosa or e coli fig 4 illustrates the e coli lawn after 480 min of irradiation for the optical fiber without sio2 modification fig 4a compared against a uv c seof fig 4b the zone of inhibition is 2 8 cm wide after 480 min of irradiation with the seof in contrast the zone of inhibition is 11x smaller 0 26 cm for no sio2 scattering centers on the optical fiber fig 4 insets show the light distribution along the optical fiber length the image was captured under dark conditions with a paper towel placed below the optical fiber the paper towel fluoresces blue light upon ultraviolet irradiance allowing for visualization of the light distribution throughout the optical fiber the bright spots seen towards the top of both images was due to i light leaving the distal end opposite end as the light source of the optical fiber and ii back reflection at the distal end of the fiber when the light reaches the distal end most of it exits the fiber however a portion of light also reflects towards the optical fiber creating a second input and higher photo density at the distal end the nanoparticles on the seof interacted with the evanescent wave and resulted in side emission through scattering creating the visible side emission glow seen in the fig 4b inset lanzarini lopes et al 2019b this glowing germicidal light enabled microbial inactivation along the length of the optical fiber the observable inactivation along the length of the bare optical fiber is due to natural light scattering that results from surface impurities since these fibers were not prepared in a clean room additionally the zone of inhibition increases slightly towards the distal end of the fiber this is due to the higher photon density that was described earlier 3 3 zone of inhibition increases with uv exposure fig 5 illustrates the zone of inhibition of p aeruginosa fig 5a and e coli fig 5b resulting from uv c seof exposure on an agar plate lawn after 0 30 60 120 240 and 480 min at each exposure time the zone of inhibition was measured at l 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm from the proximal end of the led source along the length of the fiber a dark control was obtained by placing a modified optical fiber in the agar plate without turning on the uv source no inhibition was observed by the dark control indicating that the exterior materials of the optical fiber did not contribute to the germicidal effect of the uv c seof fig 5 shows the zone of inhibition was highest at the proximal end and lower towards the distal end for lower exposure times t 120 min with both p aeruginosa and e coli this observation corresponds with the uv c side emission profile fig 3 as light side emits from the optical fiber the photon density decreases inside the fiber this phenomenon is described by the beer lambert law of attenuation through a waveguide a lower photon density means less light can be emitted through the fiber s side however the path of side emitted photons is not directly normal to the optical fiber at increasing distance from the optical fiber the localized irradiance is a sum of the irradiance emitted from the entire length of the optical fiber fig 5c illustrates that linear increase in zone of inhibition with time reaches a maximum of 2 9 cm at around 240 min of irradiation the uv dose at the edge of the lawn at 240 min is approximately 4 3 mj cm2 irradiance 0 3 μw cm2 between 240 and 480 min there is no statistically significant change in zone of inhibition for either organisms according to the student t test with 95 confidence level p 0 05 the irradiance at 480 min is also 0 3 μw cm2 resulting in double the dose 8 6 mj cm2 for the same zone of inhibition additionally single 12 hour 12 9 mj s and 24 h 25 8 mj s exposure times resulted in 3 0 cm zone of inhibition these results indicate that there is a maximum zone of inhibition mzi that is not solely dependent on dose at the edge of the inhibition zone the localized irradiance is insufficient to either i damage the dna and protein of the organism or ii surpass the rate of dna and protein reconstruction hu et al 2005 quek and hu 2008 uv c radiation at 265 nm is categorized as germicidal because it inhibits pathogens i e bacteria virus protozoa from replicating and infecting a host gayán et al 2013 absorption of uv light by nucleic acids results in crosslinking between thymine and cytosine these mutations disable hydrogen bonds to the purine base of the opposite strand therefore inhibiting replication the amount of cross linked pyrimidine nucleoside bases is directly related to the uv exposure blatchley et al 2001 certain organisms can repair damaged dna when the uv dose is too low this process reverts dna back into its undamaged form branzei and foiani 2008 at the low localized irradiance beyond the mzi then dna repair rates may exceed dna damage rates thus limiting net inactivation of the microorganism the mzi depends on i the sensitivity of the microorganism to uv light and ii the input power of the led by student s t test there is no statistical difference in either mzi or zone of inhibition p 0 05 at each irradiation time of p aeruginosa and e coli through the entire fiber length this result is supported by similar uv sensitivity reported for these organisms for 4 log i e 99 99 inactivation doses range between 3 1 and 17 mj cm2 for planktonic p aeruginosa and between 3 0 and 20 mj cm2 for planktonic e coli abshire and dunton 1981 chatterley and linden 2010 chevrefils et al 2006 clauß 2006 quek and hu 2008 3 4 edge colonies did not illustrate higher uv resistance to understand if the edge colonies fig 1 were more resistant to uv than the bulk colonies the same zone of inhibition experiments were conducted with the edge colonies as the inoculum like the zone of inhibition measurements the uv c seof was placed 3 mm above an agar plate covered with a culture of p aeruginosa after 240 min 4 hr of irradiation the fiber was removed and the plate was incubated for 24 h one isolated colony at the edge of the lawn was resuspended in lb overnight and spread on a new agar plate followed by the cell culture and zone of inhibition analysis procedure the entire process was repeated twice the zone of inhibition after 240 min was then measured to understand if the colonies at the edge of the lawn were more resistant to uv fig 6 illustrates the sequence of experiments where fig 6a is the new plate and fig 6b and 6c illustrate the results after one and two resuspensions respectively the black circles in fig 6a and 6b identify the colonies that were resuspended for the following experiment the mzi of 0 1 and 2 generations are 2 4 cm 2 5 cm and 3 1 cm these results fall within 1 standard deviation of the average zone of inhibition for 240 min of irradiation the protrusions and patchiness patterns in each agar plates result from uneven spread plate pressures and agar scrapes see center of fig 6b overall there was no significant difference in the zone of inhibition after the resuspensions consequently the survival of the edge bacteria is because of insignificant uv irradiance as explained in section 3 2 not because of uv resistance thus the zone of inhibition is a valid measurement to inform the maximum necessary optical fiber distance for complete surface inactivation the uv irradiance that reaches this area is insufficient to either damage the dna and protein of the organism or surpass the rate of dna and protein reconstruction hu et al 2005 quek and hu 2008 however a longer term study with more than two generations of resuspension should be conducted to truly understand whether uv resistance is being developed 3 5 agar plate remained bio available after uv exposure the zone of inhibition is measured by prevention of cell growth on an agar plate it is possible that cells would not grow on the plate if i the cells are damaged or ii the nutrients on the agar plate are no longer bioavailable because of surface damage by uv c light to establish the former as the primary mechanism the p aeruginosa colonies were re spread on the same agar plate after initial uv irradiation figure si 1 illustrates the three steps to this procedure fig si 1a is the p aeruginosa lawn after 240 min of inactivation and 24 hours of incubation figure si 1b illustrates the plate after the lawn has been evenly re spread on the plate figure si 1c illustrates the plate after an additional 24 hours of incubation the cell density on the sides of the initial plate was extremely dense re spreading those cells resulted in streaks and uneven distribution of bacteria throughout the agar plate however there was a clear difference in density before and after 24 hour incubation indicating cell replication the growth of cells on the entire surface of the agar plate illustrates that the agar remained bio available after uv radiation additionally the center of the agar plate had higher cell growth as indicated by opaqueness existing cellular and extracellular material from fig si 1a likely remained on the surface of the agar preventing new cells from using the nutrients underneath them thus we concluded the uv c seof inactivated the microorganisms within the measured zone of inhibition 4 summary and conclusions uv c seofs effectively inactivate p aeruginosa and e coli even on very nutrient rich surfaces subsequent experiments using the edge lawn colonies as the inoculum indicated that the bacteria did not develop significant uv resistance within two generations of exposure re spreading the previously uv radiated plate indicated that microbial growth prevention was due to biological inactivation and not damage to the agar the zone of inhibition at various times was compared without our led and experimental setup the zone of inhibition increased linearly with dose until a mzi of 2 9 0 5 and 2 8 0 5 cm was achieved for p aeruginosa and e coli respectively beyond this mzi distance we surmise that the irradiance reaching the surface is too low to damage the cell faster than the cell can repair its dna the irradiance at the edge of mzi is the minimum irradiance needed to inactivate the bacteria of interest this needs to be considered when designing uv c seof configurations for surface disinfection for example the irradiance fig 3 inset that reaches the mzis of 2 9 is 0 3 µw cm2 to assure full inactivation of p aeruginosa and e coli it is crucial that the localized irradiance in the entire surface of interest is greater than those values the maximum distance between the optical fibers can be varied by changing the input power of the led or decreasing the density of nanoparticles at the surface of the optical fiber higher power to the led would increase side emission irradiance which would also increase the maximum separation distance alternatively lower nanoparticle loadings on the surface of the optical fiber core would decrease the amount of light leaving the optical fiber scattering coefficient at each location thereby decreasing the maximum separation distance because less light is side emitted per distance this modification would enable longer optical fibers to be fabricated these results inform engineering design decisions for surface disinfection with uv c seof for example these optical fibers can be used as spiral wound membrane spacers to prevent biological fouling spacer holes are relatively small 0 1 cm to ensure proper hydraulic turbulence in this configuration long optical fibers with increasing scattering coefficients would be designed to assure even light distribution across the optical fiber mesh this paper provides a proof of concept that uvc seofs can be used for microbial inactivation on surfaces and the flexible nature of seofs allow delivery of light in places conventional uv c lamps or even leds are not practical improvements are possible in terms of power efficiency of leds and maximizing light launch efficiency from led into seofs leds have relatively low power and wall plug efficiency compared to other light sources i e mercury lamps therefore the utilization of the available power is critical chen et al 2017 loeb et al 2019 currently less than 10 of the led emitted light becomes emitted from a single seof due to i 80 of the light lost during launching light from the led into the seof ii 15 absorbed within the optical fiber core and iii 5 lost due to refraction at the end of our relatively short seof custom glass production will be able to manufacture optical fibers with higher transmittance i e less losses of light in the germicidal wavelengths ongoing research is focusing on improving the launching of light between the led and seof with an overall goal of achieving 75 of the led emitted light being side emitted from the optical fiber the seofs described herein can overcome the largest barrier to uv c disinfection optical obstruction in reactors because of bends or suspended particles fig 7 illustrates a schematic of light distribution in a u bend cylindrical geometry a without and b with seof any interference between the linear pathway of a light source and surface will result in non effective surface illumination an seof simulates infinite

c b07217n5ls amazon seattle wa usa was attached to the back of the led to assure proper semiconductor cooling after soldering copper wires to the electrodes the led was secured to a lens tube d sm1l05 12 7 mm length 25 4 mm diameter by a 6 4 mm expanded ptfe joint sealant e g7816551 zoro buffalo grove il usa shaped as an o ring the uv c side emitting optical fiber f was secured to a stainless steel ferrule multimode fiber connector g 110408 and attached to a fiber adapter plate h sm05sma finally the lens tube adapter i sm1a6fw connected the fiber components to the led in the final set up j the uv c seof is nearly touching the led to optimize light coupling into the fiber the optical fiber and uv led laid horizontal a fan ht 900 honeywell charlotte nc usa was directed to the led to dissipate heat in our apparatus small fans are connected to the back of the led but in scaled up applications other heat sinks i e as used on cell phones could be applied for small scale applications and larger scale applications would require finned heat sinks to dissipate heat from the leds a 450 ma current was delivered to the uv c led for all experiments 2 3 irradiance measurements both the uvc seof light distribution profile and light intensity incident on the agar plate where measured using a spectrophotoradiometer avaspec 2048l avantes louisville co usa calibrated over the wavelength range of 200 to 1100 nm for the light distribution profile uv c irradiance was measured along the length and perpendicular distance from the seof surface the spectrophtoradiometer s sensor tip 5 mm2 was placed normal to the fiber fig 2 the light intensity at the surface was measured by facing the sensor tip upwards 3 mm below the optical fiber the intensity was measured at distances of 0 1 cm 1 45 cm and 2 cm from the optical fiber the total irradiance is obtained by integrating the output spectrum between 250 nm and 280 nm triplicate measurements were taken at each position along independent optical fibers in this study light intensity was measured in air on a black laboratory bench top both the absorbance of air and reflectivity of the benchtop are negligible and should not influence the light distribution profile light attenuation will change for applications in water and other mediums 2 4 cell culture luria bertani lb broth media was prepared according to manufacturer instructions briefly 25 g of lb broth powder 22091 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa was added to 1 l of ultrapure water and autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c p aeruginosa atcc 15692 and e coli atcc 25922 were grown in the media on a shaker plate at 140 rpm in an isotemp incubator maxq 400 fisher scientific hampton nh usa at 37 c for 12 hours the culture was diluted in lb broth 1 10 and grown in the same conditions until it reached an absorption of 1 cm 1 as measured by a spectrophotometer odyssey dr 2500 hach loveland co usa the culture was washed 3 times and resuspended in the wash solution to eliminate uv absorption by the media the wash solution was prepared by diluting 0 9 wt of sodium chloride s7653 sigma aldrich in nano purified water and autoclaved for 15 min at 121 c the process was repeated for each experiment 2 5 uv c exposure and zone of inhibition analysis the zone of inhibition of the uv c seof was measured by placing the fiber on an agar plate spread with a p aeruginosa culture the lb broth agar plates were prepared by dissolving 10 g of tryptic soy agar 2291 sigma aldrich in 1 l of lb broth media the solution was autoclaved cooled and poured in 10 cm2 gridded polystyrene square petri dishes 741470 carolina burlington nc usa once the media solidified 50 µl of the p aeruginosa or e coli solution was spread across the agar to form a lawn as previously described in inhibition zone studies hudzicki 2009 the uv c seof was immediately positioned directly above the agar through two small holes on the side of the plate the plate remained closed to avoid unwanted contamination the plates were exposed to uv c for 0 30 60 120 249 and 480 min in random order triplicates data were obtained using different optical fibers and plates student t test was used to measure the statistical significance of the results where key t test assumptions were met two controls were analyzed in the first control no fiber was added to the plate to visualize a healthy lawn formation in the second control the fiber was placed on the plate without turning on the led this assured that the material properties of the fiber did not have germicidal effects additionally a bare optical fiber was analyzed for comparison this fiber was stripped of the previous coating and coated with the uv transparent polymer without sio2 modification after uv c exposure the plates were incubated at 37 1 c for 24 h the distance between the optical fiber and the p aeruginosa lawns on either side of the optical fiber was measured and recorded as the zone of inhibition the measurement was taken at 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm along the optical fiber length to understand how light attenuation affects zone of inhibition 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv irradiance decreases with distance from seof irradiance was measured along the length l of the seof at 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm and at 0 1 2 3 4 and 6 cm distance d perpendicular to the optical fiber fig 3 shows that there was 19 decrease in the side emitted irradiance from the proximal l 0 cm to distal l 8 cm end when directly adjacent to the fiber d 0 cm because the path of side emitted photons is not directly normal to the optical fiber the localized irradiance is a sum of the irradiance from the entire length of the optical fiber at a given distance from the optical fiber at d 2 0 cm a larger fraction of light rays will reach the spectrophotometer at the center l 4 cm position fig 3 inset shows that light attenuated as distance from the optical fiber increased the localized irradiance dropped from an average of 30 µw cm2 at d 0 cm to 0 5 µw cm2 at d 6 cm light intensity i decreases with distance as the light must spread out over a larger surface for a linear source the relationship is inversely proportional to the distance from the optical fiber this phenomenon is modeled through eq 1 where i 0 is the measured light intensity at d 0 and r 0 is the radius of the optical fiber 0 5 mm it should be noted that 0 5 mm is added at each distance to account for a 0 5 mm air gap between the sensor tip and the sensor 1 i i 0 r 0 r 0 d the model closely follows the data acquired at each distance and is important in understanding the light distribution profile along the length and distance from the fiber however the delivered light to the surface further decreases with distance because the incident angle of photons will continue to increase until the irradiance approaches zero therefore the light intensity that reached the lawn in this study was measured by facing the sensor tip upwards 3 mm below the optical fiber at 1 cm 1 45 cm and 2 cm approximately 19 0 51 µw cm2 15 0 3 µw cm2 and 12 0 17 µw cm2 of the light measured normal to the fiber reaches the lawn surface beyond 2 cm the light intensity on the surface is below detection limit 3 2 uv c seof inhibits microbial growth a uv c seof was placed 3 mm above an agar plate covered with a culture of either p aeruginosa or e coli fig 4 illustrates the e coli lawn after 480 min of irradiation for the optical fiber without sio2 modification fig 4a compared against a uv c seof fig 4b the zone of inhibition is 2 8 cm wide after 480 min of irradiation with the seof in contrast the zone of inhibition is 11x smaller 0 26 cm for no sio2 scattering centers on the optical fiber fig 4 insets show the light distribution along the optical fiber length the image was captured under dark conditions with a paper towel placed below the optical fiber the paper towel fluoresces blue light upon ultraviolet irradiance allowing for visualization of the light distribution throughout the optical fiber the bright spots seen towards the top of both images was due to i light leaving the distal end opposite end as the light source of the optical fiber and ii back reflection at the distal end of the fiber when the light reaches the distal end most of it exits the fiber however a portion of light also reflects towards the optical fiber creating a second input and higher photo density at the distal end the nanoparticles on the seof interacted with the evanescent wave and resulted in side emission through scattering creating the visible side emission glow seen in the fig 4b inset lanzarini lopes et al 2019b this glowing germicidal light enabled microbial inactivation along the length of the optical fiber the observable inactivation along the length of the bare optical fiber is due to natural light scattering that results from surface impurities since these fibers were not prepared in a clean room additionally the zone of inhibition increases slightly towards the distal end of the fiber this is due to the higher photon density that was described earlier 3 3 zone of inhibition increases with uv exposure fig 5 illustrates the zone of inhibition of p aeruginosa fig 5a and e coli fig 5b resulting from uv c seof exposure on an agar plate lawn after 0 30 60 120 240 and 480 min at each exposure time the zone of inhibition was measured at l 0 2 4 6 and 8 cm from the proximal end of the led source along the length of the fiber a dark control was obtained by placing a modified optical fiber in the agar plate without turning on the uv source no inhibition was observed by the dark control indicating that the exterior materials of the optical fiber did not contribute to the germicidal effect of the uv c seof fig 5 shows the zone of inhibition was highest at the proximal end and lower towards the distal end for lower exposure times t 120 min with both p aeruginosa and e coli this observation corresponds with the uv c side emission profile fig 3 as light side emits from the optical fiber the photon density decreases inside the fiber this phenomenon is described by the beer lambert law of attenuation through a waveguide a lower photon density means less light can be emitted through the fiber s side however the path of side emitted photons is not directly normal to the optical fiber at increasing distance from the optical fiber the localized irradiance is a sum of the irradiance emitted from the entire length of the optical fiber fig 5c illustrates that linear increase in zone of inhibition with time reaches a maximum of 2 9 cm at around 240 min of irradiation the uv dose at the edge of the lawn at 240 min is approximately 4 3 mj cm2 irradiance 0 3 μw cm2 between 240 and 480 min there is no statistically significant change in zone of inhibition for either organisms according to the student t test with 95 confidence level p 0 05 the irradiance at 480 min is also 0 3 μw cm2 resulting in double the dose 8 6 mj cm2 for the same zone of inhibition additionally single 12 hour 12 9 mj s and 24 h 25 8 mj s exposure times resulted in 3 0 cm zone of inhibition these results indicate that there is a maximum zone of inhibition mzi that is not solely dependent on dose at the edge of the inhibition zone the localized irradiance is insufficient to either i damage the dna and protein of the organism or ii surpass the rate of dna and protein reconstruction hu et al 2005 quek and hu 2008 uv c radiation at 265 nm is categorized as germicidal because it inhibits pathogens i e bacteria virus protozoa from replicating and infecting a host gayán et al 2013 absorption of uv light by nucleic acids results in crosslinking between thymine and cytosine these mutations disable hydrogen bonds to the purine base of the opposite strand therefore inhibiting replication the amount of cross linked pyrimidine nucleoside bases is directly related to the uv exposure blatchley et al 2001 certain organisms can repair damaged dna when the uv dose is too low this process reverts dna back into its undamaged form branzei and foiani 2008 at the low localized irradiance beyond the mzi then dna repair rates may exceed dna damage rates thus limiting net inactivation of the microorganism the mzi depends on i the sensitivity of the microorganism to uv light and ii the input power of the led by student s t test there is no statistical difference in either mzi or zone of inhibition p 0 05 at each irradiation time of p aeruginosa and e coli through the entire fiber length this result is supported by similar uv sensitivity reported for these organisms for 4 log i e 99 99 inactivation doses range between 3 1 and 17 mj cm2 for planktonic p aeruginosa and between 3 0 and 20 mj cm2 for planktonic e coli abshire and dunton 1981 chatterley and linden 2010 chevrefils et al 2006 clauß 2006 quek and hu 2008 3 4 edge colonies did not illustrate higher uv resistance to understand if the edge colonies fig 1 were more resistant to uv than the bulk colonies the same zone of inhibition experiments were conducted with the edge colonies as the inoculum like the zone of inhibition measurements the uv c seof was placed 3 mm above an agar plate covered with a culture of p aeruginosa after 240 min 4 hr of irradiation the fiber was removed and the plate was incubated for 24 h one isolated colony at the edge of the lawn was resuspended in lb overnight and spread on a new agar plate followed by the cell culture and zone of inhibition analysis procedure the entire process was repeated twice the zone of inhibition after 240 min was then measured to understand if the colonies at the edge of the lawn were more resistant to uv fig 6 illustrates the sequence of experiments where fig 6a is the new plate and fig 6b and 6c illustrate the results after one and two resuspensions respectively the black circles in fig 6a and 6b identify the colonies that were resuspended for the following experiment the mzi of 0 1 and 2 generations are 2 4 cm 2 5 cm and 3 1 cm these results fall within 1 standard deviation of the average zone of inhibition for 240 min of irradiation the protrusions and patchiness patterns in each agar plates result from uneven spread plate pressures and agar scrapes see center of fig 6b overall there was no significant difference in the zone of inhibition after the resuspensions consequently the survival of the edge bacteria is because of insignificant uv irradiance as explained in section 3 2 not because of uv resistance thus the zone of inhibition is a valid measurement to inform the maximum necessary optical fiber distance for complete surface inactivation the uv irradiance that reaches this area is insufficient to either damage the dna and protein of the organism or surpass the rate of dna and protein reconstruction hu et al 2005 quek and hu 2008 however a longer term study with more than two generations of resuspension should be conducted to truly understand whether uv resistance is being developed 3 5 agar plate remained bio available after uv exposure the zone of inhibition is measured by prevention of cell growth on an agar plate it is possible that cells would not grow on the plate if i the cells are damaged or ii the nutrients on the agar plate are no longer bioavailable because of surface damage by uv c light to establish the former as the primary mechanism the p aeruginosa colonies were re spread on the same agar plate after initial uv irradiation figure si 1 illustrates the three steps to this procedure fig si 1a is the p aeruginosa lawn after 240 min of inactivation and 24 hours of incubation figure si 1b illustrates the plate after the lawn has been evenly re spread on the plate figure si 1c illustrates the plate after an additional 24 hours of incubation the cell density on the sides of the initial plate was extremely dense re spreading those cells resulted in streaks and uneven distribution of bacteria throughout the agar plate however there was a clear difference in density before and after 24 hour incubation indicating cell replication the growth of cells on the entire surface of the agar plate illustrates that the agar remained bio available after uv radiation additionally the center of the agar plate had higher cell growth as indicated by opaqueness existing cellular and extracellular material from fig si 1a likely remained on the surface of the agar preventing new cells from using the nutrients underneath them thus we concluded the uv c seof inactivated the microorganisms within the measured zone of inhibition 4 summary and conclusions uv c seofs effectively inactivate p aeruginosa and e coli even on very nutrient rich surfaces subsequent experiments using the edge lawn colonies as the inoculum indicated that the bacteria did not develop significant uv resistance within two generations of exposure re spreading the previously uv radiated plate indicated that microbial growth prevention was due to biological inactivation and not damage to the agar the zone of inhibition at various times was compared without our led and experimental setup the zone of inhibition increased linearly with dose until a mzi of 2 9 0 5 and 2 8 0 5 cm was achieved for p aeruginosa and e coli respectively beyond this mzi distance we surmise that the irradiance reaching the surface is too low to damage the cell faster than the cell can repair its dna the irradiance at the edge of mzi is the minimum irradiance needed to inactivate the bacteria of interest this needs to be considered when designing uv c seof configurations for surface disinfection for example the irradiance fig 3 inset that reaches the mzis of 2 9 is 0 3 µw cm2 to assure full inactivation of p aeruginosa and e coli it is crucial that the localized irradiance in the entire surface of interest is greater than those values the maximum distance between the optical fibers can be varied by changing the input power of the led or decreasing the density of nanoparticles at the surface of the optical fiber higher power to the led would increase side emission irradiance which would also increase the maximum separation distance alternatively lower nanoparticle loadings on the surface of the optical fiber core would decrease the amount of light leaving the optical fiber scattering coefficient at each location thereby decreasing the maximum separation distance because less light is side emitted per distance this modification would enable longer optical fibers to be fabricated these results inform engineering design decisions for surface disinfection with uv c seof for example these optical fibers can be used as spiral wound membrane spacers to prevent biological fouling spacer holes are relatively small 0 1 cm to ensure proper hydraulic turbulence in this configuration long optical fibers with increasing scattering coefficients would be designed to assure even light distribution across the optical fiber mesh this paper provides a proof of concept that uvc seofs can be used for microbial inactivation on surfaces and the flexible nature of seofs allow delivery of light in places conventional uv c lamps or even leds are not practical improvements are possible in terms of power efficiency of leds and maximizing light launch efficiency from led into seofs leds have relatively low power and wall plug efficiency compared to other light sources i e mercury lamps therefore the utilization of the available power is critical chen et al 2017 loeb et al 2019 currently less than 10 of the led emitted light becomes emitted from a single seof due to i 80 of the light lost during launching light from the led into the seof ii 15 absorbed within the optical fiber core and iii 5 lost due to refraction at the end of our relatively short seof custom glass production will be able to manufacture optical fibers with higher transmittance i e less losses of light in the germicidal wavelengths ongoing research is focusing on improving the launching of light between the led and seof with an overall goal of achieving 75 of the led emitted light being side emitted from the optical fiber the seofs described herein can overcome the largest barrier to uv c disinfection optical obstruction in reactors because of bends or suspended particles fig 7 illustrates a schematic of light distribution in a u bend cylindrical geometry a without and b with seof any interference between the linear pathway of a light source and surface will result in non effective surface illumination an seof simulates infinite

17721,the accumulation of manganese in drinking water distribution systems often causes problems of black water in customers taps in this study mn accumulation onto a pipe surface under chlorinated conditions was investigated by focusing on the different states of mn in the water lab scale experiments suggested that the accumulation process included both the attachment of particulate mn onto the surface i e physical pathway and the autocatalytic oxidation of mn ions on the surface i e chemical pathway based on the experimental results a numerical model of mn accumulation on the pipe surface via the two pathways was established according to the model predictions the physical pathway contributed less than the chemical pathway over time since the latter accelerated as mn accumulation increased the chemical pathway contributed 94 when the concentration of total mn was 10 µg l throughout the experiment but only 67 when the concentration was 100 µg l thus the chemical pathway was more important for low concentrations of total mn in addition the type of pipe materials used only influenced the physical pathway while the presence of bromide directly enhanced the chemical pathway in conclusion limiting the chemical pathway was suggested as an effective strategy for reducing mn accumulation during long term operation which is achieved by controlling the state of mn in finished water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system black water manganese state numerical simulation autocatalytic oxidation chlorination 1 introduction discoloration is among the most common consumer complaints of drinking water caused by the hydraulic turbulence detachment of loose deposits over the inner surface of pipes vreeburg 2007 husband and boxall 2010 one type of discoloration is black water the occurrence of which is associated with the presence of manganese mn kohl and medlar 2006 schlenker et al 2008 field studies show that mn is one of the most abundant metal deposits in the drinking water distribution system dwds cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 li et al 2018 especially when the total mn concentration is high in the finished water li et al 2018 to abate mn concentration and consequently prevent black water occurrence through controlling the total mn concentration in the finished water regulations have been put in place by several countries and organizations for example the standard value set by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2020 japan the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw 2003 and the world health organization who 2003 is 50 µg l while the acceptable concentration for the esthetic objectives in canada is 20 µg l health canada 2019 however mn deposition has been found even when the total mn concentration was lower than 10 µg l sly et al 1990 this suggests that a further formation of mn accumulation may still occur in the distribution systems even with a low concentration of mn therefore understanding the characteristics and key factors of mn accumulation in dwds is important in order to prevent the occurrence of black water according to previous studies deposits containing mn accumulated through the formation of insoluble mn i e mno2 during disinfection or through the microbial deposition by mn oxidizing bacteria sly et al 1990 kohl and medlar 2006 cerrato 2010 in japan the lowest residual chlorine cl2 i e hypochlorous acid hocl concentration in dwds is regulated to be 0 1 mg l mhlw 2003 since the presence of residual cl2 in drinking water has been reported to efficiently inhibit the biological accumulation of mn sly et al 1990 rygel 2006 it is crucial to consider the chemical reaction between cl2 and mn for mn accumulation in chlorinated dwds in previous studies particulate mn mno2 was formed from the oxidation of mn2 in the liquid phase through an intermediate mno2 mn2 hao et al 1991 van benschoten et al 1992 hao et al 1991 proposed eqs 1 3 to describe such reactions eq 1 is the homogeneous oxidation between mn2 and hocl the adsorption eq 2 and accelerated oxidation eq 3 are the two steps of autocatalytic heterogeneous oxidation the rate constants of these reactions differed among experimental conditions and fitting methods in previous studies as shown in table 1 1 m n 2 hocl mn o 2 c l 2 mn o 2 m n 2 mn o 2 m n 2 3 mn o 2 m n 2 hocl 2 mn o 2 c l such autocatalytic oxidation of mn by various oxidants is commonly applied for mn removal in the water treatment process coffey et al 1993 kohl and medlar 2006 dashtban kenari et al 2019 in the case of chlorinated dwds it is expected that similar reactions occur and the two states of mn i e mno2 and mn2 contribute to mn accumulation on pipe surface via two pathways one is the physical attachment of mno2 particles to the pipe surface physical pathway and the other is the autocatalytic oxidation of mn2 on the mn accumulated pipe surface chemical pathway in previous studies on mn accumulation in dwds there is a limited focus on the influence of the state of mn i e mno2 and mn2 in finished water and there are no studies that have quantitatively interpreted this process bromide br is commonly present in natural water with concentrations ranging from several to several thousand micrograms per liter von gunten 2003 it is reported that the oxidation of mn2 by hocl was promoted by the presence of br since hypobromous acid hobr a more reactive oxidant than hocl was formed through eqs 4 and 5 allard et al 2013 this suggested that the presence of br affects mn accumulation on the pipe surface 4 b r hocl hobr c l k 1550 m 1 s 1 5 hobr m n 2 mn o 2 m n 2 mn o 2 b r in addition field studies have demonstrated that the amount of mn accumulation on the inner surface of pipes varied depending on the pipe materials zacheus et al 2001 cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 however the effect of the pipe materials on the two assumed pathways of mn accumulation is unclear in this study the characteristics of mn accumulation on the pipe surface in chlorinated water were investigated by lab experiments and a numerical model particularly focusing on the role of the two pathways i e physical and chemical pathways depending on the state of mn the numerical model was established based on the two pathway hypothesis and validated by the experimental results the effects of both the br concentration and the type of pipe materials on the accumulation of mn were also examined moreover the numerical model was used to discuss the control strategies for the prevention of mn accumulation on the pipe surface in long term chlorinated dwds operations 2 methods 2 1 reagents and apparatus manganese sulfate mnso4 potassium bromide kbr sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 sulfuric

using a milli q reference water purification system merck millipore burlington ma stock solution of hocl approximately 1000 mg cl2 l was prepared from sodium hypochlorite naocl fujifilm wako pure chemical and stored in the dark at 4 c the cl2 concentration in the stock solution was determined monthly by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titration method american public health association apha 2005 apparatus applied in the experiments were soaked overnight in 0 1 m hno3 and then sonicated and rinsed by mqw in advance four types of test pieces were used for mn accumulation experiments epoxy resin epoxy test pieces were provided by kubota corporation osaka japan polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene pe and high intensity pvc hi were provided by sekisui chemical co ltd osaka japan all the test pieces were also sonicated for 15 min and then rinsed by mqw before use in order to prevent the introduction of other particles to the reaction 2 2 mn accumulation experiment all mn accumulation experiments were conducted in the dark in a closed teflon conical flask at room temperature 20 2 c initially a small amount of hocl stock solution final concentration 1 5 mg cl2 l was added into 300 ml of mn2 mnso4 solution at a ph of 7 3 0 2 5 mm carbonate buffer mixed by a magnetic stirrer at 350 rpm in most experiments one clean test piece was immediately inserted into the mn solution after spiking hocl in contrast in experiments no 2 and 9 table 2 see paragraph three it was inserted after three days of the reaction between mn2 and hocl the test piece was then in contact with the mn solution for three days after the 3 d contact to better control the state of mn in the solution the same test piece was inserted into the newly prepared solution again i e mn solution just after spiking hocl or after a 3 d prechlorination and left for another three days this replacement of the mn solution was repeated five or seven times such that a sufficient amount of mn accumulated and the course of accumulation over time could be observed there was no significant variation in the ph during the 3 d contact during the experiments the test piece was vertically fixed in the solution to eliminate the accumulation due to the gravitational settling of mn particles which was not considered as the main mechanism of accumulation in dwds boxall et al 2001 vreeburg 2007 in preliminary experiments which used a shaker for mixing the settled mn particles and mn accumulation on the wall of the flasks were observed after a three day contact period in contrast such settlement and accumulation on the wall were not observed when mixing took place with a magnetic stirrer as explained above the mass balance 94 9 on average between mn in the bulk solution before accumulation and the sum of mn in the bulk solution and on the surface of the test piece after accumulation was confirmed for each case therefore in this experiment the gravitational settling of mno2 particles was considered to be negligible further the constant mixing conditions were maintained during contact because the focus of this study was the mn accumulation process although it has been reported that discoloration can be caused by a sudden change in hydraulic conditions in the pipes boxall et al 2001 table 2 presents detailed information on the experimental design all experiments were conducted more than twice a relatively higher concentration of mn 10 and 100 µg l than that in the real dwds was set for a better observation of the states of mn during the accumulation process the effect of prechlorination i e the 3 d reaction before inserting the test piece was investigated to characterize the accumulation process with different mn states under two total mn concentrations 100 µg l in experiments no 1 and 2 and 10 µg l in experiments no 8 and 9 the effect of br concentration 0 100 µg l was investigated in experiments no 1 and no 3 4 the effects of the different plastic materials of test pieces were investigated in experiments no 1 and no 5 7 epoxy is one of the most common lining materials of inner pipe surface rajasärkkä et al 2016 and the other three types of plastic materials used in this study are also commonly applied in dwds worldwide elfström broo et al 2001 except for the plastic materials used in the experiments no 5 7 epoxy test pieces were applied in all the other experiments after each 3 d contact experiment total mn concentration ph and residual cl2 in solution were analyzed at the end of mn accumulation experiments the total amount of mn accumulation on the test piece was also analyzed extra experiments were conducted to understand the water quality i e ph residual cl2 particulate and colloidal mn mno2 and soluble mn mn2 concentration after a 3 d prechlorination at both 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentration with 1 5 mg cl2 l of hocl and 30 µg l of br 2 3 analytical methods the residual cl2 and ph were analyzed immediately following the 3 d contact experiment the ph was measured by a ph meter ph meter d 51 horiba kyoto japan all the samples of mn concentration were collected and stored in the dark at 4 c following dechlorination by 0 5 ml of 1 m ethylenediamine since ethylenediamine could preserve the mno2 formed in the solution mn concentration in the solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms xseries 2xt thermo scientific waltham ma prior to the icp ms analysis all the samples were digested by 0 5 m hno3 at 105 c for several hours based on apha 2005 in the additional analysis of the solution after prechlorination mn2 was considered as the fraction of mn that had less than 10 000 molecular weight cut off mwco amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filters 10 kda merck millipore burlington ma

µm accumulated mn on the test pieces was obtained by soaking the test piece in 90 ml of 1 m hno3 for six days the amount of mn accumulation was then calculated based on the mn concentration in the solution 2 4 data analysis the results of the effect of pipe materials were analyzed using r version 3 5 1 in rstudio parametric one way analysis of variance anova was used and followed by the bonferroni p value corrected t test statistical significance was set at p 0 05 2 5 establishment of the numerical model based on the assumption of two pathways of mn accumulation i e the physical and chemical pathway on the surface and the equations of mn oxidation by hao et al 1991 table 1 a numerical model of mn accumulation on a pipe surface in chlorinated water was established the total amount

mn2 at a ph of 6 9 for 120 h text s2 1 in supplementary materials sms python 2 7 programs were established to obtain the other rate constants by fitting with results of mn accumulation experiments the fitting process was conducted through the function scipy optimize curve fit in scipy library the scipy community 2020 details of the fitting process is described in text s2 2 in sms all the calculations were conducted in moles and mn accumulation results were shown in micrograms 3 results 3 1 effect of prechlorination on mn accumulation the effect of pre chlorination on mn accumulation on an epoxy test piece were investigated at 100 µg l of total mn concentration experiments no 1 and 2 fig 1 a similar experiments were also conducted at 10 µg l of total mn concentration experiments no 8 and 9 fig 1 b after the 3 d prechlorination with approximately 1 5 mg cl2 l of hocl and 30 µg l of br 35 and 83 of total mn had been oxidized to mno2 in 100 and 10 µg l of total mn concentrations respectively fig s4 shows the proportion of different mn fractions after the 3 d prechlorination both mn2 and mno2 were present in the solution with prechlorination thus the effect of prechlorination on mn accumulation was associated with the state of mn the ph was maintained at 7 3 0 2 error standard deviation same as below and residual cl2 was 1 3 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment the amount of mn accumulation was linear to the contact time in experiments with prechlorination in both 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentration however the mn accumulation process without prechlorination accelerated through time that 0 28 and 1 4 µg mn was accumulated respectively in the first 3 d contact in 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentrations and 14 and 41 µg mn was accumulated at the end of all accumulation experiments in case of 100 µg l of total mn concentration the amount of mn accumulation in the first 3 d contact with prechlorination was 6 3 µg higher than that without prechlorination then the amount of mn accumulation remained higher than that without prechlorination at the end of the 15 d 5 3 d contact experiments 64 µg of mn had accumulated with prechlorination conversely the phenomenon was different when the total mn concentration was 10 µg l the amount of mn accumulation in the first 3 d contact was similar with and without prechlorination 0 43 µg however total mn accumulation after the 21 d contact period was only 5 6 µg with prechlorination which was much lower than 14 µg achieved without prechlorination as described above thus it can be concluded that the presence of mno2 due to prechlorination inhibited the acceleration of mn accumulation and the effect of prechlorination was dependent on the total mn concentration 3 2 effect of br on mn accumulation the processes of mn accumulation through time with different br concentrations experiments no 1 3 and 4 are shown in fig 2 during the experiments ph was 7 3 0 2 and residual cl2 was 1 2 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment with a higher br dosage the amount of mn accumulation increased after the 15 d contact experiment total mn accumulation reached 72 µg in the presence of 100 µg l of br while reaching only 9 9 µg without br however in the first 3 d contact the amount of mn accumulation was similar so that 0 65 1 3 and 3 3 µg mn was accumulated in the presence of 0 30 and 100 µg l of br respectively the difference in the amount of mn accumulation of over 15 times between the first 3 d and the whole 15 d contact experiments indicates that the accumulation processes were accelerated with time and the promotion effect of br was more significant with a higher mno2 accumulation on the epoxy surface 3 3 effect of pipe materials on mn accumulation mn accumulation on four different materials was also investigated using 100 µg l of mn and 30 µg l of br concentrations experiments no 1 and 5 7 the ph was maintained at 7 3 0 2 and residual cl2 was 1 1 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment the mn accumulation results are presented in fig 3 similar to the accumulation trend on epoxy the mn accumulation process accelerated with time on pe and hi while such acceleration was not clearly observed in the pvc experiment pvc had the largest affinity to mno2 followed by pe epoxy and then hi the clear difference between pvc and the other materials used in this study had already been displayed during the first 3 d contact experiments the accumulation on pvc in the first 3 d reaction was 17 µg which was significantly larger than that on epoxy 1 3 µg p 0 05 and hi 2 5 µg p 0 01 from the 12th day the difference among the four types of materials was no longer significant p 0 05 after the 15 d contact experiment 81 µg of mn accumulated on the surface of pvc 77 µg on pe 41 µg on epoxy and 34 µg on hi thus the influence of the types of materials was mainly observed at the beginning of the mn accumulation process 3 4 numerical simulation figs 4 a and b show the fitting results of experiments no 1 and 2 and no 8 and 9 respectively the fitting results of the other experiments are shown in fig s5 in sms the coefficient of determination r 2 of the predicted amount of mn accumulation in all experimental results was larger than 0 90 indicating that the model based on the two pathway mechanisms was able to describe the process of mn accumulation onto the pipe surface the relationship between the predicted and experimental results is shown in fig s6 in sms in fig 4 the fitting curves show different trends depending on the experimental conditions with prechlorination the speed of accumulation i e the slope of the fitting curve was almost constant throughout the experimental period however the slope of the fitting curve in the experiments without prechlorination increased with time in a total mn concentration of 100 µg l experiment no 1 fig 4 a for a total mn concentration of 10 µg l experiment no 8 the slope increased at the beginning but significantly decreased at the end of each 3 d contact from the 9th day onwards fig 4 b this is potentially due to the fact that the added mn almost accumulated on the surface in each 3 d contact experiment the values of each parameter for different conditions obtained by fitting are presented in table 3 based on the given conditions table 1 and calculation of eqs 11 and 12 the rate constant of homogeneous oxidation by hocl k 0 cl ranges from 2 5 103 m 2s 1 hao et al 1991 to 3 2 104 m 2s 1 van benschoten 1993 and that of autocatalytic oxidation by hocl in solution k 1 cl ranges from 1 5 1010 m 3s 1 allard et al 2013 to 1 6 1013 m 3s 1 hao et al 1991 therefore k 0 cl 1 3 103 m 2s 1 and k 1 cl 7 3 1012 m 3s 1 obtained in this study were close to the values presented in the literature the rate constants of hobr were one order of magnitude larger than those of hocl for both homogeneous and autocatalytic oxidation which is also similar to the findings by allard et al 2013 the rate constants of homogeneous oxidation between mn2 and hocl or hobr k 0 cl and k 0 br remained constant in all situations however those of autocatalytic oxidation were different the rate constants both in the bulk water k 1 cl and k 1 br and on the surface k sur cl and k sur br at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l was one order of magnitude larger than those at a total mn concentration of 100 µg l when the total mn concentration was the same the rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation in the bulk water k 1 cl and k 1 br were one order of magnitude larger than those on the surface k sur cl and k sur br moreover the rate constant of the physical pathway k att was also dependent on the experimental conditions in the fitting process of each parameter we assumed that k att was the only parameter affected by the pipe materials therefore k att of the pipe materials excluding epoxy was estimated using the rate constants of oxidation e g k 0 cl k 1 cl and k sur cl obtained in the experiments with epoxy fig s3 the experimental results of different pipe materials could be well fitted based on this assumption figs s5 b and c thus k att was the parameter used to differentiate the pipe materials and it showed one order of magnitude difference among the four types of pipe materials table 3 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of the two pathways to the mn accumulation in all the experiments without prechlorination except for experiment no 5 the mn accumulation process was observed to accelerate with time this acceleration strongly suggests the existence of the autocatalytic oxidation of mn2 on the accumulated mn i e chemical pathway in the accumulation process a similar trend was also observed by ginige et al 2011 when investigating the process of mn deposition on the surface of glass rings in the presence of hocl that the rate of mn deposition significantly increased after a 30 day operation in contrast mn accumulation with prechlorination was linear to the contact time fig 4 this can be explained by the limited mn2 concentration after prechlorination which makes the attachment of mno2 particles i e the physical pathway the main accumulation mechanism thus these experimental results clearly indicated that different states of mn i e mn2 and mno2 contributed to the two separate pathways in addition all the experimental results were well fitted by the two pathway numerical model which also validated the hypothesized mechanism of mn accumulation in chlorinated dwds the contribution of the two pathways was predicted under different experimental conditions using this model fig 5 shows the predicted contribution of the two separate pathways in experiments no 1 and 2 the predictions of the other experiments are shown in fig s7 in sms these predictions of mn accumulation indicated that the physical pathway contributed more to the initial phase without the prechlorination the chemical pathway accelerated with time i e with the accumulation of mno2 on the pipe surface becoming the main contributor to the mn accumulation process however the physical pathway remained the main contributor when the prechlorination process was conducted the physical pathway process contained two steps the presence of mno2 in solution and the attachment of mno2 to the pipe surface considering the mechanisms of the two pathways only the physical pathway contributed to mn accumulation when a new surface of test piece was introduced thus the physical pathway was the main contributor in the initial phase in all the experiments figs 5 and s7 in sms based on the model prediction over 90 and 99 of mn2 in the solution had been oxidized to mno2 after 3 d prechlorination in total mn concentrations of 100 and 10 µg l respectively fig s8 in sms the prediction was different from the measured concentration of mno2 i e particulate and colloidal mn section 3 1 which presented limitation of the model in the accuracy of predicting the state of mn in the bulk water since only the accumulation amount was utilized for fitting text s2 2 in sms the presence of colloidal mn at less than 10 000 mwco might be another possible reason for this inconsistency still since a large proportion of mn in the solution was present as mno2 following prechlorination the chemical pathway was inhibited due to the lack of mn2 and only the physical pathway contributed to the mn accumulation thus the accumulation process barely accelerated during the whole experiment figs 5 b and s7 g in sms the chemical pathway occurred following the attachment of mno2 onto the surface of the test pieces via the physical pathway and accelerated with time figs 5 a and s7 a f in sms this acceleration resulted in the acceleration of the entire mn accumulation process after it became the main contributor in this situation when mn2 in the solution was almost consumed the whole accumulation process was inhibited shown as the flat curves at the end of the 3 d contact fig 4 b from the results of the experiments no 1 and 8 it was predicted that the contribution of chemical pathway to the total mn accumulation at the end of the experiment was 67 for a total mn concentration of 100 µg l fig 5 a and 94 for 10 µg l fig s7 f in sms this indicates that the chemical pathway was more important at a lower total mn concentration which will be discussed in next section from a viewpoint of rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation 4 2 dependency of autocatalytic oxidation on experimental conditions according to the fitting results table 3 the rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation k 1 cl k 1 br k sur cl and k sur br at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l were one order of magnitude larger than those at 100 µg l hao et al 1991 observed a difference in the catalytic ability between commercial mno2 and mno2 particles formed during chlorination since the particle size of commercial mno2 was approximately 200 times that of the formed mno2 particles the rate constant of autocatalytic oxidation was considered to be negatively related to the size of the mno2 particles one reason for this tendency was that large particles have a small specific surface area to adsorb mn2 as shown in eq 2 hao et al 1991 in addition the initial particle size of mno2 formed in solution is expected to be positively correlated to the initial concentration of mno2 according to eq 19 huangfu et al 2013 where r h is the hydrodynamic radius of colloids k a is the rate of aggregation and n 0 is the initial concentration of the particles therefore with a higher concentration of total mn more mno2 would be formed with a similar amount of hocl through homogeneous oxidation initially eq 1 so that the particle size was larger this is qualitatively consistent with the observation that the ratio of particulate fraction 0 2 µm to mno2 concentration after 3 d prechlorination was much higher at a total mn concentration of 100 µg l than at 10 µg l of fig s4 to summarize the larger rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l were likely to be caused by the smaller particle size and larger reactive surface area of the formed mno2 particles 19 d r h d t t 0 k a n 0 similarly when the total mn concentration in solution was the same the rate constants of the autocatalytic oxidation on the surface of the test piece i e the chemical pathway k sur cl and k sur br were one order of magnitude smaller than those in the solution k 1 cl and k 1 br this might also be due to the smaller specific surface area of accumulated mno2 than that of mno2 in the solution however the direct discussion of the impact of mno2 particle size or specific surface area in the current model is very limited since eqs 2 and 3 were described as one united term in the model although the rate constants of the chemical pathway k sur cl and k sur br were smaller it continuously accelerated with the increasing amount of mn accumulation while the autocatalytic oxidation in the solution was controlled by the concentration of mno2 which was involved in the physical pathway and was limited by the dosage in the experiment process therefore when the consumption rate of mn2 by the chemical pathway became faster than the oxidation in the solution mn2 tended to directly accumulate on the surface through the chemical pathway process and became the main contributor 4 3 effects of br and pipe materials on the two pathways bromide promoted all the oxidation processes in the system by forming hobr allard et al 2013 whose rate constants of oxidation k 0 br k 1 br and k sur br were estimated to be one order of magnitude larger than those for hocl k 0 cl k 1 cl and k sur br table 3 therefore the presence of br promoted the physical pathway indirectly by forming more mno2 in the solution while also directly enhancing the chemical pathway however even though more mno2 was formed in the solution with a higher concentration of br this positive impact in the initial phase was small this suggests that the attachment of mno2 onto the surface was the rate determining step in the physical pathway on the other hand when the chemical pathway accelerated and turned into the main contributor of mn accumulation this direct promotion by the presence of br significantly enhanced the accumulation process fig 2 the difference among the four types of materials was clearly observed in the first 3 d contact fig 3 while the physical pathway was the main contributor in the initial phase of mn accumulation pipe materials also influenced the chemical pathway indirectly by accumulating various amounts of mno2 on the surface in the initial phase thus the chemical pathway occurred earlier if the material had a stronger affinity to mno2 particles like pvc fig s7 c in sms according to the results of the model fitting the difference of materials was presented only in terms of k att table 3 which was one order of magnitude different among the four types of materials this strongly indicates that pipe materials affect the physical pathway of the mn accumulation process according to previous studies the attachment of various particles is often affected by the physicochemical properties of substratum such as surface charge dai et al 2004 roughness iida et al 1993 vrijenhoek et al 2001 and hydrophobicity lee et al 2010 dai et al 2004 as summarized in table s2 the ζ potential water contact angle and roughness of the tested materials were previous measured however no clear evidence of the impact of these factors on k att value was observed a more in depth characterization regarding chemical structures or functional groups might be effective to understand the impact of pipe materials on the physical pathway lee et al 1994 cunliffe et al 1999 although this study focused on br and the pipe material other factors in drinking water are also likely to impact the mn accumulation process the variation in ph affects the dissociation of hocl hobr and the oxidation rate as shown in eqs 11 18 allard et al 2013 hao et al 1991 influencing the chemical pathway directly and the physical pathway indirectly by changing the formation of particulate mno2 further the presence of cations e g ca2 mg2 in drinking water is reported to enhance the aggregation of mno2 particles huangfu et al 2013 which may also impact the rates of autocatalytic oxidation as discussed in section 4 2 at the same time this enhancement of particle aggregation might cause the gravitational settling to be more significant li et al 2019 influencing the physical pathway although the settling was not considered in this study because the turbulence forces formed by water flow was reported to sufficiently inhibit the settling of suspended solids in drinking water boxall and saul 2005 therefore further research is required to understand the effect of such parameters in real drinking water 4 4 significance of the mn states for controlling accumulation according to the experiment results and predictions by the two pathway model it was found that mn2 in the solution contributed to the chemical pathway and mno2 contributed to the physical pathway hence the states of mn present in finished water can largely affect the mn accumulation process in chlorinated dwds in japan the total mn concentration in finished water is mostly controlled at less than 5 µg l japan water works association jwwa 2019 even at such a low level of total mn concentration the mn accumulation can still be detected sly et al 1990 given that a further reduction of mn in the water treatment process is not realistic it is worth considering the control of mn accumulation by its state in finished water fig 6 shows the long term prediction of mn accumulation on an epoxy test piece under experimental conditions with varied proportions of mn2 to total mn concentration although mn accumulation was the lowest at the beginning when the proportion of mn2 was 100 the amount of mn accumulation then increased significantly with time and reached the highest level because of the enhancement of the chemical pathway similar trends were also observed in experiments no 8 and 9 at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l fig 4 b these results suggest that when compared under constant total mn concentrations reducing the proportion of mn2 in finished water might eventually be preferable for limiting mn accumulation moreover according to our prediction the rate of autocatalytic oxidation was larger at a lower concentration of total mn such that the contribution of the chemical pathway was crucial therefore decreasing the proportion of mn2 in finished water is vital for limiting the mn accumulation in dwds particularly when the total mn concentration is well controlled in contrast li et al 2019 recommended a different countermeasure reducing the total and particulate mn in finished water to less than 10 and 5 µg l respectively they speculated the preferential accumulation of particulate mn based on field observations in which they detected a significant decrease in the total and particulate mn concentration along with dwds particularly when there is a high proportion of particulate mn in finished water and a relatively low residual cl2 in such scenarios reducing the concentration of particulate mn might become a primary countermeasure because the chemical pathway is suppressed by the lack of mn2 as predicted in our study figs 5 b and s7 g however it is possible that the contribution of the chemical pathway will eventually become larger in a longer term operation as the curve of 50 mn2 in fig 6 at this phase reducing the proportion of mn2 to limit the chemical pathway might be an effective measure although this study presented a new viewpoint of physical and chemical pathways and their significance for the control of mn accumulation this prediction fig 6 assumed ideal experimental conditions to address when and in what practical situations the chemical pathway dominates the physical pathway further quantitative research is required this would allow the clarification of the contribution of both pathways in various realistic situations in dwds 5 conclusions based on the experimental results and data fitting with a numerical model this study showed that mn accumulates on the inner pipe surface in dwds via a two pathway process our findings showed that the state of mn i e mno2 and mn2 influenced mn accumulation by contributing to two separate pathways the chemical pathway occurred after mn had accumulated through the physical pathway process and accelerated with the increased amount of accumulation eventually turning into the main contributor of mn accumulation in addition the chemical pathway contributed more when the total mn concentration was lower because of the larger oxidation rate the types of pipe material directly influenced the physical pathway while the presence of br enhanced the chemical pathway our findings suggest that suppressing the chemical pathway is an effective strategy for limiting mn accumulation in dwds for long term operations further controlling the state of mn in finished water is of great importance declaration of competing interest the

17721,the accumulation of manganese in drinking water distribution systems often causes problems of black water in customers taps in this study mn accumulation onto a pipe surface under chlorinated conditions was investigated by focusing on the different states of mn in the water lab scale experiments suggested that the accumulation process included both the attachment of particulate mn onto the surface i e physical pathway and the autocatalytic oxidation of mn ions on the surface i e chemical pathway based on the experimental results a numerical model of mn accumulation on the pipe surface via the two pathways was established according to the model predictions the physical pathway contributed less than the chemical pathway over time since the latter accelerated as mn accumulation increased the chemical pathway contributed 94 when the concentration of total mn was 10 µg l throughout the experiment but only 67 when the concentration was 100 µg l thus the chemical pathway was more important for low concentrations of total mn in addition the type of pipe materials used only influenced the physical pathway while the presence of bromide directly enhanced the chemical pathway in conclusion limiting the chemical pathway was suggested as an effective strategy for reducing mn accumulation during long term operation which is achieved by controlling the state of mn in finished water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water distribution system black water manganese state numerical simulation autocatalytic oxidation chlorination 1 introduction discoloration is among the most common consumer complaints of drinking water caused by the hydraulic turbulence detachment of loose deposits over the inner surface of pipes vreeburg 2007 husband and boxall 2010 one type of discoloration is black water the occurrence of which is associated with the presence of manganese mn kohl and medlar 2006 schlenker et al 2008 field studies show that mn is one of the most abundant metal deposits in the drinking water distribution system dwds cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 li et al 2018 especially when the total mn concentration is high in the finished water li et al 2018 to abate mn concentration and consequently prevent black water occurrence through controlling the total mn concentration in the finished water regulations have been put in place by several countries and organizations for example the standard value set by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2020 japan the ministry of health labor and welfare mhlw 2003 and the world health organization who 2003 is 50 µg l while the acceptable concentration for the esthetic objectives in canada is 20 µg l health canada 2019 however mn deposition has been found even when the total mn concentration was lower than 10 µg l sly et al 1990 this suggests that a further formation of mn accumulation may still occur in the distribution systems even with a low concentration of mn therefore understanding the characteristics and key factors of mn accumulation in dwds is important in order to prevent the occurrence of black water according to previous studies deposits containing mn accumulated through the formation of insoluble mn i e mno2 during disinfection or through the microbial deposition by mn oxidizing bacteria sly et al 1990 kohl and medlar 2006 cerrato 2010 in japan the lowest residual chlorine cl2 i e hypochlorous acid hocl concentration in dwds is regulated to be 0 1 mg l mhlw 2003 since the presence of residual cl2 in drinking water has been reported to efficiently inhibit the biological accumulation of mn sly et al 1990 rygel 2006 it is crucial to consider the chemical reaction between cl2 and mn for mn accumulation in chlorinated dwds in previous studies particulate mn mno2 was formed from the oxidation of mn2 in the liquid phase through an intermediate mno2 mn2 hao et al 1991 van benschoten et al 1992 hao et al 1991 proposed eqs 1 3 to describe such reactions eq 1 is the homogeneous oxidation between mn2 and hocl the adsorption eq 2 and accelerated oxidation eq 3 are the two steps of autocatalytic heterogeneous oxidation the rate constants of these reactions differed among experimental conditions and fitting methods in previous studies as shown in table 1 1 m n 2 hocl mn o 2 c l 2 mn o 2 m n 2 mn o 2 m n 2 3 mn o 2 m n 2 hocl 2 mn o 2 c l such autocatalytic oxidation of mn by various oxidants is commonly applied for mn removal in the water treatment process coffey et al 1993 kohl and medlar 2006 dashtban kenari et al 2019 in the case of chlorinated dwds it is expected that similar reactions occur and the two states of mn i e mno2 and mn2 contribute to mn accumulation on pipe surface via two pathways one is the physical attachment of mno2 particles to the pipe surface physical pathway and the other is the autocatalytic oxidation of mn2 on the mn accumulated pipe surface chemical pathway in previous studies on mn accumulation in dwds there is a limited focus on the influence of the state of mn i e mno2 and mn2 in finished water and there are no studies that have quantitatively interpreted this process bromide br is commonly present in natural water with concentrations ranging from several to several thousand micrograms per liter von gunten 2003 it is reported that the oxidation of mn2 by hocl was promoted by the presence of br since hypobromous acid hobr a more reactive oxidant than hocl was formed through eqs 4 and 5 allard et al 2013 this suggested that the presence of br affects mn accumulation on the pipe surface 4 b r hocl hobr c l k 1550 m 1 s 1 5 hobr m n 2 mn o 2 m n 2 mn o 2 b r in addition field studies have demonstrated that the amount of mn accumulation on the inner surface of pipes varied depending on the pipe materials zacheus et al 2001 cerrato et al 2006 gerke et al 2016 however the effect of the pipe materials on the two assumed pathways of mn accumulation is unclear in this study the characteristics of mn accumulation on the pipe surface in chlorinated water were investigated by lab experiments and a numerical model particularly focusing on the role of the two pathways i e physical and chemical pathways depending on the state of mn the numerical model was established based on the two pathway hypothesis and validated by the experimental results the effects of both the br concentration and the type of pipe materials on the accumulation of mn were also examined moreover the numerical model was used to discuss the control strategies for the prevention of mn accumulation on the pipe surface in long term chlorinated dwds operations 2 methods 2 1 reagents and apparatus manganese sulfate mnso4 potassium bromide kbr sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 sulfuric

with the mn solution for three days after the 3 d contact to better control the state of mn in the solution the same test piece was inserted into the newly prepared solution again i e mn solution just after spiking hocl or after a 3 d prechlorination and left for another three days this replacement of the mn solution was repeated five or seven times such that a sufficient amount of mn accumulated and the course of accumulation over time could be observed there was no significant variation in the ph during the 3 d contact during the experiments the test piece was vertically fixed in the solution to eliminate the accumulation due to the gravitational settling of mn particles which was not considered as the main mechanism of accumulation in dwds boxall et al 2001 vreeburg 2007 in preliminary experiments which used a shaker for mixing the settled mn particles and mn accumulation on the wall of the flasks were observed after a three day contact period in contrast such settlement and accumulation on the wall were not observed when mixing took place with a magnetic stirrer as explained above the mass balance 94 9 on average between mn in the bulk solution before accumulation and the sum of mn in the bulk solution and on the surface of the test piece after accumulation was confirmed for each case therefore in this experiment the gravitational settling of mno2 particles was considered to be negligible further the constant mixing conditions were maintained during contact because the focus of this study was the mn accumulation process although it has been reported that discoloration can be caused by a sudden change in hydraulic conditions in the pipes boxall et al 2001 table 2 presents detailed information on the experimental design all experiments were conducted more than twice a relatively higher concentration of mn 10 and 100 µg l than that in the real dwds was set for a better observation of the states of mn during the accumulation process the effect of prechlorination i e the 3 d reaction before inserting the test piece was investigated to characterize the accumulation process with different mn states under two total mn concentrations 100 µg l in experiments no 1 and 2 and 10 µg l in experiments no 8 and 9 the effect of br concentration 0 100 µg l was investigated in experiments no 1 and no 3 4 the effects of the different plastic materials of test pieces were investigated in experiments no 1 and no 5 7 epoxy is one of the most common lining materials of inner pipe surface rajasärkkä et al 2016 and the other three types of plastic materials used in this study are also commonly applied in dwds worldwide elfström broo et al 2001 except for the plastic materials used in the experiments no 5 7 epoxy test pieces were applied in all the other experiments after each 3 d contact experiment total mn concentration ph and residual cl2 in solution were analyzed at the end of mn accumulation experiments the total amount of mn accumulation on the test piece was also analyzed extra experiments were conducted to understand the water quality i e ph residual cl2 particulate and colloidal mn mno2 and soluble mn mn2 concentration after a 3 d prechlorination at both 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentration with 1 5 mg cl2 l of hocl and 30 µg l of br 2 3 analytical methods the residual cl2 and ph were analyzed immediately following the 3 d contact experiment the ph was measured by a ph meter ph meter d 51 horiba kyoto japan all the samples of mn concentration were collected and stored in the dark at 4 c following dechlorination by 0 5

bonferroni p value corrected t test statistical significance was set at p 0 05 2 5 establishment of the numerical model based on the assumption of two pathways of mn accumulation i e the physical and chemical pathway on the surface and the equations of mn oxidation by hao et al 1991 table 1 a numerical model of mn accumulation on a pipe surface in chlorinated water was established the total amount

the amount via the chemical pathway for the physical pathway a first order attachment process was assumed as shown ins eq 7 the rate constant of mno2 attaching to the test piece surface is denoted by k att s 1 and mno2 m is the concentration of mno2 in bulk water the volume of mn solution v l in this experiment was 0 3 l the chemical pathway was assumed to be auto catalytic oxidation on the

concentration of oh in solution is oh m and was observed to be in the first order in relation to the oxidation rate hao et al 1991 the concentrations of total cl2 and bromine br2 in bulk water are

mn2 at a ph of 6 9 for 120 h text s2 1 in supplementary materials sms python 2 7 programs were established to obtain the other rate constants by fitting with results of mn accumulation experiments the fitting process was conducted through the function scipy optimize curve fit in scipy library the scipy community 2020 details of the fitting process is described in text s2 2 in sms all the calculations were conducted in moles and mn accumulation results were shown in micrograms 3 results 3 1 effect of prechlorination on mn accumulation the effect of pre chlorination on mn accumulation on an epoxy test piece were investigated at 100 µg l of total mn concentration experiments no 1 and 2 fig 1 a similar experiments were also conducted at 10 µg l of total mn concentration experiments no 8 and 9 fig 1 b after the 3 d prechlorination with approximately 1 5 mg cl2 l of hocl and 30 µg l of br 35 and 83 of total mn had been oxidized to mno2 in 100 and 10 µg l of total mn concentrations respectively fig s4 shows the proportion of different mn fractions after the 3 d prechlorination both mn2 and mno2 were present in the solution with prechlorination thus the effect of prechlorination on mn accumulation was associated with the state of mn the ph was maintained at 7 3 0 2 error standard deviation same as below and residual cl2 was 1 3 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment the amount of mn accumulation was linear to the contact time in experiments with prechlorination in both 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentration however the mn accumulation process without prechlorination accelerated through time that 0 28 and 1 4 µg mn was accumulated respectively in the first 3 d contact in 10 and 100 µg l of total mn concentrations and 14 and 41 µg mn was accumulated at the end of all accumulation experiments in case of 100 µg l of total mn concentration the amount of mn accumulation in the first 3 d contact with prechlorination was 6 3 µg higher than that without prechlorination then the amount of mn accumulation remained higher than that without prechlorination at the end of the 15 d 5 3 d contact experiments 64 µg of mn had accumulated with prechlorination conversely the phenomenon was different when the total mn concentration was 10 µg l the amount of mn accumulation in the first 3 d contact was similar with and without prechlorination 0 43 µg however total mn accumulation after the 21 d contact period was only 5 6 µg with prechlorination which was much lower than 14 µg achieved without prechlorination as described above thus it can be concluded that the presence of mno2 due to prechlorination inhibited the acceleration of mn accumulation and the effect of prechlorination was dependent on the total mn concentration 3 2 effect of br on mn accumulation the processes of mn accumulation through time with different br concentrations experiments no 1 3 and 4 are shown in fig 2 during the experiments ph was 7 3 0 2 and residual cl2 was 1 2 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment with a higher br dosage the amount of mn accumulation increased after the 15 d contact experiment total mn accumulation reached 72 µg in the presence of 100 µg l of br while reaching only 9 9 µg without br however in the first 3 d contact the amount of mn accumulation was similar so that 0 65 1 3 and 3 3 µg mn was accumulated in the presence of 0 30 and 100 µg l of br respectively the difference in the amount of mn accumulation of over 15 times between the first 3 d and the whole 15 d contact experiments indicates that the accumulation processes were accelerated with time and the promotion effect of br was more significant with a higher mno2 accumulation on the epoxy surface 3 3 effect of pipe materials on mn accumulation mn accumulation on four different materials was also investigated using 100 µg l of mn and 30 µg l of br concentrations experiments no 1 and 5 7 the ph was maintained at 7 3 0 2 and residual cl2 was 1 1 0 1 mg cl2 l following each 3 d contact experiment the mn accumulation results are presented in fig 3 similar to the accumulation trend on epoxy the mn accumulation process accelerated with time on pe and hi while such acceleration was not clearly observed in the pvc experiment pvc had the largest affinity to mno2 followed by pe epoxy and then hi the clear difference between pvc and the other materials used in this study had already been displayed during the first 3 d contact experiments the accumulation on pvc in the first 3 d reaction was 17 µg which was significantly larger than that on epoxy 1 3 µg p 0 05 and hi 2 5 µg p 0 01 from the 12th day the difference among the four types of materials was no longer significant p 0 05 after the 15 d contact experiment 81 µg of mn accumulated on the surface of pvc 77 µg on pe 41 µg on epoxy and 34 µg on hi thus the influence of the types of materials was mainly observed at the beginning of the mn accumulation process 3 4 numerical simulation figs 4 a and b show the fitting results of experiments no 1 and 2 and no 8 and 9 respectively the fitting results of the other experiments are shown in fig s5 in sms the coefficient of determination r 2 of the predicted amount of mn accumulation in all experimental results was larger than 0 90 indicating that the model based on the two pathway mechanisms was able to describe the process of mn accumulation onto the pipe surface the relationship between the predicted and experimental results is shown in fig s6 in sms in fig 4 the fitting curves show different trends depending on the experimental conditions with prechlorination the speed of accumulation i e the slope of the fitting curve was almost constant throughout the experimental period however the slope of the fitting curve in the experiments without prechlorination increased with time in a total mn concentration of 100 µg l experiment no 1 fig 4 a for a total mn concentration of 10 µg l experiment no 8 the slope increased at the beginning but significantly decreased at the end of each 3 d contact from the 9th day onwards fig 4 b this is potentially due to the fact that the added mn almost accumulated on the surface in each 3 d contact experiment the values of each parameter for different conditions obtained by fitting are presented in table 3 based on the given conditions table 1 and calculation of eqs 11 and 12 the rate constant of homogeneous oxidation by hocl k 0 cl ranges from 2 5 103 m 2s 1 hao et al 1991 to 3 2 104 m 2s 1 van benschoten 1993 and that of autocatalytic oxidation by hocl in solution k 1 cl ranges from 1 5 1010 m 3s 1 allard et al 2013 to 1 6 1013 m 3s 1 hao et al 1991 therefore k 0 cl 1 3 103 m 2s 1 and k 1 cl 7 3 1012 m 3s 1 obtained in this study were close to the values presented in the literature the rate constants of hobr were one order of magnitude larger than those of hocl for both homogeneous and autocatalytic oxidation which is also similar to the findings by allard et al 2013 the rate constants of homogeneous oxidation between mn2 and hocl or hobr k 0 cl and k 0 br remained constant in all situations however those of autocatalytic oxidation were different the rate constants both in the bulk water k 1 cl and k 1 br and on the surface k sur cl and k sur br at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l was one order of magnitude larger than those at a total mn concentration of 100 µg l when the total mn concentration was the same the rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation in the bulk water k 1 cl and k 1 br were one order of magnitude larger than those on the surface k sur cl and k sur br moreover the rate constant of the physical pathway k att was also dependent on the experimental conditions in the fitting process of each parameter we assumed that k att was the only parameter affected by the pipe materials therefore k att of the pipe materials excluding epoxy was estimated using the rate constants of oxidation e g k 0 cl k 1 cl and k sur cl obtained in the experiments with epoxy fig s3 the experimental results of different pipe materials could be well fitted based on this assumption figs s5 b and c thus k att was the parameter used to differentiate the pipe materials and it showed one order of magnitude difference among the four types of pipe materials table 3 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of the two pathways to the mn accumulation in all the experiments without prechlorination except for experiment no 5 the mn accumulation process was observed to accelerate with time this acceleration strongly suggests the existence of the autocatalytic oxidation of mn2 on the accumulated mn i e chemical pathway in the accumulation process a similar trend was also observed by ginige et al 2011 when investigating the process of mn deposition on the surface of glass rings in the presence of hocl that the rate of mn deposition significantly increased after a 30 day operation in contrast mn accumulation with prechlorination was linear to the contact time fig 4 this can be explained by the limited mn2 concentration after prechlorination which makes the attachment of mno2 particles i e the physical pathway the main accumulation mechanism thus these experimental results clearly indicated that different states of mn i e mn2 and mno2 contributed to the two separate pathways in addition all the experimental results were well fitted by the two pathway numerical model which also validated the hypothesized mechanism of mn accumulation in chlorinated dwds the contribution of the two pathways was predicted under different experimental conditions using this model fig 5 shows the predicted contribution of the two separate pathways in experiments no 1 and 2 the predictions of the other experiments are shown in fig s7 in sms these predictions of mn accumulation indicated that the physical pathway contributed more to the initial phase without the prechlorination the chemical pathway accelerated with time i e with the accumulation of mno2 on the pipe surface becoming the main contributor to the mn accumulation process however the physical pathway remained the main contributor when the prechlorination process was conducted the physical pathway process contained two steps the presence of mno2 in solution and the attachment of mno2 to the pipe surface considering the mechanisms of the two pathways only the physical pathway contributed to mn accumulation when a new surface of test piece was introduced thus the physical pathway was the main contributor in the initial phase in all the experiments figs 5 and s7 in sms based on the model prediction over 90 and 99 of mn2 in the solution had been oxidized to mno2 after 3 d prechlorination in total mn concentrations of 100 and 10 µg l respectively fig s8 in sms the prediction was different from the measured concentration of mno2 i e particulate and colloidal mn section 3 1 which presented limitation of the model in the accuracy of predicting the state of mn in the bulk water since only the accumulation amount was utilized for fitting text s2 2 in sms the presence of colloidal mn at less than 10 000 mwco might be another possible reason for this inconsistency still since a large proportion of mn in the solution was present as mno2 following prechlorination the chemical pathway was inhibited due to the lack of mn2 and only the physical pathway contributed to the mn accumulation thus the accumulation process barely accelerated during the whole experiment figs 5 b and s7 g in sms the chemical pathway occurred following the attachment of mno2 onto the surface of the test pieces via the physical pathway and accelerated with time figs 5 a and s7 a f in sms this acceleration resulted in the acceleration of the entire mn accumulation process after it became the main contributor in this situation when mn2 in the solution was almost consumed the whole accumulation process was inhibited shown as the flat curves at the end of the 3 d contact fig 4 b from the results of the experiments no 1 and 8 it was predicted that the contribution of chemical pathway to the total mn accumulation at the end of the experiment was 67 for a total mn concentration of 100 µg l fig 5 a and 94 for 10 µg l fig s7 f in sms this indicates that the chemical pathway was more important at a lower total mn concentration which will be discussed in next section from a viewpoint of rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation 4 2 dependency of autocatalytic oxidation on experimental conditions according to the fitting results table 3 the rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation k 1 cl k 1 br k sur cl and k sur br at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l were one order of magnitude larger than those at 100 µg l hao et al 1991 observed a difference in the catalytic ability between commercial mno2 and mno2 particles formed during chlorination since the particle size of commercial mno2 was approximately 200 times that of the formed mno2 particles the rate constant of autocatalytic oxidation was considered to be negatively related to the size of the mno2 particles one reason for this tendency was that large particles have a small specific surface area to adsorb mn2 as shown in eq 2 hao et al 1991 in addition the initial particle size of mno2 formed in solution is expected to be positively correlated to the initial concentration of mno2 according to eq 19 huangfu et al 2013 where r h is the hydrodynamic radius of colloids k a is the rate of aggregation and n 0 is the initial concentration of the particles therefore with a higher concentration of total mn more mno2 would be formed with a similar amount of hocl through homogeneous oxidation initially eq 1 so that the particle size was larger this is qualitatively consistent with the observation that the ratio of particulate fraction 0 2 µm to mno2 concentration after 3 d prechlorination was much higher at a total mn concentration of 100 µg l than at 10 µg l of fig s4 to summarize the larger rate constants of autocatalytic oxidation at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l were likely to be caused by the smaller particle size and larger reactive surface area of the formed mno2 particles 19 d r h d t t 0 k a n 0 similarly when the total mn concentration in solution was the same the rate constants of the autocatalytic oxidation on the surface of the test piece i e the chemical pathway k sur cl and k sur br were one order of magnitude smaller than those in the solution k 1 cl and k 1 br this might also be due to the smaller specific surface area of accumulated mno2 than that of mno2 in the solution however the direct discussion of the impact of mno2 particle size or specific surface area in the current model is very limited since eqs 2 and 3 were described as one united term in the model although the rate constants of the chemical pathway k sur cl and k sur br were smaller it continuously accelerated with the increasing amount of mn accumulation while the autocatalytic oxidation in the solution was controlled by the concentration of mno2 which was involved in the physical pathway and was limited by the dosage in the experiment process therefore when the consumption rate of mn2 by the chemical pathway became faster than the oxidation in the solution mn2 tended to directly accumulate on the surface through the chemical pathway process and became the main contributor 4 3 effects of br and pipe materials on the two pathways bromide promoted all the oxidation processes in the system by forming hobr allard et al 2013 whose rate constants of oxidation k 0 br k 1 br and k sur br were estimated to be one order of magnitude larger than those for hocl k 0 cl k 1 cl and k sur br table 3 therefore the presence of br promoted the physical pathway indirectly by forming more mno2 in the solution while also directly enhancing the chemical pathway however even though more mno2 was formed in the solution with a higher concentration of br this positive impact in the initial phase was small this suggests that the attachment of mno2 onto the surface was the rate determining step in the physical pathway on the other hand when the chemical pathway accelerated and turned into the main contributor of mn accumulation this direct promotion by the presence of br significantly enhanced the accumulation process fig 2 the difference among the four types of materials was clearly observed in the first 3 d contact fig 3 while the physical pathway was the main contributor in the initial phase of mn accumulation pipe materials also influenced the chemical pathway indirectly by accumulating various amounts of mno2 on the surface in the initial phase thus the chemical pathway occurred earlier if the material had a stronger affinity to mno2 particles like pvc fig s7 c in sms according to the results of the model fitting the difference of materials was presented only in terms of k att table 3 which was one order of magnitude different among the four types of materials this strongly indicates that pipe materials affect the physical pathway of the mn accumulation process according to previous studies the attachment of various particles is often affected by the physicochemical properties of substratum such as surface charge dai et al 2004 roughness iida et al 1993 vrijenhoek et al 2001 and hydrophobicity lee et al 2010 dai et al 2004 as summarized in table s2 the ζ potential water contact angle and roughness of the tested materials were previous measured however no clear evidence of the impact of these factors on k att value was observed a more in depth characterization regarding chemical structures or functional groups might be effective to understand the impact of pipe materials on the physical pathway lee et al 1994 cunliffe et al 1999 although this study focused on br and the pipe material other factors in drinking water are also likely to impact the mn accumulation process the variation in ph affects the dissociation of hocl hobr and the oxidation rate as shown in eqs 11 18 allard et al 2013 hao et al 1991 influencing the chemical pathway directly and the physical pathway indirectly by changing the formation of particulate mno2 further the presence of cations e g ca2 mg2 in drinking water is reported to enhance the aggregation of mno2 particles huangfu et al 2013 which may also impact the rates of autocatalytic oxidation as discussed in section 4 2 at the same time this enhancement of particle aggregation might cause the gravitational settling to be more significant li et al 2019 influencing the physical pathway although the settling was not considered in this study because the turbulence forces formed by water flow was reported to sufficiently inhibit the settling of suspended solids in drinking water boxall and saul 2005 therefore further research is required to understand the effect of such parameters in real drinking water 4 4 significance of the mn states for controlling accumulation according to the experiment results and predictions by the two pathway model it was found that mn2 in the solution contributed to the chemical pathway and mno2 contributed to the physical pathway hence the states of mn present in finished water can largely affect the mn accumulation process in chlorinated dwds in japan the total mn concentration in finished water is mostly controlled at less than 5 µg l japan water works association jwwa 2019 even at such a low level of total mn concentration the mn accumulation can still be detected sly et al 1990 given that a further reduction of mn in the water treatment process is not realistic it is worth considering the control of mn accumulation by its state in finished water fig 6 shows the long term prediction of mn accumulation on an epoxy test piece under experimental conditions with varied proportions of mn2 to total mn concentration although mn accumulation was the lowest at the beginning when the proportion of mn2 was 100 the amount of mn accumulation then increased significantly with time and reached the highest level because of the enhancement of the chemical pathway similar trends were also observed in experiments no 8 and 9 at a total mn concentration of 10 µg l fig 4 b these results suggest that when compared under constant total mn concentrations reducing the proportion of mn2 in finished water might eventually be preferable for limiting mn accumulation moreover according to our prediction the rate of autocatalytic oxidation was larger at a lower concentration of total mn such that the contribution of the chemical pathway was crucial therefore decreasing the proportion of mn2 in finished water is vital for limiting the mn accumulation in dwds particularly when the total mn concentration is well controlled in contrast li et al 2019 recommended a different countermeasure reducing the total and particulate mn in finished water to less than 10 and 5 µg l respectively they speculated the preferential accumulation of particulate mn based on field observations in which they detected a significant decrease in the total and particulate mn concentration along with dwds particularly when there is a high proportion of particulate mn in finished water and a relatively low residual cl2 in such scenarios reducing the concentration of particulate mn might become a primary countermeasure because the chemical pathway is suppressed by the lack of mn2 as predicted in our study figs 5 b and s7 g however it is possible that the contribution of the chemical pathway will eventually become larger in a longer term operation as the curve of 50 mn2 in fig 6 at this phase reducing the proportion of mn2 to limit the chemical pathway might be an effective measure although this study presented a new viewpoint of physical and chemical pathways and their significance for the control of mn accumulation this prediction fig 6 assumed ideal experimental conditions to address when and in what practical situations the chemical pathway dominates the physical pathway further quantitative research is required this would allow the clarification of the contribution of both pathways in various realistic situations in dwds 5 conclusions based on the experimental results and data fitting with a numerical model this study showed that mn accumulates on the inner pipe surface in dwds via a two pathway process our findings showed that the state of mn i e mno2 and mn2 influenced mn accumulation by contributing to two separate pathways the chemical pathway occurred after mn had accumulated through the physical pathway process and accelerated with the increased amount of accumulation eventually turning into the main contributor of mn accumulation in addition the chemical pathway contributed more when the total mn concentration was lower because of the larger oxidation rate the types of pipe material directly influenced the physical pathway while the presence of br enhanced the chemical pathway our findings suggest that suppressing the chemical pathway is an effective strategy for limiting mn accumulation in dwds for long term operations further controlling the state of mn in finished water is of great importance declaration of competing interest the

17722,microplastics mps in aquatic systems can act as a vector for various toxic contaminants such as metal ions although some studies have investigated the adsorption characteristics of metal ions on mps the desorption behaviors of metal ions from mps in different environments are largely unknown here the adsorption of cadmium cd ii onto five different types of mps were compared to examine the relationship between the surface characteristics and the adsorption properties of mps our results showed that polyamide had the highest cd ii adsorption capability with a value of 1 70 0 04 mg g followed by polyvinyl chloride 1 04 0 03 mg g polystyrene 0 76 0 02 mg g acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 0 65 0 02 mg g and polyethylene terephthalate 0 25 0 01 mg g the specific surface area and total pore volume were closely correlated with the adsorption capacity of the mps and the π π interaction electrostatic interaction and oxygen containing functional groups played crucial roles in the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps the sorption capabilities of cd ii onto the mps first increased and then decreased with increasing solution ph from 2 0 to 9 0 in addition the adsorption capacities were suppressed with the presence of lead ions 20 80 mg l while the coexistence of phenanthrene had a minor impact interestingly the presence of humic acid promoted the desorption of cd ii from the mps both in the synthetic earthworm gut and in the sediment system a higher desorption rate was observed in the simulated gut environment suggesting that metal contaminated mps would pose higher ecological risks to macroinvertebrates overall our findings provide a better understanding of the sorption mechanism of cd ii onto mps and the desorption behavior under different environmental

pollutants adsorbed by mps is small compared to that adsorbed by other media e g suspended organic particulates in aquatic ecosystems koelmans et al 2016 compared with large plastics mps exhibit unique surface characteristics e g large specific areas porosity high hydrophobicity and amorphous structures bakir et al 2012 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2019c due to these characteristics the ability of mps to adsorb metal ions is considerably enhanced brennecke et al 2016 as indicated in the previous studies the dynamic equilibrium between the mps surface and contaminants is greatly influenced by the medium proprieties xu et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 generally electrostatic interaction is the universal mechanism for adsorption of chemical pollutants chen et al 2019 godoy et al 2019 in addition the surface area crystallinity and surface functional groups of mps are closely relevant to their chemical contaminants partitioning ability li et al 2018b li et al 2019b it should be noted that the surface properties of mps can be greatly altered by various environmental factors and the adsorption capabilities of mps may change as a consequence brennecke et al 2016 liu et al 2019d the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc of mps is usually lower than the environmental ph hence the ph is considered as a vital factor in the adsorption process holmes et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 moreover several studies have also reported that the effects of humic substrates or natural organic matters om on the sorption of metals ions onto mps are of great significance xu et al 2018 since various contaminants commonly co occur in aquatic environments they are often simultaneously adsorbed onto mps tourinho et al 2019 for instance different metals ions and pahs are frequently encountered in sediments through stormwater runoff wastewater discharge and sewage sludge applications al ali et al 2017 blasing and amelung 2018 therefore it is expected that the adsorption of a metal ion onto the mps can be influenced by other metal ions and pahs as an interfacial process desorption plays an important role in determining the fate and ecological risks of toxic contaminants absorbed on mps in aquatic environments zhang et al 2019 in the case of metal ions desorption from mps a reversible sorption phenomenon was recorded even though no desorption hysteresis values were given wang et al 2019 reported that the desorption rate of cadmium ions from mps was very high up to 92 9 implying that the adsorbed metal ions are likely to be released again hodson et al 2017 also found that the zinc ions adsorbed by polyethylene mps had a higher desorption rate 59 5 in synthetic earthworm guts although studies have found that metal ions adsorb onto mps and significant desorption of metal ions from mps occurs the adsorption desorption characteristics of metals from mps under different environmental conditions are largely unknown to accurately assess the ecological risks of mps in nature more studies are needed to examine the effects of different environmental factors on the adsorption desorption behaviors of metals ions from mps cadmium cd ii which is one of the most toxic metals is widely distributed in aquatic environments and has been found to easily accumulate on the surfaces of mps khan et al 2017 it is highly likely that the adsorption desorption processes may alter the fate bioavailability and toxicity of both cd ii and mps thus far few studies evaluating the risk of the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cd ii on mps have been conducted therefore in this work we mainly focus on 1 revealing the adsorption mechanisms of cd ii onto five different types of mps 2 investigating the adsorption and desorption behaviors of mps under various environmental conditions i e changes in solution ph lead ions humic acid and pahs and 3 evaluating the desorption hysteresis of cd ii from mps and comparing the desorption capabilities in the synthetic earthworm gut environment and in the sediment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents polyamide pa polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and polyethylene terephthalate pet were chosen as the adsorbents to evaluate the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cd ii on different types of mps irregular granular particles of mps were purchased from shanghai guanbu electromechanical technology inc shanghai china the mps pellets were cleaned several times with milli q water and then air dried the required particle size of mps was obtained using two stainless steel sieves with different mesh sizes 43 and 74 μm cd no3 2 pb no3 2 and nano3 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china humic acid stock solution was prepared by dissolving suwannee river humic acid standard iii cat no 3s101h international humic substances society in milli q water and the solution was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes phenanthrene solid powder purity 99 was purchased from aladdin co ltd shanghai china α amylase cellulase phosphatase and trypsin which were used in the desorption experiments were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china the solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 ωm and all the laboratory equipment was soaked in 10 v v nitric acid for more than 24 h and then was thoroughly rinsed with the ultra pure water 2 2 characterization of mps the diameters of the mps were estimated by stereomicroscope with a high resolution camera nikon smz25 japan the brunauer emmett teller bet n2 specific surface area and pore distribution were measured by n2 adsorption and desorption analysis and the phpzc of the mps was determined according to previous studies jiao et al 2017 li et al 2019c the detailed measurement methods are provided in the supporting information the surface morphologies and energy spectra of the mps were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fei sem quanta 250 and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds axf 650 apollo x respectively the crystallographic structure data of the mps were obtained by x ray diffraction xrd patterns performed on d8 advance in the range of 5 2θ 80 bruker germany in addition fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were applied to determine the surface functional group compositions of the mps the ftir spectra were detected in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 by a nicolet is10 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the xps information was gained through an x ray spectrometer k alpha thermo fisher scientific inc usa and the spectra were analyzed using xps peak 4 1 software 2 3 adsorption experiments the adsorption experiments were conducted in teflon lined screw cap glass vials in the dark at 24 1 c the measurements of the blanks and calibration controls were performed in triplicate the adsorption kinetics of the pa pvc ps abs and pet were accomplished in a solution of 0 01 mol l nano3 at a ph of 6 0 with a solid to liquid ratio of 0 1 g per 10 ml mass volume 10 g l and the initial cd ii concentration was 60 mg l bakir et al 2012 li et al 2019b all the glass vials were shaken at 220 rpm and the solutions were collected and passed through a 0 22 μm whatman paper filter the shake times ranged from 1 to 130 h and the resuts indicated that 42 h was sufficient to reach the adsorption equilibrium capacities for all mps a batch equilibration technique was performed in a 0 01 mol l nano3 solution at a ph of 6 0 in the adsorption isotherm experiment the solid to liquid ratio was 0 1 g of mps per 10 ml of background solution the diluted solutions containing a wide range of initial cd ii concentrations 20 140 mg l were set to obtain the desired equilibrium concentrations all the glass sealed vials were shaken at 220 rpm in a dark condition at 24 1 c on an orbital shaker shanghai tensuc ltd china the cd ii concentrations in the filtrates were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo fisher scientific inc usa the mps were collected and thoroughly rinsed by milli q water to remove any residual cd ii and were then dried at 35 c for the characterization analysis hodson et al 2017 further work was carried out to study the impacts of the solution chemistry on the sorption behavior of cd ii on mps for evaluating the impacts of the solution ph the ph values 2 0 9 0 were adjusted by 0 1 mol l hno3 and naoh the ph values and cd ii concentrations in the solutions were measured after reaching the adsorption equilibrium to investigate the effect of pb ii procedures identical to those mentioned above were performed with the cd ii solutions 80 mg l with pb ii 5 80 mg l to examine the effects of om on the adsorption of cd ii onto mps procedures identical to those depicted in the adsorption experiments were performed with the cd ii solutions 80 mg l with humic acid 1 50 mg l to study the effects of pahs on cd ii sorption cd ii solutions 80 mg l with phenanthrene 0 1 1 2 mg l were prepared the phenanthrene stock solutions were obtained by disolving phenanthrene in acetonitrile hplc fisher chemical and diluting it with a 0 01 mol l nano3 solution to minimize the cosolvent effects the volume percentage of acetonitrile was kept lower than 0 1 sun et al 2019 2 4 desorption experiments cd ii laden solid particles were prepared for the desorption experiments and the adsorbed concentrations were in the range of 0 02 0 07 mg g and 0 12 0 64 mg g for the low cd ii 10 mg l and high cd ii environments 100 mg l respectively the preparation method is given in the supporting information and initial cd ii content on the mps is described in table s1 a cacl2 solution 0 01 mol l ph 6 0 was used as the background solution for investigating the potential desorption in the sediment system mps 0 1 g were added into glass vials with 10 ml of the background solution and the mixture was shaken for 48 h at 220 rpm in the dark at 24 1 c to compare the desorption behaviors of cd ii from mps enzymes were used to simulate a synthetic earthworm gut solution the methods for obtaining the simulated gut environment are described in the previous studies ma et al 2009 smith et al 2010 in brief α amylase cellulase phosphatase and trypsin were dissolved in milli q water to form the enzyme activities of 675 u 186 u 37 u and 250 000 u respectively smith et al 2010 hodson et al 2017 indicated that the desorption behavior in an earthworm gut was a function of the mass instead of the volume of a solid therefore based on the moisture in an earthworm gut a 1 2 w v solid to liquid ratio was applied i e 1 g of cd laden mps was added into vials containing 2 ml of the synthetic solution hodson et al 2017 to assess the desorption behavior of cd ii on different mps as influenced by environmental factors the desorption process of cd ii in the absence or presence of pb ii humic acid ha and phenanthrene phe was investigated both in the simulated gut environment and in the sediment system four experimental treatments were arranged as follows 1 cd cd laden mps 2 cd pb cd laden mps and pb ii 50 mg l 3 cd ha cd laden mps and ha 10 mg l and 4 cd phe cd laden mps and phe 1 mg l all the sealed glass vials were shaken for 48 h because our preliminary experiment indicated that 48 h was sufficient to reach the desorption equilibrium after 48 h the solutions in each treatment were passed through 0 22 μm filters and the mps were collected subsequently the equivalent volume of the corresponding background solution was added into each vial again since it is difficult to collect sediment particles the sediment samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rcf the desorption processes in both the simulated gut and sediment systems were repeated three times and almost no cd ii was detected in the third cycle 2 5 quality control the glass vials used in both the adsorption and the desorption experiments were soaked in 10 hno3 for more than 24 h prior to use and all vials were thoroughly rinsed by milli q water to avoid cross contamination blank calibration controls with the absence of solid particles were performed in triplicate for each concentration used in this work the solute concentrations in the blank calibration controls were measured after attaining adsorption equilibrium the measured values were taken as the real initial concentrations for the sake of controlling any loss caused by adsorption to the apparatus surfaces eventually the solutes adsorbed onto solid particles were calculated from the differences between the blank calibration controls and the corresponding filtrates 2 6 data analysis the pseudo second order kinetic model and elovich model were used to fit the kinetics of cd ii adsorption onto mps while the langmuir freundlich and henry models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherms the detailed information of these models is described in the supporting information the distribution adsorption coefficient kd was determined by dividing the adsorbed amount of cd ii qe on the mps by the equilibrium concentration in the solution ce the qe was calculated by the following equation 1 q e c i c e v m where qe was the adsorption capacity of cd ii mg g and ci and ce were the initial solution concentration mg l and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively v and m referred to the equilibrium volume l and the mass of the different mps g respectively the degrees of desorption in the first and second desorption processes were quantified by the desorption hysteresis index hi huang et al 2019 hi1 and hi2 represented the first and second hi in equilibrium respectively and were calculated by the following equations 2 h 1 q e d 1 q e s q e s t c e 3 h 2 q e d 2 q e s q e s t c e where q e d 1 and q e d 2 referred to the equilibrium concentrations in the solid phase in the first and second desorption processes respectively q e s was the equilibrium concentration of the absorption experiment the t kelvin and ce mg l subscripts following q e s defined the constant conditions of the temperature and the equilibrium concentration of the solute under this condition at a given solute concentration hi 0 implied that adsorption and desorption isotherms were completely overlapped and no desorption hysteresis occurred while a higher hi value indicated that more obvious desorption hysteresis occurred the normality and homogeneity of the data sets were tested using the shapiro wilk and levene tests the one way anova and tukey s post hoc tests were used to evaluate the differences in the adsorption and desorption parameters among the different treatments the above statistical analyses were conducted using the pasw statistics 18 software ibm spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 characterization of mps the specific surface area and total pore volume vtotal values of the mps varied from 1 95 0 29 to 9 51 0 51 m2 g and 0 025 0 004 to 0 09 0 004 cm3 g respectively table 1 the mesopore volume 2 50 nm occupied the largest portion of the pore volume with values ranging from 86 83 to 90 01 table 1 the sem results revealed that the typical surfaces of most of the mps were rough fig 1 however the pet showed a relatively smooth morphology with a few wrinkles and pits being found fig 1 the eds analysis implied that cd can be found on the surfaces of all the experimental mps both before and after sorption fig 2 the presence of sharp diffraction peaks on the xrd patterns indicated a high degree of crystallinity sharp diffraction peaks were found in the xrd patterns of the pa and abs fig 3 with crystallinity values of 33 35 3 43 and 27 15 3 39 respectively table 1 the crystallinity values of the mps followed the order of pa abs pvc ps pet table 1 and no conspicuous changes were detected after the adsorption of cd ii fig 3 the surface functional groups of the mps before adsorption and after adsorption desorption were characterized by ftir fig 4 ch stretching commonly existed in all the types of mps involved in the experiments meanwhile each polymer has its own functional groups for instance nh and cnh functional groups in pa the ccl functional group in pvc c n functional groups in abs and terephthalate and polar ester groups in pet additionally the spectra shapes of each polymer were similar before adsorption and after adsorption desorption and the main sorption peaks occurred at approximately the same position and changes in the peak areas were seldom observed fig 4 the xps was applied to further examine the surface functional group compositions of the mps fig 5 the peaks of c 1s and o 1s except on ps were detected in the xps spectra of all the mps both before and after adsorption of cd ii and the peaks of cd 3d were detected in pa pvc and ps after adsorption fig s1 the c 1s deconvolution of the mps implied the existence of cc cc co co and oco functional groups and the relative atomic percentages and corresponding binding energy are given in fig 5 and table 1 respectively the contents of c o increased on all the mps except pvc after adsorption however the change trends of cc cc co and oco before and after the sorption of cd ii depended on the type of mps 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cd ii onto mps the sorption kinetics of cd ii onto mps and sediments are given in fig 6 and the parameters of the kinetics from the pseudo second order and elovich models are listed in table s2 the experimental data were better fitted by the pseudo second order model than by the elovich model the sorption isotherms of cd ii onto the mps and sediments are presented in fig 7 and the parameters of the isotherm models are given in table s3 as suggested by the r2 values the adsorption isotherms could be better fitted by the freundlich model than by the langmuir and henry models table s3 the maximum adsorption capacities qm the partition coefficient kd and the kf values of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet table s3 the pa isotherm showed a larger deviation from langmuir model compared with those of the other four types of mps in addition the higher kf value 0 0135 0 0002 l g for pa indicated its higher adsorption ability the n values for pa pvc ps abs and pet were 0 885 0 013 0 821 0 011 0 768 0 02 0 701 0 015 and 0 588 0 021 respectively implying that the surface heterogeneity of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet the deviation kf and kd of the mps were much smaller than those of the sediment table s3 additionally the feasibility values of the sorption processes rl were in the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process was energetically favorable 3 3 effects of the solution ph pb ii humic acid and phenanthrene on the sorption of cd ii onto mps the capability of cd ii to adsorb onto the mps was influenced by the solution ph fig 8 a the sorption capability first largely increased then decreased in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps was not suppressed by pb ii at concentrations between 1 and 15 mg l fig 8b by contrast the adsorption capability was evidently decreased with increasing pb ii concentrations 20 80 mg l and was suppressed by approximately 29 48 2 51 5 53 1 and 54 5 for pa pvc ps abs and pet respectively the presence of humic acid ha 1 50 mg l largely decreased the cd ii adsorption by pa abs and pet which decreased by approximately 22 43 2 and 44 9 respectively fig 8c however the cd ii content adsorbed by pvc and ps first decreased and then increased the low concentration of phenanthrene 0 1 2 mg l had no apparent effect on the absorption of cd ii by the mps fig 8d 3 4 desorption of cd ii from mps in the synthetic earthworm gut and sediment environments upon increasing the cd ii concentration from 10 to 100 mg l the desorption hysteresis of cd ii from the mps in the synthetic earthworm gut environment was obviously decreased table s4 at a given cd ii concentration the hi in the second desorption process hi2 was higher than the hi in the first desorption process hi1 the hi1 and hi2 values of the different mps groups were in the order of cd cd phe cd pd cd ha at both the 10 and 100 mg l cd ii concentrations table s4 notably significant desorption hysteresis p 0 01 in the first desorption process was only detected for the cd ha treatment at both the 10 and 100 mg l cd ii concentrations similarly a desorption hysteresis phenomenon was also observed in the sediment systems and the hi1 and hi2 values of each treatment showed the same trend in comparison to the simulated gut environment table s5 it should be noted that the hi1 values in the sediment system were significantly higher than those in the simulated gut environment p 0 01 table s6 higher desorption was detected in the simulated gut environment 36 9 49 2 and 46 5 59 9 at 10 and 100 mg l of cd respectively fig 9 when the initial cd concentrations were 10 and 100 mg l the desorption rates of cd ii in the simulated gut environment were 33 6 49 2 and 43 55 4 higher than those in the sediment respectively in contrast lower desorption rates were observed in the sediment system 6 9 15 8 and 9 9 18 7 at 10 and 100 mg l of cd respectively fig 9 the desorption capability of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet at the 10 mg l concentration of cd ii the presence of pb ii ha and phe had negligible impacts on the desorption of cd ii from the mps however at the 100 mg l concentration of cd ii ha suppressed the desorption of cd ii from certain types of mps both in the simulated gut environment and the sediment system fig 9 at a given cd ii concentration the desorption rates of cd ii in the gut environment were statistically larger than those in the sediment system p 0 01 table s7 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the surface characteristics and sorption properties of cd ii onto mps generally the surface structure specific surface area crystallinity and surface functional groups of mps are considered to be closely related to their adsorption properties li et al 2018b thus the sorption mechanisms need to be evaluated when relating the surface characteristics to the sorption properties of mps in this study the sem results revealed that there were numerous cracks wrinkles and pits on the surfaces of the mps fig 1 which could promote the adsorption of pollutants bakir et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the sa 1 95 9 51 m2 g and vtotal 0 025 0 09 cm3 g of the mps of this work followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet p 0 01 table 1 and coincided with the magnitudes of the maximum adsorption capacities qm of the mps table s3 and fig s2 the eds patterns fig 2 suggest that the metal contaminants on the mps can originate not only from plastic additives harikrishnan et al 2017 godoy et al 2019 but can also be adsorbed from the surroundings zhang et al 2019 the previous studies implied that the crystallinity of mps might be an important impact factor for the adsorption behavior of mps rochman et al 2013 liu et al 2019e liu et al 2019b and guo et al 2012 found that a high crystallinity could lead to a low adsorption capacity but liu et al 2019e reported a positive correlation between the crystallinity and adsorption capacity our study showed that pa had the highest crystallinity 33 35 3 43 and the largest qm 1 695 0 039 mg g however abs had a relatively low cd ii adsorption capacity 0 652 0 018 mg g although its crystallinity was higher than that of the pvc ps and pet table 1 to ascertain the role of crystallinity the partition coefficient kd was normalized with the crystallinity kd crystallinity in comparison to the kd values the differences in the kd crystallinity values among the different types of mps were not reduced after normalization table 2 the findings of zhang et al 2019 and our study implied that no formation of new crystalline phases appeared after the adsorption of cd ii these results indicate that the crystallinity of mps may not be the main influencing factor of metal adsorption theoretically the adsorption of metal ions onto mps surface is determined by the intermolecular interactions between the adsorbates and polymers e g electrostatic interaction van der waals and hydrogen bonding interactions cao et al 2017 in general the adsorption capacity of mps largely relies on the chemical structure of the polymer and the potential interactions godoy et al 2019 the specific functional groups of the mps are highly likely to take more important roles in the metal adsorption process compared with those of the ch group bakir et al 2012 li et al 2018a for instance the co and nh functional groups were thought to interact preferentially with metal adsorbates li et al 2018a the presence of co and nh groups on the surface of pa and its highest adsorption capability compared with the pvc ps abs and pet figs 4a and 6 reaffirmed the previous results in consideration of the possible important role of oxygen containing functional groups and the π π interaction in the process of metals adsorbing onto mps li et al 2018a the c 1s xps spectra of the pa pvc ps abs and pet before and after the sorption of cd ii were investigated to further reveal the cd ii sorption mechanism the increase in the co band proportions on the mps except pvc after cd ii adsorption fig 5 implied that the adsorption of cd ions onto the mps surface might be causing a reaction in the polymer that leads to the formation of more co bonds sar et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the rise in the cc cc band proportions of pa and abs after the sorption of cd ii fig 5 confirmed the important role of π π interactions on certain types of mps during the metal ion adsorption process bakir et al 2012 sun et al 2019 moreover the relative atomic percentage of co was largely increased on the pvc ps and pet when the cc cc band proportions were decreased fig 5 suggesting the significant role of the co functional group in the metal ion adsorption process yue et al 2015 the cooh band proportions did not vary regularly after the cd ii adsorption fig 5 this finding might be attributed to the minor role of cooh in the metal adsorption onto pa pvc ps and abs li et al 2017a the above findings showed that the oxygen functional groups especially the co and co groups played critical roles in the process of cd adsorption onto mps bakir et al 2012 the metal adsorption capability of the mps recorded in this work was in accordance with the previous studies table s8 the results of the kd sa and kd vtotal ratios in table 2 indicated that the mps with larger sa and higher vtotal values had higher adsorption affinities for cd ii wang and chen 2015 sun et al 2019 for instance the sa of pa 9 51 0 51 m2 g was approximately 3 9 times larger than that of the pet 1 95 0 29 m2 g while the qm of cd ii onto pa 1 695 0 039 mg g was approximately 5 8 times greater than that of the pet 0 247 0 008 mg g furthermore in table s3 the rl values 0 rl 1 and the better fit with the freundlich model imply that the process of cd ii adsorbing onto mps was energetically favorable and not a simple monolayer adsorption process liu et al 2019c 4 2 effects of water ph pb ii humic acid and phenanthrene on the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps as the ph may affect the surface charges of the adsorbents and the speciation of the metal ions the water ph is widely recognized as an important factor influencing the adsorption properties of mps in aquatic environments melo et al 2013 in this study the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps first increased and then gradually decreased with the increasing solution ph fig 8a the increase in adsorption was mainly owing to the enhanced anionic surface in this ph range indicating that electrostatic interactions might play important functions in the adsorption of cd ii onto mps wang et al 2020a the largest cd ii adsorption capabilities were recorded at the ph values of 7 6 6 6 and 6 for the pa pvc ps abs and pet respectively fig 8 and their corresponding phpzc values were 5 97 0 16 5 84 0 25 5 42 0 32 5 68 0 41 and 5 49 0 27 respectively table 1 when ph phpzc the net negatively charged mps favored the adsorption of cd ii khan et al 2017 however if the solution ph continues to increase a charge repulsion may be generated and result in the decreasing of the adsorption amount moreover under a high solution ph condition the formed precipitation of cd oh cd oh 2 may compete for the active sites on the mps surface and lead to a decline in cd ii adsorption capability of mps park et al 2017 overall these findings imply that the adsorption of cd ii onto mps may be dominated by electrostatic interactions and ions exchange al ali et al 2017 as reported pb ii can also be adsorbed by mps rochman et al 2013 al ali et al 2017 and the adsorption may occur on the same adsorption sites of mps as cd ii han et al 2017 li et al 2017b the cd ii sorption is suppressed by mps joined with pb ii 20 80 mg l fig 7b implying that competitive adsorption occurred during the process of metal ions adsorbing onto the mps han et al 2017 gao et al 2019 this similar competitive adsorption phenomenon on mps coupled with pb cu and cd was also shown in a recent study by gao et al 2019 additionally as the molar mass of pb 207 2 g mol is far higher than that of cd 112 4 g mol which means that at a given mass volume concentration of cd and pb mg l the molar concentration mmol l of pb is always smaller than that of cd further investigations are needed to elucidate the potential explanations for this suppression phenomenon humic acid ha which is a common type of natural organic matter usually exists with a negative charge carries oxygen functional groups and can form a copolymer with mps chen et al 2018 sun et al 2019 this type of macromolecule performs various roles in the sorption process of mps the negatively charged ha molecules can offer new sorption sites for cd ii directivity leading to competitive adsorption sun et al 2019 therefore the adsorbed cd ii content on the pa abs and pet decreased with an increase in the ha concentration fig 8c a similar adsorption inhibition phenomenon was also found with the adsorption of cd ii and tetracycline onto pa as impacted by ha chen et al 2019 on the other hand ha is indicated to be adsorbed onto some types of mps resulting in increasing zeta potentials and electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and mps chen et al 2018 li et al 2018a consequently the adsorption of cd ii onto pvc and ps increased with an increase in ha fig 8c this finding is consistent with the findings of li et al 2018a who found that the cd ii sorption capability of pvc and ps increased with an increase in ha the existence of a low concentration of phenanthrene 0 1 1 2 mg l caused a negligible impact on the adsorption of cd ii onto mps fig 8d mainly because the adsorption process of cd ii and phenanthrene took place at different adsorption sites of the adsorbents sun et al 2019 as indicated in a previous study wang et al 2020b the adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e g phenanthrene pyrene and fluoranthene onto mps is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions on the other hand with the presence of cd ii new adsorption sites for phenanthrene can be formed through cation π interactions gao et al 2019 sun et al 2019 which is another possible explanation for the negligible suppression impact of phenanthrene on the metal ion adsorption capability of mps 4 3 desorption behavior of cd ii from mps in the synthetic earthworm gut and sediment systems koelmans et al 2016 implied that the ingestion of mps is unlikely to raise the exposure to and risks of hydrophobic organic chemicals in the marine environment however if given a high abundance of mps particles relative to other media the desorption hysteresis phenomenon from mps probably can impact the mobility and biotoxicity of contaminants in the environment gao et al 2003 the observed desorption hi values were all larger than 0 table s4 suggesting that significant irreversible hysteresis of cd ii occurred during the desorption processes both in the synthetic earthworm gut environment and the sediment system it was reported that metal ions tend to irreversibly adsorb onto high energy adsorption sites under low surface coverage li et al 2014 hence at a given cd ii concentration all the hi2 values were obviously larger than the hi1 values both in the simulated earthworm gut environment and the sediment system table s4 in terms of the hi value with different cd ii surface loadings it was decreased with the increase in cd ii laden on the mps one possible explanation for this result is that the cd adsorption process shifts largely from irreversible to reversible when the absorption of cd ii onto mps increases li et al 2014 the presence of other solutes will increase the complexity of the desorption process of cd ii from the mps liu et al 2019c the steric hindrance derived from the pb ii and phenanthrene molecules is weaker than the ha macromolecules produced chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019c therefore the coexistence of ha resulted in significantly higher hi values which demonstrated that organic macromolecules would complicate the desorption of metal ions from mps the enzyme mixture solution may exhibit totally different chemical properties compared to the cacl2 electrolyte smith et al 2010 hodson et al 2017 as the covalent bonds between cd ii and the adsorbents might be broken by enzymes dong et al 2015 the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps could become more reversible thus lower hi values were measured in the simulated gut environment the toxicity and mobility of the contaminants are closely related to the desorption properties gao et al 2019 sun et al 2019 lower desorption rates were observed in the sediment system fig 9 suggesting that once adsorbed most of the cd ii is likely to be retained on the mps in sediment system in comparison the cd ii desorption capabilities of the mps in the simulated gut environment were approximately 2 5 fold higher than those in the sediment system fig 9 this observation is consistent with the finding of hodson et al 2017 in which they showed that the desorbed zinc content from mps in the simulated gut environment was 4 fold larger than that in the sediment system the high desorption rate in the simulated gut environment indicated that once metal contaminants adsorbed onto the mps and the mps were ingested by sediment faunas the bioavailability and toxicity of the cd would be elevated hodson et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 additionally the desorption capability from high cd ii loading mps was obviously stronger than that from the low ones fig 9 and this was also suggested by the lower hi values in the high cd loading group 100 mg l table s4 and s5 thus it stands to reason that environments seriously contaminated by metal contaminants will load more metal ions onto mps thus leading to a higher metal ion desorption capacity and larger bioavailability and toxicity khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in general the desorption capability of contaminants from mps is determined by the strength of the interfacial binding force between the adsorbed contaminants and the mps zhang et al 2019 different types of mps had unique surface characteristics and diverse functional group compositions bakir et al 2012 as a result the degree of cd ii desorption varied with the type of mps and followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet fig 9 and was identical to the initial amount of cd ii loading table s1 this finding further confirmed that the desorption capacity of metal ions from mps greatly depends on the adsorption capacity of the mps overall the desorption process of cd ii in the presence of ha was very different which was also suggested by the higher hi values tables s4 and s5 to conclude the steric hindrance originating from ha might block the desorption of metal ions from the mps sun et al 2019 a much higher desorption capability was observed in the simulated gut environment than in the sediments hence we assumed that if exposed to a high concentration of mps 1 to 10 in the sediment enhanced ecological risks would occur after the ingestion of metal ion laden mp faunas koelmans et al 2016 obvious suppression was found regarding the adsorption desorption behavior of cd ii when the solution ph was changed and when pb ii and humic acid coexisted which implied that environmental changes and the coexistence of other molecules would complicate the desorption of metal ions from mps this also suggested that environmental factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks associated with mps and metal contaminants 5 conclusions here we demonstrated that pa had the largest adsorption capacity followed by pvc ps abs and pet and that changes in the solution ph coexisting pb ii and humic acid considerably influenced the adsorption of cd ii by mps the electrostatic interaction and π π interaction were the main adsorption mechanisms for cd ii onto mps and oxygen containing functional groups played crucial roles in the cd ii adsorption processes of mps moreover desorption hysteresis phenomena occurred both in the simulated gut environment and the sediment system the desorption degree of cd ii from mps was much higher in the simulated gut environment than in the sediment system these findings implied that under a high plastic particle environment metal pollutant associated ecological risks can be enhanced by the adsorption desorption behavior of mps however regarding a realistic environment more environmentally relevant long term studies are needed to assess the effects of the ingestion of mps on bioaccumulation in summary this work provides a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of cd ii onto mps and a first systematic view into the desorption hysteresis and desorption capability in different environments declaration of

17722,microplastics mps in aquatic systems can act as a vector for various toxic contaminants such as metal ions although some studies have investigated the adsorption characteristics of metal ions on mps the desorption behaviors of metal ions from mps in different environments are largely unknown here the adsorption of cadmium cd ii onto five different types of mps were compared to examine the relationship between the surface characteristics and the adsorption properties of mps our results showed that polyamide had the highest cd ii adsorption capability with a value of 1 70 0 04 mg g followed by polyvinyl chloride 1 04 0 03 mg g polystyrene 0 76 0 02 mg g acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 0 65 0 02 mg g and polyethylene terephthalate 0 25 0 01 mg g the specific surface area and total pore volume were closely correlated with the adsorption capacity of the mps and the π π interaction electrostatic interaction and oxygen containing functional groups played crucial roles in the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps the sorption capabilities of cd ii onto the mps first increased and then decreased with increasing solution ph from 2 0 to 9 0 in addition the adsorption capacities were suppressed with the presence of lead ions 20 80 mg l while the coexistence of phenanthrene had a minor impact interestingly the presence of humic acid promoted the desorption of cd ii from the mps both in the synthetic earthworm gut and in the sediment system a higher desorption rate was observed in the simulated gut environment suggesting that metal contaminated mps would pose higher ecological risks to macroinvertebrates overall our findings provide a better understanding of the sorption mechanism of cd ii onto mps and the desorption behavior under different environmental conditions in aquatic ecosystems keywords freshwater humic acid macroinvertebrate gut metal ions plastic particles 1 introduction microplastics mps which are small plastic debris or pellets less than 5 mm in diameter are derived from the breakdown of plastic products or cosmetic and personal products brennecke et al 2016 peeken et al 2018 kozlowska et al 2019 this new anthropogenic stressor commonly occurs both in aquatic and in terrestrial environments and is considered as a persistent pollutant that poses negative impacts on natural environments li et al 2019a rillig et al 2019 recently a series of laboratory studies have demonstrated that adverse impacts on organisms such as physical injuries jin et al 2018 lahive et al 2019 cytotoxicity and morphological changes wu et al 2019 araújo et al 2020 and altered gut bacterial communities chen et al 2020 can be induced by ingestion of mps it has been widely recognized that mps not only pose directive impacts on their surroundings but also act as a vector for toxic additives liu et al 2019a luo et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pannetier et al 2019 trevisan et al 2019 antibiotics li et al 2018a liu et al 2019b and metal ions brennecke et al 2016 hodson et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 however it still should be noted that under realistic environmental conditions the fraction of pollutants adsorbed by mps is small compared to that adsorbed by other media e g suspended organic particulates in aquatic ecosystems koelmans et al 2016 compared with large plastics mps exhibit unique surface characteristics e g large specific areas porosity high hydrophobicity and amorphous structures bakir et al 2012 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2019c due to these characteristics the ability of mps to adsorb metal ions is considerably enhanced brennecke et al 2016 as indicated in the previous studies the dynamic equilibrium between the mps surface and contaminants is greatly influenced by the medium proprieties xu et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 generally electrostatic interaction is the universal mechanism for adsorption of chemical pollutants chen et al 2019 godoy et al 2019 in addition the surface area crystallinity and surface functional groups of mps are closely relevant to their chemical contaminants partitioning ability li et al 2018b li et al 2019b it should be noted that the surface properties of mps can be greatly altered by various environmental factors and the adsorption capabilities of mps may change as a consequence brennecke et al 2016 liu et al 2019d the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc of mps is usually lower than the environmental ph hence the ph is considered as a vital factor in the adsorption process holmes et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 moreover several studies have also reported that the effects of humic substrates or natural organic matters om on the sorption of metals ions onto mps are of great significance xu et al 2018 since various contaminants commonly co occur in aquatic environments they are often simultaneously adsorbed onto mps tourinho et al 2019 for instance different metals ions and pahs are frequently encountered in sediments through stormwater runoff wastewater discharge and sewage sludge applications al ali et al 2017 blasing and amelung 2018 therefore it is expected that the adsorption of a metal ion onto the mps can be influenced by other metal ions and pahs as an interfacial process desorption plays an important role in determining the fate and ecological risks of toxic contaminants absorbed on mps in aquatic environments zhang et al 2019 in the case of metal ions desorption from mps a reversible sorption phenomenon was recorded even though no desorption hysteresis values were given wang et al 2019 reported that the desorption rate of cadmium ions from mps was very high up to 92 9 implying that the adsorbed metal ions are likely to be released again hodson et al 2017 also found that the zinc ions adsorbed by polyethylene mps had a higher desorption rate 59 5 in synthetic earthworm guts although studies have found that metal ions adsorb onto mps and significant desorption of metal ions from mps occurs the adsorption desorption characteristics of metals from mps under different environmental conditions are largely unknown to accurately assess the ecological risks of mps in nature more studies are needed to examine the effects of different environmental factors on the adsorption desorption behaviors of metals ions from mps cadmium cd ii which is one of the most toxic metals is widely distributed in aquatic environments and has been found to easily accumulate on the surfaces of mps khan et al 2017 it is highly likely that the adsorption desorption processes may alter the fate bioavailability and toxicity of both cd ii and mps thus far few studies evaluating the risk of the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cd ii on mps have been conducted therefore in this work we mainly focus on 1 revealing the adsorption mechanisms of cd ii onto five different types of mps 2 investigating the adsorption and desorption behaviors of mps under various environmental conditions i e changes in solution ph lead ions humic acid and pahs and 3 evaluating the desorption hysteresis of cd ii from mps and comparing the desorption capabilities in the synthetic earthworm gut environment and in the sediment system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents polyamide pa polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and polyethylene terephthalate pet were chosen as the adsorbents to evaluate the adsorption and desorption behaviors of cd ii on different types of mps irregular granular particles of mps were purchased from shanghai guanbu electromechanical technology inc shanghai china the mps pellets were cleaned several times with milli q water and then air dried the required particle size of mps was obtained using two stainless steel sieves with different mesh sizes 43 and 74 μm cd no3 2 pb no3 2 and nano3 were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china humic acid stock solution was prepared by dissolving suwannee river humic acid standard iii cat no 3s101h international humic substances society in milli q water and the solution was filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes phenanthrene solid powder purity 99 was purchased from aladdin co ltd shanghai china α amylase cellulase phosphatase and trypsin which were used in the desorption experiments were obtained from aladdin co ltd shanghai china the solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 ωm and all the laboratory equipment was soaked in 10 v v nitric acid for more than 24 h and then was thoroughly rinsed with the ultra pure water 2 2 characterization of mps the diameters of the mps were estimated by stereomicroscope with a high resolution camera nikon smz25 japan the brunauer emmett teller bet n2 specific surface area and pore distribution were measured by n2 adsorption and desorption analysis and the phpzc of the mps was determined according to previous studies jiao et al 2017 li et al 2019c the detailed measurement methods are provided in the supporting information the surface morphologies and energy spectra of the mps were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fei sem quanta 250 and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds axf 650 apollo x respectively the crystallographic structure data of the mps were obtained by x ray diffraction xrd patterns performed on d8 advance in the range of 5 2θ 80 bruker germany in addition fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were applied to determine the surface functional group compositions of the mps the ftir spectra were detected in the 4000 400 cm 1 region with a resolution of 4 cm 1 by a nicolet is10 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the xps information was gained through an x ray spectrometer k alpha thermo fisher scientific inc usa and the spectra were analyzed using xps peak 4 1 software 2 3 adsorption experiments the adsorption experiments were conducted in teflon lined screw cap glass vials in the dark at 24 1 c the measurements of the blanks and calibration controls were performed in triplicate the adsorption kinetics of the pa pvc ps abs and pet were accomplished in a solution of 0 01 mol l nano3 at a ph of 6 0 with a solid to liquid ratio of 0 1 g per 10 ml mass volume 10 g l and the initial cd ii concentration was 60 mg l bakir et al 2012 li et al 2019b all the glass vials were shaken at 220 rpm and the solutions were collected and passed through a 0 22 μm whatman paper filter the shake times ranged from 1 to 130 h and the resuts indicated that 42 h was sufficient to reach the adsorption equilibrium capacities for all mps a batch equilibration technique was performed in a 0 01 mol l nano3 solution at a ph of 6 0 in the adsorption isotherm experiment the solid to liquid ratio was 0 1 g of mps per 10 ml of background solution the diluted solutions containing a wide range of initial cd ii concentrations 20 140 mg l were set to obtain the desired equilibrium concentrations all the glass sealed vials were shaken at 220 rpm in a dark condition at 24 1 c on an orbital shaker shanghai tensuc ltd china the cd ii concentrations in the filtrates were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes thermo fisher scientific inc usa the mps were collected and thoroughly rinsed by milli q water to remove any residual cd ii and were then dried at 35 c for the characterization analysis hodson et al 2017 further work was carried out to study the impacts of the solution chemistry on the sorption behavior of cd ii on mps for evaluating the impacts of the solution ph the ph values 2 0 9 0 were adjusted by 0 1 mol l hno3 and naoh the ph values and cd ii concentrations in the solutions were measured after reaching the adsorption equilibrium to investigate the effect of pb ii procedures identical to those mentioned above were performed with the cd ii solutions 80 mg l with pb ii 5 80 mg l to examine the effects of om on the adsorption of cd ii onto mps procedures identical to those depicted in the adsorption experiments were performed with the cd ii solutions 80 mg l with humic acid 1 50 mg l to study the effects of pahs on cd ii sorption cd ii solutions 80 mg l with phenanthrene 0 1 1 2 mg l were prepared the phenanthrene stock solutions were obtained by disolving phenanthrene in acetonitrile hplc fisher chemical and diluting it with a 0 01 mol l nano3 solution to minimize the cosolvent effects the volume percentage of acetonitrile was kept lower than 0 1 sun et al 2019 2 4 desorption experiments cd ii laden solid particles were prepared for the desorption experiments and the adsorbed concentrations were in the range of 0 02 0 07 mg g and 0 12 0 64 mg g for the low cd ii 10 mg l and high cd ii environments 100 mg l respectively the preparation method is given in the supporting information and initial cd ii content on the mps is described in table s1 a cacl2 solution 0 01 mol l ph 6 0 was used as the background solution for investigating the potential desorption in the sediment system mps 0 1 g were added into glass vials with 10 ml of the background solution and the mixture was shaken for 48 h at 220 rpm in the dark at 24 1 c to compare the desorption behaviors of cd ii from mps enzymes were used to simulate a synthetic earthworm gut solution the methods for obtaining the simulated gut environment are described in the previous studies ma et al 2009 smith et al 2010 in brief α amylase cellulase phosphatase and trypsin were dissolved in milli q water to form the enzyme activities of 675 u 186 u 37 u and 250 000 u respectively smith et al 2010 hodson et al 2017 indicated that the desorption behavior in an earthworm gut was a function of the mass instead of the volume of a solid therefore based on the moisture in an earthworm gut a 1 2 w v solid to liquid ratio was applied i e 1 g of cd laden mps was added into vials containing 2 ml of the synthetic solution hodson et al 2017 to assess the desorption behavior of cd ii on different mps as influenced by environmental factors the desorption process of cd ii in the absence or presence of pb ii humic acid ha and phenanthrene phe was investigated both in the simulated gut environment and in the sediment system four experimental treatments were arranged as follows 1 cd cd laden mps 2 cd pb cd laden mps and pb ii 50 mg l 3 cd ha cd laden mps and ha 10 mg l and 4 cd phe cd laden mps and phe 1 mg l all the sealed glass vials were shaken for 48 h because our preliminary experiment indicated that 48 h was sufficient to reach the desorption equilibrium after 48 h the solutions in each treatment were passed through 0 22 μm filters and the mps were collected subsequently the equivalent volume of the corresponding background solution was added into each vial again since it is difficult to collect sediment particles the sediment samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rcf the desorption processes in both the simulated gut and sediment systems were repeated three times and almost no cd ii was detected in the third cycle 2 5 quality control the glass vials used in both the adsorption and the desorption experiments were soaked in 10 hno3 for more than 24 h prior to use and all vials were thoroughly rinsed by milli q water to avoid cross contamination blank calibration controls with the absence of solid particles were performed in triplicate for each concentration used in this work the solute concentrations in the blank calibration controls were measured after attaining adsorption equilibrium the measured values were taken as the real initial concentrations for the sake of controlling any loss caused by adsorption to the apparatus surfaces eventually the solutes adsorbed onto solid particles were calculated from the differences between the blank calibration controls and the corresponding filtrates 2 6 data analysis the pseudo second order kinetic model and elovich model were used to fit the kinetics of cd ii adsorption onto mps while the langmuir freundlich and henry models were applied to fit the adsorption isotherms the detailed information of these models is described in the supporting information the distribution adsorption coefficient kd was determined by dividing the adsorbed amount of cd ii qe on the mps by the equilibrium concentration in the solution ce the qe was calculated by the following equation 1 q e c i c e v m where qe was the adsorption capacity of cd ii mg g and ci and ce were the initial solution concentration mg l and equilibrium concentration mg l respectively v and m referred to the equilibrium volume l and the mass of the different mps g respectively the degrees of desorption in the first and second desorption processes were quantified by the desorption hysteresis index hi huang et al 2019 hi1 and hi2 represented the first and second hi in equilibrium respectively and were calculated by the following equations 2 h 1 q e d 1 q e s q e s t c e 3 h 2 q e d 2 q e s q e s t c e where q e d 1 and q e d 2 referred to the equilibrium concentrations in the solid phase in the first and second desorption processes respectively q e s was the equilibrium concentration of the absorption experiment the t kelvin and ce mg l subscripts following q e s defined the constant conditions of the temperature and the equilibrium concentration of the solute under this condition at a given solute concentration hi 0 implied that adsorption and desorption isotherms were completely overlapped and no desorption hysteresis occurred while a higher hi value indicated that more obvious desorption hysteresis occurred the normality and homogeneity of the data sets were tested using the shapiro wilk and levene tests the one way anova and tukey s post hoc tests were used to evaluate the differences in the adsorption and desorption parameters among the different treatments the above statistical analyses were conducted using the pasw statistics 18 software ibm spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 characterization of mps the specific surface area and total pore volume vtotal values of the mps varied from 1 95 0 29 to 9 51 0 51 m2 g and 0 025 0 004 to 0 09 0 004 cm3 g respectively table 1 the mesopore volume 2 50 nm occupied the largest portion of the pore volume with values ranging from 86 83 to 90 01 table 1 the sem results revealed that the typical surfaces of most of the mps were rough fig 1 however the pet showed a relatively smooth morphology with a few wrinkles and pits being found fig 1 the eds analysis implied that cd can be found on the surfaces of all the experimental mps both before and after sorption fig 2 the presence of sharp diffraction peaks on the xrd patterns indicated a high degree of crystallinity sharp diffraction peaks were found in the xrd patterns of the pa and abs fig 3 with crystallinity values of 33 35 3 43 and 27 15 3 39 respectively table 1 the crystallinity values of the mps followed the order of pa abs pvc ps pet table 1 and no conspicuous changes were detected after the adsorption of cd ii fig 3 the surface functional groups of the mps before adsorption and after adsorption desorption were characterized by ftir fig 4 ch stretching commonly existed in all the types of mps involved in the experiments meanwhile each polymer has its own functional groups for instance nh and cnh functional groups in pa the ccl functional group in pvc c n functional groups in abs and terephthalate and polar ester groups in pet additionally the spectra shapes of each polymer were similar before adsorption and after adsorption desorption and the main sorption peaks occurred at approximately the same position and changes in the peak areas were seldom observed fig 4 the xps was applied to further examine the surface functional group compositions of the mps fig 5 the peaks of c 1s and o 1s except on ps were detected in the xps spectra of all the mps both before and after adsorption of cd ii and the peaks of cd 3d were detected in pa pvc and ps after adsorption fig s1 the c 1s deconvolution of the mps implied the existence of cc cc co co and oco functional groups and the relative atomic percentages and corresponding binding energy are given in fig 5 and table 1 respectively the contents of c o increased on all the mps except pvc after adsorption however the change trends of cc cc co and oco before and after the sorption of cd ii depended on the type of mps 3 2 adsorption kinetics and isotherms of cd ii onto mps the sorption kinetics of cd ii onto mps and sediments are given in fig 6 and the parameters of the kinetics from the pseudo second order and elovich models are listed in table s2 the experimental data were better fitted by the pseudo second order model than by the elovich model the sorption isotherms of cd ii onto the mps and sediments are presented in fig 7 and the parameters of the isotherm models are given in table s3 as suggested by the r2 values the adsorption isotherms could be better fitted by the freundlich model than by the langmuir and henry models table s3 the maximum adsorption capacities qm the partition coefficient kd and the kf values of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet table s3 the pa isotherm showed a larger deviation from langmuir model compared with those of the other four types of mps in addition the higher kf value 0 0135 0 0002 l g for pa indicated its higher adsorption ability the n values for pa pvc ps abs and pet were 0 885 0 013 0 821 0 011 0 768 0 02 0 701 0 015 and 0 588 0 021 respectively implying that the surface heterogeneity of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet the deviation kf and kd of the mps were much smaller than those of the sediment table s3 additionally the feasibility values of the sorption processes rl were in the range of 0 1 indicating that the adsorption process was energetically favorable 3 3 effects of the solution ph pb ii humic acid and phenanthrene on the sorption of cd ii onto mps the capability of cd ii to adsorb onto the mps was influenced by the solution ph fig 8 a the sorption capability first largely increased then decreased in the ph range of 6 0 9 0 the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps was not suppressed by pb ii at concentrations between 1 and 15 mg l fig 8b by contrast the adsorption capability was evidently decreased with increasing pb ii concentrations 20 80 mg l and was suppressed by approximately 29 48 2 51 5 53 1 and 54 5 for pa pvc ps abs and pet respectively the presence of humic acid ha 1 50 mg l largely decreased the cd ii adsorption by pa abs and pet which decreased by approximately 22 43 2 and 44 9 respectively fig 8c however the cd ii content adsorbed by pvc and ps first decreased and then increased the low concentration of phenanthrene 0 1 2 mg l had no apparent effect on the absorption of cd ii by the mps fig 8d 3 4 desorption of cd ii from mps in the synthetic earthworm gut and sediment environments upon increasing the cd ii concentration from 10 to 100 mg l the desorption hysteresis of cd ii from the mps in the synthetic earthworm gut environment was obviously decreased table s4 at a given cd ii concentration the hi in the second desorption process hi2 was higher than the hi in the first desorption process hi1 the hi1 and hi2 values of the different mps groups were in the order of cd cd phe cd pd cd ha at both the 10 and 100 mg l cd ii concentrations table s4 notably significant desorption hysteresis p 0 01 in the first desorption process was only detected for the cd ha treatment at both the 10 and 100 mg l cd ii concentrations similarly a desorption hysteresis phenomenon was also observed in the sediment systems and the hi1 and hi2 values of each treatment showed the same trend in comparison to the simulated gut environment table s5 it should be noted that the hi1 values in the sediment system were significantly higher than those in the simulated gut environment p 0 01 table s6 higher desorption was detected in the simulated gut environment 36 9 49 2 and 46 5 59 9 at 10 and 100 mg l of cd respectively fig 9 when the initial cd concentrations were 10 and 100 mg l the desorption rates of cd ii in the simulated gut environment were 33 6 49 2 and 43 55 4 higher than those in the sediment respectively in contrast lower desorption rates were observed in the sediment system 6 9 15 8 and 9 9 18 7 at 10 and 100 mg l of cd respectively fig 9 the desorption capability of the mps followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet at the 10 mg l concentration of cd ii the presence of pb ii ha and phe had negligible impacts on the desorption of cd ii from the mps however at the 100 mg l concentration of cd ii ha suppressed the desorption of cd ii from certain types of mps both in the simulated gut environment and the sediment system fig 9 at a given cd ii concentration the desorption rates of cd ii in the gut environment were statistically larger than those in the sediment system p 0 01 table s7 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between the surface characteristics and sorption properties of cd ii onto mps generally the surface structure specific surface area crystallinity and surface functional groups of mps are considered to be closely related to their adsorption properties li et al 2018b thus the sorption mechanisms need to be evaluated when relating the surface characteristics to the sorption properties of mps in this study the sem results revealed that there were numerous cracks wrinkles and pits on the surfaces of the mps fig 1 which could promote the adsorption of pollutants bakir et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 the sa 1 95 9 51 m2 g and vtotal 0 025 0 09 cm3 g of the mps of this work followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet p 0 01 table 1 and coincided with the magnitudes of the maximum adsorption capacities qm of the mps table s3 and fig s2 the eds patterns fig 2 suggest that the metal contaminants on the mps can originate not only from plastic additives harikrishnan et al 2017 godoy et al 2019 but can also be adsorbed from the surroundings zhang et al 2019 the previous studies implied that the crystallinity of mps might be an important impact factor for the adsorption behavior of mps rochman et al 2013 liu et al 2019e liu et al 2019b and guo et al 2012 found that a high crystallinity could lead to a low adsorption capacity but liu et al 2019e reported a positive correlation between the crystallinity and adsorption capacity our study showed that pa had the highest crystallinity 33 35 3 43 and the largest qm 1 695 0 039 mg g however abs had a relatively low cd ii adsorption capacity 0 652 0 018 mg g although its crystallinity was higher than that of the pvc ps and pet table 1 to ascertain the role of crystallinity the partition coefficient kd was normalized with the crystallinity kd crystallinity in comparison to the kd values the differences in the kd crystallinity values among the different types of mps were not reduced after normalization table 2 the findings of zhang et al 2019 and our study implied that no formation of new crystalline phases appeared after the adsorption of cd ii these results indicate that the crystallinity of mps may not be the main influencing factor of metal adsorption theoretically the adsorption of metal ions onto mps surface is determined by the intermolecular interactions between the adsorbates and polymers e g electrostatic interaction van der waals and hydrogen bonding interactions cao et al 2017 in general the adsorption capacity of mps largely relies on the chemical structure of the polymer and the potential interactions godoy et al 2019 the specific functional groups of the mps are highly likely to take more important roles in the metal adsorption process compared with those of the ch group bakir et al 2012 li et al 2018a for instance the co and nh functional groups were thought to interact preferentially with metal adsorbates li et al 2018a the presence of co and nh groups on the surface of pa and its highest adsorption capability compared with the pvc ps abs and pet figs 4a and 6 reaffirmed the previous results in consideration of the possible important role of oxygen containing functional groups and the π π interaction in the process of metals adsorbing onto mps li et al 2018a the c 1s xps spectra of the pa pvc ps abs and pet before and after the sorption of cd ii were investigated to further reveal the cd ii sorption mechanism the increase in the co band proportions on the mps except pvc after cd ii adsorption fig 5 implied that the adsorption of cd ions onto the mps surface might be causing a reaction in the polymer that leads to the formation of more co bonds sar et al 1999 zhang et al 2016 huang et al 2019 the rise in the cc cc band proportions of pa and abs after the sorption of cd ii fig 5 confirmed the important role of π π interactions on certain types of mps during the metal ion adsorption process bakir et al 2012 sun et al 2019 moreover the relative atomic percentage of co was largely increased on the pvc ps and pet when the cc cc band proportions were decreased fig 5 suggesting the significant role of the co functional group in the metal ion adsorption process yue et al 2015 the cooh band proportions did not vary regularly after the cd ii adsorption fig 5 this finding might be attributed to the minor role of cooh in the metal adsorption onto pa pvc ps and abs li et al 2017a the above findings showed that the oxygen functional groups especially the co and co groups played critical roles in the process of cd adsorption onto mps bakir et al 2012 the metal adsorption capability of the mps recorded in this work was in accordance with the previous studies table s8 the results of the kd sa and kd vtotal ratios in table 2 indicated that the mps with larger sa and higher vtotal values had higher adsorption affinities for cd ii wang and chen 2015 sun et al 2019 for instance the sa of pa 9 51 0 51 m2 g was approximately 3 9 times larger than that of the pet 1 95 0 29 m2 g while the qm of cd ii onto pa 1 695 0 039 mg g was approximately 5 8 times greater than that of the pet 0 247 0 008 mg g furthermore in table s3 the rl values 0 rl 1 and the better fit with the freundlich model imply that the process of cd ii adsorbing onto mps was energetically favorable and not a simple monolayer adsorption process liu et al 2019c 4 2 effects of water ph pb ii humic acid and phenanthrene on the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps as the ph may affect the surface charges of the adsorbents and the speciation of the metal ions the water ph is widely recognized as an important factor influencing the adsorption properties of mps in aquatic environments melo et al 2013 in this study the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps first increased and then gradually decreased with the increasing solution ph fig 8a the increase in adsorption was mainly owing to the enhanced anionic surface in this ph range indicating that electrostatic interactions might play important functions in the adsorption of cd ii onto mps wang et al 2020a the largest cd ii adsorption capabilities were recorded at the ph values of 7 6 6 6 and 6 for the pa pvc ps abs and pet respectively fig 8 and their corresponding phpzc values were 5 97 0 16 5 84 0 25 5 42 0 32 5 68 0 41 and 5 49 0 27 respectively table 1 when ph phpzc the net negatively charged mps favored the adsorption of cd ii khan et al 2017 however if the solution ph continues to increase a charge repulsion may be generated and result in the decreasing of the adsorption amount moreover under a high solution ph condition the formed precipitation of cd oh cd oh 2 may compete for the active sites on the mps surface and lead to a decline in cd ii adsorption capability of mps park et al 2017 overall these findings imply that the adsorption of cd ii onto mps may be dominated by electrostatic interactions and ions exchange al ali et al 2017 as reported pb ii can also be adsorbed by mps rochman et al 2013 al ali et al 2017 and the adsorption may occur on the same adsorption sites of mps as cd ii han et al 2017 li et al 2017b the cd ii sorption is suppressed by mps joined with pb ii 20 80 mg l fig 7b implying that competitive adsorption occurred during the process of metal ions adsorbing onto the mps han et al 2017 gao et al 2019 this similar competitive adsorption phenomenon on mps coupled with pb cu and cd was also shown in a recent study by gao et al 2019 additionally as the molar mass of pb 207 2 g mol is far higher than that of cd 112 4 g mol which means that at a given mass volume concentration of cd and pb mg l the molar concentration mmol l of pb is always smaller than that of cd further investigations are needed to elucidate the potential explanations for this suppression phenomenon humic acid ha which is a common type of natural organic matter usually exists with a negative charge carries oxygen functional groups and can form a copolymer with mps chen et al 2018 sun et al 2019 this type of macromolecule performs various roles in the sorption process of mps the negatively charged ha molecules can offer new sorption sites for cd ii directivity leading to competitive adsorption sun et al 2019 therefore the adsorbed cd ii content on the pa abs and pet decreased with an increase in the ha concentration fig 8c a similar adsorption inhibition phenomenon was also found with the adsorption of cd ii and tetracycline onto pa as impacted by ha chen et al 2019 on the other hand ha is indicated to be adsorbed onto some types of mps resulting in increasing zeta potentials and electrostatic interactions between the metal ions and mps chen et al 2018 li et al 2018a consequently the adsorption of cd ii onto pvc and ps increased with an increase in ha fig 8c this finding is consistent with the findings of li et al 2018a who found that the cd ii sorption capability of pvc and ps increased with an increase in ha the existence of a low concentration of phenanthrene 0 1 1 2 mg l caused a negligible impact on the adsorption of cd ii onto mps fig 8d mainly because the adsorption process of cd ii and phenanthrene took place at different adsorption sites of the adsorbents sun et al 2019 as indicated in a previous study wang et al 2020b the adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons e g phenanthrene pyrene and fluoranthene onto mps is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions on the other hand with the presence of cd ii new adsorption sites for phenanthrene can be formed through cation π interactions gao et al 2019 sun et al 2019 which is another possible explanation for the negligible suppression impact of phenanthrene on the metal ion adsorption capability of mps 4 3 desorption behavior of cd ii from mps in the synthetic earthworm gut and sediment systems koelmans et al 2016 implied that the ingestion of mps is unlikely to raise the exposure to and risks of hydrophobic organic chemicals in the marine environment however if given a high abundance of mps particles relative to other media the desorption hysteresis phenomenon from mps probably can impact the mobility and biotoxicity of contaminants in the environment gao et al 2003 the observed desorption hi values were all larger than 0 table s4 suggesting that significant irreversible hysteresis of cd ii occurred during the desorption processes both in the synthetic earthworm gut environment and the sediment system it was reported that metal ions tend to irreversibly adsorb onto high energy adsorption sites under low surface coverage li et al 2014 hence at a given cd ii concentration all the hi2 values were obviously larger than the hi1 values both in the simulated earthworm gut environment and the sediment system table s4 in terms of the hi value with different cd ii surface loadings it was decreased with the increase in cd ii laden on the mps one possible explanation for this result is that the cd adsorption process shifts largely from irreversible to reversible when the absorption of cd ii onto mps increases li et al 2014 the presence of other solutes will increase the complexity of the desorption process of cd ii from the mps liu et al 2019c the steric hindrance derived from the pb ii and phenanthrene molecules is weaker than the ha macromolecules produced chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019c therefore the coexistence of ha resulted in significantly higher hi values which demonstrated that organic macromolecules would complicate the desorption of metal ions from mps the enzyme mixture solution may exhibit totally different chemical properties compared to the cacl2 electrolyte smith et al 2010 hodson et al 2017 as the covalent bonds between cd ii and the adsorbents might be broken by enzymes dong et al 2015 the adsorption of cd ii onto the mps could become more reversible thus lower hi values were measured in the simulated gut environment the toxicity and mobility of the contaminants are closely related to the desorption properties gao et al 2019 sun et al 2019 lower desorption rates were observed in the sediment system fig 9 suggesting that once adsorbed most of the cd ii is likely to be retained on the mps in sediment system in comparison the cd ii desorption capabilities of the mps in the simulated gut environment were approximately 2 5 fold higher than those in the sediment system fig 9 this observation is consistent with the finding of hodson et al 2017 in which they showed that the desorbed zinc content from mps in the simulated gut environment was 4 fold larger than that in the sediment system the high desorption rate in the simulated gut environment indicated that once metal contaminants adsorbed onto the mps and the mps were ingested by sediment faunas the bioavailability and toxicity of the cd would be elevated hodson et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 additionally the desorption capability from high cd ii loading mps was obviously stronger than that from the low ones fig 9 and this was also suggested by the lower hi values in the high cd loading group 100 mg l table s4 and s5 thus it stands to reason that environments seriously contaminated by metal contaminants will load more metal ions onto mps thus leading to a higher metal ion desorption capacity and larger bioavailability and toxicity khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in general the desorption capability of contaminants from mps is determined by the strength of the interfacial binding force between the adsorbed contaminants and the mps zhang et al 2019 different types of mps had unique surface characteristics and diverse functional group compositions bakir et al 2012 as a result the degree of cd ii desorption varied with the type of mps and followed the order of pa pvc ps abs pet fig 9 and was identical to the initial amount of cd ii loading table s1 this finding further confirmed that the desorption capacity of metal ions from mps greatly depends on the adsorption capacity of the mps overall the desorption process of cd ii in the presence of ha was very different which was also suggested by the higher hi values tables s4 and s5 to conclude the steric hindrance originating from ha might block the desorption of metal ions from the mps sun et al 2019 a much higher desorption capability was observed in the simulated gut environment than in the sediments hence we assumed that if exposed to a high concentration of mps 1 to 10 in the sediment enhanced ecological risks would occur after the ingestion of metal ion laden mp faunas koelmans et al 2016 obvious suppression was found regarding the adsorption desorption behavior of cd ii when the solution ph was changed and when pb ii and humic acid coexisted which implied that environmental changes and the coexistence of other molecules would complicate the desorption of metal ions from mps this also suggested that environmental factors should be taken into consideration when assessing the risks associated with mps and metal contaminants 5 conclusions here we demonstrated that pa had the largest adsorption capacity followed by pvc ps abs and pet and that changes in the solution ph coexisting pb ii and humic acid considerably influenced the adsorption of cd ii by mps the electrostatic interaction and π π interaction were the main adsorption mechanisms for cd ii onto mps and oxygen containing functional groups played crucial roles in the cd ii adsorption processes of mps moreover desorption hysteresis phenomena occurred both in the simulated gut environment and the sediment system the desorption degree of cd ii from mps was much higher in the simulated gut environment than in the sediment system these findings implied that under a high plastic particle environment metal pollutant associated ecological risks can be enhanced by the adsorption desorption behavior of mps however regarding a realistic environment more environmentally relevant long term studies are needed to assess the effects of the ingestion of mps on bioaccumulation in summary this work provides a better understanding of the adsorption mechanism of cd ii onto mps and a first systematic view into the desorption hysteresis and desorption capability in different environments declaration of

17723,the edwards aquifer serves as a primary source of drinking water to more than 2 million people in south central texas and as a karst aquifer is vulnerable to human and animal fecal contamination which poses a serious risk to human and environmental health a one year study jan 2018 feb 2019 was conducted to determine the primary sources of fecal pollution along the balcones and leon creek within the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones using general e coli enterococci and universal bacteriodales and host associated human dog cow and chicken duck associated bacteriodales microbial source tracking mst assays additionally sites were classified based on surrounding land use as a potential source predictor and marker levels were correlated with rain events and water quality parameters levels for the three general indicators were highest and exhibited similar trends across the sampling sites suggesting that the sole use of these markers is not sufficient for specific fecal source identification among the host associated markers highest concentrations were observed for the dog marker baccan in the leon creek area and the cow marker baccow in the balcones creek area additionally chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season and the end of fall early winter relatively lower concentrations were observed for the human associated markers hf183 and bachum however levels were higher in the leon creek area and highest following rainfall events additionally relatively higher levels in hf183 and bachum were observed at sites having greater human population and septic tank density and may be attributed to leaks or breaks in these infrastructures this study is the first to examine and compare fecal contamination at rural and urban areas in the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer using a molecular mst approach targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna gene based assays the bacteroidales marker assays when combined with land use and weather information can allow for a better understanding of the sources and fluxes of fecal contamination which can help devise effective mitigation measures to protect water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking water quality qpcr fecal pollution bacteroidales 1 introduction high levels of fecal bacteria are the most commonly reported contaminants affecting the quality of recreational waters and drinking water sources in the united states domingo et al 2007 usepa 2016 pathogenic bacteria of various genera from human and animal fecal waste enter environmental waters via leaking on site septic systems wastewater treatment plant effluents discharge from waste lagoons and pits at livestock facilities from leaching of manure and waste from wildlife and domestic animals dowd et al 2008 heaney et al 2015 cao et al 2013 fecal contamination of water poses a serious risk to human and environmental health via waterborne disease outbreaks deterioration of recreational and drinking water quality and degradation of aquatic ecology domingo et al 2007 in this regard risk management practices in water resources have become critical to the public health community not only due to their importance in preventing human diseases but also due to the economic repercussions associated with treatment and reuse soller et al 2010 poor microbial water quality increases the costs of services derived from water use and reuse hence accurate and reliable fecal source identification is crucial to the implementation of best management practices bmps that can accurately and cost effectively prevent control and remediate fecal pollution events and maintain water quality sewage overflows and stormwater runoff introduce high levels of fecal bacteria into waterways and are considered the primary cause of water quality impairments in urbanized areas while rural sources include livestock manure from barnyards pastures rangelands feedlots unfenced farm animals improper manure or sewage land application poorly maintained manure storage and wildlife reed et al 2011 usepa 2009 in the state of texas approximately 42 of assessed rivers and streams are identified as impaired where the water body does not meet applicable water quality standards or is threatened for one or more designated uses by one or more pollutants tceq 2019 usepa 2014 presently there is an incomplete understanding of the sources of potentially pathogenic fecal contamination found in the water entering the edwards aquifer a source of drinking water to more than 2 million people in south central texas karst aquifers such as the edwards are known to be vulnerable to human and animal waste contamination pronk et al 2007 as disease outbreaks have been traced back to contaminated water originating from these systems o reilly et al 2007 borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 a close link has been reported between impaired water quality and karst topography when evaluating karst water sources in the united states zhang et al 2014 reed et al 2011 rapid movement of water from the land surface to the subsurface through fractures conduits and sinkholes lessens the amount of time available for physical processes and biogeochemical reactions that would otherwise decrease the concentrations of surface derived contaminants in the subsurface furthermore transport of microbial contaminants in karst systems is facilitated by high groundwater flow velocities particularly following heavy rainfalls or other stormwater events kelly et al 2009 the most widely used indicators of fecal contamination include the fecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli a species within the fecal coliform subset and enterococci a subgroup within the fecal streptococcus group however these conventional fibs are unreliable for pollution source tracking applications due to widely varying survival rates in the environment failure to discriminate between human and animal sources and their inability to distinguish between fecal bacteria associated with recent contamination events and those adapted to secondary habitats anderson et al 2005 whitman et al 2003 in a karst region where fecal sources are not easily known or understood microbial source tracking mst techniques can provide an opportunity to analyze water samples in a way that identifies the source human or animal and species cow dog bird etc of fecal bacteria recent advances in molecular biology have led to the development and advancement of molecular methods of mst using 16s rrna bacterial genes to identify pollution sources in many environments sowah et al 2017 brooks et al 2020 marti et al 2013 molina et al 2014 the majority of bacterial cells in feces include fecal anaerobes such as bacteroidales which are present at much higher densities than coliforms and enterococci savage 2001 bacteroidales die quickly in oxygenated surface water and groundwater thus these bacteria do not have the ambiguous survival and sourcing issues that can be present with conventional fib and can be linked with good spatio temporal resolution to a sampling site lu et al 2012 kapoor et al 2013 kapoor et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 therefore quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays targeting the bacteroidales 16s rrna genes have been developed and evaluated in several studies boehm et al 2013 layton et al 2013 bernhard and field 2000 kildare et al 2007 the purpose of this study was to apply mst techniques in conjunction with land use information to evaluate fecal contamination along the balcones and leon creek within the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer in bexar county texas a suite of six qpcr assays targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes and qpcr assays for two conventional fecal indicators were applied to identify and quantify potential sources of fecal contamination and to gain a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns the overall objectives of this study were 1 to identify and quantify the sources of human and animal fecal pollution and perform an analysis of spatial and temporal trends for the 1 year study period 2 investigate correlations among the markers and with water quality parameters and rainfall to understand the impact of environmental variables and 3 determine differences in fecal pollution sources and levels based on proximal land use features of study sites along the two creeks understanding contamination sources and origins will help city managers target outreach efforts within the edwards aquifer as well as to further discussions with local communities from which runoff originates that can impact waterways located within recharge and contributing zones of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the present study was conducted along the reaches of balcones creek and leon creek located within the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones in bexar county texas usa fig 1 balcones and leon creeks are located within the cibolo and leon watersheds respectively and flows across limestone bedrock the entire length of the balcones creek is in the edwards aquifer contributing zone while approximately one third of the leon creek is in the contributing zone the source of balcones creek is located in bandera county approximately one mile southwest of the bexar kendall and bandera county line junction the creek transects a rural area flowing east for approximately 15 km and forming the boundary for bexar and kendall counties until convergence with the upper cibolo creek at the junction of bexar kendall and comal counties according to the 2014 texas water quality assessment report the cibolo creek has been identified as impaired both upstream and downstream of convergence with balcones usepa 2014 tanvir pasha et al 2020 the leon creek

medina river south of san antonio approximately 42 km 65 of the leon creek have been identified as impaired usepa 2014 sanitary sewer overflows ssos on site sewage treatment facilities septic tanks and livestock animals are assumed to be the primary sources of fecal pollution and eight sampling sites were chosen based on the presence and proximity to pollution sources within the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer within bexar county sites b 1 through b 4 are located along balcones creek fig 1 sites b 1 and b 2 are located furthest upstream in the edwards aquifer contributing zone sites b 3 and b 4 are located near the city of fair oaks ranch in the edwards aquifer recharge zone with site b 4 as the most downstream site approximately 45 of the residential

collection and dna extraction water samples were collected by grab sampling in sterile 1 liter nalgene rochester ny bottles from each site bi monthly over a one year period from january 2018 to february 2019 for a total of 26 sample collection events all water samples were transported on ice to the laboratory at utsa san antonio texas where the samples were filtered within 6 h of collection water samples 300ml were filtered in duplicate on a vacuum manifold through 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter polycarbonate membranes pall corporation ann arbor michigan and immediately stored at 80 c until dna extraction sterile de ionized water controls were filtered with each sample event to check for cross contamination during sample processing after filter membranes were allowed to thaw to room temperature dna was extracted using the dneasy powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacture s protocol extraction blanks were processed with all batches of dna extractions to test for contamination during the dna extraction process a nanodrop onec spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de was used to determine dna purity and concentration ng µl and dna extracts were stored at 20 c until used in qpcr assays 2 3 qpcr analyses the occurrence and relative abundance of eight different mst markers in surface water samples was measured using taqman qpcr assays with dna extracts as the templates table 1 the fecal bacterial markers included six primer sets targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes universal bacteriodales bacuni assay human associated bacteroidales hf183 and bachum assays chicken duck bacteriodales chicken duck bac assay dog bacteriodales baccan assay and cow bacteriodales baccow assay kildare et al 2007 haugland et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2013 in addition two conventional fecal bacterial groups were also tested using qpcr based assays e coli ec23s857 assay chern et al 2011 and enterococcus spp entero1 assay ludwig and schleifer 2000 for the purposes of this study the qpcr targets are grouped into two classifications general indicators which include the bacuni ec23s857 and entero1 assays and host associated markers including the hf183 bachum chicken duck bac baccan and baccow assays all qpcr assays were performed on the cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad hercules ca using itaq universal probes supermix bio rad the reaction mixtures 25 μl contained 12 5µl of supermix 300 nm of each primer forward and reverse 100 nm of probe and 2 μl of dna template the thermal cycling profile for all assays was 2 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 60 c except entero1 54 c the qpcr data were analyzed using bio rad s cfx manager software version 3 1 standard curves were run in duplicate for each qpcr plate by using serially diluted plasmid standards purchased from integrated dna technologies idt skokie il containing the sequences for each of the targeted genes each standard curve was generated from at least six 10 fold plasmid dilutions in duplicate the percent amplification efficiencies were calculated by the instrument manufacturer s instructions bio rad extraction controls and no template controls three per plate were used to check for cross contamination and 10 fold dilutions of selected dna extracts were used to test for pcr inhibition as described in previous study pitkänen et al 2013 2 4 water quality parameters and rainfall data water quality parameters were measured for all sites and sample collection events throughout the course of the study to monitor water quality and examine spatial temporal variability measured water quality parameters included surface water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and dissolved nitrogen species nitrate nitrite ammonia do and temperature were measured on site using an intellical ldo101 field luminescent optical probe and hq40d portable multi meter hach loveland co ph was measured on site using an intellical phc101 probe and hq40d portable multi meter hach loveland co ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n concentrations were measured in the utsa laboratory using salicylate method 10205 hach tntplus 830 ultra low range kit usepa diazotization method 10207 hach tntplus 839 low range kit and dimethylphenol method 10206 hach tntplus 835 low range kit respectively and a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer values were reported as below detection limit bdl if measured below the tntplus kit limit of detection for statistical analysis bdl and non detect nd data points were given a value of zero rainfall data within 1 and 7 days prior to sample collection was obtained from the usgs national water information system usgs stations 08183900 and 08178585 were chosen based on their close proximity to balcones creek sites and leon creek sites respectively 2 5 land use characterization an a priori assessment of study sites was conducted based on proximal land use information obtained from bexar county fig s1 and a detailed analysis for each creek was performed as factors influencing fecal contamination sources and levels differ between urban and rural areas ridley et al 2014 land use for each creek was characterized based on four features of interest on site sewage facilities ossfs wastewater collection infrastructure average human population and percentage of developed vs undeveloped land land use features of interest were investigated at a 1 km spatial scale to support detection of recent contamination from nearby inputs arcmap 10 5 1 environmental systems research institute redlands ca was used to create 1 km buffer zones encompassing sampling sites along the length of leon and balcones creek and used to perform all calculations for features of interest the total area analyzed for leon and balcones creek buffer zones was approximately 30 1 and 15 5 km2 respectively the average human population for each zone was calculated based on census tract data obtained from bexar county and the texas demographic center the average number of septic systems per person and wastewater collection infrastructure density were calculated for each zone using ossf data obtained from bexar county public works residential address data from kendall county and the city of fair oaks ranch and underground wastewater collection infrastructure data from san antonio water systems saws the percentage of developed vs undeveloped land for leon creek was obtained from the city of san antonio and approximated based visualizations of impervious cover within the balcones creek buffer zone from the world imagery basemap in arcmap additionally land use parameters were also estimated for each individual site using the above approach and correlation coefficients were calculated between the marker occurrence and land use variables 2 6 statistical analyses based on standard curves the targeted marker copy number per 100 ml of water was calculated for all samples with values above the limit of quantification for each assay and all raw data were log10 transformed before statistical analysis results below detection limit were assigned a value of one before log transformation statistical tests showed that microbiological and environmental data were not distributed normally nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if differences between marker concentrations among sampling sites were statistically significant the correlation between the previous 1 day and 7 days rainfall and general and host associated marker concentrations at all sites was analyzed using the spearman s rank correlation analysis in microsoft excel correlation strength was interpreted according to an accepted scale for biological statistics mcdonald 2009 spearman s rank correlation coefficients r between marker concentrations and water quality parameters were also calculated for comparison purposes coefficients are characterized by a previously published scale stachler et al 2018 0 2 0 39 weak correlation 0 4 0 59 moderate correlation 0 6 0 79 strong correlation and 0 8 1 very strong correlation differences and correlations were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of qpcr assays the linear range of quantification for all qpcr assays was between 101 and 106 copies per reaction the qpcr amplification efficiencies for all the assays ranged from 95 to 120 and r2 values were all greater than 0 948 table s1 pcr inhibition tests were done on the first three set of samples for each site 12 of total samples pcr inhibition tests resulted in a ct value proportional to a 10 fold dilution relative to the undiluted dna templates suggesting that pcr inhibition did not interfere with the amplification efficiency dna extraction controls and no template controls three per qpcr plate were run to check cross contamination and the absence of contamination in the qpcr experiments was confirmed 3 2 detection of general and host associated markers in water samples the targeted fecal bacterial groups were frequently detected in surface water samples table 2 the three general indicators e coli ec23s857 enterococci entero1 and universal bacteroidales bacuni showed the highest levels of detections among the qpcr markers with detection frequency 90 for most of the samples and exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern across the sampling sites at both creeks fig s2 higher detection of entero1 and ec23s857 are expected as these markers include all enterococcus and e coli bacteria found in the gut communities of mammals and birds and are not associated with a specific host field and samadpour 2007 kapoor et al 2018 additionally both bacteria may survive and grow in a wide variety of environmental habitats such as soil and aquatic environments with little or no input from human or animal fecal sources provided resource availability and key abiotic conditions are propitious anderson et al 2005 whitman et al 2003 byappanahalli et al 2012 van elsas et al 2011 bacuni has been developed and identified as a universal marker sequence for the quantitative detection of all fecal bacteroidales and as such higher levels of this marker are also expected kildare et al 2007 therefore the sole use of these general markers for fecal source tracking in the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones is not sufficient for specific fecal source identification the water samples yielded significantly different amplification results across study sites with the host associated qpcr assays nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 the two human associated markers displayed similar levels but were slightly higher for the bachum marker at all sites for example detection across study sites ranged from 4 to 27 for the hf183 assay site b 1 exhibited the lowest frequency of amplification 4 while sites b 3 and l 4 exhibited the highest detection frequencies 27 and 23 respectively for the hf183 assay sites b 3 and l 4 also exhibited the highest detection frequencies for the bachum assay 31 and 27 respectively results from this study were consistent with previous studies which showed higher marker levels for bachum in relation to hf183 tanvir pasha et al 2020 kapoor et al 2018 the recent public release of usepa draft method for hf183 assay usepa 2019 has led to an increased interest in the use of these qpcr based markers to characterize fecal pollution in environmental waters polluted by sewage studies comparing host specificities among different fecal sources for the hf183 and bachum markers have shown that both assays were equally sensitive to sewage shanks et al 2010 but bachum showed substantially more false positive results for non human fecal sources such as cat dog gull and raccoon feces jenkins et al 2009 van de werfhorst et al 2011 boehm et al 2013 among the host associated markers study sites showed the highest detections for baccan and baccow suggesting a larger percentage of fecal pollution to be coming from canine and cow sources in the study area site b 3 had the highest occurrence of baccow 77 while site l 2 had the highest detection for baccan 58 among all the study sites chicken duck bac detection in water samples also varied significantly across study sites but overall it was detected with much less frequency than the baccan or baccow marker detection for chicken duck bac marker ranged from 16 to 50 with highest occurrence for sites b 4 and l 2 3 3 correlation of markers and water quality parameters spearman s rank correlation analysis showed an overall strong correlation between the three general markers bacuni e coli and entero1 with the strongest correlations between entero1 and bacuni 0 69 and entero1 and e coli 0 68 fig 2 table s2 for the host associated markers hf183 and bachum showed a strong correlation 0 63 as both markers have been developed for specificity to human fecal waste haughland et al 2010 kildare et al 2007 results from this study are consistent with multiple previous studies that have shown the hf183 and bachum markers to have similar sensitivity jenkins et al 2009 odagiri et al 2015 kapoor et al 2018 correlations among the other host associated markers varied from weak to moderate the host associated indicators hf183 bachum and baccan also had stronger correlations with nitrate 0 27 0 33 0 36 respectively and nitrite 0 30 0 23 0 15 respectively nitrogen concentration than exhibited by the general indicators these findings suggest that bacteroidales markers are better indicators of fecal pollution compared to the conventional indicators nitrate has been reported as a strong predictor for the presence of human associated markers and consistent with our study the major source of nitrate can be attributed to human fecal pollution badgley et al 2019 additionally given that the study area do not contain wastewater treatment plant outfalls this result raises the concern about leaking subsurface wastewater infrastructure and or septic tanks furthermore dog fecal contamination may also be attributed as a major source of nitrogen pollution in creeks as demonstrated by positive correlation between baccan marker levels and nitrate nitrite concentrations for the water quality parameters temperature and do 0 44 and nitrite and nitrate 0 46 showed moderate correlations respectively the negative correlation between temperature and do concentration demonstrates their interdependence while the positive relationships observed between levels of nitrite and nitrate suggest a common source that may be sewage pollution notably ph and ammonia did not correlate with any of the qpcr markers or other water quality parameters one possible reason for the lack of associations could be the considerably less variation of water ph throughout the study period average ph 7 6 0 5 and high number of samples with no ammonia detected it is important to note that different water quality parameters e g temperature nitrate do and ph are expected to vary widely with regard to runoff from surrounding land use which may also be related to varying pollution sources for various indicator types 3 4 proximal land use characterization analysis and spatial variation between leon creek and balcones creek marker concentrations factors influencing fecal contamination sources and levels differ between urban and rural areas ridley et al 2014 for this study an analysis of proximal land use using 1 km buffer zones surrounding balcones and leon creeks was performed in order to characterize the study sites based on septic tanks wastewater collection infrastructure human population and developed vs undeveloped land fig s3 in addition land use parameters were also estimated for each site individually table s3 and correlated with marker occurrence at each site table s4 saws and the city of fair oaks ranch underground wastewater collection infrastructure data was analyzed and estimated to underlie approximately 22 of the surface area of the balcones creek buffer zone and 75 of the leon creek buffer zone additionally the leon creek buffer zone contained a higher amount of impervious cover 50 relative to the buffer zone surrounding balcones creek 10 human population for the balcones creek buffer zone was estimated at 202 people km2 while the leon creek buffer zone population was estimated to be more than 6 5 times greater at 1355 people km2 the number of active septic tanks for balcones and leon buffers totaled 421 and 304 tanks respectively the septic tank density for the balcones creek buffer zone is 27 tanks km2 and 10 tanks km2 for the leon creek buffer zone indicating that tanks cover an approximate area 2 7 times greater for the balcones buffer a comparison of the average general and host associated marker concentrations log10 copies 100 ml between leon and balcones creeks is represented in fig 3 general marker levels were similar across both creeks and showed the highest concentrations among the qpcr markers with concentrations for both entero1 and bacuni above 4 log10 copies 100 ml all host associated marker levels were detected at lower concentrations below 3 log10 copies 100 ml with the lowest levels detected for the two human associated markers differences in marker levels between the leon area and balcones areas were evident for each host associated marker leon creek displayed higher levels for all markers except baccow higher concentrations in leon creek for the two human associated markers could be attributed to the larger human population served by septic tanks or sewer infrastructure estimated for the leon creek buffer zone table s3 both markers were positively correlated to the septic tank density human population and the percent of impervious surface table s4 studies have shown a close relationship between ossfs and human fecal pollution as these systems have been identified as significant sources for emerging contaminants in groundwater and surface water gao et al 2019 hinkle et al 2005 schaider et al 2016 phillips et al 2015 bachum and hf183 concentrations were lowest for sites b 1 and l 3 the areas surrounding these two sites are occupied by the fewest number of septic tanks fig s3 furthermore these sites are located furthest from underground wastewater collection mains table s3 which could also explain the relatively low levels of detection for human fecal waste an increase in septic tank density is observed surrounding sites b 3 l 1 and l 4 which showed the highest levels of both human associated markers therefore relatively higher levels at these three sites could be attributed to leaking septic tanks or breaks in underground sewer infrastructure concentrations for baccan were higher for leon creek sites while the balcones creek showed higher concentrations for the baccow marker higher levels of baccan within the leon creek area could be attributed to the large number of dogs associated with pet owning households as well as the unrestrained dog population in the city avma 2019 city of san antonio 2019 higher levels of baccow marker within the undeveloped balcones sites corresponds well with the higher number of farms and ranches devoted to pasture in that area tda 2019 usda 2012 the typical ranch in bexar county is engaged in cow calf operation however other types of livestock operations found in the county include horses sheep goats dairy cows and stocker calves bexar cad 2019 additionally high baccow marker levels could have also resulted from a lack of host specificity a study evaluating the performance of the baccow marker showed there is an 84 probability that a detection of the marker in a water sample is due to actual contamination from the respective host and 38 of horse fecal extracts tested positive for the baccow marker somnark et al 2018 kildare et al 2007 therefore high detections for baccow observed in the study area could be attributed to the large number of animal ranchlands surrounding the balcones creek sites and detections for baccow observed at the leon creek sites could be attributed to false positive results from non cow fecal sources due to a lack of host specificity among the balcones creek sites site b 3 showed the highest concentrations for baccan baccow and the two human associated markers hf183 and bachum fig s1 the cibolo creek which flows south through kendall county converges with balcones creek approximately 1 mile upstream of site b 3 and has a history of significant fecal contamination often exceeding the state s water quality standards for safe contact recreation a previous study suggested that human fecal contamination may likely occur as a result of treated effluent discharged into cibolo creek from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in boerne texas tanvir pasha et al 2020 thus relatively high concentrations for the host associated markers at site b 3 may be attributed to the contribution of fecal pollution from cibolo creek 3 5 temporal variation in marker concentrations temporal variation of the average levels of general indicators human associated markers and other host associated marker concentrations over the course of the study for leon and balcones creeks was also determined figs 4 s4 s5 chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season march may 2018 and the end of fall early winter nov jan 2018 concentrations for these animal associated markers were all lowest during the summer months previous studies have investigated the effect of water temperature on the persistence of feces derived bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers and have shown that decay rates for genetic markers were greater at higher temperatures okabe and shimazu 2007 kobayashi et al 2013 bell et al 2009 okabe and shimazu 2007 observed a decrease in copy numbers of approximately 1 3 logs within the first two days at 30 c and bae and wuertz 2015 reported decay rates at 22 c that were three to six times higher than those at 14 c implying that host associated bacteroidales cells and their dna are more persistent at lower temperatures surface water temperature was measured for every sample collection event throughout the course of the study and averaged 15 c during the winter and 21 c during the spring and fall months during the summer months water temperatures averaged 28 c and exceeded 30 c during june july and august with a maximum water temperature around 32 c in june 2018 as such seasonal variability and the effects of water temperatures may result in rapid decay of bacteroidales during the summer months thus resulting in low marker concentrations temporal changes in baccan and baccow marker levels can be attributed to pet ownership and livestock breeding and calving practices in the bexar county study region in this area it is more common for pet owners to keep their pets indoors during the winter and summer and spend more recreational time with pets outdoors during the fall and spring seasons studies focusing on texas show that the highest physical activity occurs during the spring while declines in physical activity can be attributed to the shorter days and adverse weather conditions associated with winter and hot and humid conditions during the summer months tucker and gilliland 2007 additionally leon creek is adjacent to the leon creek greenway 20 miles of paved multi use hike and bike trails following the leon creek in north and central san antonio this creek side trail allows access to dogs on a leash and offers a variety of activities including dog walking high levels of dog fecal waste could be associated with the large number of pets and unrestrained dog population in the study area as well as an increase in seasonal outdoor recreational activities specifically along the leon creek figure s5 furthermore there is an increase in farming activities during the spring or fall thus resulting in an increase in fecal waste from cattle sources sprott 2001 higher levels of the chicken duck bac marker during the spring and fall seasons can be attributed to bird migration patterns texas is located directly in the center of the central flyway a well defined route for migratory birds according to a publication by the texas parks and wildlife texas has recorded more species of birds than any other state over 615 species most of which are migrant shackelford et al 2005 increases in migrant birds are observed during the spring season on their transit northward and fall season during their southward passage through bexar county texas 3 6 correlation of markers with rainfall rainfall data was collected from two usgs stations and correlated with all qpcr markers used in this study for all sites table 3 for balcones creek sites significant correlations were observed for sites b 2 and b 3 but not for b 1 and b 4 at site b 2 a positive correlation was noted with baccow and rainfall reported for 1 day but not for 1 week before sample collection most leon creek sites exhibited significant correlations with host associated marker concentrations except for site l 1 at site l 2 positive correlations were noted with all markers and rainfall with statistically significant p 0 05 correlations observed for the hf183 baccow and baccan markers for 1 day rainfall 0 53 0 42 and 0 48 respectively and hf183 bachum and baccan markers for 7 days rainfall before sample collection 0 54 0 53 and 0 39 respectively the concentration of baccan marker showed a significant correlation with rainfall at site l 4 for both 1 day 0 49 and 7 days rainfall 0 47 the general indicators did not exhibit a significant correlation between the marker concentration and rainfall for any site except for site l 3 and bacuni 0 41 balcones creek sites are located in a less developed area along the bexar and kendall county border while the leon creek sites located within the city of san antonio is predominantly urbanized the poor correlations between markers at balcones creek sites and rainfall could be attributed to high surface permeability as a low percentage of impermeable surface 10 was determined for the area surrounding the balcones creek sites chen and chang 2014 buckerfield et al 2019 on average markers exhibited stronger correlations with rainfall at leon creek sites which could be due to a high percentage of impermeable surface 50 surrounding the leon creek sites resulting in more surface runoff entering the creek during rainfall events additionally the occurrence of human associated markers were positively correlated to the percent of impervious surface whereas baccow and chicken duck bac markers were negatively correlated to the percent of impervious surface table s4 the higher abundance of human fecal markers in more urbanized areas suggest that land use changes associated with development as well as increases in watershed impervious cover affect water quality human associated marker levels exhibited similar temporal trends at both creek sites and were highest from march to may 2018 peaking in march 2018 which received an average of 77 2 mm of rainfall for the study area over the seven days prior to sample collection fig 4 a second spike in human associated marker concentrations occurred during the months of september and october 2018 which received averages of 52 4 and 59 9 mm of rainfall for the leon and balcones creek areas respectively an unusual peak in host associated markers is apparent for balcones creek sites the first week of january 2019 during which time the study area received an average of 24 4 mm of rainfall after very little to no rainfall the previous six weeks cumulative total rainfall of 0 76 mm increases in human associated marker detections with rainfall events have previously been observed indicating that rainfall is an important factor in human fecal material loading stachler et al 2018 lee et al 2014 ultimately correlations between host associated marker concentrations are site specific and dependent on surrounding land use and thus may experience varying degrees of increases or decreases in marker levels during rainfall events åström et al 2013 lee et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2012 3 7 implications for the edwards aquifer currently there is an incomplete understanding of the sources of fecal pollution found in the watersheds of the edwards aquifer a primary source of drinking water to the city of san antonio and its surrounding communities segments of both the upper cibolo creek which converges with balcones and leon creek both of which flow through the aquifer recharge and contributing zones have been identified as impaired usepa 2014 bacterial pathogens have been determined to be the number one cause of river and stream impairments in texas tceq 2019 epa 2014 this study is the first to examine and compare fecal contamination at surface water sites in the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer within bexar county using a molecular mst approach targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes for host associated qpcr assays the presence of bacteroidales in most of the water samples suggested that methods targeting this bacterial phylum may be used to track sources of fecal pollution in environmental waters host associated bacteroidales signals were detected at all sites although their relative occurrence varied by site and by month human and animal fecal contaminants are among the major concerns for public health since pathogens could be present the bacteroidales marker assays when combined with land use and weather information can allow for a better understanding of the sources and fluxes of fecal inputs in urban and rural areas which can help us to understand when these fecal sources may impact water quality data collected from the one year study were used to identify and quantify the sources of human and animal fecal pollution and perform an analysis of temporal and seasonal trends it has been determined that the major fecal contributing sources differ between urban and rural areas in our study area major urban sources include sewage overflows and dog waste while rural sources include waste from livestock facilities and farms and leaking septic tanks effective mitigation measures should be directed towards public outreach efforts to educate pet owners on the negative effects of pet waste on water quality and the importance of proper pet waste disposal as well as efforts to control and reduce the large unrestrained dog population in the city efforts to mitigate fecal pollution outside of the city should focus on the implementation of bmps aimed at controlling and mitigating waste associated with animal ranches agricultural practices and wildlife future studies focusing on a more detailed assessment of rural and urban areas associated with clusters of ossfs and underground sewer infrastructure are recommended to determine appropriate measures for mitigating human fecal pollution from these sources 4 conclusions the three general markers e coli enterococci and bacuni exhibited highest levels and a similar spatial distribution pattern across the sampling sites among the host associated markers low levels were observed for the human associated markers and the highest levels for baccan and baccow suggesting a higher percentage of fecal pollution to be coming from the large canine and bovine populations in the study area human associated bacteroidales markers were detected mostly at leon creek sites suggesting that their presence is the result of larger human population served by septic tanks or sewer infrastructure the cow marker concentrations were higher for balcones creek sites due to farms and ranches in the area there were strong correlations between the general indicators and between the human associated markers temperature and dissolved oxygen and nitrite and nitrate showed moderate correlations ph and ammonia did not correlate with any of the qpcr targets or other water quality parameters most marker levels were associated with rainfall at the leon creek sites due to higher impervious cover chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season and the end of fall early winter and were all lowest during the summer months data from this study have established a baseline for fecal pollution sources in the edward aquifer recharge and contributing zones and can be used for the recommendation and implementation of best management practices that can accurately and cost effectively prevent control and remediate fecal

17723,the edwards aquifer serves as a primary source of drinking water to more than 2 million people in south central texas and as a karst aquifer is vulnerable to human and animal fecal contamination which poses a serious risk to human and environmental health a one year study jan 2018 feb 2019 was conducted to determine the primary sources of fecal pollution along the balcones and leon creek within the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones using general e coli enterococci and universal bacteriodales and host associated human dog cow and chicken duck associated bacteriodales microbial source tracking mst assays additionally sites were classified based on surrounding land use as a potential source predictor and marker levels were correlated with rain events and water quality parameters levels for the three general indicators were highest and exhibited similar trends across the sampling sites suggesting that the sole use of these markers is not sufficient for specific fecal source identification among the host associated markers highest concentrations were observed for the dog marker baccan in the leon creek area and the cow marker baccow in the balcones creek area additionally chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season and the end of fall early winter relatively lower concentrations were observed for the human associated markers hf183 and bachum however levels were higher in the leon creek area and highest following rainfall events additionally relatively higher levels in hf183 and bachum were observed at sites having greater human population and septic tank density and may be attributed to leaks or breaks in these infrastructures this study is the first to examine and compare fecal contamination at rural and urban areas in the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer using a molecular mst approach targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna gene based assays the bacteroidales marker assays when combined with land use and weather information can allow for a better understanding of the sources and fluxes of fecal contamination which can help devise effective mitigation measures to protect water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial source tracking water quality qpcr fecal pollution bacteroidales 1 introduction high levels of fecal

various genera from human and animal fecal waste enter environmental waters via leaking on site septic systems wastewater treatment plant effluents discharge from waste lagoons and pits at livestock

environmental health via waterborne disease outbreaks deterioration of recreational and drinking water quality and degradation of aquatic ecology domingo et al 2007 in this regard risk management practices in water resources have become critical to the public health community not only due to their importance in preventing human diseases but also due to the economic repercussions associated with treatment and reuse soller et al 2010 poor microbial water quality increases the costs of services derived from water use and reuse hence accurate and reliable fecal source identification is crucial to the implementation of best management practices bmps that can accurately and cost effectively prevent control and remediate fecal pollution events and maintain water quality sewage overflows and stormwater runoff introduce high levels of fecal bacteria into waterways and are considered the primary cause of water quality impairments in urbanized areas while rural sources include livestock manure from barnyards pastures rangelands feedlots unfenced farm animals improper manure or sewage land application poorly maintained manure storage and wildlife reed et al 2011 usepa 2009 in the state of texas approximately 42 of assessed rivers and streams are identified as impaired where the water body does not meet applicable water quality standards or is threatened for one or more designated uses by one or more pollutants tceq 2019 usepa 2014 presently there is an incomplete understanding of the sources of potentially pathogenic fecal contamination found in the water entering the edwards aquifer a source of drinking water to more than 2 million people in south central texas karst aquifers such as the edwards are known to be vulnerable to human and animal waste contamination pronk et al 2007 as disease outbreaks have been traced back to contaminated water originating from these systems o reilly et al 2007 borchardt et al 2011 wallender et al 2014 a close link has been reported between impaired water quality and karst topography when evaluating karst water sources in the united states zhang et al 2014 reed et al 2011 rapid movement of water from the land surface to the subsurface through fractures conduits and sinkholes lessens the amount of time available for physical processes and biogeochemical reactions that would otherwise decrease the concentrations of surface derived contaminants in the subsurface furthermore transport of microbial contaminants in karst systems is facilitated by high groundwater flow velocities particularly following heavy rainfalls or other stormwater events kelly et al 2009 the most widely used indicators of fecal contamination include the fecal indicator bacteria fib escherichia coli e coli a species within the fecal coliform subset and enterococci a subgroup within the fecal streptococcus group however these conventional fibs are unreliable for pollution source tracking applications due to widely varying survival rates in the environment failure to discriminate between human and animal sources and their inability to distinguish between fecal bacteria associated with recent contamination events and those adapted to secondary habitats anderson et al 2005 whitman et al 2003 in a karst region where fecal sources are not easily known or understood microbial source tracking mst techniques can provide an opportunity to analyze water samples in a way that identifies the source human or animal and species cow dog bird etc of fecal bacteria recent advances in molecular biology have led to the development and advancement of molecular methods of mst using 16s rrna bacterial genes to identify pollution sources in many environments sowah et al 2017 brooks et al 2020 marti et al 2013 molina et al 2014 the majority of bacterial cells in feces include fecal anaerobes such as bacteroidales which are present at much higher densities than coliforms and enterococci savage 2001 bacteroidales die quickly in oxygenated surface water and groundwater thus these bacteria do not have the ambiguous survival and sourcing issues that can be present with conventional fib and can be linked with good spatio temporal resolution to a sampling site lu et al 2012 kapoor et al 2013 kapoor et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 therefore quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays targeting the bacteroidales 16s rrna genes have been developed and evaluated in several studies boehm et al 2013 layton et al 2013 bernhard and field 2000 kildare et al 2007 the purpose of this study was to apply mst techniques in conjunction with land use information to evaluate fecal contamination along the balcones and leon creek within the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer in bexar county texas a suite of six qpcr assays targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes and qpcr assays for two conventional fecal indicators were applied to identify and quantify potential sources of fecal contamination and to gain a better understanding of spatial and temporal patterns the overall objectives of this study were 1 to identify and quantify the sources of human and animal fecal pollution and perform an analysis of spatial and temporal trends for the 1 year study period 2 investigate correlations among the markers and with water quality parameters and rainfall to understand the impact of environmental variables and 3 determine differences in fecal pollution sources and levels based on proximal land use features of study sites along the two creeks understanding contamination sources and origins will help city managers target outreach efforts within the edwards aquifer as well as to further discussions with local communities from which runoff originates that can impact waterways located within recharge and contributing zones of the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the present study was conducted along the reaches of balcones creek and leon creek located within the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones in bexar county texas usa fig 1 balcones and leon creeks are located within the cibolo and leon watersheds respectively and flows across limestone bedrock the entire length of the balcones creek is in the edwards aquifer contributing zone while approximately one third of the leon creek is in the contributing zone the source of balcones creek is located in bandera county approximately one mile southwest of the bexar kendall and bandera county line junction the creek transects a rural area flowing east for approximately 15 km and forming the boundary for bexar and kendall counties until convergence with the upper cibolo creek at the junction of bexar kendall and comal counties according to the 2014 texas water quality assessment report the cibolo creek has been identified as impaired both upstream and downstream of convergence with balcones usepa 2014 tanvir pasha et al 2020 the leon creek source is located in northwestern bexar county and flows in a generally southern direction approximately 65 km through the western portion of the city of san antonio tx until it s convergence with the medina river south of san antonio approximately 42 km 65 of the leon creek have been identified as impaired usepa 2014 sanitary sewer overflows ssos on site sewage treatment facilities septic tanks and livestock animals are assumed to be the primary sources of fecal pollution and eight sampling sites were chosen based on the presence and proximity to pollution sources within the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer within bexar county sites b 1 through b 4 are located along balcones creek fig 1 sites b 1 and b 2 are located furthest upstream in the edwards aquifer contributing zone sites b 3 and b 4 are located near the city of fair oaks ranch in the edwards aquifer recharge zone with site b 4 as the most downstream site approximately 45 of the residential properties in fair oaks ranch use septic systems and are not part of the city s wastewater collection city of fair oaks ranch 2019 sites l 1 through l 4 are located along leon creek within the city of san antonio and are predominantly urban land use sites wastewater collection and treatment for san antonio is provided by san antonio water system saws sites l 1 and l 2 are located upstream near the dominion neighborhood and the dominion country club and golf course in the edwards aquifer contributing zone site l 3 is located east of the university of texas at san antonio utsa and next to a student housing apartment complex in the edwards aquifer contributing zone within the transition zone site 4 is located furthest downstream in a residential area in the edward s aquifer recharge zone two u s geological survey usgs rainfall gauges station 08183900 and station 08178585 are located approximately 3 miles north of site b 2 and 3 5 miles southeast of site l 2 respectively 2 2 sample collection and dna extraction water samples were collected by grab sampling in sterile 1 liter nalgene rochester ny bottles from each site bi monthly over a one year period from january 2018 to february 2019 for a total of 26 sample collection events all water samples were transported on ice to the laboratory at utsa san antonio texas where the samples were filtered within 6 h of collection water samples 300ml were filtered in duplicate on a vacuum manifold through 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter polycarbonate membranes pall corporation ann arbor michigan and immediately stored at 80 c until dna extraction sterile de ionized water controls were filtered with each sample event to check for cross contamination during sample processing after filter membranes were allowed to thaw to room temperature dna was extracted using the dneasy powerlyzer powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacture s protocol extraction blanks were processed with all batches of dna extractions to test for contamination during the dna extraction process a nanodrop onec spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington de was used to determine dna purity and concentration ng µl and dna extracts were stored at 20 c until used in qpcr assays 2 3 qpcr analyses the occurrence and relative abundance of eight different mst markers in surface water samples was measured using taqman qpcr assays with dna extracts as the templates table 1 the fecal bacterial markers included six primer sets targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes universal bacteriodales bacuni assay human associated bacteroidales hf183 and bachum assays chicken duck bacteriodales chicken duck bac assay dog bacteriodales baccan assay and cow bacteriodales baccow assay kildare et al 2007 haugland et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2013 in addition two conventional fecal bacterial groups were also tested using qpcr based assays e coli ec23s857 assay chern et al 2011 and enterococcus spp entero1 assay ludwig and schleifer 2000 for the purposes of this study the qpcr targets are grouped into two classifications general indicators which include the bacuni ec23s857 and entero1 assays and host associated markers including the hf183 bachum chicken duck bac baccan and baccow assays all qpcr assays were performed on the cfx96 touch real time pcr detection system bio rad hercules ca using itaq universal probes supermix bio rad the reaction mixtures 25 μl contained 12 5µl of supermix 300 nm of each primer forward and reverse 100 nm of probe and 2 μl of dna template the thermal cycling profile for all assays was 2 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 60 c except entero1 54 c the qpcr data were analyzed using bio rad s cfx manager software version 3 1 standard curves were run in duplicate for each qpcr plate by using serially diluted plasmid standards purchased from integrated dna technologies idt skokie il containing the sequences for each of the targeted genes each standard curve was generated from at least six 10 fold plasmid dilutions in duplicate the percent amplification efficiencies were calculated by the instrument manufacturer s instructions bio rad extraction controls and no template controls three per plate were used to check for cross contamination and 10 fold dilutions of selected dna extracts were used to test for pcr inhibition as described in previous study pitkänen et al 2013 2 4 water quality parameters and rainfall data water quality parameters were measured for all sites and sample collection events throughout the course of the study to monitor water quality and examine spatial temporal variability measured water quality parameters included surface water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and dissolved nitrogen species nitrate nitrite ammonia do and temperature were measured on site using an intellical ldo101 field luminescent optical probe and hq40d portable multi meter hach loveland co ph was measured on site using an intellical phc101 probe and hq40d portable multi meter hach loveland co ammonia nh3 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n concentrations were measured in the utsa laboratory using salicylate method 10205 hach tntplus 830 ultra low range kit usepa diazotization method 10207 hach tntplus 839 low range kit and dimethylphenol method 10206 hach tntplus 835 low range kit respectively and a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer values were reported as below detection limit bdl if measured below the tntplus kit limit of detection for statistical analysis bdl and non detect nd data points were given a value of zero rainfall data within 1 and 7 days prior to sample collection was obtained from the usgs national water information system usgs stations 08183900 and 08178585 were chosen based on their close proximity to balcones creek sites and leon creek sites respectively 2 5 land use characterization an a priori assessment of study sites was conducted based on proximal land use information obtained from bexar county fig s1 and a detailed analysis for each creek was performed as factors influencing fecal contamination sources and levels differ between urban and rural areas ridley et al 2014 land use for each creek was characterized based on four features of interest on site sewage facilities ossfs wastewater collection infrastructure average human population and percentage of developed vs undeveloped land land use features of interest were investigated at a 1 km spatial scale to support detection of recent contamination from nearby inputs arcmap 10 5 1 environmental systems research institute redlands ca was used to create 1 km buffer zones encompassing sampling sites along the length of leon and balcones creek and used to perform all calculations for features of interest the total area analyzed for leon and balcones creek buffer zones was approximately 30 1 and 15 5 km2 respectively the average human population for each zone was calculated based on census tract data obtained from bexar county and the texas demographic center the average number of septic systems per person and wastewater collection infrastructure density were calculated for each zone using ossf data obtained from bexar county public works residential address data from kendall county and the city of fair oaks ranch and underground wastewater collection infrastructure data from san antonio water systems saws the percentage of developed vs undeveloped land for leon creek was obtained from the city of san antonio and approximated based visualizations of impervious cover within the balcones creek buffer zone from the world imagery basemap in arcmap additionally land use parameters were also estimated for each individual site using the above approach and correlation coefficients were calculated between the marker occurrence and land use variables 2 6 statistical analyses based on standard curves the targeted marker copy number per 100 ml of water was calculated for all samples with values above the limit of quantification for each assay and all raw data were log10 transformed before statistical analysis results below detection limit were assigned a value of one before log transformation statistical tests showed that microbiological and environmental data were not distributed normally nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if differences between marker concentrations among sampling sites were statistically significant the correlation between the previous 1 day and 7 days rainfall and general and host associated marker concentrations at all sites was analyzed using the spearman s rank correlation analysis in microsoft excel correlation strength was interpreted according to an accepted scale for biological statistics mcdonald 2009 spearman s rank correlation coefficients r between marker concentrations and water quality parameters were also calculated for comparison purposes coefficients are characterized by a previously published scale stachler et al 2018 0 2 0 39 weak correlation 0 4 0 59 moderate correlation 0 6 0 79 strong correlation and 0 8 1 very strong correlation differences and correlations were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of qpcr assays the linear range of quantification for all qpcr assays was between 101 and 106 copies per reaction the qpcr amplification efficiencies for all the assays ranged from 95 to 120 and r2 values were all greater than 0 948 table s1 pcr inhibition tests were done on the first three set of samples for each site 12 of total samples pcr inhibition tests resulted in a ct value proportional to a 10 fold dilution relative to the undiluted dna templates suggesting that pcr inhibition did not interfere with the amplification efficiency dna extraction controls and no template controls three per qpcr plate were run to check cross contamination and the absence of contamination in the qpcr experiments was confirmed 3 2 detection of general and host associated markers in water samples the targeted fecal bacterial groups were frequently detected in surface water samples table 2 the three general indicators e coli ec23s857 enterococci entero1 and universal bacteroidales bacuni showed the highest levels of detections among the qpcr markers with detection frequency 90 for most of the samples and exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern across the sampling sites at both creeks fig s2 higher detection of entero1 and ec23s857 are expected as these markers include all enterococcus and e coli bacteria found in the gut communities of mammals and birds and are not associated with a specific host field and samadpour 2007 kapoor et al 2018 additionally both bacteria may survive and grow in a wide variety of environmental habitats such as soil and aquatic environments with little or no input from human or animal fecal sources provided resource availability and key abiotic conditions are propitious anderson et al 2005 whitman et al 2003 byappanahalli et al 2012 van elsas et al 2011 bacuni has been developed and identified as a universal marker sequence for the quantitative detection of all fecal bacteroidales and as such higher levels of this marker are also expected kildare et al 2007 therefore the sole use of these general markers for fecal source tracking in the edwards aquifer recharge and contributing zones is not sufficient for specific fecal source identification the water samples yielded significantly different amplification results across study sites with the host associated qpcr assays nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 the two human associated markers displayed similar levels but were slightly higher for the bachum marker at all sites for example detection across study sites ranged from 4 to 27 for the hf183 assay site b 1 exhibited the lowest frequency of amplification 4 while sites b 3 and l 4 exhibited the highest detection frequencies 27 and 23 respectively for the hf183 assay sites b 3 and l 4 also exhibited the highest detection frequencies for the bachum assay 31 and 27 respectively results from this study were consistent with previous studies which showed higher marker levels for bachum in relation to hf183 tanvir pasha et al 2020 kapoor et al 2018 the recent public release of usepa draft method for hf183 assay usepa 2019 has led to an increased interest in the use of these qpcr based markers to characterize fecal pollution in environmental waters polluted by sewage studies comparing host specificities among different fecal sources for the hf183 and bachum markers have shown that both assays were equally sensitive to sewage shanks et al 2010 but bachum showed substantially more false positive results for non human fecal sources such as cat dog gull and raccoon feces jenkins et al 2009 van de werfhorst et al 2011 boehm et al 2013 among the host associated markers study sites showed the highest detections for baccan and baccow suggesting a larger percentage of fecal pollution to be coming from canine and cow sources in the study area site b 3 had the highest occurrence of baccow 77 while site l 2 had the highest detection for baccan 58 among all the study sites chicken duck bac detection in water samples also varied significantly across study sites but overall it was detected with much less frequency than the baccan or baccow marker detection for chicken duck bac marker ranged from 16 to 50 with highest occurrence for sites b 4 and l 2 3 3 correlation of markers and water quality parameters spearman s rank correlation analysis showed an overall strong correlation between the three general markers bacuni e coli and entero1 with the strongest correlations between entero1 and bacuni 0 69 and entero1 and e coli 0 68 fig 2 table s2 for the host associated markers hf183 and bachum showed a strong correlation 0 63 as both markers have been developed for specificity to human fecal waste haughland et al 2010 kildare et al 2007 results from this study are consistent with multiple previous studies that have shown the hf183 and bachum markers to have similar sensitivity jenkins et al 2009 odagiri et al 2015 kapoor et al 2018 correlations among the other host associated markers varied from weak to moderate the host associated indicators hf183 bachum and baccan also had stronger correlations with nitrate 0 27 0 33 0 36 respectively and nitrite 0 30 0 23 0 15 respectively nitrogen concentration than exhibited by the general indicators these findings suggest that bacteroidales markers are better indicators of fecal pollution compared to the conventional indicators nitrate has been reported as a strong predictor for the presence of human associated markers and consistent with our study the major source of nitrate can be attributed to human fecal pollution badgley et al 2019 additionally given that the study area do not contain wastewater treatment plant outfalls this result raises the concern about leaking subsurface wastewater infrastructure and or septic tanks furthermore dog fecal contamination may also be attributed as a major source of nitrogen pollution in creeks as demonstrated by positive correlation between baccan marker levels and nitrate nitrite concentrations for the water quality parameters temperature and do 0 44 and nitrite and nitrate 0 46 showed moderate correlations respectively the negative correlation between temperature and do concentration demonstrates their interdependence while the positive relationships observed between levels of nitrite and nitrate suggest a common source that may be sewage pollution notably ph and ammonia did not correlate with any of the qpcr markers or other water quality parameters one possible reason for the lack of associations could be the considerably less variation of water ph throughout the study period average ph 7 6 0 5 and high number of samples with no ammonia detected it is important to note that different water quality parameters e g temperature nitrate do and ph are expected to vary widely with regard to runoff from surrounding land use which may also be related to varying pollution sources for various indicator types 3 4 proximal land use characterization analysis and spatial variation between leon creek and balcones creek marker concentrations factors influencing fecal contamination sources and levels differ between urban and rural areas ridley et al 2014 for this study an analysis of proximal land use using 1 km buffer zones surrounding balcones and leon creeks was performed in order to characterize the study sites based on septic tanks wastewater collection infrastructure human population and developed vs undeveloped land fig s3 in addition land use parameters were also estimated for each site individually table s3 and correlated with marker occurrence at each site table s4 saws and the city of fair oaks ranch underground wastewater collection infrastructure data was analyzed and estimated to underlie approximately 22 of the surface area of the balcones creek buffer zone and 75 of the leon creek buffer zone additionally the leon creek buffer zone contained a higher amount of impervious cover 50 relative to the buffer zone surrounding balcones creek 10 human population for the balcones creek buffer zone was estimated at 202 people km2 while the leon creek buffer zone population was estimated to be more than 6 5 times greater at 1355 people km2 the number of active septic tanks for balcones and leon buffers totaled 421 and 304 tanks respectively the septic tank density for the balcones creek buffer zone is 27 tanks km2 and 10 tanks km2 for the leon creek buffer zone indicating that tanks cover an approximate area 2 7 times greater for the balcones buffer a comparison of the average general and host associated marker concentrations log10 copies 100 ml between leon and balcones creeks is represented in fig 3 general marker levels were similar across both creeks and showed the highest concentrations among the qpcr markers with concentrations for both entero1 and bacuni above 4 log10 copies 100 ml all host associated marker levels were detected at lower concentrations below 3 log10 copies 100 ml with the lowest levels detected for the two human associated markers differences in marker levels between the leon area and balcones areas were evident for each host associated marker leon creek displayed higher levels for all markers except baccow higher concentrations in leon creek for the two human associated markers could be attributed to the larger human population served by septic tanks or sewer infrastructure estimated for the leon creek buffer zone table s3 both markers were positively correlated to the septic tank density human population and the percent of impervious surface table s4 studies have shown a close relationship between ossfs and human fecal pollution as these systems have been identified as significant sources for emerging contaminants in groundwater and surface water gao et al 2019 hinkle et al 2005 schaider et al 2016 phillips et al 2015 bachum and hf183 concentrations were lowest for sites b 1 and l 3 the areas surrounding these two sites are occupied by the fewest number of septic tanks fig s3 furthermore these sites are located furthest from underground wastewater collection mains table s3 which could also explain the relatively low levels of detection for human fecal waste an increase in septic tank density is observed surrounding sites b 3 l 1 and l 4 which showed the highest levels of both human associated markers therefore relatively higher levels at these three sites could be attributed to leaking septic tanks or breaks in underground sewer infrastructure concentrations for baccan were higher for leon creek sites while the balcones creek showed higher concentrations for the baccow marker higher levels of baccan within the leon creek area could be attributed to the large number of dogs associated with pet owning households as well as the unrestrained dog population in the city avma 2019 city of san antonio 2019 higher levels of baccow marker within the undeveloped balcones sites corresponds well with the higher number of farms and ranches devoted to pasture in that area tda 2019 usda 2012 the typical ranch in bexar county is engaged in cow calf operation however other types of livestock operations found in the county include horses sheep goats dairy cows and stocker calves bexar cad 2019 additionally high baccow marker levels could have also resulted from a lack of host specificity a study evaluating the performance of the baccow marker showed there is an 84 probability that a detection of the marker in a water sample is due to actual contamination from the respective host and 38 of horse fecal extracts tested positive for the baccow marker somnark et al 2018 kildare et al 2007 therefore high detections for baccow observed in the study area could be attributed to the large number of animal ranchlands surrounding the balcones creek sites and detections for baccow observed at the leon creek sites could be attributed to false positive results from non cow fecal sources due to a lack of host specificity among the balcones creek sites site b 3 showed the highest concentrations for baccan baccow and the two human associated markers hf183 and bachum fig s1 the cibolo creek which flows south through kendall county converges with balcones creek approximately 1 mile upstream of site b 3 and has a history of significant fecal contamination often exceeding the state s water quality standards for safe contact recreation a previous study suggested that human fecal contamination may likely occur as a result of treated effluent discharged into cibolo creek from two wastewater treatment plants wwtps located in boerne texas tanvir pasha et al 2020 thus relatively high concentrations for the host associated markers at site b 3 may be attributed to the contribution of fecal pollution from cibolo creek 3 5 temporal variation in marker concentrations temporal variation of the average levels of general indicators human associated markers and other host associated marker concentrations over the course of the study for leon and balcones creeks was also determined figs 4 s4 s5 chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season march may 2018 and the end of fall early winter nov jan 2018 concentrations for these animal associated markers were all lowest during the summer months previous studies have investigated the effect of water temperature on the persistence of feces derived bacteroides 16s rrna genetic markers and have shown that decay rates for genetic markers were greater at higher temperatures okabe and shimazu 2007 kobayashi et al 2013 bell et al 2009 okabe and shimazu 2007 observed a decrease in copy numbers of approximately 1 3 logs within the first two days at 30 c and bae and wuertz 2015 reported decay rates at 22 c that were three to six times higher than those at 14 c implying that host associated bacteroidales cells and their dna are more persistent at lower temperatures surface water temperature was measured for every sample collection event throughout the course of the study and averaged 15 c during the winter and 21 c during the spring and fall months during the summer months water temperatures averaged 28 c and exceeded 30 c during june july and august with a maximum water temperature around 32 c in june 2018 as such seasonal variability and the effects of water temperatures may result in rapid decay of bacteroidales during the summer months thus resulting in low marker concentrations temporal changes in baccan and baccow marker levels can be attributed to pet ownership and livestock breeding and calving practices in the bexar county study region in this area it is more common for pet owners to keep their pets indoors during the winter and summer and spend more recreational time with pets outdoors during the fall and spring seasons studies focusing on texas show that the highest physical activity occurs during the spring while declines in physical activity can be attributed to the shorter days and adverse weather conditions associated with winter and hot and humid conditions during the summer months tucker and gilliland 2007 additionally leon creek is adjacent to the leon creek greenway 20 miles of paved multi use hike and bike trails following the leon creek in north and central san antonio this creek side trail allows access to dogs on a leash and offers a variety of activities including dog walking high levels of dog fecal waste could be associated with the large number of pets and unrestrained dog population in the study area as well as an increase in seasonal outdoor recreational activities specifically along the leon creek figure s5 furthermore there is an increase in farming activities during the spring or fall thus resulting in an increase in fecal waste from cattle sources sprott 2001 higher levels of the chicken duck bac marker during the spring and fall seasons can be attributed to bird migration patterns texas is located directly in the center of the central flyway a well defined route for migratory birds according to a publication by the texas parks and wildlife texas has recorded more species of birds than any other state over 615 species most of which are migrant shackelford et al 2005 increases in migrant birds are observed during the spring season on their transit northward and fall season during their southward passage through bexar county texas 3 6 correlation of markers with rainfall rainfall data was collected from two usgs stations and correlated with all qpcr markers used in this study for all sites table 3 for balcones creek sites significant correlations were observed for sites b 2 and b 3 but not for b 1 and b 4 at site b 2 a positive correlation was noted with baccow and rainfall reported for 1 day but not for 1 week before sample collection most leon creek sites exhibited significant correlations with host associated marker concentrations except for site l 1 at site l 2 positive correlations were noted with all markers and rainfall with statistically significant p 0 05 correlations observed for the hf183 baccow and baccan markers for 1 day rainfall 0 53 0 42 and 0 48 respectively and hf183 bachum and baccan markers for 7 days rainfall before sample collection 0 54 0 53 and 0 39 respectively the concentration of baccan marker showed a significant correlation with rainfall at site l 4 for both 1 day 0 49 and 7 days rainfall 0 47 the general indicators did not exhibit a significant correlation between the marker concentration and rainfall for any site except for site l 3 and bacuni 0 41 balcones creek sites are located in a less developed area along the bexar and kendall county border while the leon creek sites located within the city of san antonio is predominantly urbanized the poor correlations between markers at balcones creek sites and rainfall could be attributed to high surface permeability as a low percentage of impermeable surface 10 was determined for the area surrounding the balcones creek sites chen and chang 2014 buckerfield et al 2019 on average markers exhibited stronger correlations with rainfall at leon creek sites which could be due to a high percentage of impermeable surface 50 surrounding the leon creek sites resulting in more surface runoff entering the creek during rainfall events additionally the occurrence of human associated markers were positively correlated to the percent of impervious surface whereas baccow and chicken duck bac markers were negatively correlated to the percent of impervious surface table s4 the higher abundance of human fecal markers in more urbanized areas suggest that land use changes associated with development as well as increases in watershed impervious cover affect water quality human associated marker levels exhibited similar temporal trends at both creek sites and were highest from march to may 2018 peaking in march 2018 which received an average of 77 2 mm of rainfall for the study area over the seven days prior to sample collection fig 4 a second spike in human associated marker concentrations occurred during the months of september and october 2018 which received averages of 52 4 and 59 9 mm of rainfall for the leon and balcones creek areas respectively an unusual peak in host associated markers is apparent for balcones creek sites the first week of january 2019 during which time the study area received an average of 24 4 mm of rainfall after very little to no rainfall the previous six weeks cumulative total rainfall of 0 76 mm increases in human associated marker detections with rainfall events have previously been observed indicating that rainfall is an important factor in human fecal material loading stachler et al 2018 lee et al 2014 ultimately correlations between host associated marker concentrations are site specific and dependent on surrounding land use and thus may experience varying degrees of increases or decreases in marker levels during rainfall events åström et al 2013 lee et al 2014 mccarthy et al 2012 3 7 implications for the edwards aquifer currently there is an incomplete understanding of the sources of fecal pollution found in the watersheds of the edwards aquifer a primary source of drinking water to the city of san antonio and its surrounding communities segments of both the upper cibolo creek which converges with balcones and leon creek both of which flow through the aquifer recharge and contributing zones have been identified as impaired usepa 2014 bacterial pathogens have been determined to be the number one cause of river and stream impairments in texas tceq 2019 epa 2014 this study is the first to examine and compare fecal contamination at surface water sites in the recharge and contributing zones of the edwards aquifer within bexar county using a molecular mst approach targeting bacteroidales 16s rrna genes for host associated qpcr assays the presence of bacteroidales in most of the water samples suggested that methods targeting this bacterial phylum may be used to track sources of fecal pollution in environmental waters host associated bacteroidales signals were detected at all sites although their relative occurrence varied by site and by month human and animal fecal contaminants are among the major concerns for public health since pathogens could be present the bacteroidales marker assays when combined with land use and weather information can allow for a better understanding of the sources and fluxes of fecal inputs in urban and rural areas which can help us to understand when these fecal sources may impact water quality data collected from the one year study were used to identify and quantify the sources of human and animal fecal pollution and perform an analysis of temporal and seasonal trends it has been determined that the major fecal contributing sources differ between urban and rural areas in our study area major urban sources include sewage overflows and dog waste while rural sources include waste from livestock facilities and farms and leaking septic tanks effective mitigation measures should be directed towards public outreach efforts to educate pet owners on the negative effects of pet waste on water quality and the importance of proper pet waste disposal as well as efforts to control and reduce the large unrestrained dog population in the city efforts to mitigate fecal pollution outside of the city should focus on the implementation of bmps aimed at controlling and mitigating waste associated with animal ranches agricultural practices and wildlife future studies focusing on a more detailed assessment of rural and urban areas associated with clusters of ossfs and underground sewer infrastructure are recommended to determine appropriate measures for mitigating human fecal pollution from these sources 4 conclusions the three general markers e coli enterococci and bacuni exhibited highest levels and a similar spatial distribution pattern across the sampling sites among the host associated markers low levels were observed for the human associated markers and the highest levels for baccan and baccow suggesting a higher percentage of fecal pollution to be coming from the large canine and bovine populations in the study area human associated bacteroidales markers were detected mostly at leon creek sites suggesting that their presence is the result of larger human population served by septic tanks or sewer infrastructure the cow marker concentrations were higher for balcones creek sites due to farms and ranches in the area there were strong correlations between the general indicators and between the human associated markers temperature and dissolved oxygen and nitrite and nitrate showed moderate correlations ph and ammonia did not correlate with any of the qpcr targets or other water quality parameters most marker levels were associated with rainfall at the leon creek sites due to higher impervious cover chicken duck bac baccan and baccow all exhibited higher concentrations during the spring season and the end of fall early winter and were all lowest during the summer months data from this study have established a baseline for fecal pollution sources in the edward aquifer recharge and contributing zones and can be used for the recommendation and implementation of best management practices that can accurately and cost effectively prevent control and remediate fecal

17724,f specific coliphages have been proposed as viral indicators of fecal pollution these intestinal phages infect cells through the f pili of the host strains used for their detection escherichia coli hs famp in the us epa standard method and salmonella enterica wg49 in the iso method the recently designed bluephage protocol allows the rapid detection of as low as one somatic coliphage in a working day the current study describes a new bluephage method designed to exclusively detect f specific phages it employs two new host strains cb14 and cb16 which detect the same number of f specific phages as their respective parental strains hs and wg49 in the bluephage method when the strain is lysed by bacteriophage infection the yellow medium turns blue as low as one f specific phage was detected in 3 to 5 h by this approach and when the sample contained high phage concentrations results were obtained in less than 3 h the f specific bluephage method can be used with different sample volumes and allows phage quantification by the most probable number technique strain cb14 performed more consistently than cb16 with comparable detection efficiency after increasing the incubation

the bluephage method which detects somatic coliphages using an e coli strain genetically modified in the operon responsible for glucuronic acid metabolism liang et al 2005 the modifications consist of knocking out glucuronic acid transporter genes uidb and uidc and overexpression of the β glucuronidase gene uida which leads to the accumulation of β glucuronidase in the cytoplasm of the bacterial host cell after lytic phage infection the yellow medium turns blue as the released enzyme encounters its chromogenic substrate bluephage allows the detection of as low as 1 coliphage in under 4 h and

coliphages purified from different samples and enumerated using the iso 10705 1 protocol anonymous 1995 ten samples of raw urban sewage containing ca 104 5 pfu ml were collected from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant serving a population of approximately 500 000 inhabitants the same plant was the source of five sewage sludge samples which were a composite mixture of raw primary sludge about two thirds and secondary sludge about one third eight samples were also collected from the lower course of the river llobregat ca 101 2 pfu ml with the sampling points located in the barcelona

five of fish two of mackerel two of emperor fish and one of monk fish were obtained from five local supermarkets of barcelona all samples were collected in sterile containers transported to the laboratory at 5 2 c within two hours of collection and processed immediately for bacteriophage enumeration and further experiments to purify bacteriophages from natural water samples raw sewage river water and sea water samples were filtered through 0 22 µm pore size low protein binding pes membranes millipore burlington massachusetts usa to remove bacteria and other particulate material phage extraction from sludge was performed as indicated in established policies guzmán et al 2007 with minor modifications briefly the samples were mixed in a 1 10 w v ratio with 10 beef extract ph 7 2 and

generated from e coli strain hs f amp which is recommended in the us epa standard method for f specific coliphage detection u s epa 2001b 2001a strain cb16 was developed from s enterica strain wg49 used in the iso standard method for f specific coliphage detection anonymous 1995 the e coli hs derivative mutant strain cb14 was obtained as follows first using the acridine orange method hirota 1960 the hs strain was cured of its f amp plasmid due to the incompatibility of selection markers with the pkd46 and pbad plasmids used later plasmid curation was confirmed by pcr with primers fkm up lp table s1 a mutant of the cured hs strain was generated by replacing genes uidb and uidc with a tet cassette this was carried out using the red recombinase system introduced in plasmid pkd46 datsenko and wanner 2000 prepared as described previously muniesa et al 2018 without the uidb and uidc genes the strain would be unable to incorporate the glucuronic acid substrate into the cells the strain was then manipulated to overexpress the uida gene which encodes the enzyme β glucuronidase responsible for the cleavage of glucuronic acid this was achieved by transforming the hs mutant with the

arabinose in the medium accumulates high intracellular amounts of the enzyme the protocol and primers used to generate and confirm the construct were as previously described muniesa et al 2018 f plasmid derivative pox38km containing kanamycin resistance as a selective marker was introduced by conjugation in the modified hs strain thus a loop of the donor strain e coli dh5α pox38km kmr was inoculated horizontally on one side of an lb agar plate containing km and ap a loop of the recipient strain modified e coli hs δuidbc tet apr was inoculated perpendicularly to the loop of the donor strain crossing with the donor strain in the central part of the agar plate plates were incubated for 10 h at 37 c and transconjugant colonies were selected from the central interphase and confirmed by pcr with primers fkm up lp table s1 f plasmid derivative pox38km allowed expression of the f pili required for f specific coliphage infection in the final strain cb14 the generation of strain cb16 only required the introduction of the pbad uida plasmid as the original s enterica wg49 strain does not possess the β glucoronidase operon in its genome and already contains a compatible f plasmid havelaar and pot hogeboom 1988 the pbad uida plasmid was cloned as previously described muniesa et al 2018 the presence or absence of all these genes was confirmed by pcr and sequencing with the primers described in table s1 2 7 bacteriophage enumeration the coliphage both somatic and f specific detection performance of strains cb14 and cb16 was compared with that of the wild type wt strains

sludge sea water fish and mussels by both the dal anonymous 2000 1995 and bluephage methods muniesa et al 2018 when using bluephage phages were analyzed in triplicate and the positive and negative results were used to quantify phages by application of the most probable number mpn method jarvis et al 2010 2 8 strains cb14 and cb16 assayed using the bluephagemethod bluephage strains cb14 or cb16 were inoculated in bgm with ap and km for cb14 and only ap for cb16 and incubated overnight at 37 c one ml of the overnight culture was 1 100 diluted in fresh bgm with the respective antibiotics and grown to the exponential growth phase monitored by an optical density od of 0 3 at 600 nm at this stage 0 5 ml of the culture was added to 2 5 ml of btm strain cb12 was used for comparison as it can detect total coliphages using the conditions described previously toribio avedillo et al 2019 a known number of phages purified from each sample were added to each btm tube containing strains cb12 cb14 or cb16 and one tube of each strain in btm without phages was used as a control in all experiments the tubes were statically incubated at 37 c and periodically evaluated for color change from light yellow to blue at 1 00 1 30 2 00 2 30 3 00 3 30 4 00 4 30 and 5 00 h phage induced cell lysis releases β glucuronidase which after cleaving the substrate liberates a blue chromogenic compound into the medium negative controls without phages were used to confirm that the bluephage strains could not cause a color change in the absence of phage lysis during the time of the experiment the experiment lasted until the control tube without phages turned blue after a minimum of 7 h all tubes were assayed in triplicate as additional controls in the experiments with environmental samples 1 ml of 1 100 diluted wastewater or 1 ml of river water filtered through high protein binding membranes of 0 22 µm millex mf millipore to remove phages were inoculated in tubes containing btm and the strain 2 9 influence of shaking and incubation time on f specific bacteriophage enumeration the influence of shaking and incubation time on f specific coliphage detection was assessed in two different assays the effect of shaking on f specific coliphage enumeration was evaluated using the dal method with host strains hs wg49 cb14 and cb16 grown at 37 c in static conditions 0 rpm and shaking at 180 rpm twenty one different samples comprising natural samples wastewater and river water and laboratory stocks ms2 ga fi qb and environmental phage laboratory stocks were analyzed under both conditions the effect of the incubation time on enumeration was assessed with the same strains grown in static conditions phage enumeration was performed with strains hs and cb14 grown until the exponential growth phase od600 0 3 which corresponds to concentrations of 3 108 cells ml as currently used in dal enumeration or until a late exponential growth phase od600 0 8 corresponding to concentrations of 1 109 cells ml which involved 50 additional minutes of incubation at 37 c thirty two samples comprising natural samples wastewater sludge and fish and laboratory stocks ms2 ga fi qb and environmental phage laboratory stocks were analyzed under both conditions 2 10 quantitative analysis by the bluephage method applying the most probable number technique for a quantitative application of the bluephage method using the mpn approach microplates of 96 wells were used each containing dilutions of phage densities from 104 to 1 phage of ms2 ga qβ and raw sewage this experiment was performed with the same conditions proportion of nutrients substrate and strain as in the bluephage tube assays the microplates were incubated until 5 h although many positive results were observed earlier assays were performed in triplicate and using 3 dilutions of each analyzed sample 2 11 transmission electron microscopy bacterial cell cultures were negatively stained to check for the presence of f pili whole cells of strains cb10 cb12 cb14 and cb16 grown on cfa agar plates were harvested and carefully resuspended in bidistilled water afterwards 10 μl droplets of each cell preparation were applied to a copper grid overlaid with a carbon coated formvar film and incubated for 15 min afterwards the grids were washed with 2 two droplets of bidistilled water finally 10 μl droplets of uranyl acetate 2 were applied onto the copper grids and incubated for 1 or 2 min sample excess was carefully removed and the copper grid was dried the samples were examined in a jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope jeol inc peabody ma usa operating at 80 kv 2 12 statistical analysis computation of data and statistical tests were performed using the statistical package for social science software spss the anova test was used to evaluate the differences between mpn coliphage enumeration and bluephage results evaluations were based on significance levels of α 0 05 data obtained from the three replicates performed for each sample or phage stock or when indicated all data from the same type of sample or stock were used to compare the results obtained between the different strains 3 results 3 1 performance of strains detecting f specific rna phages several tests were performed to characterize the new bluephage strains cb14 and cb16 and their properties the inability of strains cb14 and cb16 to incorporate the glucuronide substrate due to the absence of uidb and uidc genes was confirmed by pcr and by culture of the strains in chromocult agar plates using the original strains hs and wg49 respectively as a control the presence of plasmids pbad uida and f kan was also confirmed by pcr analysis and sequencing using the primers described in table s1 schematic representations of all bluephage strains their genetic modifications and properties are shown in fig 1 f pili expression in the strains containing the f plasmid cb12 cb14 and cb16 was confirmed by tem fig 1 phage suspensions were diluted to high 108 pfu ml moderate 104 pfu ml and low 102 1 pfu ml concentrations table 1 and enumerated in triplicate by dal using strains cb14 and cb16 and their respective counterparts hs and wg49 as these strains are not capable of detecting somatic coliphages they were not lysed by φx174 table 1 in contrast control strain cb12 toribio avedillo et al 2019 and its counterpart cb390 can be infected by both somatic and f rna specific coliphages and was therefore able to detect φx174 and all the f specific reference phages table 1 no significant differences p 0 05 were found in enumeration by the dal method when comparing the bluephage with the non modified strains for each stock separately table 1 3 2 sensitivity of strains cb14 and cb16 phage enumeration by the dal method using the standard strains cb390 hs or wg49 did not differ significantly p 0 05 from the results using their counterpart bluephage strains cb12 cb14 or cb16 respectively when considering all the samples together or when analyzing each sample type separately in contrast significantly higher counts were obtained in sludge p 0 0048 river water p 0 0096 sea water p 0 0079 and fish p 7 08e 08 fig 2 when using total coliphage detecting strains cb390 or its bluephage strain cb12 in comparison with strains susceptible only to f specific phage infection hs cb14 and wg49 cb16 which is attributed to the presence of somatic coliphages in the environmental samples this was plausibly also the case in wastewater although in wastewater samples the differences between total coliphage detecting and f specific detecting strains were not significant in contrast no significant differences p 0 05 were observed when comparing the results of the strains hs cb14 versus wg49 cb16 since all exclusively detect f specific coliphages table 1 and fig 2 3 3 time required by cb14 and cb16 to detect reference and environmental f specific coliphages to study their performance further the cb14 and cb16 strains and their wild counterparts were incubated with suspensions of known phage concentration from laboratory stocks and environmental samples and the bluephage strains were tested in the btm containing the chromogenic substrate 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid before starting the bluephage protocol incubation times were compared the most rapidly growing strain was cb14 which required 2 h to reach the exponential growth phase whereas cb12 and cb16 had a similar incubation time of around 2 30 h the faster growth of cb14 compensates for the longer times required for phage detection by the bluephage assay when subjected to the highest concentration of reference coliphages all the strains turned the medium blue at 2 h with the exception of cb14 in the presence of ms2 which required 2 30 h fig 3 for all the strains when the phage concentration was moderate the color change occurred at 3 4 h and when low at 5 h fig 3 environmental phages at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 were added to tubes containing btm together with one of the three bluephage strains cb12 cb14 and cb16 when phage densities were high cb12 and cb14 took only 2 h to turn the medium blue fig 3 or sometimes even less data not shown lower phage densities generally required more time to cause an infection a maximum of 5 h in the case of cb12 and cb14 after which negative samples did not change the correlation between high numbers of environmental phages and rapid color change was not always observed for example sample rw7 contained a higher concentration of coliphages than rw3 but an earlier color change was observed for the combination of rw3 and cb12 similarly sample sf5 had a higher concentration of f specific coliphages than sf6 but the cb14 strain was more quickly infected when exposed to the latter these differences were attributed to the variable phage composition of the environmental samples in the case of strain cb16 when using reference coliphages such as ms2 fi ga and qβ the results matched those of the other 2 strains fig 3 in contrast the results were less consistent for environmental phages often taking more than 4 h to appear or remaining negative after 5 h of incubation in samples giving positive results for cb12 and cb14 fig 3 strain cb14 provided the most consistent results in both environmental samples and laboratory stocks although it detected lower amounts of coliphages than wg49 when using dal methods for concentrations higher than 103 pfu ml cb12 and cb14 gave positive results after a maximum of 2 h of incubation with cb14 this was mainly the case in wastewater ww samples whereas cb12 which is also capable of detecting somatic coliphages obtained these results with seawater sw sludge sl and river water rw fig 3 when phage densities were lower cb12 and cb14 turned the medium blue at 3 5 h fig 3 to confirm that changes in color were exclusively caused by phage infection and bacterial cell lysis each tube had a negative control containing only the strain and btm the controls remained yellow for the duration of the experiment and until monitoring stopped after 7 h none of the positive samples showed any further changes beyond the 5 hour mark in summary cb14 showed the best performance with a similar behavior than cb12 that detect somatic plus f specific coliphages grew faster and is specific for f specific phages in contrast cb16 performed inconsistently and considerably less efficiently than the other two strains in the analysis of environmental samples fig 3 3 4 quantitative results for strains cb14 and cb16 using the bluephage method based on the most probable number technique qualitative results based on presence absence analysis can be easily transformed into quantitative data by applying the most probable number mpn method phage counts in wastewater environmental samples and reference phage samples of known concentration obtained by the dal method were compared with those of bluephage using the mpn technique fig 4 for this experiment 3 of each sample type using 3 dilutions were assayed in triplicate with both cb14 and cb16 up to five hours good performance was observed when using the bluephage test medium downscaled for each component maintaining the original proportions of the original btm medium the comparison shows that there were no significant differences p 0 628 between real counts pfu ml and estimates mpn for cb14 while for cb16 the results varied among the different replicates data not shown therefore strain cb14 is more suitable for application in quantitative assays using the bluephage method 3 5 influence of shaking during host growth on bacteriophage enumeration strains cb14 and cb16 and their respective parental counterparts hs and wg49 were analyzed in this experiment although growth was slightly higher when strains were incubated with shaking higher phage counts were obtained in statically incubated samples fig 5 while no significant differences were observed when considering the results of all the strains together p hs 0 611 p cb14 0 419 p wg49 0 974 p cb16 0 975 separate subsets of these samples showed a significant improvement in phage recovery after static incubation especially in the case of environmental phages and ms2 detected with strain hs p 0 016 p 0 021 and qβ with strain cb14 p 0 003 additionally for strains hs and cb14 there was a slight increase in counts in the absence of shaking whether significant or not whereas for cb16 and wg49 counts fluctuated fig 5 3 6 influence of host strain incubation time on bacteriophage enumeration the influence of incubation time during the host strain growth on f specific bacteriophage enumeration was analyzed the assays were performed without shaking as they provided more consistent results when strains wg49 and cb16 were tested with ww no changes were observed in pfu counts related to the incubation time data not shown so only strains cb14 and hs were used for the analysis as they produced more consistent results with greater differences two different incubation times were tested for the host strains the usual time required to reach a mid exponential growth phage 2 h and the time required to reach a later exponential growth phase an additional 50 mins no significant differences were observed for either strain when the results for all the samples were analyzed together p hs 0 113 p cb14 0 091 however significant differences in favor of longer incubation times were observed for some phage subsets such as ms2 fi ga qβ and environmental phages for hs p 0 001 p 0 002 p 0 002 p 0 004 p 0 005 and ms2 fi qβ and environmental phages for cb14 p 0 001 p 1 22e 04 p 3 67e 04 p 0 023 overall even if the differences were not always significant the longer incubation time slightly increased counts for all the samples and strains fig 6 4 discussion somatic and f specific coliphages have been proposed as surrogates for enteric viruses in safety guidelines around the globe while somatic coliphages are often more abundant in samples the dynamics of f specific coliphages more closely resemble those of enteric viruses ballester et al 2005 love et al 2014 although somatic coliphages are typically found in higher densities in the environment jebri et al 2015 f specific coliphages consistently predominate in reclaimed water clay sediments and groundwater lucena et al 2006 montemayor et al 2008 they are also more commonly found in samples subjected to disinfection treatments such as uv irradiation jofre 2007 the targeted analysis of f specific coliphages would therefore be recommended in certain cases this prompted us to develop a new rapid detection method aimed at f specific coliphages and to study modifications to optimize the process as previously reported muniesa et al 2018 toribio avedillo et al 2019 the bluephage method can detect as low as 1 coliphage in less than a working day the complete analysis takes up to 7 h 2 to 3 h for the incubation of the host strain and then an average of 4 h for the incubation in btm the same timeframe applies for the detection of f specific phages although with some differences depending on the strain e coli cb14 grew much more quickly than cb12 or cb16 and also produced a faster color change cb14 showed less sensitivity measured by the number of phages detected by the dal method than cb16 a difference also observed between their respective counterparts hs and wg49 jofre 2007 schaper and jofre 2000 although cb16 detects more pfu using the iso dal method anonymous 1995 this s enterica strain grew more slowly and performed poorly and inconsistently in the bluephage method the presence of plasmids from e coli in cb16 and the overexpression of uida which is not found in salmonella can increase fitness costs resulting in a delayed growth of the host strain while this is not critical for the dal method it increases the time required for bluephage detection the quantitative and scaling analysis also indicated an efficient performance for cb14 but not for cb16 as a detection method needs to adapt to a range of volumes and parameters in accordance with safety guidelines cb14 is more suitable than cb16 as a host strain for bluephage assays the absence of shaking and a longer incubation time were found to improve the sensitivity of strain hsin terms of pfu detection figs 5 and 6 static incubation might increase phage yields by preventing the shear of f pili which are required for f specific phage infection wetzel 1999 m p garcillan barcia personal communication the use of a host strain grown to the late exponential growth phase could promote detection due to improved phage attachment to the pili and dna injection accordingly better conjugation rates have been reported after using cultures at the late exponential growth phase compared with early cultures lampkowska et al 2008 increasing the incubation time apparently had no influence on phage recovery by the s enterica strains which did not show a significant increase in pfu counts in the case of wg49 this could be explained by the expression of an e coli plasmid in the strain and the differences in growth rates of salmonella compared with e coli regarding its bluephage counterpart cb16 the aforementioned lack of consistency in performance could have masked differences in phage recovery in the modified conditions in any case the lower counts traditionally observed for e coli hs in comparison with s enterica wg49 jofre 2007 might be resolved by minor modifications in the incubation process rendering both strains equally suitable for f specific phage detection based on the results of the bluephage assays and the modifications of the incubation process it was concluded that strain cb14 is a good candidate for rapid phage detection not only did it perform better in the bluephage assays but its slightly lower detection rates pfu ml compared to cb16 were overcome by static incubation at 37 c for an additional 50 min before application for coliphage enumeration 5 conclusion the use of strains cb14 and cb16 in the bluephage method allowed the detection of f specific coliphages in under 5 h including the incubation of the host strain and phage detection which makes it possible to complete the analysis within a working day strain cb14 performed very similarly to the bluephage strain cb12 with improved sensitivity compared to other available methods while being specific only for phages that infect through the f pili the amount of coliphages detected by cb12 was significantly higher as it can detect both somatic and f specific coliphages so this strain is more suitable if a single host is needed for both analyses the bluephage method can be adapted to microplates and allows quantitative evaluation using the mpn technique using 3 replicates of 3 of each sample type and incubating with strain cb14 in the original proportions of btm medium for five hours it can also be adapted to the presence absence test for large sample volumes making it suitable for the implementation of future eu directives on drinking water static incubation of the host strain for an additional 50 min improved phage detection by strain e coli hs and its derivative bluephage strain these modifications could potentially help to further optimize the detection of f specific phages in the environment bluephage is the fastest available microbiological method using cultivable microorganisms to determine fecal pollution reported

phages as their respective parental strains hs and wg49 in the bluephage method when the strain is lysed by bacteriophage infection the yellow medium turns blue as low as one f specific phage was detected in 3 to 5 h by this approach and when the sample contained high phage concentrations results were obtained in less than 3 h the f specific bluephage method can be used with different sample

sambrook and russell 2001 mixed with 0 5 µg of dna plasmid or pcr product and transferred to a 0 2 cm electroporation cuvette bio rad inc hercules california usa the cells were electroporated at 2 5 kv with 25 f and 200 ω cells containing the construct were recovered on msa agar plates with the corresponding antibiotic 2 6 generation of tailored cb14 and cb16 strains e coli strain cb14 was generated from e coli strain hs f amp which is recommended in the us epa standard method for f specific coliphage detection u s epa 2001b 2001a strain cb16 was developed from s enterica strain wg49 used in the iso standard method for f specific coliphage detection anonymous 1995 the e coli hs derivative mutant strain cb14 was obtained as follows first using the acridine orange method hirota 1960 the hs strain was cured of its f amp plasmid due to the incompatibility of selection markers with the pkd46 and pbad plasmids used later plasmid curation was confirmed by pcr with primers fkm up lp table s1 a mutant of the cured hs strain was generated by replacing genes uidb and uidc with a tet cassette this was carried out using the red recombinase system introduced in plasmid pkd46 datsenko and wanner 2000 prepared as described previously muniesa et al 2018 without the uidb and uidc genes the strain would be unable to incorporate the glucuronic acid substrate into the cells the strain was then manipulated to overexpress the uida gene which encodes the enzyme β glucuronidase responsible for the cleavage of glucuronic acid this was achieved by transforming the hs mutant with the plasmid pbad topo ta expression kit containing uida under the expression of an arabinose inducible promoter arabad thermo fisher scientific the strain containing pbad uida in the presence of 0 05 of arabinose in the medium accumulates high intracellular amounts of the enzyme the protocol and primers used to generate and confirm the construct were as previously described muniesa et al 2018 f plasmid derivative pox38km containing kanamycin resistance as a selective marker was introduced by conjugation in the modified hs strain thus a loop of the donor strain e coli dh5α pox38km kmr was inoculated horizontally on one side of an lb agar plate containing km and ap a loop of the recipient strain modified e coli hs δuidbc tet apr was inoculated perpendicularly to the loop of the donor strain crossing with the donor strain in the central part of the agar plate plates were incubated for 10 h at 37 c and transconjugant colonies were selected from the central interphase and confirmed by pcr with primers fkm up lp table s1 f plasmid derivative pox38km allowed expression of the f pili required for f specific coliphage infection in the final strain cb14 the generation of strain cb16 only required the introduction of the pbad uida plasmid as the original s enterica wg49 strain does not possess the β glucoronidase operon in its genome and already contains a compatible f plasmid havelaar and pot hogeboom 1988 the pbad uida plasmid was cloned as previously described muniesa et al 2018 the presence or absence of all these genes was confirmed by pcr and sequencing with the primers described in table s1 2 7 bacteriophage enumeration the coliphage both somatic and f specific detection performance of strains cb14 and cb16 was compared with that of the wild type wt strains hs and wg49 the bluephage strain e coli cb12 and strain e coli cb390 guzmán et al 2008 all strains were used as hosts to detect phages фx174 ms2 fi ga and qβ and phages from raw sewage river water sludge sea water fish and mussels by both the dal anonymous 2000 1995 and bluephage methods muniesa et al 2018 when using bluephage phages were analyzed in triplicate and the positive and negative results were used to quantify phages by application of the most probable number mpn method jarvis et al 2010 2 8 strains cb14 and cb16 assayed using the bluephagemethod bluephage strains cb14 or cb16 were inoculated in bgm with ap and km for cb14 and only ap for cb16 and incubated overnight at 37 c one ml of the overnight culture was 1 100 diluted in fresh bgm with the respective antibiotics and grown to the exponential growth phase monitored by an optical density od of 0 3 at 600 nm at this stage 0 5 ml of the culture was added to 2 5 ml of btm strain cb12 was used for comparison as it can detect total coliphages using the conditions described previously toribio avedillo et al 2019 a known number of phages purified from each sample were added to each btm tube containing strains cb12 cb14 or cb16 and one tube of each strain in btm without phages was used as a control in all experiments the tubes were statically incubated at 37 c and periodically evaluated for color change from light yellow to blue at 1 00 1 30 2 00 2 30 3 00 3 30 4 00 4 30 and 5 00 h phage induced cell lysis releases β glucuronidase which after cleaving the substrate liberates a blue chromogenic compound into the medium negative controls without phages were used to confirm that the bluephage strains could not cause a color change in the absence of phage lysis during the time of the experiment the experiment lasted until the control tube without phages turned blue after a minimum of 7 h all tubes were assayed in triplicate as additional controls in the experiments with environmental samples 1 ml of 1 100 diluted wastewater or 1 ml of river water filtered through high protein binding membranes of 0 22 µm millex mf millipore to remove phages were inoculated in tubes containing btm and the strain 2 9 influence of shaking and incubation time on f specific bacteriophage enumeration the influence of shaking and incubation time on f specific coliphage detection was assessed in two different assays the effect of shaking on f specific coliphage enumeration was evaluated using the dal method with host strains hs wg49 cb14 and cb16 grown at 37 c in static conditions 0 rpm and shaking at 180 rpm twenty one different samples comprising natural samples wastewater and river water and laboratory stocks ms2 ga fi qb and environmental phage laboratory stocks were analyzed under both conditions the effect of the incubation time on enumeration was assessed with the same strains grown in static conditions phage enumeration was performed with strains hs and cb14 grown until the exponential growth phase od600 0 3 which corresponds to concentrations of 3 108 cells ml as currently used in dal enumeration or until a late exponential growth phase od600 0 8 corresponding to concentrations of 1 109 cells ml which involved 50 additional minutes of incubation at 37 c thirty two samples comprising natural samples wastewater sludge and fish and laboratory stocks ms2 ga fi qb and environmental phage laboratory stocks were analyzed under both conditions 2 10 quantitative analysis by the bluephage method applying the most probable number technique for a quantitative application of the bluephage method using the mpn approach microplates of 96 wells were used each containing dilutions of phage densities from 104 to 1 phage of ms2 ga qβ and raw sewage this experiment was performed with the same conditions proportion of nutrients substrate and strain as in the bluephage tube assays the microplates were incubated until 5 h although many positive results were observed earlier assays were performed in triplicate and using 3 dilutions of each analyzed sample 2 11 transmission electron microscopy bacterial cell cultures were negatively stained to check for the presence of f pili whole cells of strains cb10 cb12 cb14 and cb16 grown on cfa agar plates were harvested and carefully resuspended in bidistilled water afterwards 10 μl droplets of each cell preparation were applied to a copper grid overlaid with a carbon coated formvar film and incubated for 15 min afterwards the grids were washed with 2 two droplets of bidistilled water finally 10 μl droplets of uranyl acetate 2 were applied onto the copper grids and incubated for 1 or 2 min sample excess was carefully removed and the copper grid was dried the samples were examined in a jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope jeol inc peabody ma usa operating at 80 kv 2 12 statistical analysis computation of data and statistical tests were performed using the statistical package for social science software spss the anova test was used to evaluate the differences between mpn coliphage enumeration and bluephage results evaluations were based on significance levels of α 0 05 data obtained from the three replicates performed for each sample or phage stock or when indicated all data from the same type of sample or stock were used to compare the results obtained between the different strains 3 results 3 1 performance of strains detecting f specific rna phages several tests were performed to characterize the new bluephage strains cb14 and cb16 and their properties the inability of strains cb14 and cb16 to incorporate the glucuronide substrate due to the absence of uidb and uidc genes was confirmed by pcr and by culture of the strains in chromocult agar plates using the original strains hs and wg49 respectively as a control the presence of plasmids pbad uida and f kan was also confirmed by pcr analysis and sequencing using the primers described in table s1 schematic representations of all bluephage strains their genetic modifications and properties are shown in fig 1 f pili expression in the strains containing the f plasmid cb12 cb14 and cb16 was confirmed by tem fig 1 phage suspensions were diluted to high 108 pfu ml moderate 104 pfu ml and low 102 1 pfu ml concentrations table 1 and enumerated in triplicate by dal using strains cb14 and cb16 and their respective counterparts hs and wg49 as these strains are not capable of detecting somatic coliphages they were not lysed by φx174 table 1 in contrast control strain cb12 toribio avedillo et al 2019 and its counterpart cb390 can be infected by both somatic and f rna specific coliphages and was therefore able to detect φx174 and all the f specific reference phages table 1 no significant differences p 0 05 were found in enumeration by the dal method when comparing the bluephage with the non modified strains for each stock separately table 1 3 2 sensitivity of strains cb14 and cb16 phage enumeration by the dal method using the standard strains cb390 hs or wg49 did not differ significantly p 0 05 from the results using their counterpart bluephage strains cb12 cb14 or cb16 respectively when considering all the samples together or when analyzing each sample type separately in contrast significantly higher counts were obtained in sludge p 0 0048 river water p 0 0096 sea water p 0 0079 and fish p 7 08e 08 fig 2 when using total coliphage detecting strains cb390 or its bluephage strain cb12 in comparison with strains susceptible only to f specific phage infection hs cb14 and wg49 cb16 which is attributed to the presence of somatic coliphages in the environmental samples this was plausibly also the case in wastewater although in wastewater samples the differences between total coliphage detecting and f specific detecting strains were not significant in contrast no significant differences p 0 05 were observed when comparing the results of the strains hs cb14 versus wg49 cb16 since all exclusively detect f specific coliphages table 1 and fig 2 3 3 time required by cb14 and cb16 to detect reference and environmental f specific coliphages to study their performance further the cb14 and cb16 strains and their wild counterparts were incubated with suspensions of known phage concentration from laboratory stocks and environmental samples and the bluephage strains were tested in the btm containing the chromogenic substrate 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl β d glucuronic acid before starting the bluephage protocol incubation times were compared the most rapidly growing strain was cb14 which required 2 h to reach the exponential growth phase whereas cb12 and cb16 had a similar incubation time of around 2 30 h the faster growth of cb14 compensates for the longer times required for phage detection by the bluephage assay when subjected to the highest concentration of reference coliphages all the strains turned the medium blue at 2 h with the exception of cb14 in the presence of ms2 which required 2 30 h fig 3 for all the strains when the phage concentration was moderate the color change occurred at 3 4 h and when low at 5 h fig 3 environmental phages at concentrations ranging from 1 to 1000 were added to tubes containing btm together with one of the three bluephage strains cb12 cb14 and cb16 when phage densities were high cb12 and cb14 took only 2 h to turn the medium blue fig 3 or sometimes even less data not shown lower phage densities generally required more time to cause an infection a maximum of 5 h in the case of cb12 and cb14 after which negative samples did not change the correlation between high numbers of environmental phages and rapid color change was not always observed for example sample rw7 contained a higher concentration of coliphages than rw3 but an earlier color change was observed for the combination of rw3 and cb12 similarly sample sf5 had a higher concentration of f specific coliphages than sf6 but the cb14 strain was more quickly infected when exposed to the latter these differences were attributed to the variable phage composition of the environmental samples in the case of strain cb16 when using reference coliphages such as ms2 fi ga and qβ the results matched those of the other 2 strains fig 3 in contrast the results were less consistent for environmental phages often taking more than 4 h to appear or remaining negative after 5 h of incubation in samples giving positive results for cb12 and cb14 fig 3 strain cb14 provided the most consistent results in both environmental samples and laboratory stocks although it detected lower amounts of coliphages than wg49 when using dal methods for concentrations higher than 103 pfu ml cb12 and cb14 gave positive results after a maximum of 2 h of incubation with cb14 this was mainly the case in wastewater ww samples whereas cb12 which is also capable of detecting somatic coliphages obtained these results with seawater sw sludge sl and river water rw fig 3 when phage densities were lower cb12 and cb14 turned the medium blue at 3 5 h fig 3 to confirm that changes in color were exclusively caused by phage infection and bacterial cell lysis each tube had a negative control containing only the strain and btm the controls remained yellow for the duration of the experiment and until monitoring stopped after 7 h none of the positive samples showed any further changes beyond the 5 hour mark in summary cb14 showed the best performance with a similar behavior than cb12 that detect somatic plus f specific coliphages grew faster and is specific for f specific phages in contrast cb16 performed inconsistently and considerably less efficiently than the other two strains in the analysis of environmental samples fig 3 3 4 quantitative results for strains cb14 and cb16 using the bluephage method based on the most probable number technique qualitative results based on presence absence analysis can be easily transformed into quantitative data by applying the most probable number mpn method phage counts in wastewater environmental samples and reference phage samples of known concentration obtained by the dal method were compared with those of bluephage using the mpn technique fig 4 for this experiment 3 of each sample type using 3 dilutions were assayed in triplicate with both cb14 and cb16 up to five hours good performance was observed when using the bluephage test medium downscaled for each component maintaining the original proportions of the original btm medium the comparison shows that there were no significant differences p 0 628 between real counts pfu ml and estimates mpn for cb14 while for cb16 the results varied among the different replicates data not shown therefore strain cb14 is more suitable for application in quantitative assays using the bluephage method 3 5 influence of shaking during host growth on bacteriophage enumeration strains cb14 and cb16 and their respective parental counterparts hs and wg49 were analyzed in this experiment although growth was slightly higher when strains were incubated with shaking higher phage counts were obtained in statically incubated samples fig 5 while no significant differences were observed when considering the results of all the strains together p hs 0 611 p cb14 0 419 p wg49 0 974 p cb16 0 975 separate subsets of these samples showed a significant improvement in phage recovery after static incubation especially in the case of environmental phages and ms2 detected with strain hs p 0 016 p 0 021 and qβ with strain cb14 p 0 003 additionally for strains hs and cb14 there was a slight increase in counts in the absence of shaking whether significant or not whereas for cb16 and wg49 counts fluctuated fig 5 3 6 influence of host strain incubation time on bacteriophage enumeration the influence of incubation time during the host strain growth on f specific bacteriophage enumeration was analyzed the assays were performed without shaking as they provided more consistent results when strains wg49 and cb16 were tested with ww no changes were observed in pfu counts related to the incubation time data not shown so only strains cb14 and hs were used for the analysis as they produced more consistent results with greater differences two different incubation times were tested for the host strains the usual time required to reach a mid exponential growth phage 2 h and the time required to reach a later exponential growth phase an additional 50 mins no significant differences were observed for either strain when the results for all the samples were analyzed together p hs 0 113 p cb14 0 091 however significant differences in favor of longer incubation times were observed for some phage subsets such as ms2 fi ga qβ and environmental phages for hs p 0 001 p 0 002 p 0 002 p 0 004 p 0 005 and ms2 fi qβ and environmental phages for cb14 p 0 001 p 1 22e 04 p 3 67e 04 p 0 023 overall even if the differences were not always significant the longer incubation time slightly increased counts for all the samples and strains fig 6 4 discussion somatic and f specific coliphages have been proposed as surrogates for enteric viruses in safety guidelines around the globe while somatic coliphages are often more abundant in samples the dynamics of f specific coliphages more closely resemble those of enteric viruses ballester et al 2005 love et al 2014 although somatic coliphages are typically found in higher densities in the environment jebri et al 2015 f specific coliphages consistently predominate in reclaimed water clay sediments and groundwater lucena et al 2006 montemayor et al 2008 they are also more commonly found in samples subjected to disinfection treatments such as uv irradiation jofre 2007 the targeted analysis of f specific coliphages would therefore be recommended in certain cases this prompted us to develop a new rapid detection method aimed at f specific coliphages and to study modifications to optimize the process as previously reported muniesa et al 2018 toribio avedillo et al 2019 the bluephage method can detect as low as 1 coliphage in less than a working day the complete analysis takes up to 7 h 2 to 3 h for the incubation of the host strain and then an average of 4 h for the incubation in btm the same timeframe applies for the detection of f specific phages although with some differences depending on the strain e coli cb14 grew much more quickly than cb12 or cb16 and also produced a faster color change cb14 showed less sensitivity measured by the number of phages detected by the dal method than cb16 a difference also observed between their respective counterparts hs and wg49 jofre 2007 schaper and jofre 2000 although cb16 detects more pfu using the iso dal method anonymous 1995 this s enterica strain grew more slowly and performed poorly and inconsistently in the bluephage method the presence of plasmids from e coli in cb16 and the overexpression of uida which is not found in salmonella can increase fitness costs resulting in a delayed growth of the host strain while this is not critical for the dal method it increases the time required for bluephage detection the quantitative and scaling analysis also indicated an efficient performance for cb14 but not for cb16 as a detection method needs to adapt to a range of volumes and parameters in accordance with safety guidelines cb14 is more suitable than cb16 as a host strain for bluephage assays the absence of shaking and a longer incubation time were found to improve the sensitivity of strain hsin terms of pfu detection figs 5 and 6 static incubation might increase phage yields by preventing the shear of f pili which are required for f specific phage infection wetzel 1999 m p garcillan barcia personal communication the use of a host strain grown to the late exponential growth phase could promote detection due to improved phage attachment to the pili and dna injection accordingly better conjugation rates have been reported after using cultures at the late exponential growth phase compared with early cultures lampkowska et al 2008 increasing the incubation time apparently had no influence on phage recovery by the s enterica strains which did not show a significant increase in pfu counts in the case of wg49 this could be explained by the expression of an e coli plasmid in the strain and the differences in growth rates of salmonella compared with e coli regarding its bluephage counterpart cb16 the aforementioned lack of consistency in performance could have masked differences in phage recovery in the modified conditions in any case the lower counts traditionally observed for e coli hs in comparison with s enterica wg49 jofre 2007 might be resolved by minor modifications in the incubation process rendering both strains equally suitable for f specific phage detection based on the results of the bluephage assays and the modifications of the incubation process it was concluded that strain cb14 is a good candidate for rapid phage detection not only did it perform better in the bluephage assays but its slightly lower detection rates pfu ml compared to cb16 were overcome by static incubation at 37 c for an additional 50 min before application for coliphage enumeration 5 conclusion the use of strains cb14 and cb16 in the bluephage method allowed the detection of f specific coliphages in under 5 h including the incubation of the host strain and phage detection which makes it possible to complete the analysis within a working day strain cb14 performed very similarly to the bluephage strain cb12 with improved sensitivity compared to other available methods while being specific only for phages that infect through the f pili the amount of coliphages detected by cb12 was significantly higher as it can detect both somatic and f specific coliphages so this strain is more suitable if a single host is needed for both analyses the bluephage method can be adapted to microplates and allows quantitative evaluation using the mpn technique using 3 replicates of 3 of each sample type and incubating with strain cb14 in the original proportions of btm medium for five hours it can also be adapted to the presence absence test for large sample volumes making it suitable for the implementation of future eu directives on drinking water static incubation of the host strain for an additional 50 min improved phage detection by strain e coli hs and its derivative bluephage strain these modifications could potentially help to further optimize the detection of f specific phages in the environment bluephage is the fastest available microbiological method using cultivable microorganisms to determine fecal pollution reported
