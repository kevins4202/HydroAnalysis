19665,sludge cell disruption was generally considered as the rate limiting step for the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was advanced oxidation processes and bio electro chemical systems were recently reported to enhance the hydrolysis of was and sludge cell disruption while the cell breaking processes of these systems remain unclear yet in this study an innovative bio electro fenton system was developed to pretreat the was sequentially with cathode fenton process and anode anaerobic digestion significant cell disruption and dissolution intracellular organics were founded after the treatment x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra indicated that gram negative bacteria were more sensitive to free radicals yielded in cathode to induce a chain reaction that destroyed the lipid contained outer membrane while gram positive bacteria with thick peptidoglycan layer were liable to be biologically decomposed in the anode compared with the oxidation of organic matters in the cathode fenton the secretion of enzyme increased in the anode which was beneficial to break down the complex matters peptidoglycans into simples that were available for anode oxidation by exoelectrogens the results also showed a possible prospect for the application of this sequential pretreatment in bio electro fenton systems to disrupt sludge cells and enhance the anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords anode anaerobic digestion hydroxyl radical cell wall peptidoglycan bio electro fenton bef system 1 introduction waste activated sludge was produced from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtps has consistently drawn attention due to its huge volume and potentially environmental risks kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 anaerobic digestion is a cost efficient method to produce biogas as energy from the disposition of waste sludge appels et al 2008 different from organic wastewater a long digestion time 20 30 d is required for anaerobic disposal of waste activated sludge and hydrolysis acidification of sludge or sludge cell disruption is commonly regarded as the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion david et al 2007 to improve sludge hydrolysis thermal chemical and microwave processes have been applied to pretreat sludge prior to anaerobic digestion zhen et al 2017 neumann et al 2017 han et al 2017 fenton process as an advanced oxidation technology can produce hydroxyl radicals that are effective for the cell disruption of microorganisms to release the intracellular materials and improve the subsequent anaerobic digestion pilli et al 2015 however fenton is currently far from the full scale sludge disposal in practical application due to tedious operating procedures and quite low ph reaction condition as well as costly and dangerous chemicals h2o2 required jiang et al 2016 li et al 2009 electro fenton capable of in situ h2o2 generation from cathodic catalysis of oxygen reduction under a given potential may overcome most drawbacks above sopaj et al 2016 özcan et al 2017 with an appropriate heterogeneous catalyst electro fenton can evenly proceed under a neutral ph bio electro fenton bef is a combination of microbial electrolysis cell mec and electro fenton in which electricity is generated through the microbial decomposition of organic matters in the anode to drive a fenton reaction in the cathode ki et al 2017 li et al 2017 wang and wang 2017 recently it was reported that the anode of a mec was capable of disintegrating sludge flocs and cell walls zhao et al founded that sludge hydrolysis was significantly enhanced via anodic oxidation in a single chamber mec and extra 28 ch4 yield was obtained after 24 days experiments zhao et al 2016a b however up to now sludge pretreatment by bef has been rarely reported and the mechanisms of the sludge decomposition enhanced by anodic treatment of mec remain unclear yet ki et al 2017 li et al 2017 if waste sludge is fed into the anode of a bef the sludge decomposition through the anodic oxidation will simultaneously serve as energy supplier or electron donor for the cathodic o2 reduction thus cathode anode sequential pretreatment of the sludge in a dual chamber bef system is expected to further improve the sludge decomposition in this study an innovative bef system was developed to pretreat was was firstly treated in the cathode of the bef and then was transferred to the anode to run as electron donor for the cathodic reaction and to get further treated the sludge in the cathode and or anode was compared to investigate the differences in sludge disintegration and anaerobic digestion soluble organics release and sludge structure changes were determined to further reveal the destruction

fluorescence response pi n was the same as the reported study guo et al 2014 the eem spectra were able to display biodegradable and non biodegradable components distribution in dom among the five regions tyrosine like protein and soluble microbial by product like substances were thought of as biodegradable materials tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were regarded as non biodegradable materials jia et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of soluble protein polysaccharide and cod after the treatment protein and polysaccharide two main organic components of waste activated sludge contribute to a majority of cod soluble protein polysaccharide and cod were used to assess the disintegration of sludge flocs and cell walls as shown in fig 2 after the pretreatment the soluble protein of the original sludge os cathode treated sludge cs anode treated sludge as and cathode anode treated sludge cas were 352 5 74 3 493 8 33 0 222 9 45 4 and 435 5 27 8 mg l respectively as compared with the initial raw sludge the soluble protein increased by 70 0 for cs 36 8 for as and 23 6 for cas respectively the soluble polysaccharide of the os cs as and cas were 284 15 20 7 mg l 724 4 47 4 mg l 318 1 21 7 mg l and 436 0 22 9 mg l respectively compared with the os the soluble polysaccharide of three reactors increased by 154 9 for cs 11 9 for as and 53 4 for cas respectively the soluble cod of the os cs as and cas were 3878 0 181 8 mg l 5468 0 385 8 mg l 4881 0 545 5 mg l and 5508 315 mg l respectively as compared with the os the soluble cod of three reactors increased by 41 0 for cs 25 8 for as and 42 0 for cas respectively the soluble protein soluble polysaccharide and soluble cod increased after the treatment except for the soluble protein of as it generally indicated that both cathode and anode promoted the hydrolysis of sludge the decrease of the soluble protein in the anode chamber suggested a faster utilization of soluble proteins with anaerobic bacteria in the anode to evaluate the contribution of cell disintegration in the increased soluble cod level pure bacterial cultures of rhodococcus and pseudomonas were treated in the bef system the results are shown in fig s2 after the treatment the soluble cod of the control group cathode treated group anode treated group and cathode anode treated group were 77 3 0 7 130 1 3 8 181 4 3 8 and 252 1 0 8 mg l respectively as compared with the control group the soluble cod increased by 68 2 for cathode treated group 134 6 for anode treated group and 226 1 for cathode anode treated group respectively compared with the sludge the treatment for pure bacterial culture showed a more significant increase in soluble cod level which indicated that the cell disruption made the large contribution for the increase of soluble cod level in the treatment the soluble cod of cathode treated group showed a lower increase than the anode treated group in the treatment of pure bacterial culture which might be attributed to the nonselective oxidation of hydroxyl radicals the results showed that cell disruption was an important process to release organic matters proteins and polysaccharides available for the consequent digestion 3 2 topography of the sludge from sem images the cells of the os showed an intact spherical cellular structure while the cell surface of the cathode and anode sludge appeared a big hole it indicated the cells of sludge were broken to release soluble organic matters song et al 2010 when the cs was transferred to anode anaerobic bacteria in the anode prioritized to oxide the released organic matters that was formed in the cathode which caused the collapse of the cells in the cas fig 3 7 and fig 3 8 except the hole the cell surface of anode sludge seemed smooth comparatively pits were widespread on the cell surface of cathode sludge which might be due to the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals it indicated that the different profiles of broken cells were associated with the different processes in the cathode and anode treatment 3 3 interactions of sludge construction to further explore the changes in functional groups caused by the pretreatment the ftir spectra of sludge of the control reactor os cathode reactor cs anode reactor as and cathode anode reactor cas are illustrated in fig 4 the main absorption wave around 3300 cm 1 was the tensile vibration o h in the carboxyl group and the n h in amine representing proteins peptides sugars and alcohols the cas cs and as had weaker absorption peaks than the os which implied that most of large molecule matters had been decomposed or converted into simple ones absorption bands of p o p o stretching at 1164 cm 1 p oh stretching at 941 cm 1 p o c stretching at 1047 cm 1 and amine groups c o stretching amides at 1658 cm 1 n h deformation and c n stretching in co nh at 1537 cm 1 represented phospholipids and amino acids that constitute the microbial cell walls the decreases of these characteristic absorption bands of in cas cs and as indicated the destruction of cell walls which was in agreement with the sem morphologies of the sludge 3 4 gram stain microscopy for the sludge a gram strain test showed fig 5 that the majority of bacteria of the was gram negative it is well known that gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria have different structures in the envelopes of the cells flores et al 2012 huang et al 2012 the cell envelopes of gram negative bacteria are composed of three layers the inner membrane described as classical phospholipid bilayer the periplasm viscous compartment that contains a thin layer of peptidoglycan and the outer membrane composed of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides ruiz et al 2003 arts et al 2015 john et al 1990 goemans et al 2014 oh was reportedly capable of inducing a free radical chain reaction with phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides to forward a continual lipid peroxidation and protein aberration in the cell surface leading to a large scale cleavage of the cell walls jr et al 1985 comparatively the cell envelopes of gram positive bacteria contained a thick layer of peptidoglycan that was reported as an oh remover with high resistance toward peroxidation kiwi and nadtochenko 2005b park et al 2015 the peptidoglycans on the surface of cells could react with oh and prevent the inner cell structures from being destroyed by the oh and then gram positive bacteria had relatively high resistance to oh due to the protection of its thick peptidoglycan layer the different behaviors of gram negative and gram positive bacteria under oh exposure might cause the different properties of breaking sludge cell walls during the cathode and anode treatment 3 5 changes of the lysozyme concentration with anode treatment anode oxidation participated in the sludge decomposition but insoluble and complicated structure might not be directly used as substrates of anode oxide unless they were converted to simples kokko et al 2016 although the cell envelopes of the gram negative bacteria or gram positive bacteria are composed of complex macromolecules significant cell disruption occurred after the anode treatment to investigate the reason for the accelerated hydrolysis of the macromolecules in the anode the concentration of lysozyme that is a specific enzyme to break the bond of peptidoglycan was detected in anode treated sludge at the beginning and end of the anode treatment as shown in fig 6 the lysozyme concentration decreased both in control group and the anode treated sludge as the digestion progressed indicating the secretion of lysozyme was insufficient compared with the consumption of lysozyme within the breaking process of sludge cell walls while after 24 h treatment the lysozyme concentration decreased significantly in control group while the lysozyme concentration maintained a higher level after the anode treatment it suggested that the secretion of lysozyme had been enhanced in the anode digestion and the higher enzyme concentration could decompose the macromolecules which was beneficial for the anode oxidation to accelerate the sludge hydrolysis 3 6 xps analysis to better understand the structure changes of the sludge before and after treatment the high resolution xps spectra of the os cs as and cas were measured the results of xps spectra analysis for c n o and p elements on the surface of the original sludge are displayed in fig 7 the atomic abundance of c n o p of the os cs as and cas is shown in table 2 the regions of c 1s fig 7 1 and o 1s fig 7 2 for the os indicated the main c containing and o containing species the peaks at 284 80 ev c1 and 531 2 ev o1 were resulted from the o c o bond of the carboxyl saad et al 2011 vinnichenko et al 2002 as shown in table 2 the binding area of c1 and o1 increased in the cs as and cas which suggested that sludge decomposition had been enhanced to increase carboxyl generation the peak at 286 15 ev c2 was attributed to c making a single bond with o or n c o or c n respectively in amide functions of proteins and peptide chains sun et al 2014 xiao et al 1997 from table 2 compared with os the binding area of c2 of cs as and cas all decreased indicating that the degradation of the main c n contained structures peptide chain and proteins had been enhanced after the treatment in the cathode or and anode the peak at 532 0 ev o2 was attributed to the two oxygen atoms bound to phosphorus p o and p o in phospholipids sun et al 2014 rouxhet et al 2008 which showed a decrease in the cs as and cas suggesting that the lipid bilayer of membrane of cells had been destructed after the treatment the peak at 134 1 ev p1 was attributed to the c o po3 groups in polyphosphates and or phosphates rumble et al 2010 the binding area of which had a similar change as the binding area of o2 in the cs as and cas compared with the os the decrease of binding area of p1 in the as was more significant than that in the cs indicating that the breaking of c o po3 bond mainly occurred in the anode which might be attributed to the function of some hydrolases and the bond c o po3 was not the main reaction sites for radicals produced in the fenton process the breaking of the c o bond in the c po4 of the phospholipids was prior to occur in the anode due to microbial hydrolysis in which the secretion of some hydrolases might have been enhanced while the radicals were more likely to oxidize unsaturated fatty acids of phospholipid to break the cell walls in the cathode the peak at 402 40 n1 was attributed to h n c o the vital structure for the amino acid to form peptide chains and proteins rumble et al 2010 the binding area of n1 decreased in the as and cas suggesting the destruction of peptide bonds in peptidoglycans had been enhanced after the anodic or cathodic anodic the treatment the peak at 399 60 ev n2 was attributed to n c r bond which was a common structure in amino acid of peptidoglycan and proteins rumble et al 2010 the binding area of n2 presented the inverse results to that of n1 in the as and cas it meant that the peptidoglycans had been broken to release amino peptide fragments or free amino acid that had the n c r bond to aqueous phase which could be detectable by xps hydroxyl radicals generated in the cathode induced a chain reaction with lipid of outer membrane of the gram negative bacteria which destroyed the outer structure to make the inner peptidoglycans exposed as a result the binding area of n1 that was the indispensable structure of peptidoglycans increased in the cs from the analysis above the different changes of the functional groups of the sludge in the anode and cathode might be ascribed to the different cell wall structures of gram positive and gram negative bacteria the breaking processes of which were discrepant under the hydroxyl radical exposure unlike the chain reactions by hydroxyl radicals that caused large scale phospholipid oxidation in the cathode the breaking of the bond between organic groups in peptidoglycans or phospholipids was likely more effective in the anode indicating that the secretion of some enzymes hydrolase lysozyme had been enhanced and to decompose macromolecules to simples that can be utilized as the electron donors to promote anode oxidation which was account for the acceleration of sludge hydrolysis 3 7 differences of pure g and g strains treated by fenton process and anode digestion to further verify the distinct mechanism of fenton process and anode digestion in the breaking of cell walls rhodococcus and pseudomonas two pure strains have been treated by fenton process and anode treatment rhodococcus was characterized as the gram positive bacteria matera et al 2017 briganti 2010 while pseudomonas was characterized as the gram negative bacteria rodrigo troyano and sibila 2017 both of which were the typical microbial population in the aerobic activated sludge the source of was soler et al 2017 huang et al 2017 after the treatment the obtained bacterium suspensions were centrifuged and then dispersed in the ultrapure water to avoid the disruption of dissolving organic matters and the differential spectra in ftir were shown in fig 8 from fig 8 1 a decrease of amine groups in the rhodococcus g treated by fenton process was observed after the fenton process while the amine groups in the rhodococcus after the anode digestion increased considering that the thick peptidoglycan layer in gram positive bacteria was mainly composed of amino acids the decrease of amine groups after the fenton treatment indicated that oh induced deamination had occurred in the peptidoglycan to degrade amino acids in the anode enzymes secreted by anaerobes could effectively break the bonds in peptidoglycans rather than destroy the amino acids and after the hydrolysis of peptidoglycans peptide fragments or amino acids were released to the aqueous phase to be detected from fig 8 2 compared with the original reference ps ps the amine groups of the pseudomonas g increased after the fenton process while the anode digestion still showed an inverse result for the gram negative bacteria in the fenton process hydroxyl radicals firstly destroyed the outer lipopolysaccharide layer on the cell surface and then exposed the refractory peptidoglycan layer to increase the detectable amine groups during the anode treatment after small amount of superficial phospholipids and lipoproteins on the cell surface had been destroyed the thin peptidoglycan layer was exposed and then degraded with the enzymes in anaerobic digestion leading to the decrease of amine groups the results showed that hydroxyl radicals had the high efficiency in destroying the lipid contained outer membrane and the low efficiency in destroying the peptidoglycan layer while the enhanced secretion of enzymes in the anode could compose peptidoglycan layer efficiently the catalytic decomposition of the cell structures with enzymes was a significant procedure for the efficient promotion of cell disruption and anode oxidation 3 8 fluorescence eem spectra and fri technique assessment the cathode and anode pretreatment broke the polymeric network of the sludge to possibly release ending extracellular and possibly intracellular materials here dom that included organics molecules with fluorescence characteristic was measured by eem and fri analysis to reveal the variation of components after the pretreatment fig 9 shows the eem fluorescence spectra and percent fluorescence response pi n of dom after the pretreatment the highest contribution proportion of pi n in the os was 39 7 region iv soluble microbial by product and 26 4 region ii tryptophan like protein followed by region iii fulvic acid like substances of 12 1 region i tyrosine like protein of 11 1 region v humic acid like organics of 10 8 soluble microbial by products and tryptophan like proteins were the main compounds in dom compared with the os the fluorescence intensity increased significantly in the cs indicating that more dom was released after the fenton process in the cathode while the fluorescence intensity of the as and cas decreased which was attributed to the consumption of the dom during the anode digestion the pi n of region iv and region i reported as the biodegradable ingredients in the cs and as increased which suggested that the improvement of biodegradability was obtained after the treatment and the cas after the sequential pretreatment showed a further enhanced effect moreover the pi n of the tyrosine like and tryptophan like proteins decreased significantly in the cs indicating that amino acids might have been degraded by hydroxyl radicals during the cell interruption while the pi n of the tryptophan like proteins did not show significant change and the pi n of tyrosine like even showed a slight increase in the as which implied that anode anaerobic digestion was prior to hydrolyze proteins or peptidoglycans to release amino acids rather than degrade them the results matched well with previous results that fenton process preferred to degrade the proteins or peptidoglycans while the hydrolysis of the organics proteins or peptidoglycans with enzymes was an important process for anode digestion 3 9 methane production and energy balance ch4 is one of the end products in anaerobic digestion after the pretreatment the obtained sludge was digested in serum bottles to measure the methane production in the 27 days digestion process ch4 concentration in gas bags was measured every day fig 10 showed that the accumulative methane production of the os cs as and cas reached 397 0506 7 467 9 and 523 6 ml respectively fig 10 as compared with the pretreatment free os the accumulative methane production of the cs as and cas increased by 27 6 17 9 and 31 9 these results suggested that the pretreatment of electro fenton and anode digestion could enhance anaerobic methanogenesis i t curve is showed in fig s3 with 0 358 v of the voltage supply between the two electrodes the average current is 2 83 10 4 a the currency further confirmed that the combination of the anode oxidation of sludge and cathode fenton had occurred under this currency the energy consumption for 48 h calculated was 17 46 j which was much only 0 34 of the energy equivalent from the increased methane production moreover the potential of anode was 0 392 v which is profitable circumstance for the biosis of bacteria in anode chamber and might enhance the secretion of the specific enzymes 3 10 significance of this study the increase of soluble organics and obvious destruction of the cell walls were observed after the sludge pretreatment in the cathode anode and the combination of cathode and anode of a bef in agreement with previous reports the treatment in the anode and the fenton process could accelerate sludge hydrolysis via breaking cell walls of sludge compared with the energy consumption of the bef system the energy recovery of methane production was more substantial the discrepancies founded in the sludge treated by cathode and anode process was attributed to different envelope structures of the gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria in the was for gram negative cells massive lipid concluded organic matters such as phospholipids lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides accounted for a substantial percentage of the envelopes of the cells and the free radical chain reaction caused by oh could lead to the large scale lipid peroxidation and protein aberration in the gram negative cell walls fig 11 1 while for the gram positive bacteria peptidoglycan that reported as a oh remover was a dominating component of the cell wall therefore it is not cost effective only using fenton process to destroy the peptidoglycans comparatively the digestion in the anode showed the effective destruction of peptidoglycans fig 11 2 the secretion of lysozyme was enhanced to accelerate the hydrolysis of macromolecules which was beneficial for further anode oxidation the enhanced secretion of enzymes in the anode might be related to the relief of feedback repression by the end products and the information transfer between exoelectrogens and acidification bacteria by cytochromes nanowires soluble redox active molecules or ion channel mediated electrochemical signaling relay liu et al 2017 lee et al 2017 the sequential pretreatment could firstly destroy the lipid of the gram negative bacteria with oh in cathode and then further destructed the thin peptidoglycan layer of the gram negative bacteria or the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram positive bacteria in anode meanwhile sludge treated in the anode simultaneously served as electron donor to continuously drive cathode reaction 4 conclusion in this study significant cell disruption in municipal sludge was obtained with a sequential pretreatment in a bio electro fenton system and the mechanism of the cell breaking of gram positive and gram negative bacteria was investigated with fenton process and anode digestion the results showed that hydroxyl radicals have high efficiency in the composition of lipid contained membrane with the induced radical chain reaction while the anode was more efficient in the destruction of the macromolecules with

19665,sludge cell disruption was generally considered as the rate limiting step for the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was advanced oxidation processes and bio electro chemical systems were recently reported to enhance the hydrolysis of was and sludge cell disruption while the cell breaking processes of these systems remain unclear yet in this study an innovative bio electro fenton system was developed to pretreat the was sequentially with cathode fenton process and anode anaerobic digestion significant cell disruption and dissolution intracellular organics were founded after the treatment x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra indicated that gram negative bacteria were more sensitive to free radicals yielded in cathode to induce a chain reaction that destroyed the lipid contained outer membrane while gram positive bacteria with thick peptidoglycan layer were liable to be biologically decomposed in the anode compared with the oxidation of organic matters in the cathode fenton the secretion of enzyme increased in the anode which was beneficial to break down the complex matters peptidoglycans into simples that were available for anode oxidation by exoelectrogens the results also showed a possible prospect for the application of this sequential pretreatment in bio electro fenton systems to disrupt sludge cells and enhance the anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords anode anaerobic digestion hydroxyl radical cell wall peptidoglycan bio electro fenton bef system 1 introduction waste activated sludge was produced from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtps has consistently drawn attention due to its huge volume and potentially environmental risks kelessidis and stasinakis 2012 anaerobic digestion is a cost efficient method to produce biogas as energy from the disposition of waste sludge appels et al 2008 different from organic wastewater a long digestion time 20 30 d is required for anaerobic disposal of waste activated sludge and hydrolysis acidification of sludge or sludge cell disruption is commonly regarded as the rate limiting step of anaerobic digestion david et al 2007 to improve sludge hydrolysis thermal chemical and microwave processes have been applied to pretreat sludge prior to anaerobic digestion zhen et al 2017 neumann et al 2017 han et al 2017 fenton process as an advanced oxidation technology can produce hydroxyl radicals that are effective for the cell disruption of microorganisms to release the intracellular materials and improve the subsequent anaerobic digestion pilli et al 2015 however fenton is currently far from the full scale sludge disposal in practical application due to tedious operating procedures and quite low ph reaction condition as well as costly and dangerous chemicals h2o2 required jiang et al 2016 li et al 2009 electro fenton capable of in situ h2o2 generation from cathodic catalysis of oxygen reduction under a given potential may overcome most drawbacks above sopaj et al 2016 özcan et al 2017 with an appropriate heterogeneous catalyst electro fenton can evenly proceed under a neutral ph bio electro fenton bef is a combination of microbial electrolysis cell mec and electro fenton in which electricity is generated through the microbial decomposition of organic matters in the anode to drive a fenton reaction in the cathode ki et al 2017 li et al 2017 wang and wang 2017 recently it was reported that the anode of a mec was capable of disintegrating sludge flocs and cell walls zhao et al founded that sludge hydrolysis was significantly enhanced via anodic oxidation in a single chamber mec and extra 28 ch4 yield was obtained after 24 days experiments zhao et al 2016a b however up to now sludge pretreatment by bef has been rarely reported and the mechanisms of the sludge decomposition enhanced by anodic treatment of mec remain unclear yet ki et al 2017 li et al 2017 if waste sludge is fed into the anode of a bef the sludge decomposition through the anodic oxidation will simultaneously serve as energy supplier or electron donor for the cathodic o2 reduction thus cathode anode sequential pretreatment of the sludge in a dual chamber bef system is expected to further improve the sludge decomposition in this study an innovative bef system was developed to pretreat was was firstly treated in the cathode of the bef and then was transferred to the anode to run as electron donor for the cathodic reaction and to get further treated the sludge in the cathode and or anode was compared to investigate the differences in sludge disintegration and anaerobic digestion soluble organics release and sludge structure changes were determined to further reveal the destruction

method yuan and shiller 1999 to optimize cathode potential a methylene blue solution was used as catholyte and the electrode was imposed with a series of potential from 0 60 v to 0 85 v for 2 h and the highest degradation efficiency of methylene blue was 56 4 at a cathode potential of 0 75 v to detect h2o2 production under this cathode potential and avoid the consumption of h2o2 with the catalysis of fe2 moo4 3 a fe2 moo4 3 free electrode was placed into a 0 5 m na2so4 solution for 2 h to detect h2o2 it was determined that the h2o2 production was 103 25 mg l at 0 75 v thus the

fluorescence response pi n was the same as the reported study guo et al 2014 the eem spectra were able to display biodegradable and non biodegradable components distribution in dom among the five regions tyrosine like protein and soluble microbial by product like substances were thought of as biodegradable materials tryptophan like fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were regarded as non biodegradable materials jia et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of soluble protein polysaccharide and cod after the treatment protein and polysaccharide two main organic components of waste activated sludge contribute to a majority of cod soluble protein polysaccharide and cod were used to assess the disintegration of sludge flocs and cell walls as shown in fig 2 after the pretreatment the soluble protein of the original sludge os cathode treated sludge cs anode treated sludge as and cathode anode treated sludge cas were 352 5 74 3 493 8 33 0 222 9 45 4 and 435 5 27 8 mg l respectively as compared with the initial raw sludge the soluble protein increased by 70 0 for cs 36 8 for as and 23 6 for cas respectively the soluble polysaccharide of the os cs as and cas were 284 15 20 7 mg l 724 4 47 4 mg l 318 1 21 7 mg l and 436 0 22 9 mg l respectively compared with the os the soluble polysaccharide of three reactors increased by 154 9 for cs 11 9 for as and 53 4 for cas respectively the soluble cod of the os cs as and cas were 3878 0 181 8 mg l 5468 0 385 8 mg l 4881 0 545 5 mg l and 5508 315 mg l respectively as compared with the os the soluble cod of three reactors increased by 41 0 for cs 25 8 for as and 42 0 for cas respectively the soluble protein soluble polysaccharide and soluble cod increased after the treatment except for the soluble protein of as it generally indicated that both cathode and anode promoted the hydrolysis of sludge the decrease of the soluble protein in the anode chamber suggested a faster utilization of soluble proteins with anaerobic bacteria in the anode to evaluate the contribution of cell disintegration in the increased soluble cod level pure bacterial cultures of rhodococcus and pseudomonas were treated in the bef system the results are shown in fig s2 after the treatment the soluble cod of the control group cathode treated group anode treated group and cathode anode treated group were 77 3 0 7 130 1 3 8 181 4 3 8 and 252 1 0 8 mg l respectively as compared with the control group the soluble cod increased by 68 2 for cathode treated group 134 6 for anode treated group and 226 1 for cathode anode treated group respectively compared with the sludge the treatment for pure bacterial culture showed a more significant increase in soluble cod level which indicated that the cell disruption made the large contribution for the increase of soluble cod level in the treatment the soluble cod of cathode treated group showed a lower increase than the anode treated group in the treatment of pure bacterial culture which might be attributed to the nonselective oxidation of hydroxyl radicals the results showed that cell disruption was an important process to release organic matters proteins and polysaccharides available for the consequent digestion 3 2 topography of the sludge from sem images the cells of the os showed an intact spherical cellular structure while the cell surface of the cathode and anode sludge appeared a big hole it indicated the cells of sludge were broken to release soluble organic matters song et al 2010 when the cs was transferred to anode anaerobic bacteria in the anode prioritized to oxide the released organic matters that was formed in the cathode which caused the collapse of the cells in the cas fig 3 7 and fig 3 8 except the hole the cell surface of anode sludge seemed smooth comparatively pits were widespread on the cell surface of cathode sludge which might be due to the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals it indicated that the different profiles of broken cells were associated with the different processes in the cathode and anode treatment 3 3 interactions of sludge construction to further explore the changes in functional groups caused by the pretreatment the ftir spectra of sludge of the control reactor os cathode reactor cs anode reactor as and cathode anode reactor cas are illustrated in fig 4 the main absorption wave around 3300 cm 1 was the tensile vibration o h in the carboxyl group and the n h in amine representing proteins peptides sugars and alcohols the cas cs and as had weaker absorption peaks than the os which implied that most of large molecule matters had been decomposed or converted into simple ones absorption bands of p o p o stretching at 1164 cm 1 p oh stretching at 941 cm 1 p o c stretching at 1047 cm 1 and amine groups c o stretching amides at 1658 cm 1 n h deformation and c n stretching in co nh at 1537 cm 1 represented phospholipids and amino acids that constitute the microbial cell walls the decreases of these characteristic absorption bands of in cas cs and as indicated the destruction of cell walls which was in agreement with the sem morphologies of the sludge 3 4 gram stain microscopy for the sludge a gram strain test showed fig 5 that the majority of bacteria of the was gram negative it is well known that gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria have different structures in the envelopes of the cells flores et al 2012 huang et al 2012 the cell envelopes of gram negative bacteria are composed of three layers the inner membrane described as classical phospholipid bilayer the periplasm viscous compartment that contains a thin layer of peptidoglycan and the outer membrane composed of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides ruiz et al 2003 arts et al 2015 john et al 1990 goemans et al 2014 oh was reportedly capable of inducing a free radical chain reaction with phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides to forward a continual lipid peroxidation and protein aberration in the cell surface leading to a large scale cleavage of the cell walls jr et al 1985 comparatively the cell envelopes of gram positive bacteria contained a thick layer of peptidoglycan that was reported as an oh remover with high resistance toward peroxidation kiwi and nadtochenko 2005b park et al 2015 the peptidoglycans on the surface of cells could react with oh and prevent the inner cell structures from being destroyed by the oh and then gram positive bacteria had relatively high resistance to oh due to the protection of its thick peptidoglycan layer the different behaviors of gram negative and gram positive bacteria under oh exposure might cause the different properties of breaking sludge cell walls during the cathode and anode treatment 3 5 changes of the lysozyme concentration with anode treatment anode oxidation participated in the sludge decomposition but insoluble and complicated structure might not be directly used as substrates of anode oxide unless they were converted to simples kokko et al 2016 although the cell envelopes of the gram negative bacteria or gram positive bacteria are composed of complex macromolecules significant cell disruption occurred after the anode treatment to investigate the reason for the accelerated hydrolysis of the macromolecules in the anode the concentration of lysozyme that is a specific enzyme to break the bond of peptidoglycan was detected in anode treated sludge at the beginning and end of the anode treatment as shown in fig 6 the lysozyme concentration decreased both in control group and the anode treated sludge as the digestion progressed indicating the secretion of lysozyme was insufficient compared with the consumption of lysozyme within the breaking process of sludge cell walls while after 24 h treatment the lysozyme concentration decreased significantly in control group while the lysozyme concentration maintained a higher level after the anode treatment it suggested that the secretion of lysozyme had been enhanced in the anode digestion and the higher enzyme concentration could decompose the macromolecules which was beneficial for the anode oxidation to accelerate the sludge hydrolysis 3 6 xps analysis to better understand the structure changes of the sludge before and after treatment the high resolution xps spectra of the os cs as and cas were measured the results of xps spectra analysis for c n o and p elements on the surface of the original sludge are displayed in fig 7 the atomic abundance of c n o p of the os cs as and cas is shown in table 2 the regions of c 1s fig 7 1 and o 1s fig 7 2 for the os indicated the main c containing and o containing species the peaks at 284 80 ev c1 and 531 2 ev o1 were resulted from the o c o bond of the carboxyl saad et al 2011 vinnichenko et al 2002 as shown in table 2 the binding area of c1 and o1 increased in the cs as and cas which suggested that sludge decomposition had been enhanced to increase carboxyl generation the peak at 286 15 ev c2 was attributed to c making a single bond with o or n c o or c n respectively in amide functions of proteins and peptide chains sun et al 2014 xiao et al 1997 from table 2 compared with os the binding area of c2 of cs as and cas all decreased indicating that the degradation of the main c n contained structures peptide chain and proteins had been enhanced after the treatment in the cathode or and anode the peak at 532 0 ev o2 was attributed to the two oxygen atoms bound to phosphorus p o and p o in phospholipids sun et al 2014 rouxhet et al 2008 which showed a decrease in the cs as and cas suggesting that the lipid bilayer of membrane of cells had been destructed after the treatment the peak at 134 1 ev p1 was attributed to the c o po3 groups in polyphosphates and or phosphates rumble et al 2010 the binding area of which had a similar change as the binding area of o2 in the cs as and cas compared with the os the decrease of binding area of p1 in the as was more significant than that in the cs indicating that the breaking of c o po3 bond mainly occurred in the anode which might be attributed to the function of some hydrolases and the bond c o po3 was not the main reaction sites for radicals produced in the fenton process the breaking of the c o bond in the c po4 of the phospholipids was prior to occur in the anode due to microbial hydrolysis in which the secretion of some hydrolases might have been enhanced while the radicals were more likely to oxidize unsaturated fatty acids of phospholipid to break the cell walls in the cathode the peak at 402 40 n1 was attributed to h n c o the vital structure for the amino acid to form peptide chains and proteins rumble et al 2010 the binding area of n1 decreased in the as and cas suggesting the destruction of peptide bonds in peptidoglycans had been enhanced after the anodic or cathodic anodic the treatment the peak at 399 60 ev n2 was attributed to n c r bond which was a common structure in amino acid of peptidoglycan and proteins rumble et al 2010 the binding area of n2 presented the inverse results to that of n1 in the as and cas it meant that the peptidoglycans had been broken to release amino peptide fragments or free amino acid that had the n c r bond to aqueous phase which could be detectable by xps hydroxyl radicals generated in the cathode induced a chain reaction with lipid of outer membrane of the gram negative bacteria which destroyed the outer structure to make the inner peptidoglycans exposed as a result the binding area of n1 that was the indispensable structure of peptidoglycans increased in the cs from the analysis above the different changes of the functional groups of the sludge in the anode and cathode might be ascribed to the different cell wall structures of gram positive and gram negative bacteria the breaking processes of which were discrepant under the hydroxyl radical exposure unlike the chain reactions by hydroxyl radicals that caused large scale phospholipid oxidation in the cathode the breaking of the bond between organic groups in peptidoglycans or phospholipids was likely more effective in the anode indicating that the secretion of some enzymes hydrolase lysozyme had been enhanced and to decompose macromolecules to simples that can be utilized as the electron donors to promote anode oxidation which was account for the acceleration of sludge hydrolysis 3 7 differences of pure g and g strains treated by fenton process and anode digestion to further verify the distinct mechanism of fenton process and anode digestion in the breaking of cell walls rhodococcus and pseudomonas two pure strains have been treated by fenton process and anode treatment rhodococcus was characterized as the gram positive bacteria matera et al 2017 briganti 2010 while pseudomonas was characterized as the gram negative bacteria rodrigo troyano and sibila 2017 both of which were the typical microbial population in the aerobic activated sludge the source of was soler et al 2017 huang et al 2017 after the treatment the obtained bacterium suspensions were centrifuged and then dispersed in the ultrapure water to avoid the disruption of dissolving organic matters and the differential spectra in ftir were shown in fig 8 from fig 8 1 a decrease of amine groups in the rhodococcus g treated by fenton process was observed after the fenton process while the amine groups in the rhodococcus after the anode digestion increased considering that the thick peptidoglycan layer in gram positive bacteria was mainly composed of amino acids the decrease of amine groups after the fenton treatment indicated that oh induced deamination had occurred in the peptidoglycan to degrade amino acids in the anode enzymes secreted by anaerobes could effectively break the bonds in peptidoglycans rather than destroy the amino acids and after the hydrolysis of peptidoglycans peptide fragments or amino acids were released to the aqueous phase to be detected from fig 8 2 compared with the original reference ps ps the amine groups of the pseudomonas g increased after the fenton process while the anode digestion still showed an inverse result for the gram negative bacteria in the fenton process hydroxyl radicals firstly destroyed the outer lipopolysaccharide layer on the cell surface and then exposed the refractory peptidoglycan layer to increase the detectable amine groups during the anode treatment after small amount of superficial phospholipids and lipoproteins on the cell surface had been destroyed the thin peptidoglycan layer was exposed and then degraded with the enzymes in anaerobic digestion leading to the decrease of amine groups the results showed that hydroxyl radicals had the high efficiency in destroying the lipid contained outer membrane and the low efficiency in destroying the peptidoglycan layer while the enhanced secretion of enzymes in the anode could compose peptidoglycan layer efficiently the catalytic decomposition of the cell structures with enzymes was a significant procedure for the efficient promotion of cell disruption and anode oxidation 3 8 fluorescence eem spectra and fri technique assessment the cathode and anode pretreatment broke the polymeric network of the sludge to possibly release ending extracellular and possibly intracellular materials here dom that included organics molecules with fluorescence characteristic was measured by eem and fri analysis to reveal the variation of components after the pretreatment fig 9 shows the eem fluorescence spectra and percent fluorescence response pi n of dom after the pretreatment the highest contribution proportion of pi n in the os was 39 7 region iv soluble microbial by product and 26 4 region ii tryptophan like protein followed by region iii fulvic acid like substances of 12 1 region i tyrosine like protein of 11 1 region v humic acid like organics of 10 8 soluble microbial by products and tryptophan like proteins were the main compounds in dom compared with the os the fluorescence intensity increased significantly in the cs indicating that more dom was released after the fenton process in the cathode while the fluorescence intensity of the as and cas decreased which was attributed to the consumption of the dom during the anode digestion the pi n of region iv and region i reported as the biodegradable ingredients in the cs and as increased which suggested that the improvement of biodegradability was obtained after the treatment and the cas after the sequential pretreatment showed a further enhanced effect moreover the pi n of the tyrosine like and tryptophan like proteins decreased significantly in the cs indicating that amino acids might have been degraded by hydroxyl radicals during the cell interruption while the pi n of the tryptophan like proteins did not show significant change and the pi n of tyrosine like even showed a slight increase in the as which implied that anode anaerobic digestion was prior to hydrolyze proteins or peptidoglycans to release amino acids rather than degrade them the results matched well with previous results that fenton process preferred to degrade the proteins or peptidoglycans while the hydrolysis of the organics proteins or peptidoglycans with enzymes was an important process for anode digestion 3 9 methane production and energy balance ch4 is one of the end products in anaerobic digestion after the pretreatment the obtained sludge was digested in serum bottles to measure the methane production in the 27 days digestion process ch4 concentration in gas bags was measured every day fig 10 showed that the accumulative methane production of the os cs as and cas reached 397 0506 7 467 9 and 523 6 ml respectively fig 10 as compared with the pretreatment free os the accumulative methane production of the cs as and cas increased by 27 6 17 9 and 31 9 these results suggested that the pretreatment of electro fenton and anode digestion could enhance anaerobic methanogenesis i t curve is showed in fig s3 with 0 358 v of the voltage supply between the two electrodes the average current is 2 83 10 4 a the currency further confirmed that the combination of the anode oxidation of sludge and cathode fenton had occurred under this currency the energy consumption for 48 h calculated was 17 46 j which was much only 0 34 of the energy equivalent from the increased methane production moreover the potential of anode was 0 392 v which is profitable circumstance for the biosis of bacteria in anode chamber and might enhance the secretion of the specific enzymes 3 10 significance of this study the increase of soluble organics and obvious destruction of the cell walls were observed after the sludge pretreatment in the cathode anode and the combination of cathode and anode of a bef in agreement with previous reports the treatment in the anode and the fenton process could accelerate sludge hydrolysis via breaking cell walls of sludge compared with the energy consumption of the bef system the energy recovery of methane production was more substantial the discrepancies founded in the sludge treated by cathode and anode process was attributed to different envelope structures of the gram negative bacteria and gram positive bacteria in the was for gram negative cells massive lipid concluded organic matters such as phospholipids lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides accounted for a substantial percentage of the envelopes of the cells and the free radical chain reaction caused by oh could lead to the large scale lipid peroxidation and protein aberration in the gram negative cell walls fig 11 1 while for the gram positive bacteria peptidoglycan that reported as a oh remover was a dominating component of the cell wall therefore it is not cost effective only using fenton process to destroy the peptidoglycans comparatively the digestion in the anode showed the effective destruction of peptidoglycans fig 11 2 the secretion of lysozyme was enhanced to accelerate the hydrolysis of macromolecules which was beneficial for further anode oxidation the enhanced secretion of enzymes in the anode might be related to the relief of feedback repression by the end products and the information transfer between exoelectrogens and acidification bacteria by cytochromes nanowires soluble redox active molecules or ion channel mediated electrochemical signaling relay liu et al 2017 lee et al 2017 the sequential pretreatment could firstly destroy the lipid of the gram negative bacteria with oh in cathode and then further destructed the thin peptidoglycan layer of the gram negative bacteria or the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram positive bacteria in anode meanwhile sludge treated in the anode

19666,nutrient recovery performance utilising an electrodialysis ed process was quantified in a 30 cell pair pilot reactor with a 7 2 m2 effective membrane area utilising domestic anaerobic digester supernatant which had been passed through a centrifuge as a feed source centrate a concentrated product nh4 n 7100 300 mg l and k 2490 40 mg l could be achieved by concentrating nutrient ions from the centrate wastewater dilute feed stream to the product stream using the ed process the average total current efficiency for all major cations over the experimental period was 76 2 nh4 n transport 40 k transport 14 the electrode power consumption was 4 9 1 5 kwh kgn averaged across the three replicate trials this value is lower than competing technologies for nh4 n removal and production and far lower than previous ed lab trials demonstrating the importance of pilot testing no significant variation in starting flux densities and cell resistance voltage for subsequent replicate treatments indicated effective cleaning procedures and operational sustainability at treatment durations of several days this study demonstrates that ed is an economically promising technology for the recovery of nutrients from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords potassium ammonia electrodialysis nutrient recovery struvite 1 introduction the depletion of natural resources and increasing fertilizer prices due to either increased demand energy costs or resource limitations has increased pressure to develop new processes for enhanced resource recovery xie et al 2016 according to batstone et al 2015 and mehta et al 2016 a substantial fraction of global macronutrient requirements such as po4 p k and nh4 n could be recovered from existing waste streams such as municipal wastewater treatment effluents electrodialysis ed is an emerging electrochemical membrane process capable of concentrating and separating ions from wastewater zhang et al 2009 morantes et al 2011 thompson brewster et al 2016 2017a ed processes utilize an alternating series of cation exchange membranes cems and anion exchange membranes aems placed between the terminal anode and cathode applied current generates an internal potential gradient used to concentrate or dilute ions from an aqueous solution through ion migration thompson brewster et al 2016 traditional ed has been utilised in applications such as brackish water desalination table salt production and industrial process water demineralization strathmann 2010 more recently emergent ed applications aim to concentrate nutrients from waste streams ippersiel et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 ledezma et al 2015 including prefermented hydrolysed sludge tao et al 2016 laboratory scale ed has demonstrated the potential of nutrient recovery from wastewater sources for example pronk et al 2006 utilised laboratory scale ed to concentrate nh4 n and po4 p by a factor of 3 2 14 000 mg l nh4 n 600 mg l po4 p in continuous ed experiments with current efficiencies between 38 and 50 mondor et al 2008 and ippersiel et al 2012 used electrodialysis to concentrate nh4 n to 14 25 g l and 21 35 g l from swine manure with a batch ed process respectively ed for nh4 n and k recovery from domestic anaerobic digester supernatant the liquid reject stream from centrifuges is a relatively new application and the limits of nutrient concentration for this wastewater stream have not been evaluated thus far mehta et al 2015 thompson brewster et al 2017a and the use of synthetic wastewaters does not achieve proof of concept for real wastewaters previous laboratory scale experimental work has been undertaken utilising ed coupled with po4 p recovery utilising a crystallization precipitation process wang et al 2015 tran et al 2014 for example wang et al 2015 utilised ed for the simultaneous recovery of nh4 n and po4 p from synthetic wastewater coupled with a struvite reactor removal ratios of 96 100 for nh4 n and 86 94 for po4 p were obtained with this integrated ed and struvite crystallization process a similar integrated nutrient recovery approach to separate and recover phosphate as capo4 was investigated by tran et al 2014 another benefit of coupled crystallization ed nutrient recovery is a reduction in membrane scaling thompson brewster et al 2017a xie et al 2016 membrane scaling in ed increases the cell resistance decreases ion migration and selectivity and can eventually cause irreversible membrane scaling xie et al 2016 mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 according to thompson brewster et al 2017a the scaling of ed membranes in wastewater treatment can be reduced by more than 50 by applying struvite crystallization pre treatment to the centrate although studies have demonstrated ed as a suitable technology for resource recovery from wastewater no work has been reported in scientific literature at a larger pilot scale this is critical as power efficiency in particular is highly dependent on large numbers of internal cells to utilize current effectively which requires larger ed systems a dominant aspect driving the practical feasibility of ed technologies is power consumption different nh4 n removal and recovery technologies have a large variation in energy requirements power consumption for the removal of nh4 n by conventional sludge based nitrification and denitrification treatment processes ranges from approximately 6 18 13 6 kwh kg nh4 n treated xie et al 2016 maurer et al 2003 schaubroeck et al 2015 the anammox treatment process is lower with estimates of 1 50 5 02 kwh kg nh4 n treated schaubroeck et al 2015 ed is more practical for nutrient removal at high concentrations than for full wastewater treatment but recovered nitrogen is a valuable product and nitrogen removal from centrate reduces overall plant load the recovery and concentration of nh4 n by other technologies such as nh4 n stripping with air and acid absorption for nh4 2so4 production uses 25 kwh kg nh4 n maurer et al 2003 commercial n production fixing nh3 from atmospheric nitrogen haber bosch process dominant for nitrogen manufacturing ranges from 10 3 kwh kg utilising natural gas to 12 5 kwh kg nh4 n using oil maurer et al 2003 energy consumption below 10 kwh kg nh4 n is necessary for ed to compete as a potential alternative for the haber bosch process though recovery from wastewater also offsets treatment energy costs the recovery of nh4 n by ed has been estimated to be 18 05 kwh kg nh4 n by ippersiel et al 2012 well above the required threshold levels the current work applies electrodialysis pilot scale to identify whether the process can economically compete with both existing nitrogen treatment technologies and as an alternative for nitrogen production via the haber bosch process this work will also quantify the maximum nh4 n product concentration achievable utilising the ed processes and aims to validate previous results in lab that struvite crystallization as a pretreatment for ed can be a viable technology to control ed membrane scaling 2 methods 2 1 centrate wastewater and struvite pre treatment feed water for this experiment consisted of centrate at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the chemical analysis of the feed water used in this experiment is shown in table 1 the centrate was pre treated by a struvite crystallizer system to precipitate phosphorus as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for struvite crystallization magnesium sulphate mgso4 was used as mg source dosed at a molar ratio of 1 1 mg p and sodium hydroxide naoh to maintain ph at 8 5 the struvite crystallizer was operated onsite and 60 p removal was observed as shown in table 1 post crystallised centrate hereafter referred as ed dilute feed was gravity fed from the overflow to a 200l dilute feed inlet tank for the ed cell system 2 2 pilot ed cell configuration a 30 cell pair pilot scale ed unit was utilised for this experimental

the initial volume of the concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solution recirculation loops was 47 5 l 25 l in reservoir and 22 5 l in ed cell and 183 l respectively concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solutions recirculated continuously from the reservoir multi pass while the feed was single pass for each replicate 5400l of dilute feed was treated over the 72 h the return flow of the electrolyte rinse solution and concentrate product solutions provided mixing within the respective reservoirs 0 05 m h2so4 was used as electrolyte rinse solution with an initial electrical conductivity of 10 ms cm2 the conductivity of the electrolyte rinse solution was maintained at 10 ms cm2 during the experimental period by dosing 3 6 m h2so4 solution from a reservoir using a peristaltic pump controlled by the plc a potentiostat 100 v 100 a rectifiers australia was used to supply a constant current of 2 5 a 20 a m2 the optimal current density was identified by undertaken limiting current density plots to determine a suitable current density see section 2 5 and 3 1 the ed cell was cleaned with 60 l of 0 5 naocl solution and 60 l of 1 hcl solution after each replicate run at the end of each replicate the cell was drained and alkaline naocl cleaning solution was recirculating through the cell for approximately two hours the cell was drained again after alkaline cleaning and flushed with water before acid cleaning to remove all residual alkaline cleaning solution from the system and prevent ph neutralization in the acid cleaning stage a 1 hcl solution initial ph 1 was recirculated through the cell overnight and the ed cell was drained after cleaning before starting the next replicate run 2 3 sampling and analysis sampling was undertaken 4 times during the 72 h experimental period with one 50 ml sample aliquot taken from each of the four respective reservoirs sample aliquots were collected at time intervals of 0 24 48 and 72 h electrolyte rinse solution

density trials were undertaken to determine the ohmic region and associated current for the optimal operation of the ed cell the limiting current density i lim was established by plotting the slope of the current density a m 2 against the cell resistance v the initial limiting current trial was undertaken up to the 100 v maximum of the potentiostat to determine the ohmic region the voltage on the potentiostat was increased in 500 ma increments to the maximum output voltage of 100 v while maintaining the amperage chronoamperometrically across the ed cell the experimental duration of each tested current density was 1 5 hydraulic retention times 27 min hrt of the ed cell post struvite centrate feed water was utilised in all current voltage experiments and was used for both the dilute feed and concentrate product streams the fluids were not recirculated it was a single pass operation at a flow rate of 1 25 l h during this experimental period electrolyte rinse solution was fed at the same flow rate as the dilute feed and concentrate product the electrolyte rinse solution was also discarded once it had passed through the ed cell maintaining standardised electrical conductivity conditions to determine the final i lim the two slopes belonging to the ohmic and the plateau region were plotted and the bisection point determined kroll et al 1999 2 5 molar ionic flux density the molar ionic flux density j i across the cation exchange membranes was determined for nh4 n na k and mg at the 24 48 and 72 h experimental times by the molar concentration in the feed minus the molar concentration of the dilute stream out divided by total effective membrane area 3 6 m2 2 6 current efficiency current efficiency ce is defined as the ratio of moles transferred of the target cation

of the major cations k mg na ca and nh4 n 3 results 3 1 limiting current density fig 1 shows the current density voltage results for the pilot scale ed unit operated in the range of 0 8 and 4 ma cm2 a linear increment in voltage was observed as the current density increased from 0 8 to 3 2 ma cm2 identified as ohmic region on fig 2 above 3 2 ma cm2 a sharp decline in slope was observed suggesting increased resistance due to concentration polarization or depletion of ions in the membrane boundary layer this region was identified as a plateau region as shown in fig 2 based on the slopes of the ohmic and the plateau regions 3 2 ma cm2 was estimated as a limiting current density i lim for the given operating conditions and reactor type the pilot scale ed reactor was operated at 2 ma cm2 for all other experimental work as 60 80 of the ohmic region prior to the limiting current density region is considered as ideal current density strathmann 2004 higher current densities were not possible due to the 100 v limitation of the potentiostat used to operate the pilot ed cell system and therefore the water splitting region of the over limiting current density was not reached strathmann 2010 3 2 concentration factor ec and ed cell parameters the electrical conductivity of the ed dilute feed reduced from 8 3 0 1 ms cm2 to 6 4 0 1 ms cm2 23 reduction over the single pass 95 confidence interval n 3 a total of 5400 l of feed in total was treated the initial electrical conductivity of the concentrate product was 7 7 0 6 ms cm2 and this increased to the final electrical conductivity of 59 4 ms cm2 fig 3 the average total amount of undiluted 18 m h2so4 used to maintain the electrolyte rinse solution ec over the experimental period was 470 20 ml this was sufficient to maintain the electrolyte rinse solution ec above 10 ms cm2 over the experimental duration for all three replicates cation concentrations increased over the experimental period of 72 h the maximum concentration of nh4 n and k achieved was 7100 800 mg l and 2500 100 mg l respectively however the rate of accumulation for all major cations started to decrease after 24 h and had plateaued at the 72 h experimental duration fig 4 shows the concentrations for na nh4 n k and po4 p over the experimental duration fig 5 shows the accumulated mass of concentrated cations over the experimental duration the icp fia ic total cod codtot and soluble cod codsol results for the concentrate stream is shown in table 2 the mean ph for the ed dilute feed was 8 75 0 04 while the concentrate product stream ph was 8 7 8 9 for the first 12 h then dropped to 8 4 8 6 for the remaining 48 h concentrate product ph data is provided in supplementary material 3 the ph of the post ed cell dilute stream leaving the ed cell also decreased over the experimental duration the final vfa concentrations achieved in the concentrate at the end of the experimental period were 10 mg l for acetic acid butyric acid valeric acid hexanoic acid and butanol respectively the final total suspended solids in the concentrate were 0 7 0 3 mg l 3 3 ed cell voltage fig 6 shows the time series voltage for the ed cell for each replicate voltage initially increased likely due to process polarization kroll et al 1999 following this potential reduced to a stable 20 30 v over the remainder of the experimental period the average current efficiency calculated at the start of the experimental period was 78 7 and reduced to 64 16 at the end of the 72 h experimental period 3 4 ed cell ionic flux density and current efficiency the overall average ionic flux density for the major ions in mol m2h was 0 3 0 2 nh4 0 17 0 14 na 0 0004 0 00018 mg 0 03 0 012 k 0 003 0 0031 ca 0 006 0 0019 po4 and 0 004 0 0061 so4 fig 7 shows the ionic flux density j i mol m2h for the 24 48 and 72 h individual sampling periods over the experimental period the flux density of all major cations appeared to decrease over the experimental period but further statistical analysis indicated no significant time trend p 0 05 this was by correlated analysis of variance ancova using the anovan command in matlab time as continuous variable replicate as categorical variable only phosphorous had a p of less than 0 1 p 0 08 for time and all others were greater than 0 25 the overall removal rates for the major cations was 23 21 19 8 19 17 and 5 for nh4 ca k mg na p and so4 respectively the experimental average total current efficiency for the experimental period was 76 2 nh4 n transport 40 k transport 14 the initial total current efficiency was 78 7 and decreased to 64 16 over the 72 h experimental duration this represents a 14 decrease in total current transport efficiency over the experimental period 3 5 concentrate volume ed cell inlet pressure for both the dilute feed stream and the concentrate product stream remained stable and did not increase over the experimental duration inlet pressure data from the concentrated product and dilute feed stream are shown in the supplementary material s1 the initial average volume of the concentrate product stream reservoir was 27l with concentrate volume increasing to 128 3 l at the end of the 72 h experimental period due to osmotic flux fig 8 shows the increase in product volume over the experimental duration 4 discussion the results demonstrate that a concentrated product suitable as fertilizer could be achieved by concentrating nutrient ions from the dilute feed stream to the concentrate product stream via the ed process the main negative in this application is the relatively high na concentrations which could be reduced through modified struvite precipitation which uses mgoh rather than naoh to raise ph this elimination would reduce na levels down to on the order of 2000 mg l which would make it suitable for use as liquid fertilizer in many applications but nh4 and k could be further separated and concentrated through processes such as stripping for nh4 or adsorption nh4 and k hedström 2001 guo et al 2018 it is noted that osmotic flux was constant while molar flux and conductivity reduction reduced during the experiments a reduction in the ionic molar flux and removal efficiency at high product concentrations has been previously reported rottiers et al 2014 identified back diffusion of ions from the concentrate to dilute stream due to a concentration gradient as a major limiting factor for ion concentration and efficiency in ed processes and the type of membranes only marginally influenced this thompson brewster et al 2017b suggested that limitations to high product concentrations may be due to increased back diffusion due to large concentration gradients and osmotic and electro osmotic water fluxes mondor et al 2008 reported the nh4 n concentration was partly limited by osmosis and the transfer of solvated ions from the dilute feed stream to the concentrate product stream and as the concentrate ionic strength increases solvated ion water transport decreases current efficiency and limits concentration extent this indicates an optimal operational period in batch mode and that in continuous mode a concentrate flush stream is needed to avoid excessive product ionic strength and conductivity a decrease in ionic molar flux density and transfer efficiency has also been highlighted by mondor et al 2009 where they identified membrane fouling and scaling as a major factor reducing efficiency of the ed process experimental results and modeling simulations by thompson brewster et al 2017a showed a significant reduction in precipitation formation when struvite pre treatment was applied to centrate feed water prior to the ed system a mass balance indicates a 29 loss of po4 p and a 92 loss of ca from the concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solution this loss of po4 p and ca indicates that precipitates formed within the cell the formation of these precipitants would have contributed to the increase in the voltage resistance across the ed cell however this voltage increase from the formation of precipitants is only temporary as the membrane flux densities clearly return to similar ranges after the cleaning process has been undertaken the inlet pressure did not change substantially indicating that flow pathways are not substantially restricted supplementary material s1 the overall mass balances for this experiment indicated a 28 total loss of nh4 n over the experiment a major part of this loss could be related to the volatilisation of nh4 n to the atmosphere this ammonia could be captured by pressurising the headspace or recovering headspace gas through an acid bath the alternative is to acidify the concentrate which may enhance cation recovery or use a more concentrated acid as electrolyte the average up concentration mg l of nh4 n achieved in this experimental work was 8 77 times and recovery is 23 3 this results compares to ranges reported by zhang et al 2013 and ippersiel et al 2012 who reported over 7 and 6 67 times nh4 n up concentration respectively these results are higher than results reported by pronk et al 2006 where an up concentration factor of 3 2 times was reported we note that 23 3 is a relatively low recovery compared with biological alternatives such as anammox but that a the cost of this removal is relatively low see comparative analysis below b a higher reduction can be achieved with longer retention times or multiple passes albeit at an increased cell potential due to decreased conductivity and c related to this a higher recovery will be achieved on more concentrated streams where electrodialysis becomes increasingly competitive water flux from the dilute to the concentrate was substantial with product volume increasing from 25 l to 125 l this large increase in concentrate product volume is due to the water transport caused by osmosis and electro osmosis solvation shells of water molecules transporting through membrane together with ions pronk et al 2006 robbins et al 1996 and rottiers et al 2014 also identified the water flux through the ed membranes as a major obstacle when ed is used as a concentration technology according to rottiers et al 2014 the water flux by electro osmosis in ed is far higher than by osmosis this is normal and the time stability of osmotic flux with increasing concentration in product indicates that the flux is mainly electro osmotic and not the main reason for the plateauing in cation fluxes which is likely more related to back diffusion water flux could be decreased by utilising concentrate product as electrolyte which would reduce the osmotic gradient between the product and the electrolyte however the electro osmotic transfer and the associated volume increase in the concentrate product can actually be beneficial harvesting could be achieved by removing further concentrate product once a specific volume and concentration had been reached this would enable continuous operation of the cell and would eliminate the need for batch wise replacement of concentrate the power consumption over the three replicates was 4 9 1 5 kwh kg nh4 n this does not include pumping energy which is fairly high in a pilot unit 5 kwh kg nh4 n due to the use of peristaltic pumps but given the relatively low diluent side pressure drop averaging 0 3 bar see supplementary info full scale pumping energy would be an order of magnitude lower than the electrochemical energy input on the order of 0 1 kwh m3 batstone et al 2015 in any case energy consumption is at the lower end of the reported energy requirement of 6 18 13 6 kwh kg nh4 n utilising current wastewater treatment technology activated sludge and aeration for nitrification xie et al 2016 maurer et al 2003 schaubroeck et al 2015 compared with side stream anammox ed is a competitive process achieving an equivalent energy consumption but with lower footprint hrt 0 3 h simpler in operation single stage process and without the difficulty in inhibition or start up where there is difficulty in obtaining seed sludge in addition it recovers the nitrogen rather than destroying it however ed is dependent on a relatively high solution electrical conductivity and as ions are recovered electrical conductivity drops this limits the recovery in this case 23 nh4 n per pass as well as placing a limit on ultimate recovery with increased voltage required at lower ammonia concentrations it is likely that anammox will be a more effective technology at lower ammonia concentrations 1000 mgn l 1 with ed becoming progressively more competitive above 1500 mgn l 1 when the calculated energy consumption reported in this study is compared with other nh4 n recovery technologies for example nh4 n stripping with air and nh4 2so4 and the commercial haber bosch process for n fertilizer production it is excluding pumping below 50 of the energy requirements per kg of nh4 n reported for current technologies this result demonstrates the ed process as a more energy efficient nh4 n recovery option and while it does not produce a highly concentrated product e g nh4 2so4 it is possible to directly use the product as liquid fertilizers the energy consumption for electrodialysis is acceptable and given the relatively low pressure drop pumping energy can be relatively low higher conductivity feeds i e more concentrated would further decrease energy consumption and improved membranes may provide additional efficiency gains but the essential feasibility is established key areas of future research include optimising removal extent and product recovery determining performance under longer term operation eliminating sodium and unwanted anions like chloride and further optimising energy consumption 5 conclusion development of a low cost technology to recover nitrogen from wastewater is crucial for economic and environmental benefit the feasibility of pilot scale electrodialysis ed for nutrient concentration and recovery from municipal wastewater was studied in this work the maximum achievable total nh4 n concentration measured experimentally was approximately 7100 800 g l which corresponded to a concentration factor of approximately 8 times mean current efficiency for ion transport was 76 2 the power consumption 4 9 1 5 kwh kg nh4 n is well under previous results and estimates for nutrient recovery by ed this makes the process economically competitive for nitrogen removal by advanced reactive technologies such as anammox and advantageous for nitrogen production vs

nh4 n removal and recovery technologies have a large variation in energy requirements power consumption for the removal of nh4 n by conventional sludge based nitrification and denitrification treatment processes ranges from approximately 6 18 13 6 kwh kg nh4 n treated xie et al 2016 maurer et al 2003 schaubroeck et al 2015 the anammox treatment process is lower with estimates of 1 50 5 02 kwh kg nh4 n treated schaubroeck et al 2015 ed is more practical for nutrient removal at high concentrations than for full wastewater treatment but recovered nitrogen is a valuable product and nitrogen removal from centrate reduces overall plant load the recovery and concentration of nh4 n by other technologies such as nh4 n stripping with air and acid absorption for nh4 2so4 production uses 25 kwh kg nh4 n maurer et al 2003 commercial n production fixing nh3 from atmospheric nitrogen haber bosch process dominant for nitrogen manufacturing ranges from 10 3 kwh kg utilising natural gas to 12 5 kwh kg nh4 n using oil maurer et al 2003 energy consumption below 10 kwh kg nh4 n is necessary for ed to compete as a potential alternative for the haber bosch process though recovery from wastewater also offsets treatment energy costs the recovery of nh4 n by ed has been estimated to be 18 05 kwh kg nh4 n by ippersiel et al 2012 well above the required threshold levels the current work applies electrodialysis pilot scale to identify whether the process can economically compete with both existing nitrogen treatment technologies and as an alternative for nitrogen production via the haber bosch process this work will also quantify the maximum nh4 n product concentration achievable utilising the ed processes and aims to validate previous results in lab that struvite crystallization as a pretreatment for ed can be a viable technology to control ed membrane scaling 2 methods 2 1 centrate wastewater and struvite pre treatment feed water for this experiment consisted of centrate at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant wwtp brisbane australia the chemical analysis of the feed water used in this experiment is shown in table 1 the centrate was pre treated by a struvite crystallizer system to precipitate phosphorus as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o for struvite crystallization magnesium sulphate mgso4 was used as mg source dosed at a molar ratio of 1 1 mg p and sodium hydroxide naoh to maintain ph at 8 5 the struvite crystallizer was operated onsite and 60 p removal was observed as shown in table 1 post crystallised centrate hereafter referred as ed dilute feed was gravity fed from the overflow to a 200l dilute feed inlet tank for the ed cell system 2 2 pilot ed cell configuration a 30 cell pair pilot scale ed unit was utilised for this experimental work supplied by abr process engineering brisbane australia the effective internal membrane area was 0 4 m 0 3 m 0 12 m2 per membrane 7 2 m2 total system membrane area thickness of the spacers was 6

electric cr67 and 30 aem membranes general electric ar204szra cem membranes were placed next to the cathode and anode chambers to minimise the transfer of chlorine ions into the electrode chambers ti ptiro2 electrodes 295 400 1 5 mm were used as the anode and cathode abr process engineering 200 l high density polyethylene tanks were used for the one pass dilute feed and recirculated electrolyte rinse solution and recirculated concentrate product stream a 100 l high density polyethylene tank was used to collect the post ed dilute stream from the ed cell for sampling purposes the post ed dilute stream outlet tank then overflowed to a sewer drain all reservoir tanks were covered but were vented to maintain atmospheric pressure a process logic controller crio 9066 compactrio controller national instruments and lab view software national instruments 2015 was employed to control operate and log operational data from the pilot ed cell system further detail of process logic controller

master flex easy load ii l s 36 pump head used to transport the concentrate product and dilute feed streams at a flow rate of 1250 ml min 75 l h pre treated centrate was used as initial concentrate the initial volume of the concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solution recirculation loops was 47 5 l 25 l in reservoir and 22 5 l in ed cell and 183 l respectively concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solutions recirculated continuously from the reservoir multi pass while the feed was single pass for each replicate 5400l of dilute feed was treated over the 72 h the return flow of the electrolyte rinse solution and concentrate product solutions provided mixing within the respective reservoirs 0 05 m h2so4 was used as electrolyte rinse solution with an initial electrical conductivity of 10 ms cm2 the conductivity of the electrolyte rinse solution was maintained at 10 ms cm2 during the experimental period by dosing 3 6 m h2so4 solution from a reservoir using a peristaltic pump controlled by the plc a potentiostat 100 v 100 a rectifiers australia was used to supply a constant current of 2 5 a 20 a m2 the optimal current density was identified by undertaken limiting current density plots to determine a suitable current density see section 2 5 and 3 1 the ed cell was cleaned with 60 l of 0 5 naocl solution and 60 l of 1 hcl solution after each replicate run at the end of each replicate the cell was drained and alkaline naocl cleaning solution was recirculating through the cell for approximately two hours the cell was drained again after alkaline cleaning and flushed with water before acid cleaning to remove all residual alkaline cleaning solution from the system and prevent ph neutralization in the acid cleaning stage a 1 hcl solution initial ph 1 was recirculated through the cell overnight and the ed cell was drained after cleaning before starting the next replicate run 2 3 sampling and analysis sampling was undertaken 4 times during the 72 h experimental period with one 50 ml sample aliquot taken from each of the four respective reservoirs sample aliquots were collected at time intervals of 0 24 48 and 72 h electrolyte rinse solution concentrate product and dilute feed sample aliquots were collected from the reservoir bulk solution and the post ed cell dilute stream sample was collected directly from ed cell outlet pipe all

product and electrolyte rinse solution were measured over the experimental period by ultrasonic level sensors echopod dl10 ocean controls flowline australia 2 4 current voltage curve limiting current density trials were undertaken to determine the ohmic region and associated current for the optimal operation of the ed cell the limiting current density i lim was established by plotting the slope of the current density a m 2 against the cell resistance v the initial limiting current trial was undertaken up to the 100 v maximum of the potentiostat to determine the ohmic region the voltage on the potentiostat was increased in 500 ma increments to the maximum output voltage of 100 v while maintaining the amperage chronoamperometrically across the ed cell the experimental duration of each tested current density was 1 5 hydraulic retention times 27 min hrt of the ed cell post struvite centrate feed water was utilised in all current voltage experiments and was used for both the dilute feed and concentrate product streams the fluids were not recirculated it was a single pass operation at a flow rate of 1 25 l h during this experimental period electrolyte rinse solution was fed at the same flow rate as the dilute feed and concentrate product the electrolyte rinse solution was also discarded once it had passed through the ed cell maintaining standardised electrical conductivity conditions to determine the final i lim the two slopes belonging to the ohmic and the plateau region were plotted and the bisection point determined kroll et al 1999 2 5 molar ionic flux density the molar ionic flux density j i across the cation exchange membranes was determined for nh4 n na k and mg at the 24 48 and 72 h experimental times by the molar concentration in the feed minus the molar concentration of the dilute stream out divided by total effective membrane area 3 6 m2 2 6 current efficiency current efficiency ce is defined as the ratio of moles transferred of the target cation

of the major cations k mg na ca and nh4 n 3 results 3 1 limiting current density fig 1 shows the current density voltage results for the pilot scale ed unit operated in the range of 0 8 and 4 ma cm2 a linear increment in voltage was observed as the current density increased from 0 8 to 3 2 ma cm2 identified as ohmic region on fig 2 above 3 2 ma cm2 a sharp decline in slope was observed suggesting increased resistance due to concentration polarization or depletion of ions in the membrane boundary layer this region was identified as a plateau region as shown in fig 2 based on the slopes of the ohmic and the plateau regions 3 2 ma cm2 was estimated as a limiting current density i lim for the given operating conditions and reactor type the pilot scale ed reactor was operated at 2 ma cm2 for all other experimental work as 60 80 of the ohmic region prior to the limiting current density region is considered as ideal current density strathmann 2004 higher current densities were not possible due to the 100 v limitation of the potentiostat used to operate the pilot ed cell system and therefore the water splitting region of the over limiting current density was not reached strathmann 2010 3 2 concentration factor ec and ed cell parameters the electrical conductivity of the ed dilute feed reduced from 8 3 0 1 ms cm2 to 6 4 0 1 ms cm2 23 reduction over the single pass 95 confidence interval n 3 a total of 5400 l of feed in total was treated the initial electrical conductivity of the concentrate product was 7 7 0 6 ms cm2 and this increased to the final electrical conductivity of 59 4 ms cm2 fig 3 the average total amount of undiluted 18 m h2so4 used to maintain the electrolyte rinse solution ec over the experimental period was 470 20 ml this was sufficient to maintain the electrolyte rinse solution ec above 10 ms cm2 over the experimental duration for all three replicates cation concentrations increased over the experimental period of 72 h the maximum concentration of nh4 n and k achieved was 7100 800 mg l and 2500 100 mg l respectively however the rate of accumulation for all major cations started to decrease after 24 h and had plateaued at the 72 h experimental duration fig 4 shows the concentrations for na nh4 n k and po4 p over the experimental duration fig 5 shows the accumulated mass of concentrated cations over the experimental duration the icp fia ic total cod codtot and soluble cod codsol results for the concentrate stream is shown in table 2 the mean ph for the ed dilute feed was 8 75 0 04 while the concentrate product stream ph was 8 7 8 9 for the first 12 h then dropped to 8 4 8 6 for the remaining 48 h concentrate product ph data is provided in supplementary material 3 the ph of the post ed cell dilute stream leaving the ed cell also decreased over the experimental duration the final vfa concentrations achieved in the concentrate at the end of the experimental period were 10 mg l for acetic acid butyric acid valeric acid hexanoic acid and butanol respectively the final total suspended solids in the concentrate were 0 7 0 3 mg l 3 3 ed cell voltage fig 6 shows the time series voltage for the ed cell for each replicate voltage initially increased likely due to process polarization kroll et al 1999 following this potential reduced to a stable 20 30 v over the remainder of the experimental period the average current efficiency calculated at the start of the experimental period was 78 7 and reduced to 64 16 at the end of the 72 h experimental period 3 4 ed cell ionic flux density and current efficiency the overall average ionic flux density for the major ions in mol m2h was 0 3 0 2 nh4 0 17 0 14 na 0 0004 0 00018 mg 0 03 0 012 k 0 003 0 0031 ca 0 006 0 0019 po4 and 0 004 0 0061 so4 fig 7 shows the ionic flux density j i mol m2h for the 24 48 and 72 h individual sampling periods over the experimental period the flux density of all major cations appeared to decrease over the experimental period but further statistical analysis indicated no significant time trend p 0 05 this was by correlated analysis of variance ancova using the anovan command in matlab time as continuous variable replicate as categorical variable only phosphorous had a p of less than 0 1 p 0 08 for time and all others were greater than 0 25 the overall removal rates for the major cations was 23 21 19 8 19 17 and 5 for nh4 ca k mg na p and so4 respectively the experimental average total current efficiency for the experimental period was 76 2 nh4 n transport 40 k transport 14 the initial total current efficiency was 78 7 and decreased to 64 16 over the 72 h experimental duration this represents a 14 decrease in total current transport efficiency over the experimental period 3 5 concentrate volume ed cell inlet pressure for both the dilute feed stream and the concentrate product stream remained stable and did not increase over the experimental duration inlet pressure data from the concentrated product and dilute feed stream are shown in the supplementary material s1 the initial average volume of the concentrate product stream reservoir was 27l with concentrate volume increasing to 128 3 l at the end of the 72 h experimental period due to osmotic flux fig 8 shows the increase in product volume over the experimental duration 4 discussion the results demonstrate that a concentrated product suitable as fertilizer could be achieved by concentrating nutrient ions from the dilute feed stream to the concentrate product stream via the ed process the main negative in this application is the relatively high na concentrations which could be reduced through modified struvite precipitation which uses mgoh rather than naoh to raise ph this elimination would reduce na levels down to on the order of 2000 mg l which would make it suitable for use as liquid fertilizer in many applications but nh4 and k could be further separated and concentrated through processes such as stripping for nh4 or adsorption nh4 and k hedström 2001 guo et al 2018 it is noted that osmotic flux was constant while molar flux and conductivity reduction reduced during the experiments a reduction in the ionic molar flux and removal efficiency at high product concentrations has been previously reported rottiers et al 2014 identified back diffusion of ions from the concentrate to dilute stream due to a concentration gradient as a major limiting factor for ion concentration and efficiency in ed processes and the type of membranes only marginally influenced this thompson brewster et al 2017b suggested that limitations to high product concentrations may be due to increased back diffusion due to large concentration gradients and osmotic and electro osmotic water fluxes mondor et al 2008 reported the nh4 n concentration was partly limited by osmosis and the transfer of solvated ions from the dilute feed stream to the concentrate product stream and as the concentrate ionic strength increases solvated ion water transport decreases current efficiency and limits concentration extent this indicates an optimal operational period in batch mode and that in continuous mode a concentrate flush stream is needed to avoid excessive product ionic strength and conductivity a decrease in ionic molar flux density and transfer efficiency has also been highlighted by mondor et al 2009 where they identified membrane fouling and scaling as a major factor reducing efficiency of the ed process experimental results and modeling simulations by thompson brewster et al 2017a showed a significant reduction in precipitation formation when struvite pre treatment was applied to centrate feed water prior to the ed system a mass balance indicates a 29 loss of po4 p and a 92 loss of ca from the concentrate product and electrolyte rinse solution this loss of po4 p and ca indicates that precipitates formed within the cell the formation of these precipitants would have contributed to the increase in the voltage resistance across the ed cell however this voltage increase from the formation of precipitants is only temporary as the membrane flux densities clearly return to similar ranges after the cleaning process has been undertaken the inlet pressure did not change substantially indicating that flow pathways are not substantially restricted supplementary material s1 the overall mass balances for this experiment indicated a 28 total loss of nh4 n over the experiment a major part of this loss could be related to the volatilisation of nh4 n to the atmosphere this ammonia could be captured by pressurising the headspace or recovering headspace gas through an acid bath the alternative is to acidify the concentrate which may enhance cation recovery or use a more concentrated acid as electrolyte the average up concentration mg l of nh4 n achieved in this experimental work was 8 77 times and recovery is 23 3 this results compares to ranges reported by zhang et al 2013 and ippersiel et al 2012 who reported over 7 and 6 67 times nh4 n up concentration respectively these results are higher than results reported by pronk et al 2006 where an up concentration factor of 3 2 times was reported we note that 23 3 is a relatively low recovery compared with biological alternatives such as anammox but that a the cost of this removal is relatively low see comparative analysis below b a higher reduction can be achieved with longer retention times or multiple passes albeit at an increased cell potential due to decreased conductivity and c related to this a higher recovery will be achieved on more concentrated streams where electrodialysis becomes increasingly competitive water flux from the dilute to the concentrate was substantial with product volume increasing from 25 l to 125 l this large increase in concentrate product volume is due to the water transport caused by osmosis and electro osmosis solvation shells of water molecules transporting through membrane together with ions pronk et al 2006 robbins et al 1996 and rottiers et al 2014 also identified the water flux through the ed membranes as a major obstacle when ed is used as a concentration technology according to rottiers et al 2014 the water flux by electro osmosis in ed is far higher than by osmosis this is normal and the time stability of osmotic flux with increasing concentration in product indicates that the flux is mainly electro osmotic and not the main reason for the plateauing in cation fluxes which is likely more related to back diffusion water flux could be decreased by utilising concentrate product as electrolyte which would reduce the osmotic gradient between the product and the electrolyte however the electro osmotic transfer and the associated volume increase in the concentrate product can actually be beneficial harvesting could be achieved by removing further concentrate product once a specific volume and concentration had been reached this would enable continuous operation of the cell and would eliminate the need for batch wise replacement of concentrate the power consumption over the three replicates was 4 9 1 5 kwh kg nh4 n this does not include pumping energy which is fairly high in a pilot unit 5 kwh kg nh4 n due to the use of peristaltic pumps but given the relatively low diluent side pressure drop averaging 0 3 bar see supplementary info full scale pumping energy would be an order of magnitude lower than the electrochemical energy input on the order of 0 1 kwh m3 batstone et al 2015 in any case energy consumption is at the lower end of the reported energy requirement of 6 18 13 6 kwh kg nh4 n utilising current wastewater treatment technology activated sludge and aeration for nitrification xie et al 2016 maurer et al 2003 schaubroeck et al 2015 compared with side stream anammox ed is a competitive process achieving an equivalent energy consumption but with lower footprint hrt 0 3 h simpler in operation single stage process and without the difficulty in inhibition or start up where there is difficulty in obtaining seed sludge in addition it recovers the nitrogen rather than destroying it however ed is dependent on a relatively high solution electrical conductivity and as ions are recovered electrical conductivity drops this limits the recovery in this case 23 nh4 n per pass as well as placing a limit on ultimate recovery with increased voltage required at lower ammonia concentrations it is likely that anammox will be a more effective technology at lower ammonia concentrations 1000 mgn l 1 with ed becoming progressively more competitive above 1500 mgn l 1 when the calculated energy consumption reported in this study is compared with other nh4 n recovery technologies for example nh4 n stripping with air and nh4 2so4 and the commercial haber bosch process for n fertilizer production it is excluding pumping below 50 of the energy requirements per kg of nh4 n reported for current technologies this result demonstrates the ed process as a more energy efficient nh4 n recovery option and while it does not produce a highly concentrated product e g nh4 2so4 it is possible to directly use the product as liquid fertilizers the energy consumption for electrodialysis is acceptable and given the relatively low pressure drop pumping energy can be relatively low higher conductivity feeds i e more concentrated would further decrease energy consumption and improved membranes may provide additional efficiency gains but the essential feasibility is established key areas of future research include optimising removal extent and product recovery determining performance under longer term operation eliminating sodium and unwanted anions like chloride and further optimising energy consumption 5 conclusion development of a low cost technology to recover nitrogen from wastewater is crucial for economic and environmental benefit the feasibility of pilot scale electrodialysis ed for nutrient concentration and recovery from municipal wastewater was studied in this work the maximum achievable total nh4 n concentration measured experimentally was approximately 7100 800 g l which corresponded to a concentration factor of approximately 8 times mean current efficiency for ion transport was 76 2 the power consumption 4 9 1 5 kwh kg nh4 n is well under previous results and estimates for nutrient recovery by ed this makes the process economically competitive for nitrogen removal by advanced reactive technologies such as anammox and advantageous for nitrogen production vs

19667,polyphenols are chemicals that primarily inhibit the growth of various autotrophic organisms the presence of these metabolites greatly boosts the ecological dominance of eg cladophora which creates large surface mats the main goal of our work was to quantify the phenol and polyphenols allelopathic substances secreted by the macroalgae as a result of exposure to biotic stress caused by competition the research was carried out on the cladophora glomerata biomass collected from two freshwater ecosystems located in wielkopolska region poland fig 1 oporzynskie lake n52 55 e 17 9 and nielba river n52 48 e 17 12 seasonal variability may october 2015 in the properties of c glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water in addition the content of pigments in the analyzed biomass was determined during the appearance of algae mats in water reservoirs biomass extraction was performed to determine the phenolic and carotenoid contents chlorophyll and carotenoids by using two extraction methods microwave assisted extraction mae and supercritical fluid extraction sfe after isolation of the phenols from the thalli mats and the habitat they were analyzed using the folin ciocalteu method with some modifications while the pigment content chlorophyll and carotenoids was evaluated by the spectrophotometric method liechtenthaler 1987 with some variations analysis of the content of these components in algae extracts indicates that the tendency of changes in their contents was similar or the same growth and decrease of phenolic content cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe and pigments mae chlorophyll sfe and mae carotenoids at the same time were independent of the insulation method used the mats formed by c glomerata on the surface of lake oporzyńskie were more stable and larger surface area than those on the nielba river which could explain differences in polyphenol concentrations in these two aquatic ecosystems the results suggest a reduction in the secretion of phenolic compounds with an aging population of algae graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyphenols pigments microwave assisted extraction supercritical fluid extraction allelopathy freshwater macroalgae 1 introduction limited information about functioning astatic biocenoses forming in the littoral zone by filamentous green algae have prompted the authors to undertake detailed analysis of seasonal differences in the content of phenols and pigments in the thalli of freshwater cladophora glomerata and also in its habitat the available floristic data confirmed the presence of patches mats of filamentous green algae in the surface layer free floating thalli and in the benthic zone thalli attached to the bottom in lakes and lowland rivers which play an important role in aquatic ecosystems however competition between the mat forming species may depend on i mutual replacement ii exclusion of species or iii release of chemicals macroalgae from the group of chlorophytes that anchor to submerged vegetation can compete in the process of colonization of the water surface the filamentous green algae that tolerate a wide range of changes in habitat conditions pikosz et al 2017 show the ability to produce an enhanced amount of polyphenols in response to biotic stress it is supposed that secretion of polyphenols is a response to the competition from the cladophora genus algae so far only a few studies have been conducted regarding the contents of phenolic compounds and pigments composition in freshwater macroalgae such phenols as coumaric acid and galic acid kartal et al 2009 have been found in freshwater c glomerata a high allelopathic potential of algae and water plants can be a result of high tissue concentrations of total phenolic compounds 6 12 of dry matter which are released into the surrounding medium hilt nee körner et al 2006 some phenolic allelochemicals such as tannic acid exuded from submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum may inhibit development of other aquatic organisms e g phytoplankton or epiphyton gross et al 1996 it has been proved that tannic acid might exhibit allelopathic effect on the green algae desmodesmus armatus chodat hegewald and scenedesmus vacuolatus shihira and krauss as well as the diatom stephanodiscus minutulus kützing cleve and möller eigemann et al 2013 the same polyphenol is able to inhibit the growth rates of green alga desmodesmus armatus and at the same time may increase the growth rates of cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa kützing kützing chang et al 2012 others compounds such as pyrogallic acid gallic acid ellagic acid and catechin have been also found as allelopathic polyphenols in myriophyllum spicatum l influencing the growth and photosynthetic activities of cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa zhu et al 2010 polyphenols are able to penetrate cell membranes due to their amphiphilic or lipophilic structure leu et al 2002 in our previous paper we compared the efficiency of different extraction methods and then chose the most effective technique to isolate pigments as bioactive substances from freshwater green algae such as cladophora glomerata l kütz cladophora rivularis l hoek and ulva flexuosa wulfen in the same conditions temperature time fabrowska et al 2017 however in fact little is known about the interactions between the mat forming species and the response of organisms to biotic stress caused by competition moreover a quantitative determination of phenols and polyphenols allelopathic substances secreted by macroalgae to the habitat as a result of their exposure to biotic stress caused by competition is also an objective of our study according to literature data polyphenols are the main chemicals inhibiting the growth of different autotrophic organisms macias et al 2008 nakai et al 2000 2001 d ambrosca et al 2006 the role of phenols and polyphenols as allelopathic substances has been evaluated the presence of phenols and polyphenols can significantly stimulate the ecological dominance of e g cladophora that forms large surface mats our another objective was to determine the total amount of polyphenols synthesized in response to the effects of stress factors and the physiological conditions in the resulting mat by examining the composition and concentration of photosynthetically active pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids seasonal variability in the properties of c glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae material and water samples samples of c glomerata were collected manually from two freshwater ecosystems located in greater poland

2015 all samples were randomly selected from the mat at about 10 cm from the water surface the filamentous green algae samples were collected into plastic containers and transported in a refrigerated container at 4 c to a laboratory after harvesting the filaments were rinsed repeatedly with distilled water next fresh algal biomass was weighed and dried in a drying chamber fd with forced air binder under the temperature of 40 c until a dry matter of the water content 15 was obtained afterwards dry algae were milled using a laboratory mill with a grinding tank dried algal biomass was stored in plastic containers protected from light at room temperature each time to check the taxonomic purity of the material morphometric measurements of the length and width of cells pyrenoids stained with lugol s iodine and nuclei stained with 1 acetocarmine were observed to assess the physicochemical preferences of macroalga in mats we collected water samples from 0 1m using a customized sampler samples for analyses of chlorophyll a and other chemical analyses were collected using a sucking pump equipped with hoses ø 10 mm adapted to bring up water from a particular sampling depth into a calibrated vessel during the weekly sampling some physicochemical parameters of water were measured such as temperature c ph oxygen saturation os dissolved oxygen do mg o2 l 1 electrolytic

sampling sites water was sampled both from the middle of algal mats and from the area outside the mats about 0 5 l of water was collected from the lake and the river week by week into plastic

concentration of phenols released into the water was much lower than that in the algae extract studied these concentrations were so low that they were below the detection limit of the method applied for this reason it was necessary to adjust the method to determine the phenolic content in the habitat water by using undiluted folin ciocalteu reagent total phenols content tpc in the habitat water was determined spectrophotometrically using the modified folin ciocalteu method a portion of 2 ml of ultra filtered polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe 0 2 μm membrane habitat water was mixed with 150 μl of undiluted folin ciocalteu reagent after 1 min 450 μl of 20 w v na2co3 and 570 μl of water were added the samples were incubated for 2 h at 20 c in the dark afterwards 2 70 ml of each reaction mixture

disscusion the aim of the study was to establish the effects of mass growth of filamentous green algae mats on freshwater ecosystems the maximum mass increase maximum growth rate of these algae species is observed usually in the summer time in july and august pikosz and messyasz 2016 but sometimes two periods of maximum growth rate could be observed in spring and autumn these observations applied not only to lakes but also to rivers earlier chudyba 1965 1968 has reported great morphometrical variation in the thalli of cladophora glomerata from the skawa river which was related to the influence of external conditions water flow the macroscopic filamentous algae mainly those from the cladophora genus and other green algae compete for space light and nutrients dominant species of filamentous green algae c glomerata in mats are better adapted to environmental conditions than other algae and changes in them as they are more resistant and their defense systems against stress factors are more effective our objective was to determine the content of polyphenols and pigments in the particular species of c glomerata thus to determine the influence of these metabolites on the phenomenon of allelopathy for this purpose phenols and polyphenols from the thalli of macroscopic algae and the water were isolated by the mae and sfe extraction methods in this paper we also investigated the concentration of phenols in water from the mat and water outside the mat investigations of large mat persisting for a long time is expected to bring more detail information on their function in aquatic ecosystems in this study the role and significance of phenols and polyphenols as active allelopathic substances helping cladophora glomerate to achieve ecological dominance expressed by formation of large congeneric mats on the water surface was assessed chemically protected macroalgae negative allelopathic effect e g by excretion of phenols often dominate their environments the biomass of macroscopic green algae developing in the inland water ecosystems is considered as a result of interspecific competition and expansion of these species thanks to the possibility of such a chemical response to the biotic and abiotic stress factors green algae can better adapt to new habitat conditions the excretion of polyphenols into surrounding water by the dense mats of green algae floating on the water surface leads to significant changes in the taxonomic composition reduction of biodiversity in the mat as well as in the phytoplankton and phytobenthos there are no results in the literature regarding the determination of the content of polyphenols and pigments in c glomerata thus determining the effect of these metabolites on the phenomenon of allelopathy only a few research groups deal with freshwater macroglons for the content of bioactive compounds laungsuwon and chulalaksananukul 2013 gao et al 2017 recently a work has also been published whose aqueous extract of c glomerata enriched with cr iii ions reduced apoptosis and inflammation in ascs of ems and the improvement of pdk4 expression and reduction of endoplastic reticulum stress marycz et al 2017 the freshwater macroalgae that we have studied came from lake oporzyn and the nielba river water reservoirs that have been our sampling area for years in this sampling area we have examined the use of freshwater algae as bioaccumulators of metals in the river and lakes rybak et al 2013 as well as the study was to determine the mineral content amino acid and fatty acid composition of the freshwater macroalga messyasz et al 2015 pikosz and messyasz 2015 3 1 habitat the relationship between the environmental factors and cladophora glomerata distribution in water ecosystems was investigated table 1 the mass appearance of c glomerata in the summer especially in late june may result from the great fertility of the water of both ecosystems the average concentrations of n no3 n nh4 p po4 3 for both water ecosystems in this period were 0 36 0 45 mg l 1 0 28 0 69 mg l 1 and 0 36 0 57 mg l 1 approximately the abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus mineral forms in the river and the lake water was very high and indicated the eutrophic nature of their waters the value of the electrolytic conductivity fluctuated around 500 600 μs cm 1 irrespective of the location and time of measurement the high values indicate the influence of local pollution at the lake site the source of pollution was a small village with large crop fields in the river the pollution could come from unpurified sewage of the city localized close to the river during the maximum growth period of cladophora the ph value in the surface water ranged between 7 86 and 8 31 the concentrations of oxygen varied between 8 4 mg l 1 in the water from mat and 4 3 mg l 1 in the site with water out of mat in the lake the decrease in chlorophyll did not correspond to the decrease in the concentration of nutrients in both studied water ecosystems in lake oporzynskie statistically significant differences between sites with a dense mat and without the presence of cladophor glomerata were found for the ph of water its turbidity and the concentration of sulphates and chlorophyll a table 1 on the other hand in the case of the nielba river differences in the physico chemical parameters of water were statistically insignificant except for the biological parameter chlorophyll a anova analysis f were showed statistically significant differences between the four groups river lake water from the mat water from outside the mat within parameters related to inorganic substances dissolved in water electrolytical conductivity turbidity tds trophy of water p po4 3 so4 2 os and the development of algae in the water chlorophyll a ph os table 1 3 2 pigments fig 2 presents the changes in the concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the c glomerata extracts studied first of all it was observed that sfe was the most efficient method for isolation of both chlorophylls and carotenoids this is related to the non polar character of supercritical carbon dioxide which is an effective solvent for pigments extraction especially for carotenoids fabrowska et al 2016 the algae collected from the river were characterized by higher contents of the pigments than those from the lake at the beginning of the vegetation period may the amount of chlorophylls in algal biomass was relatively high afterwards the content of chlorophylls slightly increased in the algae collected in june and then decreased in those collected in september from lake oporzynskie in c glomerata biomass from the nielba river the chlorophylls concentration also decreased in the period from june to august and after that an increase was noted in the algae collected till september in the biomass from the lake and from the river the quantity of chlorophylls stabilized in the autumn from september to october on the other hand the content of carotenoids content in the studied algae was low at the beginning of the experiment may june for algae from lake oporzynskie and may july for algae from nielba river and increased in the algae collected up to october the observed changes in pigments content clearly depend on the vegetation period which affects the physiology and metabolic processes of algae in late spring and early summer may june massive blooms of algae are observed in inland waters in poland in this period c glomerata algae create a large amount of dark green biomass covering the surface of lake oporzynskie and rocks in nielba river during the vegetation season when temperatures are high and there are more sunny days the algae are growing and produce higher amounts of chlorophylls necessary for photosynthesis process at the same time the carotenoids concentration in the biomass of algae gets lower at the end of the vegetation season september october the metabolism of algae changes which is visible in the pigments composition due to lower temperatures and less sunlight the metabolic processes slow down and algae do not need so much chlorophylls for photosynthesis as a consequence algae produce less chlorophylls and more carotenoids and the biomass dies 3 3 polyphenols fig 3 presents the polyphenol concentration in algae extracts and in water at different sites of sample collection the data for the samples collected from lake oporzynskie are in fig 3a while those for the samples from the nielba river in fig 3b the figures present the data obtained by the two methods of extraction the microwave assisted cladophora t mae and supercritical extraction cladophora t sfe for the samples from both lake oporzynskie and the nielba river the effectiveness of mae was higher reaching over 30 however the character of dependence of the polyphenols content determined by the two methods mae and sfe on the sites of collection was the same in the following we consider the curves for the results obtained by the more efficient mae method in the period from may to june 2015 the concentration of polyphenols in the extracts slightly increased in july it significantly decreased and in the following months it grew to reach the values from the earlier period the concentration of polyphenols in water samples taken from the mat mat water and outside the mat water was by almost 4 orders of magnitude lower than in the extract and varied in the range 0 0005 do 0 0011 g l the tendency of changes in the concentration of polyphenols in water is the reverse to that observed for polyphenols in the extracts the concentration of polyphenols in water samples was at more or less the same level throughout the vegetation season except for the samples collected in july 2015 in which it was much higher to drop in august the simultaneous decrease in the content of polyphenols in the algae extracts and the increase in their content in water samples in july 2015 so at the top of the vegetation season can be a result of enhanced secretion of allelopathic substances to the environment in this case to water it seems that july 2015 was the key month for winning the dominant position in the environment by c glomerata in lake oporzynskie most probably the intensive secretion of polyphenols to water led to temporary reduction of the content of secondary metabolites in algae thalli this reduction was then compensated for later in august through october 2015 similar relations between the extraction yield and type of extraction method cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe can be observed for the samples from the nielba river fig 3b the total content of phenols in the extracts obtained by the methods mae and sfe in the samples collected throughout the vegetation period changes in similar way fig 3a and b the character of changes is similar for the samples obtained by the two methods collected from the lake and from the river although the contents obtained by these two methods are slightly different the differences between the contents of phenols determined by the two methods also depend on the time of sample collection but are generally of the same magnitude however the mae method is always more efficient then sef and provides a certain percentage of the product more however the differences are significant they are related to the fact that in the flowing water the mat is formed later in may 2015 in lake oporzynskie the mats were already fully developed that is why the concentration of polyphenols in may was low and considerably increased in june in july it decreased and in august increased again the concentration of polyphenols in water was observed to increase from may to july 2015 decrease in july and increase again in august the decrease in the concentration of polyphenols in the water samples from lake oporzynskie and in the nielba river in august seems to be related to the anomalously high average daily temperatures noted in august 2015 even up to 30 c fig 4 in the samples of water from the nielba river in contrast to those from lake oporzynskie a significant decrease in the concentration of polyphenols was observed in october when their concentration in lake oporzynskie was constant a probable explanation of this fact is that in late september and early october in this region intensive precipitations took place they increased the level of water in the lake but the algae managed to maintain relatively constant level of polyphenols in the lake water which was impossible in the river intensive increase in the water flow in the river from 0 17 to 0 83 m3 s fig 5 made it impossible for the ageing algae colonies to maintain a constant level of polyphenols in the river water another important objective of this study was to assess the phenomenon of morphometric and habitat variation of filamentous algae in aquatic ecosystems in the greater poland wielkopolska region north poland as well as to establish the environmental conditions ensuring the optimum development of the test species traditionally the descriptions of most species have been based on morphological data our studies showed that c glometara was well adapted to a specific set of environmental conditions in which algae individuals have to cope with strong competition from other related species and with periods of severe environmental stress therefore ecological and environmental information such as habitat preferences water temperature were also useful the study on chemical composition of the samples including determination of phenols and pigments in the extracts from the algae and water from their habitats have provided new and independent data confirming the competition between different species in these habitats and the phenomenon of allopathy of c glomerata which was so strong that it inhibited development of other algae the seasonal changes in the content of phenols in the algae extracts and in water demonstrate the significant effect of allelopathy on the other algae that could potentially develop in the same habitat in all cases differences were statistically significant p was smaller than 0 001 table s1 supplementary data 4 conclusions 1 the mats formed by c glomerata on the lake oporzynskie water surface were more stable and covered greater area than those on the nielba river which could explain the differences in the polyphenol concentrations in these two water bodies 2 the contents of phenols and pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids in the extracts obtained from algae by two methods mae and sfe were determined analysis of the contents of these components in the algae extracts collected in the season may october 2015 figs 2 and 3 shows that the tendency of changes in their content was similar or the same the increase and decrease in contents of phenols cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe and pigments chlorophyll mae sfe and carotenoids mae sfe in the same period was independent of the method of isolation 3 the method of extraction should be chosen taking into account its effectiveness for determination of the content of particular substance for the extraction of phenolic compounds more effective was the mae method while for the extraction of pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids more effective was the sfe method 4 the folin ciocalteu method for determination of phenolic compounds in water from mat water m and out of mat water had to be modified fig 3 it was necessary because of lower content of phenolic compounds in the water samples studied than in the standard analytical samples 5 the results suggested a decrease in the phenolic compounds secretion with ageing the algae population 6 application of the modified folin ciocalteu method for determination of phenols in water from lake oporzyńskie and the nielba river provided the opportunity to deepen the studies on allelopathic factors and the role of filamentous

19667,polyphenols are chemicals that primarily inhibit the growth of various autotrophic organisms the presence of these metabolites greatly boosts the ecological dominance of eg cladophora which creates large surface mats the main goal of our work was to quantify the phenol and polyphenols allelopathic substances secreted by the macroalgae as a result of exposure to biotic stress caused by competition the research was carried out on the cladophora glomerata biomass collected from two freshwater ecosystems located in wielkopolska region poland fig 1 oporzynskie lake n52 55 e 17 9 and nielba river n52 48 e 17 12 seasonal variability may october 2015 in the properties of c glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water in addition the content of pigments in the analyzed biomass was determined during the appearance of algae mats in water reservoirs biomass extraction was performed to determine the phenolic and carotenoid contents chlorophyll and carotenoids by using two extraction methods microwave assisted extraction mae and supercritical fluid extraction sfe after isolation of the phenols from the thalli mats and the habitat they were analyzed using the folin ciocalteu method with some modifications while the pigment content chlorophyll and carotenoids was evaluated by the spectrophotometric method liechtenthaler 1987 with some variations analysis of the content of these components in algae extracts indicates that the tendency of changes in their contents was similar or the same growth and decrease of phenolic content cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe and pigments mae chlorophyll sfe and mae carotenoids at the same time were independent of the insulation method used the mats formed by c glomerata on the surface of lake oporzyńskie were more stable and larger surface area than those on the nielba river which could explain differences in polyphenol concentrations in these two aquatic ecosystems the results suggest a reduction in the secretion of phenolic compounds with an aging population of algae graphical abstract image 1 keywords polyphenols pigments microwave assisted extraction supercritical fluid extraction allelopathy freshwater macroalgae 1 introduction limited information about functioning astatic biocenoses forming in the littoral zone by filamentous green algae have prompted the authors to undertake detailed analysis of seasonal differences in the content of phenols and pigments in the thalli of freshwater cladophora glomerata and also in its habitat the available floristic data confirmed the presence of patches mats of filamentous green algae in the surface layer free floating thalli and in the benthic zone thalli attached to the bottom in lakes and lowland rivers which play an important role in aquatic ecosystems however competition between the mat forming species may depend on i mutual replacement ii exclusion of species or iii release of chemicals macroalgae from the group of chlorophytes that anchor to submerged vegetation can compete in the process of colonization of the water surface the filamentous green algae that tolerate a wide range of changes in habitat conditions pikosz et al 2017 show the ability to produce an enhanced amount of polyphenols in response to biotic stress it is supposed that secretion of polyphenols is a response to the competition from the cladophora genus algae so far only a few studies have been conducted regarding the contents of phenolic compounds and pigments composition in freshwater macroalgae such phenols as coumaric acid and galic acid kartal et al 2009 have been found in freshwater c glomerata a high allelopathic potential of algae and water plants can be a result of high tissue concentrations of total phenolic compounds 6 12 of dry matter which are released into the surrounding medium hilt nee körner et al 2006 some phenolic allelochemicals such as tannic acid exuded from submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum may inhibit development of other aquatic organisms e g phytoplankton or epiphyton gross et al 1996 it has been proved that tannic acid might exhibit allelopathic effect on the green algae desmodesmus armatus chodat hegewald and scenedesmus vacuolatus shihira and krauss as well as the diatom stephanodiscus minutulus kützing cleve and möller eigemann et al 2013 the same polyphenol is able to inhibit the growth rates of green alga desmodesmus armatus and at the same time may increase the growth rates of cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa kützing kützing chang et al 2012 others compounds such as pyrogallic acid gallic acid ellagic acid and catechin have been also found as allelopathic polyphenols in myriophyllum spicatum l influencing the growth and photosynthetic activities of cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa zhu et al 2010 polyphenols are able to penetrate cell membranes due to their amphiphilic or lipophilic structure leu et al 2002 in our previous paper we compared the efficiency of different extraction methods and then chose the most effective technique to isolate pigments as bioactive substances from freshwater green algae such as cladophora glomerata l kütz cladophora rivularis l hoek and ulva flexuosa wulfen in the same conditions temperature time fabrowska et al 2017 however in fact little is known about the interactions between the mat forming species and the response of organisms to biotic stress caused by competition moreover a quantitative determination of phenols and polyphenols allelopathic substances secreted by macroalgae to the habitat as a result of their exposure to biotic stress caused by competition is also an objective of our study according to literature data polyphenols are the main chemicals inhibiting the growth of different autotrophic organisms macias et al 2008 nakai et al 2000 2001 d ambrosca et al 2006 the role of phenols and polyphenols as allelopathic substances has been evaluated the presence of phenols and polyphenols can significantly stimulate the ecological dominance of e g cladophora that forms large surface mats our another objective was to determine the total amount of polyphenols synthesized in response to the effects of stress factors and the physiological conditions in the resulting mat by examining the composition and concentration of photosynthetically active pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids seasonal variability in the properties of c glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae material and water samples samples of c glomerata were collected manually from two freshwater ecosystems located in greater poland region poland fig 1 lake oporzynskie n52 55 e17 9 and the nielba river n52 48 e17 12 the biomass of algae was collected week by week starting from the first week of may 2015 till the end of october 2015 all samples were randomly selected from the mat at about 10 cm from the water surface the filamentous green algae samples were collected into plastic containers and transported in a refrigerated container at 4 c to a laboratory after harvesting the filaments were rinsed repeatedly with distilled water next fresh algal biomass was weighed and dried in a drying chamber fd with forced air binder under the temperature of 40 c until a dry matter of the water content 15 was obtained afterwards dry algae were milled using a laboratory mill with a grinding tank dried algal biomass was stored in plastic containers protected from light at room temperature each time to check the taxonomic purity of the material morphometric measurements of the length and width of cells pyrenoids stained with lugol s iodine and nuclei stained with 1 acetocarmine were observed to assess the physicochemical preferences of macroalga in mats we collected water samples from 0 1m using a customized sampler samples for analyses of chlorophyll a and other chemical analyses were collected using a sucking pump equipped with hoses ø 10 mm adapted to bring up water from a particular sampling depth into a calibrated vessel during the weekly sampling some physicochemical parameters of water were measured such as temperature c ph oxygen saturation os dissolved oxygen do mg o2 l 1 electrolytic conductivity ec μscm 1 and total dissolved substance tds mg l 1 all these variables were measured in the field using a ysi multi parameter probe for a detailed analysis of the chemical parameters water samples 500 ml were taken conserved with chloroform chcl3 and stored at 10 c for further analyses water samples 0 5 l for pigment analysis were filtered through whatman gf f filters according to the iso 10260 standard method the concentrations of orthophosphates nitrates ammonium nitrogen and sulfates were determined using a spectrophotometer hach dr 2800 the phytoplankton chlorophyll a chl a μg g 1 concentration was determined in laboratory on a spectrophotometer using ethanol as extraction solvent at the same time water samples for analysis of polyphenols were collected from both sampling sites water was sampled both from the middle of algal mats and from the area outside the mats about 0 5 l of water was collected from the lake and the river week by week into plastic containers water samples were ultra filtered to remove any microorganism stored in a laboratory freezer at 20 c and protected from light until analysis 2 2 chemicals and reagents the chemicals used in

investigated table 1 the mass appearance of c glomerata in the summer especially in late june may result from the great fertility of the water of both ecosystems the average concentrations of n no3 n nh4 p po4 3 for both water ecosystems in this period were 0 36 0 45 mg l 1 0 28 0 69 mg l 1 and 0 36 0 57 mg l 1 approximately the abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus mineral forms in the river and the lake water was very high and indicated the eutrophic nature of their waters the value of the electrolytic conductivity fluctuated around 500 600 μs cm 1 irrespective of the location and time of measurement the high values indicate the influence of local pollution at the lake site the source of pollution was a small village with large crop fields in the river the pollution could come from unpurified sewage of the city localized close to the river during the maximum growth period of cladophora the ph value in the surface water ranged between 7 86 and 8 31 the concentrations of oxygen varied between 8 4 mg l 1 in the water from mat and 4 3 mg l 1 in the site with water out of mat in the lake the decrease in chlorophyll did not correspond to the decrease in the concentration of nutrients in both studied water ecosystems in lake oporzynskie statistically significant differences between sites with a dense mat and without the presence of cladophor glomerata were found for the ph of water its turbidity and the concentration of sulphates and chlorophyll a table 1 on the other hand in the case of the nielba river differences in the physico chemical parameters of water were statistically insignificant except for the biological parameter chlorophyll a anova analysis f were showed statistically significant differences between the four groups river lake water from the mat water from outside the mat within parameters related to inorganic substances dissolved in water electrolytical conductivity turbidity tds trophy of water p po4 3 so4 2 os and the development of algae in the water chlorophyll a ph os table 1 3 2 pigments fig 2 presents the changes in the concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the c glomerata extracts studied first of all it was observed that sfe was the most efficient method for isolation of both chlorophylls and carotenoids this is related to the non polar character of supercritical carbon dioxide which is an effective solvent for pigments extraction especially for carotenoids fabrowska et al 2016 the algae collected from the river were characterized by higher contents of the pigments than those from the lake at the beginning of the vegetation period may the amount of chlorophylls in algal biomass was relatively high afterwards the content of chlorophylls slightly increased in the algae collected in june and then decreased in those collected in september from lake oporzynskie in c glomerata biomass from the nielba river the chlorophylls concentration also decreased in the period from june to august and after that an increase was noted in the algae collected till september in the biomass from the lake and from the river the quantity of chlorophylls stabilized in the autumn from september to october on the other hand the content of carotenoids content in the studied algae was low at the beginning of the experiment may june for algae from lake oporzynskie and may july for algae from nielba river and increased in the algae collected up to october the observed changes in pigments content clearly depend on the vegetation period which affects the physiology and metabolic processes of algae in late spring and early summer may june massive blooms of algae are observed in inland waters in poland in this period c glomerata algae create a large amount of dark green biomass covering the surface of lake oporzynskie and rocks in nielba river during the vegetation season when temperatures are high and there are more sunny days the algae are growing and produce higher amounts of chlorophylls necessary for photosynthesis process at the same time the carotenoids concentration in the biomass of algae gets lower at the end of the vegetation season september october the metabolism of algae changes which is visible in the pigments composition due to lower temperatures and less sunlight the metabolic processes slow down and algae do not need so much chlorophylls for photosynthesis as a consequence algae produce less chlorophylls and more carotenoids and the biomass dies 3 3 polyphenols fig 3 presents the polyphenol concentration in algae extracts and in water at different sites of sample collection the data for the samples collected from lake oporzynskie are in fig 3a while those for the samples from the nielba river in fig 3b the figures present the data obtained by the two methods of extraction the microwave assisted cladophora t mae and supercritical extraction cladophora t sfe for the samples from both lake oporzynskie and the nielba river the effectiveness of mae was higher reaching over 30 however the character of dependence of the polyphenols content determined by the two methods mae and sfe on the sites of collection was the same in the following we consider the curves for the results obtained by the more efficient mae method in the period from may to june 2015 the concentration of polyphenols in the extracts slightly increased in july it significantly decreased and in the following months it grew to reach the values from the earlier period the concentration of polyphenols in water samples taken from the mat mat water and outside the mat water was by almost 4 orders of magnitude lower than in the extract and varied in the range 0 0005 do 0 0011 g l the tendency of changes in the concentration of polyphenols in water is the reverse to that observed for polyphenols in the extracts the concentration of polyphenols in water samples was at more or less the same level throughout the vegetation season except for the samples collected in july 2015 in which it was much higher to drop in august the simultaneous decrease in the content of polyphenols in the algae extracts and the increase in their content in water samples in july 2015 so at the top of the vegetation season can be a result of enhanced secretion of allelopathic substances to the environment in this case to water it seems that july 2015 was the key month for winning the dominant position in the environment by c glomerata in lake oporzynskie most probably the intensive secretion of polyphenols to water led to temporary reduction of the content of secondary metabolites in algae thalli this reduction was then compensated for later in august through october 2015 similar relations between the extraction yield and type of extraction method cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe can be observed for the samples from the nielba river fig 3b the total content of phenols in the extracts obtained by the methods mae and sfe in the samples collected throughout the vegetation period changes in similar way fig 3a and b the character of changes is similar for the samples obtained by the two methods collected from the lake and from the river although the contents obtained by these two methods are slightly different the differences between the contents of phenols determined by the two methods also depend on the time of sample collection but are generally of the same magnitude however the mae method is always more efficient then sef and provides a certain percentage of the product more however the differences are significant they are related to the fact that in the flowing water the mat is formed later in may 2015 in lake oporzynskie the mats were already fully developed that is why the concentration of polyphenols in may was low and considerably increased in june in july it decreased and in august increased again the concentration of polyphenols in water was observed to increase from may to july 2015 decrease in july and increase again in august the decrease in the concentration of polyphenols in the water samples from lake oporzynskie and in the nielba river in august seems to be related to the anomalously high average daily temperatures noted in august 2015 even up to 30 c fig 4 in the samples of water from the nielba river in contrast to those from lake oporzynskie a significant decrease in the concentration of polyphenols was observed in october when their concentration in lake oporzynskie was constant a probable explanation of this fact is that in late september and early october in this region intensive precipitations took place they increased the level of water in the lake but the algae managed to maintain relatively constant level of polyphenols in the lake water which was impossible in the river intensive increase in the water flow in the river from 0 17 to 0 83 m3 s fig 5 made it impossible for the ageing algae colonies to maintain a constant level of polyphenols in the river water another important objective of this study was to assess the phenomenon of morphometric and habitat variation of filamentous algae in aquatic ecosystems in the greater poland wielkopolska region north poland as well as to establish the environmental conditions ensuring the optimum development of the test species traditionally the descriptions of most species have been based on morphological data our studies showed that c glometara was well adapted to a specific set of environmental conditions in which algae individuals have to cope with strong competition from other related species and with periods of severe environmental stress therefore ecological and environmental information such as habitat preferences water temperature were also useful the study on chemical composition of the samples including determination of phenols and pigments in the extracts from the algae and water from their habitats have provided new and independent data confirming the competition between different species in these habitats and the phenomenon of allopathy of c glomerata which was so strong that it inhibited development of other algae the seasonal changes in the content of phenols in the algae extracts and in water demonstrate the significant effect of allelopathy on the other algae that could potentially develop in the same habitat in all cases differences were statistically significant p was smaller than 0 001 table s1 supplementary data 4 conclusions 1 the mats formed by c glomerata on the lake oporzynskie water surface were more stable and covered greater area than those on the nielba river which could explain the differences in the polyphenol concentrations in these two water bodies 2 the contents of phenols and pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids in the extracts obtained from algae by two methods mae and sfe were determined analysis of the contents of these components in the algae extracts collected in the season may october 2015 figs 2 and 3 shows that the tendency of changes in their content was similar or the same the increase and decrease in contents of phenols cladophora t mae and cladophora t sfe and pigments chlorophyll mae sfe and carotenoids mae sfe in the same period was independent of the method of isolation 3 the method of extraction should be chosen taking into account its effectiveness for determination of the content of particular substance for the extraction of phenolic compounds more effective was the mae method while for the extraction of pigments chlorophylls and carotenoids more effective was the sfe method 4 the folin ciocalteu method for determination of phenolic compounds in water from mat water m and out of mat water had to be modified fig 3 it was necessary because of lower content of phenolic compounds in the water samples studied than in the standard analytical samples 5 the results suggested a decrease in the phenolic compounds secretion with ageing the algae population 6 application of the modified folin ciocalteu method for determination of phenols in water from lake oporzyńskie and the nielba river provided the opportunity to deepen the studies on allelopathic factors and the role of filamentous

19668,this work investigated impacts of iodide i on the transformation of the widely used phenolic preservative methylparaben mep as well as 11 other phenolic compounds by potassium permanganate kmno4 it was found that kmno4 showed a low reactivity towards mep in the absence of i with apparent second order rate constants k app ranging from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 the presence of i remarkably enhanced the transformation rates of mep by kmno4 via the contribution of hypoiodous acid hoi in situ formed which displayed several orders of magnitude higher reactivity towards mep than kmno4 this enhancing effect of i was greatly influenced by solution conditions e g i or kmno4 concentration or ph which could be well simulated by a kinetic model involving competition reactions i e kmno4 with i kmno4 with mep hoi with kmno4 and hoi with mep similar enhancing effect of i on the transformation kinetics of 5 other selected phenols i e p hydroxybenzoic acid phenol and bromophenols at ph 7 was also observed but not in the cases of bisphenol a triclosan 4 n nonylphenol and cresols this discrepancy could be well explained by the relative reactivity of kmno4 towards phenols vs i liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that iodinated aromatic products and or iodinated quinone like product were generated in the cases where i enhancing effect was observed evolution of iodinated aromatic products generated from mep 10 μm treated by kmno4 50 150 μm in the presence of i 5 15 μm suggested that higher i or moderate kmno4 concentration or neutral ph promoted their formation a similar enhancing effect of i 1 μm on the transformation of mep 1 μm by kmno4 12 6 μm and formation of iodinated aromatic products were also observed in natural water this work demonstrates an important role of i in the transformation kinetics and product formation of phenolic compounds by kmno4 which has great implications for future applications of kmno4 in treatment of i containing water graphical abstract image 1 keywords permanganate phenolic compounds methylparaben mep iodide i iodinated aromatic products 1 introduction parabens para hydroxybenzoic acid esters are a group of phenolic compounds that are extensively used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals processed food and beverage and cosmetics liao et al 2013a hossainiz et al 2000 calafat et al 2010 their occurrence in various environmental compartments e g river water waste water treatment plant effluents and sewage sludge is well documented where methylparaben mep is the most frequently detected one wang et al 2015 liao et al 2013b for instance xue et al 2015 reported the occurrence of mep in the majority of marine mammal tissues with the highest concentration up to 865 ng g wet weight liao et al 2013b reported that mep was detected in all samples collected from surface sediments and sediment cores with concentrations ranging from 0 312 to 540 ng g dry weight several studies have suggested that parabens display estrogenic activity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments xue et al 2015 savage et al 2012 permanganate kmno4 has been widely used for advanced water wastewater treatment as well as in situ chemical oxidation isco of subsurface environments due to its relatively low cost comparative stability and ease of handling chen et al 2016 hu et al 2009 2010 2011 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 earlier studies of our group suggested that kmno4 could effectively oxidize phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals e g 4 n nonylphenol 4 n np and bisphenol a bpa odorous bromophenols brps flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbrbpa and antimicrobial triclosan tcs in both synthetic and real waters pang et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 2014 2015 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 systematically studied the oxidation kinetics of kmno4 with 17 substituted phenols including chlorophenols clps cresols and nitrophenols nps at neutral ph they concluded that kmno4 was a good candidate for isco because it exhibited remarkable reactivity towards these contaminants with apparent second order rate constants ranging from 0 03 to 237 m 1s 1 however the reactivity of kmno4 towards mep remains unclear so far iodide i is ubiquitously found in raw waters with concentrations usually ranging from 0 4 to 100 μg l richardson et al 2008 high i concentrations up to few milligrams per liter are occasionally reported in costal water and hydraulic fracturing contaminated water parker et al 2014 harkness et al 2015 previous studies show that i can be easily oxidized to active hypoiodous acid hoi and or further to stable iodate io3 by common oxidants disinfectants such as chlorine kristiana et al 2009 criquet et al 2012 deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramine zhu and zhang 2016 bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 ozone lee et al 2015 liu et al 2001 peroxymonosulfate pms li et al 2017 lente et al 2009 and kmno4 zhao et al 2016 2017 ye et al 2012 the reactions between hoi formed and phenolic compounds co present can not only affect the transformation kinetics of phenols by oxidants disinfectants but also influence their transformation products for instance vikesland et al 2013 reported that the presence of i accelerated the transformation rates of 2 4 dichlorophenol tcs and bpa with chlorine by 2 15 3 30 and 230 660 times respectively over the ph range of 5 5 10 meanwhile several iodinated aromatic products were also detected in addition to chlorinated aromatic products a recent work by our group li et al 2018 found that phenol and bpa were rapidly transformed by pms in the presence of i with the formation of iodinated aromatic products it is reported that iodinated products always present higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues richardson et al 2007 plewa et al 2004 2008 pan et al 2016 sayess et al 2017 especially iodinated aromatic products are generally more toxic than their haloaliphatic ones e g haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 and thus have raised great concerns in recent years yet the impacts of i on the transformation of mep as well as other phenolic compounds by kmno4 and potential formation of iodinated aromatic products of concerns have not been investigated so far the overall objective of this work is to address these two issues first reaction kinetics of kmno4 with mep were determined over the ph range of 5 9 then impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 were studied under various conditions and simulated by a kinetic model moreover iodinated aromatic products formed from mep by treatment of kmno4 in the presence of i were identified and their evolution kinetics were monitored furthermore impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of 11 other selected phenols including phenol p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba tcs bpa 4 n nonylphenol 4 n np brps and cresols by kmno4 were comparatively studied and formation of iodinated aromatic products was also identified finally oxidative treatment of mep by kmno4 and formation of iodinated aromatic products were examined in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1

chemical reagent co ltd all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma stock solutions of kmno4 were prepared by dissolving weighed amounts of kmno4 crystals in di water and standardized spectrophotometrically by an abts method jiang et al 2012 stock solutions of chlorine were prepared by diluting commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo 4 active chlorine and standardized by iodometry 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 transformation of mep and selected phenols by kmno4 in the presence or absence of i all experiments were conducted in 150 ml glass bottles in water bath at 25 1 c under magnetic stirring batch reactions were initiated by adding kmno4 50 300 μm into ph buffered solutions containing mep or one of the selected phenols 10 μm with or without i 0 15 μm acetic acid buffer 2 mm for ph 5 6 and borate buffer 2 mm for ph 7 9 were used samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched with excess hydroxylamine before analysis of mep or selected phenols by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc and uv detection for samples obtained in the presence of i hplc and negative electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry hplc esi qqqms at a precursor ion scan pis approach was also conducted for identification of iodinated aromatic products possibly generated moreover hplc esi qqqms at multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was further performed to obtain the evolution kinetics of iodinated aromatic products identified in the case of mep 2 2 2 transformation of mep and selected phenols by hoi kinetics of hoi freshly prepared by stoichiometric reaction of ocl with i zhao et al 2017 reaction with mep 1 μm at ph 5 9 and selected phenols 1 μm at ph 7 were examined with hoi in excess 10 μm following the procedure described above same buffers as these in the case of kmno4 were used parallel experiments were also performed to identify iodinated aromatic products formed from mep and selected phenols treated by hoi a series of ph buffered solutions containing hoi 5 30 μm ph 7 were first prepared and then mep or one of the selected phenols 10 μm was added to initiate the reactions the final solutions i e after depletion of hoi were analyzed by hplc esi qqqms at pis mode 2 2 3 experiments in natural waters natural water was taken from the songhua river harbin china i 0 05 μm doc 3 8 mg c l alkalinity 100 mg l as caco3 and ph 7 3 after being vacuum filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter this water was buffered to ph 7 with hclo4 and stored at 4 c and used within several days a similar procedure to that in synthetic buffered solutions was followed except that lower concentrations of mep 1 μm and i 1 μm as well as kmno4 12 6 μm 2 0 mg l were used to better mimic environmental levels and water utility operations samples were withdrawn at predetermined time periods and quenched with excess hydroxylamine for analysis of residual mep by hplc and

amu 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics of kmno4 reaction with mep in the absence of i reaction kinetics of kmno4 with mep were investigated over the ph range of 5 9 as fig s1a displayed the loss of mep 10 μm followed pseudo first order rate law with kmno4 in excess 100 μm at ph 7 demonstrating that the reaction was first order with respect to mep pseudo first order rate constants k obs s 1 for mep 10 μm obtained at various kmno4 concentrations 100 300 μm under ph 7 condition showed a linearity with kmno4 concentrations fig s1b suggesting that the reaction was also first order with respect to kmno4 the apparent second order rate constants for kmno4 reaction with mep k kmno4 mep as a function of ph were shown in fig 1 a to be noted the initial rate was used to determine the rate constant for mep reaction with kmno4 at ph 5 due to the autocatalysis occurring therein jiang et al 2009 2012 2015 as can be seen k kmno4 mep ranged from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 and it exhibited a bell shaped ph dependent profile with the maxima obtained at ph near pka value of mep 8 47 this ph dependent k kmno4 mep could not be quantitatively described by parallel reactions between oxidant i e kmno4 and individual acid base species of phenols i e mep that have been widely used to describe the effect of ph on the oxidation kinetics of chlorine ozone and ferrate lee and von gunten 2010 gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde et al 2005 similar observations were also found in previous studies on kmno4 oxidation of other phenols e g brps clps tcs and bisphenol s du et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 2014 gao et al 2017 which were well explained by a kinetic model involving the formation and decomposition of intermediates between kmno4 and phenols text s1 and fig s2 3 2 enhanced transformation of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i impacts of i 0 15 μm on the transformation of mep 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 were investigated as fig 2 a displayed addition of i obviously enhanced the transformation of mep by kmno4 and this enhancement was more pronounced at higher i concentrations the half live of mep loss decreased from 80 min in control experiment without i to about 60 20 and 15 min at i concentration of 5 10 and 15 μm respectively further experiments were also conducted to explore the transformation of mep 10 μm by varying kmno4 concentrations 50 150 μm at a fixed i concentration 10 μm at ph 7 and the results were exhibited as fig 2b the half lives of mep loss obtained at kmno4 concentrations of 50 100 and 150 μm were about 40 20 and 15 min respectively comparatively 20 of mep was transformed within investigated 80 min even at kmno4 concentration of 150 μm in control experiments without i transformation of mep 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm under different ph conditions 5 7 and 9 was further investigated as shown in fig 2c the i enhanced transformation of mep was observed under all the investigated ph conditions and the half live of mep loss decreased in the order of ph 5 40 min ph 9 30 min ph 7 20 min 3 3 kinetics of hoi reaction with mep according to recent studies of zhao et al 2016 2017 the enhanced transformation of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i was reasonably explained by the contribution of hoi in situ formed from kmno4 oxidation of i therefore kinetics of hoi reaction with mep were further investigated in the ph range of 5 9 as fig s3 displayed the reaction of hoi with mep was first order with respect to both mep fig s3a and hoi fig s3b thus reaction kinetics for mep loss followed a generalized second order rate law and the second order rate constants for hoi reaction with mep k hoi mep as a function of ph were comparatively shown in fig 1b as can be seen k hoi mep varied more than one order of magnitude 53 4 3022 106 m 1s 1 in the ph rang of 5 9 with maximum value obtained at ph 8 however this ph dependent rate profiles for hoi reaction with mep could not be successfully simulated by parallel reactions between individual acid base species of hoi pk a 10 4 and mep similar observations were also reported by zhao et al 2017 where they were ascribed to the impacts of buffers i e speciation type and concentration on the reaction rates of hoi with phenols the higher reaction rates of mep with hoi than kmno4 fig 1a over the investigated ph ranges were consistent with the observed enhancing effect of i shown in fig 2 3 4 kinetic modeling of transformation of mep by kmno4 i system a kinetic model by considering the competitive reactions of kmno4 with i fig s4 and mep as well as hoi with kmno4 fig s4 and mep was developed to simulate the transformation kinetics of mep under various conditions by the program kintecus 3 5 table s2 as fig 2 showed experimental data of mep transformation symbols could be well simulated by this model the dashed lines except for the cases at ph 5 this might be attributed to effects of manganese dioxide mno2 in situ formed at acid ph jiang et al 2009 2012 2015 which were not involved in the kinetic model the enhancing effect of i on the transformation of mep by kmno4 under various conditions could be well explained by the contribution of hoi i e hoi exposures k hoi mep the concentration of hoi as a function of time under each condition in fig 2 was simulated by the above kinetic model as figs s5a 5b showed higher hoi exposures were obtained at higher i or kmno4 concentrations in accordance with the higher transformation rates of mep therein fig 2a b hoi exposures under ph 5 and 7 conditions were comparable and both of them were much higher than those obtained at ph 9 fig s5c while higher values of k hoi mep were obtained at ph 9 ph 7 ph 5 fig 1b these two factors together contributed to the observed decreasing order of transformation rates of mep at ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 3 5 formation of iodinated aromatic products from mep in the kmno4 i system formation of iodinated aromatic products from mep by the treatment of kmno4 in the presence of i was identified by hplc esi qqqms pis approach by setting pis at m z 127 the hplc esi qqqms pis approach was developed as an effective tool to fast and selectively detect polar halogen containing compounds from the complex background matrices and its basic principles was widely described in previous studies yang and zhang 2013 ding and zhang 2009 zhang et al 2008 deng et al 2014 gao et al 2016 guan et al 2017 the hplc esi qqqms pis chromatogram of a sample containing mep 10 μm and i 10 μm treated by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 was shown in fig 3 as can be seen two transformation products tps were detected tp i at 14 49 min with molecular ion of m z 277 was assigned to mono iodinated mep and tp ii at 15 67 min with molecular ion of m z 403 was assigned to di iodinated mep these two products were also identified from mep 10 μm treated by hoi 10 μm fig s6 stepwise substitution of hoi to the para and or ortho position of hydroxyl group resulted in the formation of these tps 3 6 evolution of iodinated aromatic products in the kmno4 i mep system furthermore evolution kinetics of tp i and ii generated in kmno4 i mep system under various conditions were monitored by hplc esi qqqms mrm where iodide m z 127 was set as the product ion the ms spectral peak areas were used as an indicative of their relative concentrations due to the unavailability of analytical standards fig 4 a c showed the evolution of tp i and ii formed from mep 10 μm treated by kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i at 5 10 and 15 μm respectively under ph 7 condition as can be seen tp i concentrations firstly increased and then levelled off as the reaction processed at each i concentration while tp ii concentrations kept increasing over the time scales investigated tp i concentrations were slightly influenced by i concentrations in contrast tp ii showed an obvious i concentration dependent profiles with higher level at higher i concentration suggesting that higher hoi exposure favored the generation of multi iodinated aromatic products fig 4d f displayed the evolution of tp i and ii in kmno4 i mep system at a fixed i concentration 10 μm with varied kmno4 concentrations of 50 100 and 150 μm respectively under ph 7 condition as can be seen in the case of kmno4 at 50 μm tp i concentrations gradually increased in the first 40 min and then leveled off while tp ii concentrations remained increasing within investigated 80 min similar profiles of tp i and ii were also observed as kmno4 concentration increased to 100 μm while decreased trends of both tp i and ii after about 40 min were observed with kmno4 concentration further increasing to 150 μm moreover higher levels of both tp i and ii were obtained at moderate kmno4 concentration of 100 μm which probably resulted from lower hoi exposure at lower kmno4 concentration or further transformation of tp i and ii at higher kmno4 concentration fig 4g i exemplified the evolution of tp i and ii at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively by 100 μm kmno4 in the presence of 10 μm i as shown ph has a strong influence on the formation of tp i and ii especially for tp ii tp i concentrations gradually increased over the investigated time scales under each ph condition with comparable levels obtained at ph 7 and 9 and a lower level at ph 5 the formation of tp ii was only observed at ph 7 where it kept increasing within investigated 40 min at ph 5 and 9 negligible formation of tp ii was observed these results correlated well with the observed transformation trends of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i under various ph conditions fig 2c 3 7 impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of other selected phenols by kmno4 further experiments were performed to comparatively investigate impacts of i 10 μm on the transformation kinetics of 11 other phenols 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 as shown in fig 5 the presence of i greatly enhanced the transformation kinetics of p hba phenol and brps including 2 brp 3 brp and 4 brp in contrast a slight enhancement of i on the transformation of tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols including 2 cresol 3 cresol and 4 cresol was observed similar to the case of mep the enhanced transformation of p hba phenol and brps in the presence of i could also be well simulated dashed lines in fig 5 by the kinetic model discussed above table s3 as shown in table 1 for p hba phenol and brps the apparent second order rate constants of kmno4 with phenols k kmno4 p 0 35 0 051 23 0 1 7 m 1s 1 were lower or comparable to that of kmno4 with i k kmno4 i 6 9 1 3 m 1s 1 this allowed the accumulation of hoi before the complete transformation of phenols by kmno4 which in turn accelerated phenols transformation as hoi displayed several orders of magnitude higher reactivity towards them k hoi p 1020 27 15400 890 m 1s 1 than kmno4 for tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols the k kmno4 p 23 1 1 7 110 4 3 0 m 1s 1 was generally several times higher than that of k kmno4 i thus kmno4 was the dominant oxidant that contributed to their transformation additionally the linear free energy relationships lfers for these selected phenols transformation by kmno4 and hoi were also investigated a relative rate constant k rel method salter blanc et al 2016 guan et al 2017 sun et al 2018 by using 4 brp as a reference compound was adopted due to the unavailability of the species specific second order rate constants for kmno4 hoi reaction with phenols as discussed above however no obvious relationship was observed between logk rel and pka or hammett constants σ σ or σ of phenols in both cases 3 8 formation of iodinated aromatic products from selected phenols in the kmno4 i system formation of iodinated aromatic products from above 11 phenols 10 μm by treatment of kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm was further identified by hplc esi qqqms pis approach as expected for tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols no obvious peak was detected by contrast several iodinated aromatic tps were detected from p hba phenol and brps as shown in table 2 and figs s7 s11 mono and multi iodinated aromatic tps were detected in these cases in addition iodinated quinone like tp i e 2 6 diiodinated quinone even numbered molecular ions zhao et al 2010 huang et al 2013 as well as iodinated polymers were also detected from p hba fig s11 similar tps from hoi reaction with these phenols were also detected data were not shown 3 9 impacts of i on the transformation of mep by kmno4 in natural waters transformation of mep 1 μm by kmno4 12 6 μm at ph 7 in natural water without or with i spiking 1 μm was further studied as shown in fig 6 a an enhancement of i on the transformation of mep was also observed in natural water about 10 mep loss by kmno4 alone was obtained after reaction of 660 min which increased to 45 in the presence of 1 μm i under similar conditions kinetic modeling showed that the transformation of mep by kmno4 in the absence of i was well simulated while a significant overestimation of its transformation was observed in the presence of i dashed lines in fig 6a this result could be attributed to the competitive consumption of hoi by the background matrixes in natural water fig s12 the time course profiles of tp i and ii during the kinetics runs were also monitored by hplc esi qqqms mrm and were shown in fig 6b as can be seen both tps kept increasing over the time periods investigated 4 conclusions impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of mep and selected phenols by kmno4 under various conditions as well as formation of iodinated aromatic products during these processes were investigated in this work the following conclusions can be obtained 1 kmno4 showed a low reactivity towards mep in the absence of i with apparent second order rate constants ranging from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 2 the presence of i greatly enhanced the transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 via the effects of hoi in situ formed which showed higher reactivity towards mep than kmno4 the apparent second order rate constants for hoi reaction with mep were 53 4 3022 106 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 3 a kinetic model involving competition reactions of kmno4 with i kmno4 with mep hoi with kmno4 and hoi with mep could well simulate the observed transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i under various conditions 4 similar enhancing effects of i on the transformation of phenol p hba and brps 2 brp 3 brp and 4 brp by kmno4 were also observed which could be well simulated by the kinetic model as well in contrast i showed slight impacts on the transformation of tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols 2 cresol 3 cresol and 4 cresol by kmno4 5 mono and multi iodinated aromatic products were detected from mep and 5 other selected phenols i e phenol p hba and brps treated by kmno4 in the presence of i 6 evolution kinetics of mep iodinated aromatic products showed that higher levels of these iodinated aromatic products were generally obtained at higher i or moderate kmno4 concentration or neutral ph 7 a similar enhancing effect of i on the transformation of mep was also observed in natural water and formation of iodinated aromatic products therein was confirmed acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19668,this work investigated impacts of iodide i on the transformation of the widely used phenolic preservative methylparaben mep as well as 11 other phenolic compounds by potassium permanganate kmno4 it was found that kmno4 showed a low reactivity towards mep in the absence of i with apparent second order rate constants k app ranging from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 the presence of i remarkably enhanced the transformation rates of mep by kmno4 via the contribution of hypoiodous acid hoi in situ formed which displayed several orders of magnitude higher reactivity towards mep than kmno4 this enhancing effect of i was greatly influenced by solution conditions e g i or kmno4 concentration or ph which could be well simulated by a kinetic model involving competition reactions i e kmno4 with i kmno4 with mep hoi with kmno4 and hoi with mep similar enhancing effect of i on the transformation kinetics of 5 other selected phenols i e p hydroxybenzoic acid phenol and bromophenols at ph 7 was also observed but not in the cases of bisphenol a triclosan 4 n nonylphenol and cresols this discrepancy could be well explained by the relative reactivity of kmno4 towards phenols vs i liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis showed that iodinated aromatic products and or iodinated quinone like product were generated in the cases where i enhancing effect was observed evolution of iodinated aromatic products generated from mep 10 μm treated by kmno4 50 150 μm in the presence of i 5 15 μm suggested that higher i or moderate kmno4 concentration or neutral ph promoted their formation a similar enhancing effect of i 1 μm on the transformation of mep 1 μm by kmno4 12 6 μm and formation of iodinated aromatic products were also observed in natural water this work demonstrates an important role of i in the transformation kinetics and product formation of phenolic compounds by kmno4 which has great implications for future applications of kmno4 in

acid esters are a group of phenolic compounds that are extensively used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals processed food and beverage and cosmetics liao et al 2013a hossainiz et al 2000 calafat et al 2010 their occurrence in various environmental compartments e g river water waste water treatment plant effluents and sewage sludge is well documented where methylparaben mep is the most frequently detected one wang et al 2015 liao et al 2013b for instance xue et al 2015 reported the occurrence of mep in the majority of marine mammal tissues with the highest concentration up to 865 ng g wet weight liao et al 2013b reported that mep was detected in all samples collected from surface sediments and sediment cores with concentrations ranging from 0 312 to 540 ng g dry weight several studies have suggested that parabens display estrogenic activity in both in vitro and in vivo experiments xue et al 2015 savage et al 2012 permanganate kmno4 has been widely used for advanced water wastewater treatment as well as in situ chemical oxidation isco of subsurface environments due to its relatively low cost comparative stability and ease of handling chen et al 2016 hu et al 2009 2010 2011 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 earlier studies of our group suggested that kmno4 could effectively oxidize phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals e g 4 n nonylphenol 4 n np and bisphenol a bpa odorous bromophenols brps flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol a tbrbpa and antimicrobial triclosan tcs in both synthetic and real waters pang et al 2014 jiang et al 2009 2010 2012 2014 2015 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 systematically studied the oxidation kinetics of kmno4 with 17 substituted phenols including chlorophenols clps cresols and nitrophenols nps at neutral ph they concluded that kmno4 was a good candidate for isco because it exhibited remarkable reactivity towards these contaminants with apparent second order rate constants ranging from 0 03 to 237 m 1s 1 however the reactivity of kmno4 towards mep remains unclear so far iodide i is ubiquitously found in raw waters with concentrations usually ranging from 0 4 to 100 μg l richardson et al 2008 high i concentrations up to few milligrams per liter are occasionally reported in costal water and hydraulic fracturing contaminated water parker et al 2014 harkness et al 2015 previous studies show that i can be easily oxidized to active hypoiodous acid hoi and or further to stable iodate io3 by common oxidants disinfectants such as chlorine kristiana et al 2009 criquet et al 2012 deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramine zhu and zhang 2016 bichsel and von gunten 1999 2000 ozone lee et al 2015 liu et al 2001 peroxymonosulfate pms li et al 2017 lente et al 2009 and kmno4 zhao et al 2016 2017 ye et al 2012 the reactions between hoi formed and phenolic compounds co present can not only affect the transformation kinetics of phenols by oxidants disinfectants but also influence their transformation products for instance vikesland et al 2013 reported that the presence of i accelerated the transformation rates of 2 4 dichlorophenol tcs and bpa with chlorine by 2 15 3 30 and 230 660 times respectively over the ph range of 5 5 10 meanwhile several iodinated aromatic products were also detected in addition to chlorinated aromatic products a recent work by our group li et al 2018 found that phenol and bpa were rapidly transformed by pms in the presence of i with the formation of iodinated aromatic products it is reported that iodinated products always present higher toxicity than their chlorinated and brominated analogues richardson et al 2007 plewa et al 2004 2008 pan et al 2016 sayess et al 2017 especially iodinated aromatic products are generally more toxic than their haloaliphatic ones e g haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes yang and zhang 2013 liu and zhang 2014 and thus have raised great concerns in recent years yet the impacts of i on the transformation of mep as well as other phenolic compounds by kmno4 and potential formation of iodinated aromatic products of concerns have not been investigated so far the overall objective of this work is to address these two issues first reaction kinetics of kmno4 with mep were determined over the ph range of 5 9 then impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 were studied under various conditions and simulated by a kinetic model moreover iodinated aromatic products formed from mep by treatment of kmno4 in the presence of i were identified and their evolution kinetics were monitored furthermore impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of 11 other selected phenols including phenol p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba tcs bpa 4 n nonylphenol 4 n np brps and cresols by kmno4 were comparatively studied and formation of iodinated aromatic products was also identified finally oxidative treatment of mep by kmno4 and formation of iodinated aromatic products were examined in natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials mep and 11 selected phenols table s1 for structural information purchased from j k scientific ltd were used without further purification ki was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all solutions were prepared using deionized di water from a milli q purification system millipore billerica ma stock solutions of kmno4 were prepared by dissolving weighed amounts of kmno4 crystals in di water and standardized spectrophotometrically by an abts method jiang et al 2012 stock solutions of chlorine were prepared by diluting commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo 4 active chlorine and standardized by iodometry 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 transformation of mep and selected phenols by kmno4 in the presence or absence of i all experiments were conducted in 150 ml glass bottles in water bath at 25 1 c under magnetic stirring batch reactions were initiated by adding kmno4 50 300 μm into ph buffered solutions containing mep or one of the selected phenols 10 μm with or without i 0 15 μm acetic acid buffer 2 mm for ph 5 6 and borate buffer 2 mm for ph 7 9 were used samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and quenched with excess hydroxylamine before analysis of mep or selected phenols by high pressure liquid chromatography hplc and uv detection for samples obtained in the presence of i hplc and negative electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry hplc esi qqqms at a precursor ion scan pis approach was also conducted for identification of iodinated aromatic products possibly generated moreover hplc esi qqqms at multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode was further performed to obtain the evolution kinetics of iodinated aromatic products identified in the case of mep 2 2 2 transformation of mep and selected phenols by hoi kinetics of hoi freshly prepared by stoichiometric reaction of ocl with i zhao et al 2017 reaction with mep 1 μm at ph 5 9 and selected phenols 1 μm at ph 7 were examined with hoi in excess 10 μm following the procedure described above same buffers as these in the case of kmno4 were used parallel experiments were also performed to identify iodinated aromatic products formed from mep and selected phenols treated by hoi a series of ph buffered solutions containing hoi 5 30 μm ph 7 were first prepared and then mep or one of the selected phenols 10 μm was added to initiate the reactions the final solutions i e after depletion of hoi were analyzed by hplc esi qqqms at pis mode 2 2 3 experiments in natural waters natural water was taken from the songhua river harbin china i 0 05 μm doc 3 8 mg c l alkalinity 100 mg l as caco3 and ph 7 3 after being vacuum filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter this water was buffered to ph 7 with hclo4 and stored at 4 c and used within several days a similar procedure to that in synthetic buffered solutions was followed except that lower concentrations of mep 1 μm and i 1 μm as well as kmno4 12 6 μm 2 0 mg l were used to better mimic environmental levels and water utility operations samples were withdrawn at predetermined time periods and quenched with excess hydroxylamine for analysis of residual mep by hplc and iodinated aromatic products by hplc esi qqqms mrm 2 3 analytical methods a hitachi hplc equipped with a hitachi 5210 autosampler and a hitachi 5430 diode array detector with a symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size was used for the determination of mep and selected phenols table s1 for detailed information ab sciex qtrap 5500 ms coupled to an agilent 1260 hplc with an xbridge c18 column

amu 3 results and discussions 3 1 kinetics of kmno4 reaction with mep in the absence of i reaction kinetics of kmno4 with mep were investigated over the ph range of 5 9 as fig s1a displayed the loss of mep 10 μm followed pseudo first order rate law with kmno4 in excess 100 μm at ph 7 demonstrating that the reaction was first order with respect to mep pseudo first order rate constants k obs s 1 for mep 10 μm obtained at various kmno4 concentrations 100 300 μm under ph 7 condition showed a linearity with kmno4 concentrations fig s1b suggesting that the reaction was also first order with respect to kmno4 the apparent second order rate constants for kmno4 reaction with mep k kmno4 mep as a function of ph were shown in fig 1 a to be noted the initial rate was used to determine the rate constant for mep reaction with kmno4 at ph 5 due to the autocatalysis occurring therein jiang et al 2009 2012 2015 as can be seen k kmno4 mep ranged from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 and it exhibited a bell shaped ph dependent profile with the maxima obtained at ph near pka value of mep 8 47 this ph dependent k kmno4 mep could not be quantitatively described by parallel reactions between oxidant i e kmno4 and individual acid base species of phenols i e mep that have been widely used to describe the effect of ph on the oxidation kinetics of chlorine ozone and ferrate lee and von gunten 2010 gallard and von gunten 2002 deborde et al 2005 similar observations were also found in previous studies on kmno4 oxidation of other phenols e g brps clps tcs and bisphenol s du et al 2012 jiang et al 2009 2014 gao et al 2017 which were well explained by a kinetic model involving the formation and decomposition of intermediates between kmno4 and phenols text s1 and fig s2 3 2 enhanced transformation of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i impacts of i 0 15 μm on the transformation of mep 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 were investigated as fig 2 a displayed addition of i obviously enhanced the transformation of mep by kmno4 and this enhancement was more pronounced at higher i concentrations the half live of mep loss decreased from 80 min in control experiment without i to about 60 20 and 15 min at i concentration of 5 10 and 15 μm respectively further experiments were also conducted to explore the transformation of mep 10 μm by varying kmno4 concentrations 50 150 μm at a fixed i concentration 10 μm at ph 7 and the results were exhibited as fig 2b the half lives of mep loss obtained at kmno4 concentrations of 50 100 and 150 μm were about 40 20 and 15 min respectively comparatively 20 of mep was transformed within investigated 80 min even at kmno4 concentration of 150 μm in control experiments without i transformation of mep 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm under different ph conditions 5 7 and 9 was further investigated as shown in fig 2c the i enhanced transformation of mep was observed under all the investigated ph conditions and the half live of mep loss decreased in the order of ph 5 40 min ph 9 30 min ph 7 20 min 3 3 kinetics of hoi reaction with mep according to recent studies of zhao et al 2016 2017 the enhanced transformation of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i was reasonably explained by the contribution of hoi in situ formed from kmno4 oxidation of i therefore kinetics of hoi reaction with mep were further investigated in the ph range of 5 9 as fig s3 displayed the reaction of hoi with mep was first order with respect to both mep fig s3a and hoi fig s3b thus reaction kinetics for mep loss followed a generalized second order rate law and the second order rate constants for hoi reaction with mep k hoi mep as a function of ph were comparatively shown in fig 1b as can be seen k hoi mep varied more than one order of magnitude 53 4 3022 106 m 1s 1 in the ph rang of 5 9 with maximum value obtained at ph 8 however this ph dependent rate profiles for hoi reaction with mep could not be successfully simulated by parallel reactions between individual acid base species of hoi pk a 10 4 and mep similar observations were also reported by zhao et al 2017 where they were ascribed to the impacts of buffers i e speciation type and concentration on the reaction rates of hoi with phenols the higher reaction rates of mep with hoi than kmno4 fig 1a over the investigated ph ranges were consistent with the observed enhancing effect of i shown in fig 2 3 4 kinetic modeling of transformation of mep by kmno4 i system a kinetic model by considering the competitive reactions of kmno4 with i fig s4 and mep as well as hoi with kmno4 fig s4 and mep was developed to simulate the transformation kinetics of mep under various conditions by the program kintecus 3 5 table s2 as fig 2 showed experimental data of mep transformation symbols could be well simulated by this model the dashed lines except for the cases at ph 5 this might be attributed to effects of manganese dioxide mno2 in situ formed at acid ph jiang et al 2009 2012 2015 which were not involved in the kinetic model the enhancing effect of i on the transformation of mep by kmno4 under various conditions could be well explained by the contribution of hoi i e hoi exposures k hoi mep the concentration of hoi as a function of time under each condition in fig 2 was simulated by the above kinetic model as figs s5a 5b showed higher hoi exposures were obtained at higher i or kmno4 concentrations in accordance with the higher transformation rates of mep therein fig 2a b hoi exposures under ph 5 and 7 conditions were comparable and both of them were much higher than those obtained at ph 9 fig s5c while higher values of k hoi mep were obtained at ph 9 ph 7 ph 5 fig 1b these two factors together contributed to the observed decreasing order of transformation rates of mep at ph 7 ph 9 ph 5 3 5 formation of iodinated aromatic products from mep in the kmno4 i system formation of iodinated aromatic products from mep by the treatment of kmno4 in the presence of i was identified by hplc esi qqqms pis approach by setting pis at m z 127 the hplc esi qqqms pis approach was developed as an effective tool to fast and selectively detect polar halogen containing compounds from the complex background matrices and its basic principles was widely described in previous studies yang and zhang 2013 ding and zhang 2009 zhang et al 2008 deng et al 2014 gao et al 2016 guan et al 2017 the hplc esi qqqms pis chromatogram of a sample containing mep 10 μm and i 10 μm treated by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 was shown in fig 3 as can be seen two transformation products tps were detected tp i at 14 49 min with molecular ion of m z 277 was assigned to mono iodinated mep and tp ii at 15 67 min with molecular ion of m z 403 was assigned to di iodinated mep these two products were also identified from mep 10 μm treated by hoi 10 μm fig s6 stepwise substitution of hoi to the para and or ortho position of hydroxyl group resulted in the formation of these tps 3 6 evolution of iodinated aromatic products in the kmno4 i mep system furthermore evolution kinetics of tp i and ii generated in kmno4 i mep system under various conditions were monitored by hplc esi qqqms mrm where iodide m z 127 was set as the product ion the ms spectral peak areas were used as an indicative of their relative concentrations due to the unavailability of analytical standards fig 4 a c showed the evolution of tp i and ii formed from mep 10 μm treated by kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i at 5 10 and 15 μm respectively under ph 7 condition as can be seen tp i concentrations firstly increased and then levelled off as the reaction processed at each i concentration while tp ii concentrations kept increasing over the time scales investigated tp i concentrations were slightly influenced by i concentrations in contrast tp ii showed an obvious i concentration dependent profiles with higher level at higher i concentration suggesting that higher hoi exposure favored the generation of multi iodinated aromatic products fig 4d f displayed the evolution of tp i and ii in kmno4 i mep system at a fixed i concentration 10 μm with varied kmno4 concentrations of 50 100 and 150 μm respectively under ph 7 condition as can be seen in the case of kmno4 at 50 μm tp i concentrations gradually increased in the first 40 min and then leveled off while tp ii concentrations remained increasing within investigated 80 min similar profiles of tp i and ii were also observed as kmno4 concentration increased to 100 μm while decreased trends of both tp i and ii after about 40 min were observed with kmno4 concentration further increasing to 150 μm moreover higher levels of both tp i and ii were obtained at moderate kmno4 concentration of 100 μm which probably resulted from lower hoi exposure at lower kmno4 concentration or further transformation of tp i and ii at higher kmno4 concentration fig 4g i exemplified the evolution of tp i and ii at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively by 100 μm kmno4 in the presence of 10 μm i as shown ph has a strong influence on the formation of tp i and ii especially for tp ii tp i concentrations gradually increased over the investigated time scales under each ph condition with comparable levels obtained at ph 7 and 9 and a lower level at ph 5 the formation of tp ii was only observed at ph 7 where it kept increasing within investigated 40 min at ph 5 and 9 negligible formation of tp ii was observed these results correlated well with the observed transformation trends of mep by kmno4 in the presence of i under various ph conditions fig 2c 3 7 impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of other selected phenols by kmno4 further experiments were performed to comparatively investigate impacts of i 10 μm on the transformation kinetics of 11 other phenols 10 μm by kmno4 100 μm at ph 7 as shown in fig 5 the presence of i greatly enhanced the transformation kinetics of p hba phenol and brps including 2 brp 3 brp and 4 brp in contrast a slight enhancement of i on the transformation of tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols including 2 cresol 3 cresol and 4 cresol was observed similar to the case of mep the enhanced transformation of p hba phenol and brps in the presence of i could also be well simulated dashed lines in fig 5 by the kinetic model discussed above table s3 as shown in table 1 for p hba phenol and brps the apparent second order rate constants of kmno4 with phenols k kmno4 p 0 35 0 051 23 0 1 7 m 1s 1 were lower or comparable to that of kmno4 with i k kmno4 i 6 9 1 3 m 1s 1 this allowed the accumulation of hoi before the complete transformation of phenols by kmno4 which in turn accelerated phenols transformation as hoi displayed several orders of magnitude higher reactivity towards them k hoi p 1020 27 15400 890 m 1s 1 than kmno4 for tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols the k kmno4 p 23 1 1 7 110 4 3 0 m 1s 1 was generally several times higher than that of k kmno4 i thus kmno4 was the dominant oxidant that contributed to their transformation additionally the linear free energy relationships lfers for these selected phenols transformation by kmno4 and hoi were also investigated a relative rate constant k rel method salter blanc et al 2016 guan et al 2017 sun et al 2018 by using 4 brp as a reference compound was adopted due to the unavailability of the species specific second order rate constants for kmno4 hoi reaction with phenols as discussed above however no obvious relationship was observed between logk rel and pka or hammett constants σ σ or σ of phenols in both cases 3 8 formation of iodinated aromatic products from selected phenols in the kmno4 i system formation of iodinated aromatic products from above 11 phenols 10 μm by treatment of kmno4 100 μm in the presence of i 10 μm was further identified by hplc esi qqqms pis approach as expected for tcs bpa 4 n np and cresols no obvious peak was detected by contrast several iodinated aromatic tps were detected from p hba phenol and brps as shown in table 2 and figs s7 s11 mono and multi iodinated aromatic tps were detected in these cases in addition iodinated quinone like tp i e 2 6 diiodinated quinone even numbered molecular ions zhao et al 2010 huang et al 2013 as well as iodinated polymers were also detected from p hba fig s11 similar tps from hoi reaction with these phenols were also detected data were not shown 3 9 impacts of i on the transformation of mep by kmno4 in natural waters transformation of mep 1 μm by kmno4 12 6 μm at ph 7 in natural water without or with i spiking 1 μm was further studied as shown in fig 6 a an enhancement of i on the transformation of mep was also observed in natural water about 10 mep loss by kmno4 alone was obtained after reaction of 660 min which increased to 45 in the presence of 1 μm i under similar conditions kinetic modeling showed that the transformation of mep by kmno4 in the absence of i was well simulated while a significant overestimation of its transformation was observed in the presence of i dashed lines in fig 6a this result could be attributed to the competitive consumption of hoi by the background matrixes in natural water fig s12 the time course profiles of tp i and ii during the kinetics runs were also monitored by hplc esi qqqms mrm and were shown in fig 6b as can be seen both tps kept increasing over the time periods investigated 4 conclusions impacts of i on the transformation kinetics of mep and selected phenols by kmno4 under various conditions as well as formation of iodinated aromatic products during these processes were investigated in this work the following conclusions can be obtained 1 kmno4 showed a low reactivity towards mep in the absence of i with apparent second order rate constants ranging from 0 065 0 0071 to 1 0 0 1 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 2 the presence of i greatly enhanced the transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 via the effects of hoi in situ formed which showed higher reactivity towards mep than kmno4 the apparent second order rate constants for hoi reaction with mep were 53 4 3022 106 m 1s 1 over the ph range of 5 9 3 a kinetic model involving competition reactions of kmno4 with i kmno4 with mep hoi with kmno4 and hoi with mep could well simulate the observed transformation kinetics of mep by kmno4 in the

19669,stable dispersion of nanoparticles with environmentally friendly materials is important for their various applications including environmental remediation in this study we systematically examined the mechanisms of stable dispersion of two types of tio2 nanoparticles tnps with anatase and rutile crystalline structures by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter humic acid at different phs including at below and above the point of zero charge pzc the results showed that stable dispersion of tnps by humic acid ha at all phs tested can only be achieved with the assistance of ultra sonication the dispersion of tnps by ha differed at the three phs tested generally ha greatly decreased the hydrodynamic diameters of tnps at a very low concentration the dispersion of tnps became relatively stable when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l indicating that this ha concentration is required for stable dispersion of tnps the mechanisms involved in dispersion of tnps by ha included electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction electrostatic repulsion was identified to be the dominant mechanism the dispersion of tnps was enhanced when ha was added before ultra sonication to avoid the partly irreversible re aggregation of tnps after sonication the crystalline phases and concentrations of tnps were also found to influence their stable dispersion the findings from this work enhance understanding of the combined effects of ha ph ultra sonication and crystalline structures of tnps on their stable dispersion the mechanisms identified can improve applications of tnps in environmental water pollution control graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable dispersion titanium oxide nanoparticles humic acid mechanism crystalline structure 1 introduction nanoparticles are promising novel materials due to their unique physicochemical properties including small size large surface area special morphology catalytic reactivity and optical properties ju nam and lead 2008 liu et al 2011 among all nanoparticles titanium dioxide nanoparticles tnps have large production volumes with extensive applications in photo catalysis as uv protection agent for sensing and energy storage chen and mao 2007 although environmental risks of nanoparticles such as toxic effects on aquatic organisms have been widely reported hou et al 2017a 2017b tnps also have promising potential for environmental remediation because of their high photocatalytic activity varshney et al 2016 as low cost and effective sorbents they have been applied in the removal of a variety of heavy metals including arsenic lead and mercury qu et al 2013 they also have a high sorption capacity for organic pollutants wang et al 2008 however the strong aggregation tendency of tnps in the aqueous phase is an obstacle to their applications because aggregation may decrease their exposed surface area and alter their surface properties resulting in decreased sorption capacity and catalytic efficiency ju nam and lead 2008 modification of tnps to prevent their agglomeration has been shown to be effective in improving their photocatalytic performance li et al 2010 enhanced sorption of sulfamethoxazole to carbon nanotubes suspended by ha was also reported pan et al 2013 thus to utilize tnps it is imperative to improve their dispersion in the aqueous phase ultra sonication is more effective than other dispersing techniques in breaking up aggregated tnp clusters it can refine the nps structure by cavitation and erosion thus dispersing them taurozzi et al 2011 however re agglomeration after sonication is often observed indicating that the nanoparticle suspension was not sufficiently stabilized nguyen et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 as previously reported the aggregate size of tnps in tap water increased from 500 nm to 2000 nm within 8 h after sonication for 10 min zhang et al 2008 to prepare stable nanoparticle suspensions various methods were adopted in addition to sonication including optimization of the aqueous chemistry especially ph condition surface modification of nanoparticles and addition of dispersant including polymers and surfactants he and zhao 2007 singh et al 2012 although nanoparticle suspensions can be well stabilized with some dispersants it should be noted that introduction of these synthetic dispersants may bring new potential threats to the aquatic environment dickson et al 2012 the surface properties of the nanoparticles would also be altered by these dispersants thus affecting the interactions between nanoparticles and other pollutants phenrat et al 2009 therefore one of the critical criteria for selecting dispersants is that they should be natural natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in aquatic systems can be an environmentally friendly dispersant option humic acid ha a major component of nom and a typical representative of humic substances may interact with tnps via electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange yang et al 2009 its adsorption would increase the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between individual nanoparticles thereby enhancing their dispersion and stability chen et al 2012 a few studies investigated the influence of humic acid on the stability of tnps through studying variations of the hydrodynamic diameters of tnps aggregates it was observed that tnps can be disaggregated into small clusters with sizes ranging from 50 to 250 nm by ha at a low concentration representative of environmental levels loosli et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 however these studies mainly focused on the aggregation behavior of tnps instead of their dispersion tnps aggregate size was generally adopted as an indicator of their stability at various ha concentrations while aggregate size cannot fully characterize the dispersion of tnps the aggregated large clusters of tnps would settle well after standing or centrifugation the optimal ha concentration for stable tnps dispersion merits further exploration and the connection between aggregate size and dispersion of tnps deserves careful investigation besides the combined effects of sonication and ha on dispersion of tnps has rarely been discussed since tnps were generally pre dispersed and stabilized before use or were purchased as suspension in previous studies loosli et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 the possible difference in stable dispersion of tnps by ha added before and after sonication and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been investigated furthermore impacts of the intrinsic properties of tnps and ha such as the concentration and crystalline structure of tnps and the effects of extrinsic conditions including ph and ultra sonication on the role of ha in dispersing tnps have not yet been elucidated to help systematically understand the underlying mechanisms controlling stable dispersion of tnps the roles of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter ha ph and ultra sonication in the dispersion of tnps with different crystalline structures anatase and rutile were tested and compared the findings of the present work will facilitate the application of stably dispersed tnps for sustainable water pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 tio2 nanoparticles both the pristine anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles atnps and rtnps were used in this study they were purchased from nanjing guanye chemical industry co ltd xrd spectra of atnps and rtnps are available in our previous publications wang et al 2014 the tnp suspension at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg l was prepared by adding tnp powder to the background solution containing 3 mm nacl prepared with milli q water the ph of the suspension was adjusted with 0 1 m hcl and naoh to study the dispersity of tnps with or without the assistance of ultra sonication tnp suspensions were ultra sonicated for 15 min branson 250 digital sonifier usa at 70 amplitude or shaken for 2 d respectively the ph of the suspensions was measured and adjusted again after ultra sonication and shaking to ensure it was maintained at the ph of interest 5 20 0 1 and 8 10 0 1 for atnp 4 30 0 1 and 7 60 0 1 for rtnp aliquots of the suspensions were transferred to 40 ml vials for the following experiments 2 2 humic acid the ha used was extracted from a peat soil collected from amherst massachusetts with 0 1 m na2p4o7 to remove minerals mostly silicates the extracted ha were treated with 0 1 m hcl 0 3 m hf rinsed five times with deionized water freeze dried and then ground to pass through a 250 μm sieve and stored a stock solution of 200 mg l ha was prepared and adjusted to neutral ph wang et al 2011 to minimize bioactivity nan3 200 mg l was added to the stock solution details of the solution preparation are described in our previous publication zhou et al 2012 2 3 dispersion of tnps the z average hydrodynamic diameters and percentage of stably dispersed tnps after centrifugation were measured to examine the impacts of ph ha and tnp concentrations on the dispersion of tnps a certain amount of ha stock solution was added to the vials containing tnp suspension that was prepared as mentioned above to reach a final ha concentration of 0 1 5 10 20 mg l with a total mixture volume of 40 ml the mixed suspension was immediately sampled for aggregate size measurement using a nano zs90 zetasizer malvern instruments technical ltd uk a ratio of a a0 here a0 and a are absorbance of the bulk tnp suspension and the supernatant before and after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min respectively obtained using a uv visible spectrometer at 500 nm was measured to describe the percentage of the stably dispersed tnps zeta potential values of tnps in the suspension 120 min after ha addition were also collected with the same zetasizer to study effects of ultra sonication on the dispersion of tnps ha was added before instead of after ultra sonication and the subsequent sample treatments along with the measurements of z average hydrodynamic diameters and a a0 values were the same as mentioned above details of the measurement of z average size ζ potential and a a0 value are provided as supporting information si 2 4 ha sorption experiments sorption experiments of ha on tnps were conducted to elucidate the impact of ha on their dispersion after sampling for size and ζ potential measurements the remaining tnp suspension was shaken for 2 d at room temperature after mixing the suspension was centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 20 min the total organic carbon toc values of the supernatant were measured using a shimadzu toc5000a the mass difference of ha before and after sorption was then calculated and converted to the sorbed amount of ha a blank control was set up in which tnp suspension was prepared and centrifuged following the same procedure but in the absence of ha the toc value of the blank control was deducted to eliminate the interference from the measurement procedure and tnp impurities details of sorption experiments are provided in si 2 5 sem imaging scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem430 fei co usa was employed to obtain images of tnp aggregates in the aqueous phase samples were prepared by drying on silica slides several drops of tnps suspension which was dispersed following the method in section 2 3 under the desired conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on the dispersion of tnps aggregation behaviors of tnps under different ph conditions have been discussed in previous studies loosli et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2008 these studies highlighted the influence of ph on tnps stability which was mainly through changing their ζ potential values the ζ potential of tnps is generally positive at low ph and gradually decreases to negative values as ph is increased the closeness of ph to pzc determines the electrostatic repulsive force between nanoparticles therefore influencing their aggregation behaviors loosli et al 2014 thus dispersion of different tnps can differ greatly in the aqueous phase with ph variation the measured pzc values of tnps were about 6 60 0 1 and 5 90 0 1 for atnp and rtnp respectively fig s2 consistent with the pzc values of tnps reported previously 4 2 6 8 liu et al 2013 to compare dispersion of atnps and rtnps for different ph conditions three representative ph regions were chosen pzc pzc and pzc besides the pzc the other two ph values were set with equal intervals to the pzc values 5 20 0 1 and 8 10 0 1 for atnp 4 30 0 1 and 7 60 0 1 for rtnp the z average hydrodynamic diameters of atnps and rtnps in suspensions prepared by shaking at the various ph values were measured but clearly the aggregate sizes failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer because of the high polydispersion index and fluorescence of the particles in suspension the suspension became transparent with evident sedimentation after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min hence to make atnps and rtnps well dispersed shaking is insufficient and additional techniques are required among all the reported dispersion methods including vortexing bath and probe sonications probe sonication has been shown to be the most effective one and has been widely adopted to disperse the aggregated nanoparticles dickson et al 2012 therefore both atnps and rtnps suspensions at different phs were ultra sonicated with a probe sonicator for 15 min prior to particle size measurement dispersion of tnps was greatly enhanced with the assistance of ultra sonication as most of the collected data met the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer except for some cases with values higher than 2000 nm the impact of ph variation on dispersion of tnps can thus be studied atnps and rtnps exhibited similar size variation patterns in response to ph changes fig 1 large aggregates were formed rapidly at the pzc for both types of tnps with dramatic increase in aggregate size within 30 min the electrostatic repulsion between individual tnp particles was relatively weak at a ph in the vicinity of pzc which facilitated agglomeration suttiponparnit et al 2011 the aggregation rates were comparatively slower at both high and low phs for atnps and rtnps especially at low ph for atnps and high ph for rtnps despite the above mentioned similarities some differences in dispersion behaviors of atnps and rtnps under different ph conditions were notable the smallest aggregate size and the lowest aggregation rate were observed at low ph for atnps while rtnps at high ph exhibited the best dispersion fig 1 this can be ascribed to their different ζ potential variation patterns as presented in fig s2 the absolute value of the ζ potential of rtnps at high ph was higher than that at low ph 35 7 mv and 20 3 mv respectively hence the electrostatic repulsion between individual rtnps at low ph was weaker than that at high ph which facilitated formation of larger clusters although the absolute values of the ζ potential of atnps were close at high and low ph 26 2 mv and 22 9 mv respectively a larger aggregate size was observed at high ph the higher ionic strength resulted from naoh addition for ph adjustment which could weaken the electrostatic repulsion between particles via double layer compression thus increasing the aggregate size of atnps therefore it can be concluded that the closeness of ph to pzc which determined the absolute value of the ζ potential was influential for the dispersion of tnps the pzc values of tnps are dependent on many factors it was found that the pzc of atnps decreased from 6 0 to 3 8 as the original size of atnps increased from 6 nm to 104 nm chowdhury et al 2013 suttiponparnit et al 2011 which implied that the original particle size of tnp may affect its pzc the pzc of tnps is also affected by the technique used for their synthesis a related study also showed that constituents of tnps such as silicon and phosphorous which were introduced to tnps during synthesis led to a deviation of their pzc values liu et al 2011 therefore tnps could still have different pzc values even when the crystalline structure and the initial particle size of tnps are identical hence it is crucial to select a proper type of tnp with a pzc far away from the ph in the aqueous phase of interest to achieve good dispersion although the aggregate size of atnps at low ph was stable for 120 min and was the smallest among the various phs tested the corresponding a a0 value after centrifugation was as low as 0 215 indicating an unsatisfactory dispersion therefore it is difficult to acquire an ideal stable dispersion of tnps solely by selecting tnp with proper pzc or adjusting aqueous phase ph instead the assistance of a dispersant is required 3 2 effect of humic acid on dispersion of tnps the presence of natural organic matter may either enhance or suppress the stability of metal oxide nanoparticles depending on ph and natural organic matter concentration loosli et al 2014 ghosh et al 2008 to systematically understand how ha influences the dispersion of tnps the aggregate sizes and a a0 values of atnps and rtnps in the presence of ha at different concentrations for distinct ph conditions were analyzed and compared the initial study was conducted without the assistance of ultra sonication however it was observed that the aggregate size of both atnps and rtnps under all ph conditions failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer even at the highest ha concentration tested indicating that the aggregates of tnps in the aqueous phase could not be dispersed with only ha addition the following dispersion experiment was thus conducted with the assistance of ultra sonication as a pre dispersing step both atnp and rtnp suspensions at different phs were ultra sonicated for 15 min prior to the addition of ha with various concentrations fig 2 both atnps and rtnps exhibited good stability at most of the tested ha concentrations which was illustrated by their aggregate sizes remaining constant over 120 min implying that ha was capable of stabilizing the small tnp clusters that were broken up by ultra sonication further analysis showed that the influence of ha concentration on dispersion of two types of tnps was a function of ph at low ph strong aggregation of both atnps and rtnps was observed for an ha concentration below 1 mg l indicated by the obvious increasing trend of their aggregate size one notable observation was that although the aggregate size of atnps without ha addition 0 mg l was stable for 120 min at around 200 nm the corresponding a a0 value was much lower 0 215 0 094 than those measured for higher ha concentrations 0 46 0 50 implying a lesser and unstable dispersion as the ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l the aggregate size of atnps was also stable at around 200 nm and did not decrease over time further increase in ha concentration did not significantly change the particle size of atnps the a a0 ratios of the atnp suspensions were close 0 460 0 051 at ha 5 mg l 0 504 0 008 at ha 10 mg l and 0 500 0 016 at ha 20 mg l reflecting similar dispersion of atnps in the presence of ha with a concentration over 5 mg l in comparison as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l aggregate size of rtnps decreased to almost a constant value at about 500 nm during measurement and remained unchanged as ha concentration was increased to 10 mg l when ha concentration was further increased to 20 mg l the aggregate size of rtnps slightly decreased to around 360 nm the corresponding a a0 ratios of rtnps were 0 147 0 003 0 161 0 012 and 0 198 0 002 at ha concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively evidently a minimal ha concentration of 5 mg l is required to stably disperse both atnps and rtnps with the assistance of ultra sonication at low ph above this ha concentration dispersion of these two types of tnps may not be significantly enhanced the dlvo theory was used to evaluate the stability of tnps the calculated results were generally in accordance with the corresponding aggregate sizes and a a0 values the net energy between particles was attractive for atnps and rtnps at low ph with ha concentrations of 0 and 1 mg l a net energy barrier of approximately 70 75 kt and 140 185 kt between atnps and rtnps respectively appeared as ha concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l fig s1 details of the dlvo calculation are provided in si the roles of ha in the dispersion of tnps can be attributed to the ζ potential changes resulting from ha sorption ha sorption may increase the net surface charge of tnps resulting in a higher electric double layer repulsion energy baalousha 2009 the net energy barriers between particles were enhanced accordingly leading to fragmentation of agglomerates it was further reported that natural organic matter at a concentration of 1 mg l was able to cause a remarkable ζ potential inversion of metal oxide nanoparticles including tnps decreasing their ζ potentials to below 30 mv zhang et al 2009 another study also consistently showed that sorption of a small amount of natural organic matter to tnps greatly changed their ζ potential resulting in better dispersion of tnps loosli et al 2014 to test whether the dispersion enhancement of tnps induced by ha addition mainly resulted from their ζ potential changes ζ potential changes of two types of tnps induced by ha concentration variation at different phs were analyzed fig 3 at low ph 1 mg l ha neutralized the surface positive charges of tnps decreasing the initial positive ζ potential values of atnps and rtnps to around 4 mv and 9 mv respectively which in turn decreased the electrostatic repulsion between particles this explained why the addition of 1 mg l ha led to aggregation of both types of tnps at low ph as ha concentration was increased beyond 5 mg l ζ potential of tnps dropped further and reached almost a constant value of around 40 mv when ph value was higher than the pzc both atnps and rtnps showed the best dispersion specifically at a ha concentration of 1 mg l aggregate sizes of both atnps and rtnps were around 200 nm within 120 min much smaller than those at other phs correspondingly at high ph the initial ζ potential values of tnps before ha addition were also the lowest 20 mv for atnps and 30 mv for rtnps they were decreased to 25 80 mv for atnps and 35 65 mv for rtnps with the addition of 1 mg l ha which explained the much better dispersion of tnps at high ph than at low ph as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l both atnps and rtnps exhibited constant aggregate sizes below 200 nm their sizes remained unchanged with a further increase of ha concentration the a a0 ratios of atnps and rtnps were also constants with values ranging 0 48 0 51 and 0 72 0 74 when ha concentration was higher than 5 mg l the ζ potential variation patterns of atnps and rtnps at both low and high phs were generally in agreement with those of their aggregate size figs 2 and 3 ζ potentials decreased with increasing ha concentration below 5 mg l then became relatively stable at around 40 mv even when the ha concentration was further increased to 20 mg l fig 3 dlvo calculation results showed similar trends the net energy barrier became relatively constant with ha concentration higher than 5 mg l fig s1 hence the ζ potential changes of tnps resulting from ha sorption prominently regulated dispersion of tnps at low and high phs apart from electrostatic interaction other influencing factors on the stability of tnps stemming from ha sorption have been documented and the steric hindrance effect was the most highlighted one loosli et al 2014 domingos et al 2009 its effect on nps stability was considered to extend the classical dlvo theory mudunkotuwa and grassian 2010 which is often applied to explain the aggregation behaviors of tnps without taking the non dlvo forces into consideration ghosh et al 2008 sorption of ha on tnps may increase the surface coating thickness thereby enhancing their stability although the exact coating thickness is difficult to measure baalousha 2009 another effect of ha sorption includes hydrophobic interaction as a hydrophobic substance with abundant hydrophobic moieties ha may enhance the hydrophobicity of tnps once sorbed onto their surfaces thereby strengthening the interactions between particles in the aqueous phase and promoting aggregation to test whether these effects influenced the dispersion of tnps the amount of ha sorbed on tnps at the three tested phs was measured it was found that ha sorption on tnps especially atnps generally increased with increasing initial ha concentrations at all phs tested fig 4 an increase in ha sorption may enhance both the steric hindrance effect and the hydrophobic interactions between solid particles while the dispersion of tnps at low and high ph was not affected with the increase of ha concentration the dispersion enhancement resulting from the steric hindrance effect may have been offset to a large extent by the aggregation enhancement caused by hydrophobic interaction at low and high phs their joint effect on the dispersion of tnps was negligible when tnps were well dispersed as small clusters by electrostatic repulsion when ph was at the respective pzc values of atnps and rtnps aggregate size of atnps increased rapidly and failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer without ha addition aggregate size was significantly reduced to around 815 nm at a ha concentration of 1 mg l suggesting that 1 mg l ha greatly enhanced dispersion of atnps however a slight increase in the aggregate size of atnps could still be observed at this low ha concentration level as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l aggregate size of atnps dramatically decreased to approximately 450 530 nm much smaller than that at a ha concentration of 1 mg l 815 1030 nm dispersion of atnps tended to be less pronounced when ha concentration was over 5 mg l as indicated by respective aggregate sizes of 675 760 nm at 10 mg l ha and 560 650 nm at 20 mg l ha this implied that a ha concentration of 5 mg l was the optimal level for dispersion of atnps at pzc however the dispersion behaviors of rtnps at pzc was entirely different from that of atnps particularly aggregate size of rtnps was around 500 nm at 1 mg l ha and around 450 nm at ha concentration higher than 5 mg l with the corresponding a a0 values being 0 09 and around 0 13 respectively the corresponding dlvo results were consistent with the variation patterns of aggregate size and a a0 values fig s1 despite the different aggregate sizes and a a0 values of atnps and rtnps it can be concluded that a ha concentration at 5 mg l with the assistance of ultra sonication was able to achieve the best dispersion of both atnps and rtnps at their pzc however the corresponding a a0 value was lower and aggregate size was larger compared to those obtained at low and high ph indicating tnps could not be stably dispersed at pzc the unconformity between the variation patterns of the aggregate size of atnps and that of their ζ potential values was observed at the pzc of atnps when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l figs 2 and 3 specifically the ζ potential values of atnps remained almost constant when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l while the ha concentration increase led to a considerable difference in aggregate size which could result from higher ha sorption on atnps sorption of ha increased with increasing initial ha concentration at the pzc fig 4 resulting in a stronger steric hindrance effect consequently the aggregate size of tnps was expected to decrease however the aggregate size of atnps in the presence of ha at a concentration over 5 mg l at the pzc followed the order of ha 5 mg l ha 20 mg l ha 10 mg l this demonstrated that as ha sorption increased the enhancement of hydrophobicity interaction between particles partly offset the steric hindrance effect resulting in aggregate size variation of atnps at the pzc in comparison rtnps size at the pzc remained around 450 nm with ha concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg l which could be explained by the smaller increase in ha sorption on rtnps with increasing ha concentration fig 4 in addition rtnps at their pzc were better dispersed than atnps especially at a ha concentration below 1 mg l as indicated by their smaller aggregate size which can be a result of the higher corresponding ζ potential value of rtnps fig 3 therefore when ζ potential was constant higher ha sorption on tnps may still influence their dispersion if they were not highly dispersed and had relatively large sizes 500 nm like atnps at its pzc hence the impacts of ha on the dispersion of tnps resulted from a combination of the effects which stem from electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction among which electrostatic repulsion was the most influential factor however differences in ζ potential and ha sorption alone could not fully explain different aggregate sizes of tnps at various phs for instance when ha concentration was over 5 mg l aggregate size of atnps at pzc was much larger than that at other phs while their ζ potential values at three phs were similar and ha sorption on atnps at the pzc was neither the highest nor lowest in comparison with other ph values apparently ph may have lasting effects on tnps dispersion even when their ζ potential was already decreased by ha sorption this may be explained by the observation that tnps at different ph values showed a dissimilar degree of re aggregation after ultra sonication even though ha was added immediately once regrouped aggregates can apparently only be partly fragmented by the ha added to further support this explanation control experiments were designed in which all procedures were kept identical to the previous ones except that ha 10 mg l was added before instead of after ultra sonication the mixture of tnps suspension with ha was ultra sonicated for 15 min and its z average hydrodynamic diameters variation over 120 min as well as the a a0 values after centrifugation were measured to compare with the previous results two ph values were selected for both atnps and rtnps at which their aggregate sizes were previously observed to be relatively large and small respectively when ha was added immediately after ultra sonication notable differences in dispersion of tnps were observed between the experiments with pre and post addition of ha fig 5 at ph 6 60 ha addition after ultra sonication only decreased atnps size from 1300 nm to about 1000 nm within 120 min while ha addition before ultra sonication led to a constant atnps size of less than 200 nm the corresponding a a0 values of these two groups were 0 25 and 0 48 respectively also exhibiting a remarkable difference likewise at ph 4 30 the aggregate size of rtnps was approximately 400 420 nm and the a a0 value was about 0 18 when ha was added after ultra sonication whereas with ha added before ultra sonication the corresponding values were 150 nm and 0 82 respectively measurements of ζ potential values of tnps in both cases obtained similar results fig s3 which excluded the possibility that the dispersion difference of atnps at ph 6 60 and rtnps at ph 4 30 observed with ha added before or after ultra sonication resulted from ζ potential changes of the particles therefore the rapid re aggregation of tnps before ha addition which was demonstrated in fig 1 was a reasonable explanation for the larger aggregate size and lower a a0 value when ha was added after ultra sonication as mentioned before ultra sonication was capable of breaking up large tnp clusters into smaller ones which were not stable at the pzc and they re agglomerated into larger clusters immediately without ha addition the re agglomeration occurred so fast that it was inevitable in some cases although ha was added as quickly as possible after sonication a portion of the regrouped agglomerates could be fragmented by the added ha whereas the remaining portion of the aggregates could not be re dispersed even at high ha concentrations hence the hydrodynamic diameters of atnps were much larger at the pzc than those at other ph values although their ζ potentials were as low as 40 mv after ha addition in contrast the aggregate sizes and a a0 values of tnps were similar with pre and post addition of ha when their aggregate sizes were relatively small 200 nm in either case such as atnps at ph 5 20 and rtnps at ph 7 30 fig 5 this implied that the small clusters of atnps at low ph and rtnps at high ph would not regroup immediately after sonication which was in accordance with their dispersion kinetics in the absence of ha fig 1 rtnps at high ph exhibited great dispersion with a constant aggregate size of around 150 nm this was the minimal size of both atnps and rtnps achieved in the present study despite their nominal particle size of 20 nm a previous study also found that once formed large cluster of tnps could not be broken up back into their nominal size penn et al 2001 the authors ascribed this phenomenon to the fact that tnps may irreversibly aggregate via chemical bonds it should be highlighted that although the aggregate sizes of atnps at low ph and rtnps at high ph were comparable approximately 200 nm for atnps and 150 nm for rtnps their dispersion was quite different demonstrated by a a0 value of 0 803 0 002 for rtnps at high ph and 0 477 0 006 for atnps at low ph fig 5 to further probe the impacts of re aggregation of tnps on their dispersion in the presence of ha the dependence of the tnps size on the time intervals between ultra sonication and ha addition was studied suspensions containing 100 mg l atnps were ultra sonicated at ph 6 60 and then left to stand quiescently after sonication for 0 60 min before adding ha 10 mg l the aggregate size of atnps was measured 2 h after ha addition a rise in aggregate size of atnps was observed with an increase in the quiescent standing time which indicated that the irreversible portion of atnps clusters formed in the re aggregation process gradually increased after sonication fig s4 when ha was added 60 min after ultra sonication the particle size of atnps exceeded 800 nm which was about 200 nm larger than observed when ha was added immediately hence to keep tnps in suspension especially when ph is in the vicinity of the pzc of tnps the time interval between sonication and addition of ha should be as short as possible the best dispersion of tnps can be achieved if ha is added to tnps suspensions before sonication to visualize the difference in dispersion of tnps by ha added before and after ultra sonication sem images for atnps at phs of 5 20 and 6 60 and rtnps at phs of 4 30 and 7 60 at a ha concentration of 10 mg l were taken to compare the conformation of tnp aggregates in these two scenarios fig s5 the morphology of rtnps aggregates was similar in fig s5 a and b where rtnps aggregated to form small clusters with sizes below 200 nm whereas the rtnps cluster was larger in fig s5 c when ha was added after ultra sonication at ph 4 30 compared to that in fig s5 d similarly different extents of atnps aggregation at ph 6 60 can be observed between fig s5 e and f especially in the region circled in red whereas the atnps aggregate showed similar size in fig s5 g and h at ph 5 20 overall the extent of aggregation of tnps shown in sem images was in accordance with their corresponding hydrodynamic diameters supporting the results of the joint effects of ha and ultra sonication on the dispersion of atnps and rtnps at different ph values 3 3 effect of tnp concentration on its stable dispersion as discussed above the added ha concentration was influential for the stable dispersion of tnps to extend our knowledge on how tnp concentration may affect its stable dispersion dispersion of atnps at two concentrations 100 mg l and 200 mg l with the assistance of ultra sonication was tested at different phs two ph values 6 60 and 5 20 were chosen to explore the effect of tnp concentration on its dispersion when electrostatic repulsion was weak and strong respectively the impact of tnp concentration on its dispersion differed as a function of ph fig 6 at ph 6 60 aggregate size of atnps at 200 mg l was remarkably higher than that at 100 mg l for all ha concentrations tested besides there was a slight trend of increasing aggregate size of atnps over 120 min when its concentration was 100 mg l and ha concentration was 1 mg l while the rising trend became much more obvious as atnp concentration was increased to 200 mg l indicating a stronger aggregation tendency fig 6 atnps at a higher concentration more readily formed larger aggregates while the value and variation pattern of their ζ potential were generally similar with those at a lower concentration figs 3 and 7 this could be attributed to the higher collision probability of individual particles at a higher concentration maximova and dahl 2006 besides atnps at a higher concentration exhibited lower ha sorption with an increase in ha concentration figs 4 and 7 which may also contribute to the larger cluster formation in comparison at ph 5 20 no notable difference in aggregate size and its variation pattern of atnps at different concentrations was observed regardless of ha concentrations and their a a0 values below 10 mg l ha were also similar 0 504 0 008 for 100 mg l atnps 0 477 0 006 for 200 mg l atnps a study on the aggregation of iron oxide nps obtained similar results in that the rise in their aggregate size brought about by a nanoparticle concentration increase was more significant at a ph in the vicinity of the pzc as compared to other phs baalousha 2009 aggregation theory can explain different impacts of the concentration of tnps on their dispersion as reported aggregation at the pzc and high low phs can be classified into two regimes known as the diffusion limited cluster aggregation dlca regime and reaction limited cluster aggregation rlca regime sandkuhler et al 2005 dlca refers to the aggregation that is not restrained by repulsive force therefore the diffusion and collision of tnps with higher concentration resulted in larger aggregate size which was exactly the case for atnps at the pzc in contrast for the rlca regime electrostatic repulsion becomes the dominant factor and the formation of aggregated clusters is regulated by the probability of adhesion vikesland et al 2016 due to strong electrostatic repulsion at low ph the probability of tnps adhering to each other was very low and a higher tnps concentration could not lead to a higher extent of aggregation overall a higher atnps concentration did generally facilitate their aggregation to some extent although the concentration effect was less pronounced when the ph was far away from the pzc and electrostatic repulsion between tnps was strong besides the optimal tnp ha concentration ratio for tnp dispersion was not a fixed value according to our experimental observations hence an optimal ha concentration should be determined experimentally to maximize its dispersing efficiency depending on factors which include tnp concentration and ph 4 conclusions the impacts of ha and ultra sonication on the dispersion of tnps with two crystalline structures at different phs and tnp concentrations were systematically investigated in this work the main conclusions can be summarized as follows stable dispersion of tnps requires both ha and the assistance of ultra sonication ultra sonication was effective in breaking up tnps agglomerations but re aggregation of tnps after ultra sonication was inevitable in the absence of ha especially at the pzc of tnps in general tnps can be better dispersed with ha and the simultaneous assistance of ultra sonication ha can stabilize tnps at a very low concentration mainly through increasing the electrostatic repulsion between particles non dlvo forces brought about by ha sorption include steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction which can also affect tnp dispersion but these effects are relatively weak an optimal method for preparing environmentally friendly and stably dispersed tnp suspensions for practical applications can be developed by optimizing physicochemical conditions including ph and tnp concentrations such stably dispersed tnps may then have higher efficiency as photocatalysts due to an increase in surface area the suspensions can also be used as a sorbent to remove pollutants from the aqueous phase acknowledgments this study was supported by the national science fund for distinguished young scientist 41525005 the 973 program

19669,stable dispersion of nanoparticles with environmentally friendly materials is important for their various applications including environmental remediation in this study we systematically examined the mechanisms of stable dispersion of two types of tio2 nanoparticles tnps with anatase and rutile crystalline structures by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter humic acid at different phs including at below and above the point of zero charge pzc the results showed that stable dispersion of tnps by humic acid ha at all phs tested can only be achieved with the assistance of ultra sonication the dispersion of tnps by ha differed at the three phs tested generally ha greatly decreased the hydrodynamic diameters of tnps at a very low concentration the dispersion of tnps became relatively stable when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l indicating that this ha concentration is required for stable dispersion of tnps the mechanisms involved in dispersion of tnps by ha included electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction electrostatic repulsion was identified to be the dominant mechanism the dispersion of tnps was enhanced when ha was added before ultra sonication to avoid the partly irreversible re aggregation of tnps after sonication the crystalline phases and concentrations of tnps were also found to influence their stable dispersion the findings from this work enhance understanding of the combined effects of ha ph ultra sonication and crystalline structures of tnps on their stable dispersion the mechanisms identified can improve applications of tnps in environmental water pollution control graphical abstract image 1 keywords stable dispersion titanium oxide nanoparticles humic acid mechanism crystalline structure 1 introduction nanoparticles are promising novel materials due to their unique physicochemical properties including small size large surface area special morphology catalytic reactivity and optical properties ju nam and lead 2008 liu et al 2011 among all nanoparticles titanium dioxide nanoparticles tnps have large production volumes with extensive applications in photo catalysis as uv protection agent for sensing and energy storage chen and mao 2007 although environmental risks of nanoparticles such as toxic effects on aquatic organisms have been widely reported hou et al 2017a 2017b tnps also have promising potential for environmental remediation because of their high photocatalytic activity varshney et al 2016 as low cost and effective sorbents they have been applied in the removal of a variety of heavy metals including arsenic lead and mercury qu et al 2013 they also have a high sorption capacity for organic pollutants wang et al 2008 however the strong aggregation tendency of tnps in the aqueous phase is an obstacle to their applications because aggregation may decrease their exposed surface area and alter their surface properties resulting in decreased sorption capacity and catalytic efficiency ju nam and lead 2008 modification of tnps to prevent their agglomeration has been shown to be effective in improving their photocatalytic performance li et al 2010 enhanced sorption of sulfamethoxazole to carbon nanotubes suspended by ha was also reported pan et al 2013 thus to utilize tnps it is imperative to improve their dispersion in the aqueous phase ultra sonication is more effective than other dispersing techniques in breaking up aggregated tnp clusters it can refine the nps structure by cavitation and erosion thus dispersing them taurozzi et al 2011 however re agglomeration after sonication is often observed indicating that the nanoparticle suspension was not sufficiently stabilized nguyen et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 as previously reported the aggregate size of tnps in tap water increased from 500 nm to 2000 nm within 8 h after sonication for 10 min zhang et al 2008 to prepare stable nanoparticle suspensions various methods were adopted in addition to sonication including optimization of the aqueous chemistry especially ph condition surface modification of nanoparticles and addition of dispersant including polymers and surfactants he and zhao 2007 singh et al 2012 although nanoparticle suspensions can be well stabilized with some dispersants it should be noted that introduction of these synthetic dispersants may bring new potential threats to the aquatic environment dickson et al 2012 the surface properties of the nanoparticles would also be altered by these dispersants thus affecting the interactions between nanoparticles and other pollutants phenrat et al 2009 therefore one of the critical criteria for selecting dispersants is that they should be natural natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in aquatic systems can be an environmentally friendly dispersant option humic acid ha a major component of nom and a typical representative of humic substances may interact with tnps via electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange yang et al 2009 its adsorption would increase the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between individual nanoparticles thereby enhancing their dispersion and stability chen et al 2012 a few studies investigated the influence of humic acid on the stability of tnps through studying variations of the hydrodynamic diameters of tnps aggregates it was observed that tnps can be disaggregated into small clusters with sizes ranging from 50 to 250 nm by ha at a low concentration representative of environmental levels loosli et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 however these studies mainly focused on the aggregation behavior of tnps instead of their dispersion tnps aggregate size was generally adopted as an indicator of their stability at various ha concentrations while aggregate size cannot fully characterize the dispersion of tnps the aggregated large clusters of tnps would settle well after standing or centrifugation the optimal ha concentration for stable tnps dispersion merits further exploration and the connection between aggregate size and dispersion of tnps deserves careful investigation besides the combined effects of sonication and ha on dispersion of tnps has rarely been discussed since tnps were generally pre dispersed and stabilized before use or were purchased as suspension in previous studies loosli et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 the possible difference in stable dispersion of tnps by ha added before and after sonication and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been investigated furthermore impacts of the intrinsic properties of tnps and ha such as the concentration and crystalline structure of tnps and the effects of extrinsic conditions including ph and ultra sonication on the role of ha in dispersing tnps have not yet been elucidated to help systematically understand the underlying mechanisms controlling stable dispersion of tnps the roles of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter ha ph and ultra sonication in the dispersion of tnps with different crystalline structures anatase and rutile were tested and compared the findings of the present work will facilitate the application of stably dispersed tnps for sustainable water pollution control 2 materials and methods 2 1 tio2 nanoparticles both the pristine anatase and rutile tio2 nanoparticles atnps and rtnps were used in this study they were purchased from nanjing guanye chemical industry co ltd xrd spectra of atnps and rtnps are available in our previous publications wang et al 2014 the tnp suspension at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg l was prepared by adding tnp powder to the background solution containing 3 mm nacl prepared with milli q water the ph of the suspension was adjusted with 0 1 m hcl and naoh to study the dispersity of tnps with or without the assistance of ultra sonication tnp suspensions were ultra sonicated for 15 min branson 250 digital sonifier usa at 70 amplitude or shaken for 2 d respectively the ph of the suspensions was measured and adjusted again after ultra sonication and shaking to ensure it was maintained at the ph of interest 5 20 0 1 and 8 10 0 1 for atnp 4 30 0 1 and 7 60 0 1 for rtnp aliquots of the suspensions were transferred to 40 ml vials for the following experiments 2 2 humic acid the ha used was extracted from a peat soil collected from amherst massachusetts with 0 1 m na2p4o7 to remove minerals mostly silicates the extracted ha were treated with 0 1 m hcl 0 3 m hf rinsed five times with deionized water freeze dried and then ground to pass through a 250 μm sieve and stored a stock solution of 200 mg l ha was prepared and adjusted to neutral ph wang et al 2011 to minimize bioactivity nan3 200 mg l was added to the stock solution details of the solution preparation are described in our previous publication zhou et al 2012 2 3 dispersion of tnps the z average hydrodynamic diameters and percentage of stably dispersed tnps after centrifugation were measured to examine the impacts of ph ha and tnp concentrations on the dispersion of tnps a certain amount of ha stock solution was added to the vials containing tnp suspension that was prepared as mentioned above to reach a final ha concentration of 0 1 5 10 20 mg l with a total mixture volume of 40 ml the mixed suspension was immediately sampled for aggregate size measurement using a nano zs90 zetasizer malvern instruments technical ltd uk a ratio of a a0 here a0 and a are absorbance of the bulk tnp suspension and the supernatant before and after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min respectively obtained using a uv visible spectrometer at 500 nm was measured to describe the percentage of the stably dispersed tnps zeta potential values of tnps in the suspension 120 min after ha addition were also collected with the same zetasizer to study effects of ultra sonication on the dispersion of tnps ha was added before instead of after ultra sonication and the subsequent sample treatments along with the measurements of z average hydrodynamic diameters and a a0 values were the same as mentioned above details of the measurement of z average size ζ potential and a a0 value are provided as supporting information si 2 4 ha sorption experiments sorption experiments of ha on tnps were conducted to elucidate the impact of ha on their dispersion after sampling for size and ζ potential measurements the remaining tnp suspension was shaken for 2 d at room temperature after mixing the suspension was centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 20 min the total organic carbon toc values of the supernatant were measured using a shimadzu toc5000a the mass difference of ha before and after sorption was then calculated and converted to the sorbed amount of ha a blank control was set up in which tnp suspension was prepared and centrifuged following the same procedure but in the absence of ha the toc value of the blank control was deducted to eliminate the interference from the measurement procedure and tnp impurities details of sorption experiments are provided in si 2 5 sem imaging scanning electron microscopy sem nova nanosem430 fei co usa was employed to obtain images of tnp aggregates in the aqueous phase samples were prepared by drying on silica slides several drops of tnps suspension which was dispersed following the method in section 2 3 under the desired conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of ph on the dispersion of tnps aggregation behaviors of tnps under different ph conditions have been discussed in previous studies loosli et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2008 these studies highlighted the influence of ph on tnps stability which was mainly through changing their ζ potential values the ζ potential of tnps is generally positive at low ph and gradually decreases to negative values as ph is increased the closeness of ph to pzc determines the electrostatic repulsive force between nanoparticles therefore influencing their aggregation behaviors loosli et al 2014 thus dispersion of different tnps can differ greatly in the aqueous phase with ph variation the measured pzc values of tnps were about 6 60 0 1 and 5 90 0 1 for atnp and rtnp respectively fig s2 consistent with the pzc values of tnps reported previously 4 2 6 8 liu et al 2013 to compare dispersion of atnps and rtnps for different ph conditions three representative ph regions were chosen pzc pzc and pzc besides the pzc the other two ph values were set with equal intervals to the pzc values 5 20 0 1 and 8 10 0 1 for atnp 4 30 0 1 and 7 60 0 1 for rtnp the z average hydrodynamic diameters of atnps and rtnps in suspensions prepared by shaking at the various ph values were measured but clearly the aggregate sizes failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer because of the high polydispersion index and fluorescence of the particles in suspension the suspension became transparent with evident sedimentation after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 min hence to make atnps and rtnps well dispersed shaking is insufficient and additional techniques are required among all the reported dispersion methods including vortexing bath and probe sonications probe sonication has been shown to be the most effective one and has been widely adopted to disperse the aggregated nanoparticles dickson et al 2012 therefore both atnps and rtnps suspensions at different phs were ultra sonicated with a probe sonicator for 15 min prior to particle size measurement dispersion of tnps was greatly enhanced with the assistance of ultra sonication as most of the collected data met the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer except for some cases with values higher than 2000 nm the impact of ph variation on dispersion of tnps can thus be studied atnps and rtnps exhibited similar size variation patterns in response to ph changes fig 1 large aggregates were formed rapidly at the pzc for both types of tnps with dramatic increase in aggregate size within 30 min the electrostatic repulsion between individual tnp particles was relatively weak at a ph in the vicinity of pzc which facilitated agglomeration suttiponparnit et al 2011 the aggregation rates were comparatively slower at both high and low phs for atnps and rtnps especially at low ph for atnps and high ph for rtnps despite the above mentioned similarities some differences in dispersion behaviors of atnps and rtnps under different ph conditions were notable the smallest aggregate size and the lowest aggregation rate were observed at low ph for atnps while rtnps at high ph exhibited the best dispersion fig 1 this can be ascribed to their different ζ potential variation patterns as presented in fig s2 the absolute value of the ζ potential of rtnps at high ph was higher than that at low ph 35 7 mv and 20 3 mv respectively hence the electrostatic repulsion between individual rtnps at low ph was weaker than that at high ph which facilitated formation of larger clusters although the absolute values of the ζ potential of atnps were close at high and low ph 26 2 mv and 22 9 mv respectively a larger aggregate size was observed at high ph the higher ionic strength resulted from naoh addition for ph adjustment which could weaken the electrostatic repulsion between particles via double layer compression thus increasing the aggregate size of atnps therefore it can be concluded that the closeness of ph to pzc which determined the absolute value of the ζ potential was influential for the dispersion of tnps the pzc values of tnps are dependent on many factors it was found that the pzc of atnps decreased from 6 0 to 3 8 as the original size of atnps increased from 6 nm to 104 nm chowdhury et al 2013 suttiponparnit et al 2011 which implied that the original particle size of tnp may affect its pzc the pzc of tnps is also affected by the technique used for their synthesis a related study also showed that constituents of tnps such as silicon and phosphorous which were introduced to tnps during synthesis led to a deviation of their pzc values liu et al 2011 therefore tnps could still have different pzc values even when the crystalline structure and the initial particle size of tnps are identical hence it is crucial to select a proper type of tnp with a pzc far away from the ph in the aqueous phase of interest to achieve good dispersion although the aggregate size of atnps at low ph was stable for 120 min and was the smallest among the various phs tested the corresponding a a0 value after centrifugation was as low as 0 215 indicating an unsatisfactory dispersion therefore it is difficult to acquire an ideal stable dispersion of tnps solely by selecting tnp with proper pzc or adjusting aqueous phase ph instead the assistance of a dispersant is required 3 2 effect of humic acid on dispersion of tnps the presence of natural organic matter may either enhance or suppress the stability of metal oxide nanoparticles depending on ph and natural organic matter concentration loosli et al 2014 ghosh et al 2008 to systematically understand how ha influences the dispersion of tnps the aggregate sizes and a a0 values of atnps and rtnps in the presence of ha at different concentrations for distinct ph conditions were analyzed and compared the initial study was conducted without the assistance of ultra sonication however it was observed that the aggregate size of both atnps and rtnps under all ph conditions failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer even at the highest ha concentration tested indicating that the aggregates of tnps in the aqueous phase could not be dispersed with only ha addition the following dispersion experiment was thus conducted with the assistance of ultra sonication as a pre dispersing step both atnp and rtnp suspensions at different phs were ultra sonicated for 15 min prior to the addition of ha with various concentrations fig 2 both atnps and rtnps exhibited good stability at most of the tested ha concentrations which was illustrated by their aggregate sizes remaining constant over 120 min implying that ha was capable of stabilizing the small tnp clusters that were broken up by ultra sonication further analysis showed that the influence of ha concentration on dispersion of two types of tnps was a function of ph at low ph strong aggregation of both atnps and rtnps was observed for an ha concentration below 1 mg l indicated by the obvious increasing trend of their aggregate size one notable observation was that although the aggregate size of atnps without ha addition 0 mg l was stable for 120 min at around 200 nm the corresponding a a0 value was much lower 0 215 0 094 than those measured for higher ha concentrations 0 46 0 50 implying a lesser and unstable dispersion as the ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l the aggregate size of atnps was also stable at around 200 nm and did not decrease over time further increase in ha concentration did not significantly change the particle size of atnps the a a0 ratios of the atnp suspensions were close 0 460 0 051 at ha 5 mg l 0 504 0 008 at ha 10 mg l and 0 500 0 016 at ha 20 mg l reflecting similar dispersion of atnps in the presence of ha with a concentration over 5 mg l in comparison as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l aggregate size of rtnps decreased to almost a constant value at about 500 nm during measurement and remained unchanged as ha concentration was increased to 10 mg l when ha concentration was further increased to 20 mg l the aggregate size of rtnps slightly decreased to around 360 nm the corresponding a a0 ratios of rtnps were 0 147 0 003 0 161 0 012 and 0 198 0 002 at ha concentrations of 5 10 and 20 mg l respectively evidently a minimal ha concentration of 5 mg l is required to stably disperse both atnps and rtnps with the assistance of ultra sonication at low ph above this ha concentration dispersion of these two types of tnps may not be significantly enhanced the dlvo theory was used to evaluate the stability of tnps the calculated results were generally in accordance with the corresponding aggregate sizes and a a0 values the net energy between particles was attractive for atnps and rtnps at low ph with ha concentrations of 0 and 1 mg l a net energy barrier of approximately 70 75 kt and 140 185 kt between atnps and rtnps respectively appeared as ha concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l fig s1 details of the dlvo calculation are provided in si the roles of ha in the dispersion of tnps can be attributed to the ζ potential changes resulting from ha sorption ha sorption may increase the net surface charge of tnps resulting in a higher electric double layer repulsion energy baalousha 2009 the net energy barriers between particles were enhanced accordingly leading to fragmentation of agglomerates it was further reported that natural organic matter at a concentration of 1 mg l was able to cause a remarkable ζ potential inversion of metal oxide nanoparticles including tnps decreasing their ζ potentials to below 30 mv zhang et al 2009 another study also consistently showed that sorption of a small amount of natural organic matter to tnps greatly changed their ζ potential resulting in better dispersion of tnps loosli et al 2014 to test whether the dispersion enhancement of tnps induced by ha addition mainly resulted from their ζ potential changes ζ potential changes of two types of tnps induced by ha concentration variation at different phs were analyzed fig 3 at low ph 1 mg l ha neutralized the surface positive charges of tnps decreasing the initial positive ζ potential values of atnps and rtnps to around 4 mv and 9 mv respectively which in turn decreased the electrostatic repulsion between particles this explained why the addition of 1 mg l ha led to aggregation of both types of tnps at low ph as ha concentration was increased beyond 5 mg l ζ potential of tnps dropped further and reached almost a constant value of around 40 mv when ph value was higher than the pzc both atnps and rtnps showed the best dispersion specifically at a ha concentration of 1 mg l aggregate sizes of both atnps and rtnps were around 200 nm within 120 min much smaller than those at other phs correspondingly at high ph the initial ζ potential values of tnps before ha addition were also the lowest 20 mv for atnps and 30 mv for rtnps they were decreased to 25 80 mv for atnps and 35 65 mv for rtnps with the addition of 1 mg l ha which explained the much better dispersion of tnps at high ph than at low ph as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l both atnps and rtnps exhibited constant aggregate sizes below 200 nm their sizes remained unchanged with a further increase of ha concentration the a a0 ratios of atnps and rtnps were also constants with values ranging 0 48 0 51 and 0 72 0 74 when ha concentration was higher than 5 mg l the ζ potential variation patterns of atnps and rtnps at both low and high phs were generally in agreement with those of their aggregate size figs 2 and 3 ζ potentials decreased with increasing ha concentration below 5 mg l then became relatively stable at around 40 mv even when the ha concentration was further increased to 20 mg l fig 3 dlvo calculation results showed similar trends the net energy barrier became relatively constant with ha concentration higher than 5 mg l fig s1 hence the ζ potential changes of tnps resulting from ha sorption prominently regulated dispersion of tnps at low and high phs apart from electrostatic interaction other influencing factors on the stability of tnps stemming from ha sorption have been documented and the steric hindrance effect was the most highlighted one loosli et al 2014 domingos et al 2009 its effect on nps stability was considered to extend the classical dlvo theory mudunkotuwa and grassian 2010 which is often applied to explain the aggregation behaviors of tnps without taking the non dlvo forces into consideration ghosh et al 2008 sorption of ha on tnps may increase the surface coating thickness thereby enhancing their stability although the exact coating thickness is difficult to measure baalousha 2009 another effect of ha sorption includes hydrophobic interaction as a hydrophobic substance with abundant hydrophobic moieties ha may enhance the hydrophobicity of tnps once sorbed onto their surfaces thereby strengthening the interactions between particles in the aqueous phase and promoting aggregation to test whether these effects influenced the dispersion of tnps the amount of ha sorbed on tnps at the three tested phs was measured it was found that ha sorption on tnps especially atnps generally increased with increasing initial ha concentrations at all phs tested fig 4 an increase in ha sorption may enhance both the steric hindrance effect and the hydrophobic interactions between solid particles while the dispersion of tnps at low and high ph was not affected with the increase of ha concentration the dispersion enhancement resulting from the steric hindrance effect may have been offset to a large extent by the aggregation enhancement caused by hydrophobic interaction at low and high phs their joint effect on the dispersion of tnps was negligible when tnps were well dispersed as small clusters by electrostatic repulsion when ph was at the respective pzc values of atnps and rtnps aggregate size of atnps increased rapidly and failed to meet the quality criteria for the use of the zetasizer without ha addition aggregate size was significantly reduced to around 815 nm at a ha concentration of 1 mg l suggesting that 1 mg l ha greatly enhanced dispersion of atnps however a slight increase in the aggregate size of atnps could still be observed at this low ha concentration level as ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l aggregate size of atnps dramatically decreased to approximately 450 530 nm much smaller than that at a ha concentration of 1 mg l 815 1030 nm dispersion of atnps tended to be less pronounced when ha concentration was over 5 mg l as indicated by respective aggregate sizes of 675 760 nm at 10 mg l ha and 560 650 nm at 20 mg l ha this implied that a ha concentration of 5 mg l was the optimal level for dispersion of atnps at pzc however the dispersion behaviors of rtnps at pzc was entirely different from that of atnps particularly aggregate size of rtnps was around 500 nm at 1 mg l ha and around 450 nm at ha concentration higher than 5 mg l with the corresponding a a0 values being 0 09 and around 0 13 respectively the corresponding dlvo results were consistent with the variation patterns of aggregate size and a a0 values fig s1 despite the different aggregate sizes and a a0 values of atnps and rtnps it can be concluded that a ha concentration at 5 mg l with the assistance of ultra sonication was able to achieve the best dispersion of both atnps and rtnps at their pzc however the corresponding a a0 value was lower and aggregate size was larger compared to those obtained at low and high ph indicating tnps could not be stably dispersed at pzc the unconformity between the variation patterns of the aggregate size of atnps and that of their ζ potential values was observed at the pzc of atnps when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l figs 2 and 3 specifically the ζ potential values of atnps remained almost constant when the ha concentration exceeded 5 mg l while the ha concentration increase led to a considerable difference in aggregate size which could result from higher ha sorption on atnps sorption of ha increased with increasing initial ha concentration at the pzc fig 4 resulting in a stronger steric hindrance effect consequently the aggregate size of tnps was expected to decrease however the aggregate size of atnps in the presence of ha at a concentration over 5 mg l at the pzc followed the order of ha 5 mg l ha 20 mg l ha 10 mg l this demonstrated that as ha sorption increased the enhancement of hydrophobicity interaction between particles partly offset the steric hindrance effect resulting in aggregate size variation of atnps at the pzc in comparison rtnps size at the pzc remained around 450 nm with ha concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg l which could be explained by the smaller increase in ha sorption on rtnps with increasing ha concentration fig 4 in addition rtnps at their pzc were better dispersed than atnps especially at a ha concentration below 1 mg l as indicated by their smaller aggregate size which can be a result of the higher corresponding ζ potential value of rtnps fig 3 therefore when ζ potential was constant higher ha sorption on tnps may still influence their dispersion if they were not highly dispersed and had relatively large sizes 500 nm like atnps at its pzc hence the impacts of ha on the dispersion of tnps resulted from a combination of the effects which stem from electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction among which electrostatic repulsion was the most influential factor however differences in ζ potential and ha sorption alone could not fully explain different aggregate sizes of tnps at various phs for instance when ha concentration was over 5 mg l aggregate size of atnps at pzc was much larger than that at other phs while their ζ potential values at three phs were similar and ha sorption on atnps at the pzc was neither the highest nor lowest in comparison with other ph values apparently ph may have lasting effects on tnps dispersion even when their ζ potential was already decreased by ha sorption this may be explained by the observation that tnps at different ph values showed a dissimilar degree of re aggregation after ultra sonication even though ha was added immediately once regrouped aggregates can apparently only be partly fragmented by the ha added to further support this explanation control experiments were designed in which all procedures were kept identical to the previous ones except that ha 10 mg l was added before instead of after ultra sonication the mixture of tnps suspension with ha was ultra sonicated for 15 min and its z average hydrodynamic diameters variation over 120 min as well as the a a0 values after centrifugation were measured to compare with the previous results two ph values were selected for both atnps and rtnps at which their aggregate sizes were previously observed to be relatively large and small respectively when ha was added immediately after ultra sonication notable differences in dispersion of tnps were observed between the experiments with pre and post addition of ha fig 5 at ph 6 60 ha addition after ultra sonication only decreased atnps size from 1300 nm to about 1000 nm within 120 min while ha addition before ultra sonication led to a constant atnps size of less than 200 nm the corresponding a a0 values of these two groups were 0 25 and 0 48 respectively also exhibiting a remarkable difference likewise at ph 4 30 the aggregate size of rtnps was approximately 400 420 nm and the a a0 value was about 0 18 when ha was added after ultra sonication whereas with ha added before ultra sonication the corresponding values were 150 nm and 0 82 respectively measurements of ζ potential values of tnps in both cases obtained similar results fig s3 which excluded the possibility that the dispersion difference of atnps at ph 6 60 and rtnps at ph 4 30 observed with ha added before or after ultra sonication resulted from ζ potential changes of the particles therefore the rapid re aggregation of tnps before ha addition which was demonstrated in fig 1 was a reasonable explanation for the larger aggregate size and lower a a0 value when ha was added after ultra sonication as mentioned before ultra sonication was capable of breaking up large tnp clusters into smaller ones which were not stable at the pzc and they re agglomerated into larger clusters immediately without ha addition the re agglomeration occurred so fast that it was inevitable in some cases although ha was added as quickly as possible after sonication a portion of the regrouped agglomerates could be fragmented by the added ha whereas the remaining portion of the aggregates could not be re dispersed even at high ha concentrations hence the hydrodynamic diameters of atnps were much larger at the pzc than those at other ph values although their ζ potentials were as low as 40 mv after ha addition in contrast the aggregate sizes and a a0 values of tnps were similar with pre and post addition of ha when their aggregate sizes were relatively small 200 nm in either case such as atnps at ph 5 20 and rtnps at ph 7 30 fig 5 this implied that the small clusters of atnps at low ph and rtnps at high ph would not regroup immediately after sonication which was in accordance with their dispersion kinetics in the absence of ha fig 1 rtnps at high ph exhibited great dispersion with a constant aggregate size of around 150 nm this was the minimal size of both atnps and rtnps achieved in the present study despite their nominal particle size of 20 nm a previous study also found that once formed large cluster of tnps could not be broken up back into their nominal size penn et al 2001 the authors ascribed this phenomenon to the fact that tnps may irreversibly aggregate via chemical bonds it should be highlighted that although the aggregate sizes of atnps at low ph and rtnps at high ph were comparable approximately 200 nm for atnps and 150 nm for rtnps their dispersion was quite different demonstrated by a a0 value of 0 803 0 002 for rtnps at high ph and 0 477 0 006 for atnps at low ph fig 5 to further probe the impacts of re aggregation of tnps on their dispersion in the presence of ha the dependence of the tnps size on the time intervals between ultra sonication and ha addition was studied suspensions containing 100 mg l atnps were ultra sonicated at ph 6 60 and then left to stand quiescently after sonication for 0 60 min before adding ha 10 mg l the aggregate size of atnps was measured 2 h after ha addition a rise in aggregate size of atnps was observed with an increase in the quiescent standing time which indicated that the irreversible portion of atnps clusters formed in the re aggregation process gradually increased after sonication fig s4 when ha was added 60 min after ultra sonication the particle size of atnps exceeded 800 nm which was about 200 nm larger than observed when ha was added immediately hence to keep tnps in suspension especially when ph is in the vicinity of the pzc of tnps the time interval between sonication and addition of ha should be as short as possible the best dispersion of tnps can be achieved if ha is added to tnps suspensions before sonication to visualize the difference in dispersion of tnps by ha added before and after ultra sonication sem images for atnps at phs of 5 20 and 6 60 and rtnps at phs of 4 30 and 7 60 at a ha concentration of 10 mg l were taken to compare the conformation of tnp aggregates in these two scenarios fig s5 the morphology of rtnps aggregates was similar in fig s5 a and b where rtnps aggregated to form small clusters with sizes below 200 nm whereas the rtnps cluster was larger in fig s5 c when ha was added after ultra sonication at ph 4 30 compared to that in fig s5 d similarly different extents of atnps aggregation at ph 6 60 can be observed between fig s5 e and f especially in the region circled in red whereas the atnps aggregate showed similar size in fig s5 g and h at ph 5 20 overall the extent of aggregation of tnps shown in sem images was in accordance with their corresponding hydrodynamic diameters supporting the results of the joint effects of ha and ultra sonication on the dispersion of atnps and rtnps at different ph values 3 3 effect of tnp concentration on its stable dispersion as discussed above the added ha concentration was influential for the stable dispersion of tnps to extend our knowledge on how tnp concentration may affect its stable dispersion dispersion of atnps at two concentrations 100 mg l and 200 mg l with the assistance of ultra sonication was tested at different phs two ph values 6 60 and 5 20 were chosen to explore the effect of tnp concentration on its dispersion when electrostatic repulsion was weak and strong respectively the impact of tnp concentration on its dispersion differed as a function of ph fig 6 at ph 6 60 aggregate size of atnps at 200 mg l was remarkably higher than that at 100 mg l for all ha concentrations tested besides there was a slight trend of increasing aggregate size of atnps over 120 min when its concentration was 100 mg l and ha concentration was 1 mg l while the rising trend became much more obvious as atnp concentration was increased to 200 mg l indicating a stronger aggregation tendency fig 6 atnps at a higher concentration more readily formed larger aggregates while the value and variation pattern of their ζ potential were generally similar with those at a lower concentration figs 3 and 7 this could be attributed to the higher collision probability of individual particles at a higher concentration maximova and dahl 2006 besides atnps at a higher concentration exhibited lower ha sorption with an increase in ha concentration figs 4 and 7 which may also contribute to the larger cluster formation in comparison at ph 5 20 no notable difference in aggregate size and its variation pattern of atnps at different concentrations was observed regardless of ha concentrations and their a a0 values below 10 mg l ha were also similar 0 504 0 008 for 100 mg l atnps 0 477 0 006 for 200 mg l atnps a study on the aggregation of iron oxide nps obtained similar results in that the rise in their aggregate size brought about by a nanoparticle concentration increase was more significant at a ph in the vicinity of the pzc as compared to other phs baalousha 2009 aggregation theory can explain different impacts of the concentration of tnps on their dispersion as reported aggregation at the pzc and high low phs can be classified into two regimes known as the diffusion limited cluster aggregation dlca regime and reaction limited cluster aggregation rlca regime sandkuhler et al 2005 dlca refers to the aggregation that is not restrained by repulsive force therefore the diffusion and collision of tnps with higher concentration resulted in larger aggregate size which was exactly the case for atnps at the pzc in contrast for the rlca regime electrostatic repulsion becomes the dominant factor and the formation of aggregated clusters is regulated by the probability of adhesion vikesland et al 2016 due to strong electrostatic repulsion at low ph the probability of tnps adhering to each other was very low and a higher tnps concentration could not lead to a higher extent of aggregation overall a higher atnps concentration did generally facilitate their aggregation to some extent although the concentration effect was less pronounced when the ph was far away from the pzc and electrostatic repulsion between tnps was strong besides the optimal tnp ha concentration ratio for tnp dispersion was not a fixed value according to our experimental observations hence an optimal ha concentration should be determined experimentally to maximize its dispersing efficiency depending on factors which include tnp concentration and ph 4 conclusions the impacts of ha and ultra sonication on the dispersion of tnps with two crystalline structures at different phs and tnp concentrations were systematically investigated in this work the main conclusions can be summarized as follows stable dispersion of tnps requires both ha and the assistance of ultra sonication ultra sonication was effective in breaking up tnps agglomerations but re aggregation of tnps after ultra sonication was inevitable in the absence of ha especially at the pzc of tnps in general tnps can be better dispersed with ha and the simultaneous assistance of ultra sonication ha can stabilize tnps at a very low concentration mainly through increasing the electrostatic repulsion between particles non dlvo forces brought about by ha sorption include steric hindrance and hydrophobic interaction which can also affect tnp dispersion but these effects are relatively weak an optimal method for preparing environmentally friendly and stably dispersed tnp suspensions for practical applications can be developed by optimizing physicochemical conditions including ph and tnp concentrations such stably dispersed tnps may then have higher efficiency as photocatalysts due to an increase in surface area the suspensions can also be used as a sorbent to remove pollutants from the aqueous phase acknowledgments this study was supported by the national science fund for distinguished young scientist 41525005 the 973 program
