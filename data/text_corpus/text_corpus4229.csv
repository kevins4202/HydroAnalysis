21145,the performance in extracting wave power from an offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and back lip wall is explored and according to the potential flow theory the matched eigenfunction method is employed to establish a theoretical model to solve the boundary value problem effects from the variation of symmetry lip wall drafts chamber breadth and spring stiffness on the optimal extraction efficiency and other parameters of the owc with different moving components are compared and discussed it is found that a relatively deeper wall draft is more beneficial for the power extraction when equipped with a surging front lip wall within the interested wave frequency range to improve the trapped energy and reduce the occurring of sloshing mode inside the pneumatic chamber for a surging front lip wall a medium chamber breadth is more desirable as it can significantly enhance the peak efficiency as well as the expansion of high efficiency frequency bandwidth while a surging back lip wall model is inferior in this aspect in addition generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness and even stiffness of zero is more recommended for the front wall than the back wall surging motion as the former can make full use the positive effects of the surging mode keywords marine energy oscillating water column energy extraction efficiency surging motion spring stiffness 1 introduction the contemporary society is facing a number of serious issues during the process of urbanization development and one of the most concerning aspects is the energy crisis from the excessive exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels to realize the sustainable development of human society it is indispensable to find a kind of reliable alternative renewable energy to relieve the crisis from the global scope diego et al 2014 owning to abundant advantages such as rich reserves and low negative impacts on the environment liberti et al 2013 wave energy has become one of the most popular and significant renewable energy and its status and application scope are gradually improved and expanded as well the extraction and conversion of wave energy relies on the application of ingenious wave energy converter wec devices and the oscillating water column owc is regarded as one of the most promising technologies falcao and henriques 2016 fundamentally an owc device is developed by a bottom opened and partially immersed air chamber which can make use of the oscillation of water waves inside the chamber to generate electricity heath 2012 the investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device has lasted for several decades and the focus is mainly concentrated on two aspects one is to optimize the geometrical parameters to adapt to ocean waves and achieve the best performance in extracting wave energy the other is to integrate the traditional marine structures such as breakwater floating platform offshore wind turbines with the wave energy converter wec device to realize the functional diversification falcao and henriques 2016 for the former plenty of investigations are mainly carried out based on the theory of linear water waves and the early representative research can be found in evans 1976 falnes 1985 sarmento 1985 and evans and porter 1996 these scholars can be regarded as the pioneers in this field and they mainly used the eigenfunction expansion method to deduce the mathematical expression of the energy absorption efficiency of the owc device and a number of potential influential factors were taken into consideration including the wall drafts chamber breadth air turbine and air compression and etc consequently the understanding of hydrodynamic performance of owc device is gradually deepened with the development of research work in recent few years the potential flow theory becomes much maturer and the scope of its application is more extensive and thorough besides the potential theory the physical experiments and numerical simulations are the alternatives to investigate the influences from geometry parameters and related work can be referred in ning et al 2016a elhanafi et al 2017b and deng et al 2019 for the latter sarmento and mech 2009 theoretically examined the performance of a single owc device installed at the tip of a long and thin breakwater by considering the variation of air compressibility and the angle of incidence by solving the boundary value problem of a 2d owc device rezanejad et al 2013 deeply investigated how the existence of a stepped seabed topography under the owc device influences its performance in energy extraction and absorption based on the linear potential flow theory zheng et al 2019b studied the characteristics of an owc device integrated into a vertical structure and the effects of the thickness of the chamber wall and the radius and submerged depth of the chamber on wave power extraction were discussed in detail similar to this by building a theoretical model zheng et al 2019a explored the hydrodynamic performance of a couple of cylindrical owcs installed along a vertical straight coast and more practical factors were taken into account in this area the physical experiments and numerical technologies play a dominant role as well and representative research can be found in john ashlin et al 2018 and deng et al 2020a recently due to the continuous maturity and development of the knowledge about the interaction between ocean waves and owc devices the investigation on owc device with a fully stationary structure almost no longer meet the practical needs thus a number of research considering the motion of owc device is carried out from different aspects including the theoretical models physical experiments and numerical simulations by utilizing the concept of integrating the owc device into a breakwater he et al 2013 and he et al 2017 proposed a floating box type breakwater with dual pneumatic chambers and experimentally investigated its performance in energy extraction and expected to design a system which can extract wave energy over a wide range of wave frequency elhanafi et al 2017a explored the intact and damage survivability of a floating moored owc device in the physical wave flume and both the irregular and regular wave conditions were considered to analyse the survivability of the damaged mooring system zheng and zhang 2018 proposed a novel wave energy converter composed by a floating owc device and several oscillating floats and theoretically explored its dynamic response and energy extraction in the frequency domain by using the open source cfd toolbox openfoam wang et al 2019 proposed a dual chamber owc system consisting of heave only and onshore units and the effects from a number of parameters including the chamber breadth wall drafts and the interval between different device on its performance in energy extraction were numerically examined the primary objective of the present work is to complement the research on the owc device partially composed by a moving component under the excitation of ocean waves with different frequencies compared with the traditional fully stationary owc device the device proposed at present is equipped with some parts which are allowed to move harmoniously under the action of incident waves and the inclusion of movement is much likely to influence the device performance positively or negatively thus detailed comparison of the device performance is implemented between the owc with different movable components to figure out which part of the movement i e front lip wall or back lip wall will have a better impact on the performance in wave energy extraction and this can provide practical engineering guidance to avoid inappropriate design although the wec device of owc type is usually praised for its structural simplicity and the model proposed here has more complexity compared with the stationary owc device to some extent this defect can be made up if the improvement in device performance is inspiring and noticeable to this end a theoretical model based on the linear potential flow theory of a two dimensional offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and a surging back lip wall is established respectively the matched eigenfunction expansion method is utilized and the continuity condition of velocity and pressure on the common interface between different regions is employed to build a set of linear equations for the calculations of hydrodynamic properties of the owc device including the optimal energy absorption efficiency reflection and transmission coefficient averaged free surface displacement inside the pneumatic chamber and horizontal loads acting on the moving part the potential influential factors namely the symmetry wall drafts the chamber breadth and spring stiffness are explored and their effects on the interested hydrodynamic performance of the owc device with a surging front and back lip wall are compared and discussed the remainder of this paper is organized by the mathematical formulation convergence test and model validation results and discussions and conclusions respectively 2 mathematical formulation as depicted in fig 1 a and b an offshore oscillating water column wave energy conversion device with a surging front and a surging back wall is considered and explored by assuming the owc device with an infinite length and parallel to the wave crest the hydrodynamic problem related to present owc device model could be thought as a 2d problem for convenience a cartesian coordinates o x z is defined in which the x axis coincides with the still water level and z axis points vertically upwards respectively and coordinate origin o is selected exactly at the centre of the owc pneumatic chamber some essential geometry parameters describing the owc device are illustrated in fig 1 with a constant system water depth h and the breadth and height of the chamber is indicated with 2 w 1 and c respectively and the submerged depth of the front and back wall are denoted by d 1 and d 2 in addition w 2 w 1 is used to take the thickness of lip wall into consideration for the sake of optimizing the extraction and conversion efficiency of the owc device a wells turbine is equipped at the top of the owc pneumatic chamber and by tuning its parameters an optimal performance could be achieved considering the difference of boundary conditions of different regions in the whole system the matched eigenfunction expansion method is utilized and the whole fluid domain could be divided into five sub regions namely ω 1 ω 5 as depicted in fig 1 2 1 the governing equation and boundary conditions under the assumption of irrotational fluid and inviscid fluid it is conventional to introduce a total velocity potential φ x z t and air pressure drop p c representing the pressure condition inside the pneumatic chamber for the time harmonic motion of angular frequency ω above two variables can be separately written as 2 1 φ x z t re φ x z e i ω t p c t re p c e i ω t where i 1 t is the time re is to take the real component of argument φ x z and p c denote complex amplitudes of related parameters respectively in the domain filled with fluid the complex amplitude of total velocity potential φ satisfies the following governing equation 2 2 2 φ x z 0 and the corresponding boundary conditions could be expressed as 2 3 φ z ω 2 g φ i ω ρ g p c w 1 x w 1 z 0 0 x w 2 or x w 2 z 0 2 4 φ z 0 z h 2 5 φ n u n on rigid boundaries in which n indicates the positive normal direction pointing outside the fluid region and u n denotes the normal velocity on the solid structure boundaries ρ is the density of fluid 1 10 3 kg m 3 g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 in addition to the boundary conditions expressed in eqns 2 3 2 5 the sommerfeld radiation condition must be satisfied as well and its physical meaning is to represent the outgoing waves at infinity based on the theory of linear water waves generally the total velocity potential φ is conventionally decomposed into three different components in present work 2 6 φ φ s φ r 1 φ r 2 where φ r 1 is the complex amplitude in the radiation problem resulting from the unique air pressure oscillation in the air chamber but free from the action of incident waves φ r 2 is the complex amplitude in the radiation problem due to the surging motion of the wall under the condition of unique pressure distribution inside and outside the pneumatic chamber and free from wave conditions φ s denotes the wave scattering by an owc device without ceiling and could further be divided into the following two parts 2 7 φ s φ i φ d here φ d is the diffraction potential and φ i is the incident wave potential propagating from x and its formal mathematical expression is dean and dalrymple 1984 2 8 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x w 2 in which a denotes the amplitude of incident waves and k is the wave number 2 2 motion equation for the surging wall to realize the displacement control of the structure a simple linear spring of stiffness k is introduced the motion equation of the surging wall is indispensable to be built for the solution of the one scattering problem and two radiation problems here due to the similarity between the motion problem of surging front wall and surging back wall the former is taken as an example for illustration based on the newton s second law the surging motion of the front wall can be written as 2 9 f φ f p k s m s d 2 s d t 2 where f φ re f φ e i ω t f φ f s a f r 1 p c f r 2 s is the consultant force from the wave fields f p re f p e i ω t f p p c c is the consultant force from the air pressure fluctuation inside the pneumatic chamber m is the mass of surging wall which can be expressed as m s ρ s c d 1 w 2 w 1 where ρ s is the density of wall and s re s e i ω t is the surging displacement of the front wall for brevity p c and s namely the dimensionless form of complex amplitude of p c and s satisfy the following equation 2 10 p c p c ρ g a s s a thus the motion equation could be rewritten as 2 11 f r 2 ω 2 m s k s ρ g f r 1 c p c f s where 2 12 f s a i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 s φ 3 s d z f r 1 p c i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 r 1 φ 3 r 1 d z f r 2 s i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 r 2 φ 3 r 2 d z 2 3 power take off model to realize the extraction and conversion of the wave energy the power take off pto device is an essential part of the pneumatic wave energy conversion device and a linear wells turbine is installed on the top of the air chamber according to sarmento 1985 and martin rivas and mei 2009 the formal mathematical expression describing the relationship between the varied rate of the air mass and pressure drop inside the pneumatic chamber can be written as 2 13 d m d t d ρ c v d t ρ c 0 d v d t v 0 d ρ c d t k ˆ d n ˆ p c in which m ρ c and v are the instantaneous air mass density and volume inside the chamber respectively ρ c 0 and v 0 are respectively the initial state of the air density and the air volume k ˆ d n ˆ are the parameters revealing the performance of the linear turbine and respective meanings are the dimensionless damping coefficient outer diameter of the turbine rotor the angular rotational speed of the turbine blades an isentropic process of the air compression is assumed falcão and justino 1999 and by combining the sound speed c a 340 m s in air at a constant pressure condition the relationship between the density and pressure of the air inside the chamber can be expressed as 2 14 c a 2 d ρ c d t d p c d t physically d v d t represents the varied rate of the total volume of air inside the chamber obtained by 2 15 q d v d t w 1 w 1 φ 3 z z 0 d x d s d t c where the outflow of air from the chamber is considered positive q re q e i ω t is also considered as a time harmonic motion and q denotes the complex amplitude of the volume flux combining the decomposition of different components in eqn 2 6 q can also be divided into 2 16 q q s q r 1 q r 2 i ω c s where q s is the contribution due to the wave diffraction problem q r 1 is the component from the air pressure oscillation inside the pneumatic chamber q r 2 is the component from the surging motion of front wall they can be obtained by respectively 2 17 q s w 1 w 1 φ 3 s z z 0

problems the laplace s equation is always satisfied for the velocity potential φ j j s r 1 r 2 s represents the scattering problem and r 1 and r 2 represents the radiation problems and the difference exists in the boundary conditions given by eqns 2 3 2 5 with 2 21 p c 0 j s r 2 p c ρ g a j r 1 u n 0 j s r 1 i ω s j r 2 generally if a region is bounded together with an upper free water surface and a lower horizontal flat bottom φ 1 φ 3 and φ 5 the normalized function z m k m z is usually introduced mei et al 2005 2 22 z 0 k z n 0 1 2 cosh k z h n 0 2 k h sinh 2 k h 4 k m 0 z m k m z n m 1 2 cos

z z m k m z d z 1 m m 0 m m in addition considering the feature of the impenetrable upper boundary condition in the domain φ 2 and φ 4 it is necessary to introduce a new set of vertical eigenfunctions and they can be written as respectively 2 25 y 0 λ 0 z m 0 1 2 cos λ 0 z h m 0 h d 1 n 0 y n λ n z m n 1 2 cos λ n z h m n h d 1 2 n 0 and 2 26 y 0 λ 0 z m 0 1 2 cos λ 0 z h m 0 h d 2 n 0 y n λ n z m

0 k 0 z φ a r 1 φ a r 2 0 φ p j φ p s φ p r 2 0 φ p r 1 1 are the special terms due to the boundary difference in different sub problems the expression of ξ j can be written as 2 28 ξ j i g a ω j s i p c ρ ω j r 1 i ω s j r 2 2 4 2 auxiliary velocity distribution functions the singular behaviour occurring at the vicinity of lower edges of the owc device when treated in the numerical calculations is much likely to lead to the occurrence of an ill conditioned matrix thus weakening the convergence speed to deal with this problem effectively the galerkin approximation method introduced in evans and porter 1996 is utilized in the present work for the sake of numerical accuracy the singular behaviour near the sharp edges of the structures can be characterized by the horizontal velocity distributions which are expanded in the form of orthogonal polynomials for the four common boundaries in fig 1 i e x w 2 and w 1 they can be expressed as respectively x w 2 2 29 u w 2 j z ξ j r 0 α r

2 i 1 6 i r s c 2 j 1 6 j q p are the even terms of gegenbauer polynomials and γ is the gamma function 2 4 3 solving the unknown coefficients to obtain the unknown coefficients in eqn 2 27 the formal expressions of the velocity potential must satisfy the upper and lower boundary conditions as well as the far field condition meanwhile on the common interface between the different connected sub regions the distribution of horizontal velocity and pressure along the interface must ensure the continuity of fluid field firstly according to the continuity of the horizontal velocities on the common interface i e at the spatial location of x w 2 w 1 w 1 w 2 the following equations must be satisfied 2 35 φ 1 j x u n d 1 z 0 x w 2 u w 2 j z h z d 1 x w 2 2 36 φ 2 j x u w 2 j z h z d 1 x w 2 2 37 φ 2 j x u w 1 j z h z d 1 x w 1 2 38 φ 3 j x u n d 1 z 0 x w 1 u w 1 j z h z d 1 x w 1 2 39 φ 3 j x 0 d 2 z 0 x w 1 u w 1 j z h z d 2 x w 1 2 40 φ 4 j x u w 1 j z h z d 2 x w 1 2 41 φ 4 j x u w 2 j z h z d 2 x w 2 2 42 φ 5 j x 0 d 2 z 0 x w 2 u w 2 j z h z d 2 x w 2 next the orthogonality of the z dependence is applied to calculate all the unknown coefficients except for for b 0 j and f 0 j in eqn 2 27 in this procedure it is general to multiply the two sides of eqns 2 35 2 42 by utilizing the corresponding eigenfunctions eqn 2 22 and eqns 2 25 2 26 and then over the vertical direction the obtained equations can be integrated for further calculations secondly besides the horizontal velocities continuity the continuity condition of pressure distribution must be satisfied as well thus the equations at the common interface can be expressed as respectively 2 43 φ 1 j φ 2 j h z d 1 x w 2 2 44 φ 2 j φ 3 j h z d 1 x w 1 2 45 φ 3 j φ 4 j h z d 2 x w 1 2 46 φ 4 j φ 5 j h z d 2 x w 2 by using u 1 r u 1 s u 1 q and u 1 p respectively to multiply the both sides of eqn 2 43 eqn 2 44 eqn 2 45 and eqn 2 46 and combining the mathematical expressions of coefficients a m j b n j c n j d m j e m j f n j g n j and h m j a set of linear equations can be built together with the unknown coefficients α r j β s j γ q j κ p j b 0 j and f 0 j once the linear system is numerically solved the interested parameters could be further obtained including the velocity potential and other physical quantities 2 5 calculations of relevant quantities 2 5 1 energy absorption efficiency following martin rivas and mei 2009 and deng et al 2014 the wave power absorbed by present owc device can be evaluated by 2 47 p o u t d ρ c v d t p c ρ c 0 k ˆ d n ˆ p c 2 ρ c 0 k ˆ d 2 ρ c 0 n ˆ p c 2 ρ 2 g 2 a 2 k ˆ d 2 ρ c 0 n ˆ p c 2 combining the wave energy flux of incident wave with per unit crest length ρ g a 2 c g 2 c g denotes the group velocity it can be used to normalize the absorbed wave power p o u t to obtain the expression of power absorption efficiency e namely 2 48 e ρ h g h ρ c 0 c g k ˆ d h n ˆ g h p c 2 ρ h g h ρ c 0 c g x 1 2 χ χ re x 2 2 im x 2 2 where 2 49 χ k ˆ d h n ˆ g h 2 50 x 1 ρ c 0 ρ

optimal wave energy conversion efficiency e o p t this can be implemented by the derivative of turbine parameters in eqn 2 48 namely e χ 0 thus the optimal turbine parameter χ o p t is x 2 and the optimal energy conversion efficiency e o p t can be obtained by introducing χ o p t into the formula eqn 2 48 2 5 2 reflection and transmission coefficient the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient of the owc device with a surging wall namely c r and c t can be calculated by the following expressions 2 52 c r n 0 1 2 a 0 s p c a 0 r 1 ω 2 s g a 0 r 2 cos k 0 h c t n 0 1 2 h 0 s p c h 0 r 1 ω 2 s g h 0 r 2 cos k 0 h another function of the introduction of c r and c t lies in that it can be applied to verify the conservation of the total wave energy in the system namely the conservation relation must be always satisfied no matter what the circumstance is 2 53 c r 2 c t 2 e 1 2 5 3 averaged free surface displacement inside the chamber the surface displacement inside the pneumatic chamber is usually introduced to analyse the behaviour of the fluid here the spatially averaged surface elevation namely η which is normalized by the incident wave amplitude a can be divided into three components from wave scattering problem and wave radiation problems respectively 2 54 η η 3 s η 3 r 1 η 3 r 2 where 2 55 η 3 s m 0 m cos k m h k m n m 1 2 2 w 1 d m s e k m w 1 e

loads f x acting on the moving wall is usually another concentrated point the formal mathematical expression of the horizontal loads is written as 2 56 f x a f s p c f r 1 s f r 2 p c c a f s p c ρ g a f r 1 s a f r 2 p c ρ g a c based on the incident wave amplitude a and water depth h the dimensionless form of the horizontal loads acting on the surging front wall can be written as 2 57 f x 2 f x ρ g a h 2 f s p c ρ g f r 1 s f r 2 p c ρ g c ρ g h 3 convergence test and model validation 3 1 convergence test as described in the mathematical expressions of the velocity potentials in eqn 2 27 and horizontal velocities in eqns 2 29 2 32 there exists several infinite summations and it is necessary to determine an appropriate truncated number for these summations to guarantee accurate results according to deng et al 2020b the truncated number of r s q p equalling 6 is enough to obtain satisfying solutions with respect to the truncated number of m and n namely m and n under the condition of r s q p 6 the convergence test is carried out with h 20 m w 1 0 2 h w 2 0 2000001 h d 1 d 2 0 1 h in addition considering the range of interested dimensionless wave parameter k h from 0 3 to 10 the case when k h is 5 0 is taken for illustration the optimal parameters including e o p t c r o p t and c t o p t the subscript o p t denotes the parameter is calculated when χ is x 2 are plotted versus m and n respectively in fig 2 the results displayed in fig 2 demonstrate that the cut off number of n is much easily to achieve a convergent result than the cut off number of m generally when m 50 and n 10 the difference between resulting parameters can almost be ignored in the subsequent computations the value of m 50 and n 10 is adopted without loss of generality the following constant parameters are used unless otherwise specified water depth h 20 m relative density ratio ρ ρ 0 1000 and vertical distance c 0 1 h from the top cover of the owc to the still water level 3 2 model validation to validate the correctness of self programming code for solving present wave scattering and radiation problems the analytical results published by he et al 2019 were used for a calibration and verification in this part the chosen geometry parameters of the owc device proposed in he et al 2019 are half breadth of the pneumatic chamber w 1 0 05 h front wall draft d 1 0 05 h 0 1 h 0 15 h 0 2 h and 0 25h back wall draft d 2 d 1 0 1 h the thickness of front and back wall was neglected in the literature and this can be achieved by setting w 2 w 1 here the parameters including the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t the optimal dimensionless pto damping c o p t and the corresponding wave transmission coefficient c t o p t and reflection coefficient c r o p t are the main concentrated parameters in waves of k h ranging from 0 3 to 10 except for the optimal dimensionless pto damping which is defined as c o p t ρ h χ ρ c other parameters can be calculated according to eqn 2 48 and eqn 2 52 respectively it is worth mentioning that the parameters deduced in sec 2 5 all take the effect of spring stiffness k and the surging motion of the lip wall into consideration in view of the owc model proposed in he et al 2019 is completely stationary and in order to ensure the consistency of present work and model in the literature the value of spring stiffness k is set as so the surging displacement of lip wall can almost be ignored in present model as depicted in fig 3 all the tested variables evidently show that various results obtained in the present model agree well with the theoretical model published by he et al 2019 which effectively guarantee the correctness of the present mathematical deductions and numerical computations in addition the law of energy conservation i e c r 2 c t 2 e 1 is always checked and validated for any case in fig 3 but this is not displayed in it for brevity thus further investigations on related hydrodynamic parameters can be implemented effectively in the following sections 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of the symmetry wall drafts the structure parameters of the owc device examined in this part are as follows the chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 1 h the thickness of both the front and back wall is ignored by setting w 2 w 1 and the relative density of the moving component ρ s ρ 0 5 the front and back wall drafts d 1 d 2 0 1 h 0 15 h 0 2 h and 0 25h are taken into account in addition the surging motion of the front and back wall of the owc device is considered respectively as shown in fig 4 the comparison of optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t is given for the surging model including surging front wall and surging back wall and the completely stationary model where surging fw and surging bw mean the circumstance with surging front wall and surging back wall respectively regarding the surging part of the owc device the spring stiffness k imposed on is set as 0 here and thus the movement can be regarded as a fully free mode for the fully stationary owc device in fig 4 b there exists only one peak efficiency within the interested range of k h the value of which is approximate to 0 5 with the increase of immersed depth d 1 and d 2 of the owc device there is a trend of left shift of the peak efficiency this is mainly due to that the increase of lip wall draft means the increase of the water column mass trapped inside the chamber and the inertia effect and natural period of the oscillating water column will increase as well in addition the rapid decrease of the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t within the range of 6 k h 10 is much evident owing to the increase of wall drafts generally the increase of wall drafts can make the propagating waves difficult to pass through the back lip wall of the owc device and almost be reflected at the front lip wall thus to some extent reflected wave energy reduces the extracted wave power in turn due to the fact that most wave energy is concentrated at about a fourth wavelength below the sea water level drew et al 2009 reflection effects from the deeper wall drafts will become more dominant and extracted power will seriously decrease when the owc device is composed by a surging back wall k 0 with other parameters unchanged the performance in energy extraction and absorption is much inferior to the fully stationary model the increase of the wall draft not only leads to the reduction of absorption efficiency within a broad range of k h 2 k h 10 but also an evident drop of the peak value in the efficiency curves contrary to the model with a surging back wall the performance of the model with a surging front wall is significantly improved under the same wave conditions especially in the range of 4 k h 10 and over a much wide range of k h a high efficiency frequency band e o p t 0 5 can be achieved which means the owc device with a surging front wall is more beneficial for the extraction of wave energy the curves of the averaged water surface displacement inside the chamber η in fig 5 a show that there exists dual peak values for all the cases including the left peak value and right peak value with the increase of k h the occurring of the violent internal water surface oscillation usually results from the resonance mechanism and is much likely to lead to a considerable energy efficiency rezanejad et al 2013 generally no matter the cases with a surging front wall or a surging back wall the right peak value of η occur at the same k h with the peak of e o p t shown in fig 4 b which is mainly due to the resonance mechanism of the oscillation of the water column inside the chamber when the front wall or back wall is in a surging mode this kind of resonance does not result in noticeable effects on the efficiency curves in fig 4 a nevertheless another resonance mechanism resulting from the surging motion of the lip wall for both the front wall and back wall is much evident in the efficiency curves as the occurring of the left peak value of η in fig 5 a is in accordance with the left peak efficiency displayed in fig 4 a with respect to the resonance from surging motion of the lip wall besides the left peak value of the averaged water surface displacement η actually it can be associated with the response amplitude operator s defined in eqn 2 10 of the moving component of the owc device as well this can be further proved according to the results displayed in fig 5 b as the maximum response amplitude operator s occurs at the same wave parameter k h condition with the left peak value of both the averaged water surface displacement η and optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t in addition the surging location of the lip wall does not make a difference to the occurring of the peak η for both the internal fluid resonance and the surging lip wall resonance moreover it can be noticed that the left peak value of η for surging fw is a little lower than that for surging bw and this can be partially responsible for the lower efficiency for surging fw shown in fig 4 a note that the right peak value of η for surging fw is much larger than that for surging bw and over a broad range of k h the resulting fluid oscillation is more violent for the surging front wall as well which is the main reason for superior characteristics in energy absorption for the owc device with a surging front wall fig 6 illustrates the comparison of reflection and transmission coefficient c r o p t and c t o p t between surging model and fully stationary model when the pto damping is optimized for the energy absorption efficiency e o p t for the fully stationary owc model with the increase of wall drafts d 1 and d 2 an overall larger reflection coefficient but lower transmission coefficient can be obtained regarding the effects of surging motion of front wall and back wall the curves of c r o p t firstly increases to a turning point at k h where surging lip wall resonance occurs then decreases to a local minimum and after that c r o p t increases again with respect to the effects of wall drafts under the lip wall surging mode for small k h smaller than the k h where resonance resulting from the surging mode occurs the difference between surging front and surging back wall can almost be ignored for the range of 3 k h 10 a deeper wall draft can reflect more wave energy for the surging motion of the back wall while the results of c r o p t are opposite for the surging motion of the front wall within the range of 7 k h 10 as for the transmission coefficient c t o p t there exists a valley with the increase of k h which is due to the resonance of surging motion of lip wall the effects on c t o p t from different surging parts of the owc device with the same wall draft can almost be ignored the effective range of k h to obtain a safe transmission coefficient c t o p t 0 5 both for the stationary model and the model with a surging component is similar which indicates the surging motion will not result in a significant improvement in terms of its performance in wave attenuation in addition when the turbine is optimized for the energy extraction efficiency e o p t the amplitude of air pressure p c depicted in fig 7 a illustrates that there exists almost no discrepancy between the model with a surging front wall and with a surging back wall for all cases within the range of k h 2 and the peak value of p c occurs at the same k h with the peak of e o p t and η which is mainly due to the resonance phenomenon from the surging lip wall physically when the oscillation of the internal water surface improves to a more violent extent the resulting internal air pressure p c inside the pneumatic chamber generally will be enhanced simultaneously within the range of 4 k h 10 the air pressure p c for the model with a surging front wall is much larger than the model with a surging back wall referring to eqn 2 47 the energy absorption efficiency is mainly determined by the internal air pressure to a great extent and the pressure difference between different surging components can partially explain the difference of performance in energy extraction and utilization with respect to the horizontal loads f x acting on the moving part of the owc device shown in fig 7 b it can be noticed that horizontal loads for the surging front wall is much larger than that for the surging back wall which is easily understood as the front wall is the most direct load bearing position generally a larger horizontal load will contribute to a larger response amplitude operator s however combining the curves of f x and s shown in figs 7 b and fig 5 b respectively the results are not conform to above regularity especially around the value of resonance condition k h due to the surging lip wall but when k h is away from this resonance condition namely k h increases to the short wave regime a larger horizontal force condition leads to a larger wall displacement 4 2 effects of the chamber breadth the effects of the owc chamber breadth 2 w 1 on the energy absorption efficiency are explored and the comparison of optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t between surging model surging front wall and surging back wall and stationary model for different chamber breadths namely 2 w 1 0 1 h 0 2 h 0 3 h 0 4 h is given in fig 8 a and b in all cases the condition of w 1 w 2 is considered in view of the superior performance in energy extraction with a larger wall draft d 1 and d 2 for the owc device with a surging front wall the drafts d 1 d 2 0 25 h is unchanged in this part for the fully stationary owc model without moving components there exists no difference between the energy absorption efficiency e o p t when k h 4 no matter what the half chamber breadth w 1 is but considerable enhancement of the efficiency can be observed with the increase of chamber breadth for the extremely long wave regime k h 3 in addition a left shift of the peak efficiency could be noticed with the increase of chamber breadth 2 w 1 for the owc device with a surging back lip wall the evident enhancement of energy efficiency e o p t with the increase of w 1 only occurs at a finite range of k h namely 0 8 k h 3 5 while for the model with a surging front wall the high efficiency frequency band for w 1 0 1 h is more broad than when the half chamber breadth w 1 0 05 h and a trend of efficiency attenuation can be noticed when k h is larger than 8 when the half chamber breadth w 1 increases to 0 15 h the attenuation phenomenon starts to occur at a smaller k h around the value 5 and the high efficiency bandwidth becomes much narrower than the case with a half chamber breath w 1 0 1 h for the case with the widest chamber the efficiency curve for w 1 0 2 h and surging fw firstly experiences a peak value due to the surging lip wall resonance then decreases a little but increases dramatically to a larger peak value around 0 92 after that it drops drastically to a zero efficiency point but continues to increase within a limit range of k h the occurrence of the zero efficiency point is mainly owing to the sloshing mode of the fluid inside the owc chamber rezanejad et al 2013 ning et al 2016b which is much likely to happen when the half incident wave length λ 2 is approximately equal to the chamber breadth 2 w 1 it is worth mentioning that the sloshing mode does not occur for the fully stationary model but when it is excited by the surging lip wall it provides an opportunity for the occurrence of this new resonance mechanism due to sloshing mode it can be inferred that the phenomenon with multiple peak efficiency values over 2 is completely applicable to the cases with w 1 0 05 h 0 1 h 0 15 h as well but they do not occur due to the limited range of tested k h referring to the averaged water surface displacement η and the amplitude of air pressure p c inside the chamber shown in fig 9 the k h with a zero value of efficiency meanwhile leads to a weak averaged water fluid oscillation and weak air pressure inside the chamber the existence of other peak values of η and p c have been explained in the previous parts and for brevity this is not be repeated here for the fully stationary owc model and surging model their respective performance in terms of wave reflection and transmission are compared in fig 10 when the owc device is fully fixed for a finite range of k h namely 0 3 k h 2 and 3 k h 4 the increase of chamber breadth will result in a slight improvement in the reflection coefficient c r o p t but a reduction in the transmission coefficient c t o p t almost for the whole tested k h range this is because the increase of the breadth of pneumatic chamber will increase the cross sectional area of the oscillating water column in the chamber and so is the inertia of the internal fluid so wave energy is less likely to transmit to the leeside of the owc device and more prone to be reflected and extracted when considering the surging motion of the back wall the curves of c r o p t and c t o p t will not changed significantly except for the k h when the resonance phenomenon happens including the surging motion resonance of the lip wall k h 0 3 0 8 the vertical oscillation resonance of the water column k h 2 5 3 5 and the sloshing mode of the water column k h 8 8 3 in the pneumatic chamber with respect to the surging motion of the front wall the curves of c r o p t differ a lot between cases with different chamber breadths as illustrated in fig 10 a for each curve there exists a nearly zero reflection coefficient and the corresponding k h is in accordance with the position where the maximum energy absorption efficiency e o p t occurs in fig 8 a and this can be understood by analysing the wave energy distribution in the whole system based on the conservation law overall owing to the ignorable difference for the transmission coefficient c t o p t between the surging model and the stationary model to significantly improve the performance in energy extraction and conversion it can only make efforts from the aspect of reducing the wave energy that reflected by the marine structures combing the purpose of extracting and utilizing the wave energy to a maximum extent within the concentrated wave parameters k h range the owc device with a chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 2h and a surging front wall is the relatively optimal structure design as it can reduce the reflected wave energy as much as possible and contribute to more components of the energy to be conversed 4 3 effects of the spring stiffness in the previous discussions the spring stiffness k is set as zero for considering the surging motion of the front or back lip wall which means the motion of the moving component of the owc device is completely free under the action of external forces actually the function of the spring is not only to provide a new resonance mechanism for the owc device but also to tune the motion response of the moving component for a more desirable performance in energy extraction and conversion to this end in this subsection the spring with different stiffness k the unit of spring stiffness k is n m the value of k is from 0 to 1 10 8 is considered and the corresponding working performance is examined and discussed fig 11 shows the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t for the owc model with a surging front lip wall and surging back lip wall respectively as a function of both k h and l o g 10 k under the conditions of d 1 d 2 0 25 h w 1 w 2 0 1 h the results of a completely freely surging lip wall namely k 0 are not included due to the l o g 10 function for the owc model with a surging front lip wall the distribution of e o p t can be divided into three main regions the first one is within the range of 0 3 k h 2 and 0 l o g 10 k 8 the feature of which is that under the action of extremely long waves the effects from the variation of stiffness k on e o p t can almost be ignored and the value is always lower than 0 4 the second region is bounded in 3 k h 10 and 0 l o g 10 k 5 which can be regarded as a high efficiency region with the majority of e o p t larger than 0 8 when the stiffness k is smaller than 1 10 4 i e l o g 10 k 4 different k can result in a slight effect on e o p t however when l o g 10 k increases to 5 a rapid decline of the absorption efficiency could be noticed the further increase of l o g 10 k will lead to the distribution of e o p t entering into the third region as mentioned before where is the low efficiency region and the majority of e o p t is less than 0 2 for the owc model with a surging back wall only a finite region which is bounded in 2 k h 3 and 4 l o g 10 k 6 can obtain a relatively satisfying energy absorption efficiency e o p t but far from enough and in other areas the absorption efficiency e o p t is extremely unsatisfactory as the majority of its value is lower than 0 2 owing to the superior performance in energy extraction for the owc model with a surging front lip wall other parameters including optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t and corresponding averaged water surface displacement η response amplitude operator s and horizontal loads f x are plotted in fig 12 for the superior owc model the efficiency curves in fig 12 a can help understand the distribution of e o p t versus k h and l o g 10 k in fig 11 a when the spring stiffness k is smaller than 1 10 4 including the fully free mode k 0 a slight difference can be observed for the different efficiency curves while when the spring stiffness k increases to a value larger than 1 10 6 the surging motion of the lip wall tends to be restricted and is more prone to be a fixed wall generally the increase of spring stiffness k can lead to a decline in the energy absorption e o p t the averaged water surface displacement η and the response amplitude operator s but a rise in the horizontal loads f x acting on the surging lip wall it is worth noting that for the spring stiffness k 1 10 5 the curves of e o p t η s and f x differ from the curves for both the small spring stiffness and large spring stiffness and this spring stiffness k can be seen as a transition value which means the related performance revealed when the owc device is subjected to ocean waves is determined by the combined effects from the stationary model and the surging model the combination of the two effects can lead to a much violent fluid oscillation an increased motion displacement and an evident increase of horizontal force especially when the resonance phenomenon occurs according to above examinations the proper design of the spring stiffness k is essential and required to achieve a high efficiency in a wide frequency bandwidth generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness and even k 0 a completely free mode of the front lip wall is more recommended 5 conclusions the hydrodynamic performance of an offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and a surging back lip wall under the excitation of ocean waves with a wide range of frequencies was explored analytically by utilizing the linear potential flow theory the effects resulting from the potential influential factors on the related hydrodynamic properties were compared between the owc device with a surging front lip wall and back lip wall the prime findings from the present work are listed below firstly the increase of the wall drafts will significantly enhance the performance in energy absorption when the owc device is equipped with a surging front lip wall while weaken its efficiency with a surging back lip wall the improvement is not only reflected in the increase of the peak efficiency but also in the considerable expansion of high efficiency frequency bandwidth compared with the stationary model overall in the present work front and back wall draft d 1 d 2 0 25 h is the most recommended design secondly when the front lip wall of the owc device is in the surging mode there exists an optimal chamber breadth in terms of energy extraction and conversion to the best utilization of wave energy within the interested wave frequency range the owc device with a chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 2 h is more desirable however the performance of device with a surging back lip wall is far from satisfactory compared with another model thirdly the positive effects of the spring stiffness on the front surging model is mainly within a limited range namely k 1 10 4 and when k is over the value 1 10 6 the function of surging motion is slight due to the moving wall is prone to be fixed generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness or k 0 a completely free mode of the front lip wall is more advisable finally over a wide range of wave frequency the resulting reflection coefficient from the surging motion of the front wall is far lower than the model with a surging back lip wall but the difference between transmission coefficient for different models can almost be ignored when considering the variation of symmetry wall drafts and chamber breadth the concept proposed in present work can be extended to investigate a fully 3d owc device model coupled with a moving component in practical design the realization of the connections between moving lip walls and the owc device is the main concentrated point in the future which will be reported elsewhere credit authorship contribution statement chen wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

21145,the performance in extracting wave power from an offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and back lip wall is explored and according to the potential flow theory the matched eigenfunction method is employed to establish a theoretical model to solve the boundary value problem effects from the variation of symmetry lip wall drafts chamber breadth and spring stiffness on the optimal extraction efficiency and other parameters of the owc with different moving components are compared and discussed it is found that a relatively deeper wall draft is more beneficial for the power extraction when equipped with a surging front lip wall within the interested wave frequency range to improve the trapped energy and reduce the occurring of sloshing mode inside the pneumatic chamber for a surging front lip wall a medium chamber breadth is more desirable as it can significantly enhance the peak efficiency as well as the expansion of high efficiency frequency bandwidth while a surging back lip wall model is inferior in this aspect in addition generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness and even stiffness of zero is more recommended for the front wall than the back wall surging motion as the former can make full use the positive effects of the surging mode keywords marine energy oscillating water column energy extraction efficiency surging motion spring stiffness 1 introduction the contemporary society is facing a number of serious issues during the process of urbanization development and one of the most concerning aspects is the energy crisis from the excessive exploitation and utilization of fossil fuels to realize the sustainable development of human society it is indispensable to find a kind of reliable alternative renewable energy to relieve the crisis from the global scope diego et al 2014 owning to abundant advantages such as rich reserves and low negative impacts on the environment liberti et al 2013 wave energy has become one of the most popular and significant renewable energy and its status and application scope are gradually improved and expanded as well the extraction and conversion of wave energy relies on the application of ingenious wave energy converter wec devices and the oscillating water column owc is regarded as one of the most promising technologies falcao and henriques 2016 fundamentally an owc device is developed by a bottom opened and partially immersed air chamber which can make use of the oscillation of water waves inside the chamber to generate electricity heath 2012 the investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device has lasted for several decades and the focus is mainly concentrated on two aspects one is to optimize the geometrical parameters to adapt to ocean waves and achieve the best performance in extracting wave energy the other is to integrate the traditional marine structures such as breakwater floating platform offshore wind turbines with the wave energy converter wec device to realize the functional diversification falcao and henriques 2016 for the former plenty of investigations are mainly carried out based on the theory of linear water waves and the early representative research can be found in evans 1976 falnes 1985 sarmento 1985 and evans and porter 1996 these scholars can be regarded as the pioneers in this field and they mainly used the eigenfunction expansion method to deduce the mathematical expression of the energy absorption efficiency of the owc device and a number of potential influential factors were taken into consideration including the wall drafts chamber breadth air turbine and air compression and etc consequently the understanding of hydrodynamic performance of owc device is gradually deepened with the development of research work in recent few years the potential flow theory becomes much maturer and the scope of its application is more extensive and thorough besides the potential theory the physical experiments and numerical simulations are the alternatives to investigate the influences from geometry parameters and related work can be referred in ning et al 2016a elhanafi et al 2017b and deng et al 2019 for the latter sarmento and mech 2009 theoretically examined the performance of a single owc device installed at the tip of a long and thin breakwater by considering the variation of air compressibility and the angle of incidence by solving the boundary value problem of a 2d owc device rezanejad et al 2013 deeply investigated how the existence of a stepped seabed topography under the owc device influences its performance in energy extraction and absorption based on the linear potential flow theory zheng et al 2019b studied the characteristics of an owc device integrated into a vertical structure and the effects of the thickness of the chamber wall and the radius and submerged depth of the chamber on wave power extraction were discussed in detail similar to this by building a theoretical model zheng et al 2019a explored the hydrodynamic performance of a couple of cylindrical owcs installed along a vertical straight coast and more practical factors were taken into account in this area the physical experiments and numerical technologies play a dominant role as well and representative research can be found in john ashlin et al 2018 and deng et al 2020a recently due to the continuous maturity and development of the knowledge about the interaction between ocean waves and owc devices the investigation on owc device with a fully stationary structure almost no longer meet the practical needs thus a number of research considering the motion of owc device is carried out from different aspects including the theoretical models physical experiments and numerical simulations by utilizing the concept of integrating the owc device into a breakwater he et al 2013 and he et al 2017 proposed a floating box type breakwater with dual pneumatic chambers and experimentally investigated its performance in energy extraction and expected to design a system which can extract wave energy over a wide range of wave frequency elhanafi et al 2017a explored the intact and damage survivability of a floating moored owc device in the physical wave flume and both the irregular and regular wave conditions were considered to analyse the survivability of the damaged mooring system zheng and zhang 2018 proposed a novel wave energy converter composed by a floating owc device and several oscillating floats and theoretically explored its dynamic response and energy extraction in the frequency domain by using the open source cfd toolbox openfoam wang et al 2019 proposed a dual chamber owc system consisting of heave only and onshore units and the effects from a number of parameters including the chamber breadth wall drafts and the interval between different device on its performance in energy extraction were numerically examined the primary objective of the present work is to complement the research on the owc device partially composed by a moving component under the excitation of ocean waves with different frequencies compared with the traditional fully stationary owc device the device proposed at present is equipped with some parts which are allowed to move harmoniously under the action of incident waves and the inclusion of movement is much likely to influence the device performance positively or negatively thus detailed comparison of the device performance is implemented between the owc with different movable components to figure out which part of the movement i e front lip wall or back lip wall will have a better impact on the performance in wave energy extraction and this can provide practical engineering guidance to avoid inappropriate design although the wec device of owc type is usually praised for its structural simplicity and the model proposed here has more complexity compared with the stationary owc device to some extent this defect can be made up if the improvement in device performance is inspiring and noticeable to this end a theoretical model based on the linear potential flow theory of a two dimensional offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and a surging back lip wall is established respectively the matched eigenfunction expansion method is utilized and the continuity condition of velocity and pressure on the common interface between different regions is employed to build a set of linear equations for the calculations of hydrodynamic properties of the owc device including the optimal energy absorption efficiency reflection and transmission coefficient averaged free surface displacement inside the pneumatic chamber and horizontal loads acting on the moving part the potential influential factors namely the symmetry wall drafts the chamber breadth and spring stiffness are explored and their effects on the interested hydrodynamic performance of the owc device with a surging front and back lip wall are compared and discussed the remainder of this paper is organized by the mathematical formulation convergence test and model validation results and discussions and conclusions respectively 2 mathematical formulation as depicted in fig 1 a and b an offshore oscillating water column wave energy conversion device with a surging front and a surging back wall is considered and explored by assuming the owc device with an infinite length and parallel to the wave crest the hydrodynamic problem related to present owc device model could be thought as a 2d problem for convenience a cartesian coordinates o x z is defined in which the x axis coincides with the still water level and z axis points vertically upwards respectively and coordinate origin o is selected exactly at the centre of the owc pneumatic chamber some essential geometry parameters describing the owc device are illustrated in fig 1 with a constant system water depth h and the breadth and height of the chamber is indicated with 2 w 1 and c respectively and the submerged depth of the front and back wall are denoted by d 1 and d 2 in addition w 2 w 1 is used to take the thickness of lip wall into consideration for the sake of optimizing the extraction and conversion efficiency of the owc device a wells turbine is equipped at the top of the owc pneumatic chamber and by tuning its parameters an optimal performance could be achieved considering the difference of boundary conditions of different regions in the whole system the matched eigenfunction expansion method is utilized and the whole fluid domain could be divided into five sub regions namely ω 1 ω 5 as depicted in fig 1 2 1 the governing equation and boundary conditions under the assumption of irrotational fluid and inviscid fluid it is conventional to introduce a total velocity potential φ x z t and air pressure drop p c representing the pressure condition inside the pneumatic chamber for the time harmonic motion of angular frequency ω above two variables can be separately written as 2 1 φ x z t re φ x z e i ω t p c t re p c e i ω t where i 1 t is the time re is to take the real component of argument φ x z and p c denote complex amplitudes of related parameters respectively in the domain filled with fluid the complex amplitude of total velocity potential φ satisfies the following governing equation 2 2 2 φ x z 0 and the corresponding boundary conditions could be expressed as 2 3 φ z ω 2 g φ i ω ρ g p c w 1 x w 1 z 0 0 x w 2 or x w 2 z 0 2 4 φ z 0 z h 2 5 φ n u n on rigid boundaries in which n indicates the positive normal direction pointing outside the fluid region and u n denotes the normal velocity on the solid structure boundaries ρ is the density of fluid 1 10 3 kg m 3 g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 in addition to the boundary conditions expressed in eqns 2 3 2 5 the sommerfeld radiation condition must be satisfied as well and its physical meaning is to represent the outgoing waves at infinity based on the theory of linear water waves generally the total velocity potential φ is conventionally decomposed into three different components in present work 2 6 φ φ s φ r 1 φ r 2 where φ r 1 is the complex amplitude in the radiation problem resulting from the unique air pressure oscillation in the air chamber but free from the action of incident waves φ r 2 is the complex amplitude in the radiation problem due to the surging motion of the wall under the condition of unique pressure distribution inside and outside the pneumatic chamber and free from wave conditions φ s denotes the wave scattering by an owc device without ceiling and could further be divided into the following two parts 2 7 φ s φ i φ d here φ d is the diffraction potential and φ i is the incident wave potential propagating from x and its formal mathematical expression is dean and dalrymple 1984 2 8 φ i i g a ω cosh k z h cosh k h e i k x w 2 in which a denotes the amplitude of incident waves and k is the wave number 2 2 motion equation for the surging wall to realize the displacement control of the structure a simple linear spring of stiffness k is introduced the motion equation of the surging wall is indispensable to be built for the solution of the one scattering problem and two radiation problems here due to the similarity between the motion problem of surging front wall and surging back wall the former is taken as an example for illustration based on the newton s second law the surging motion of the front wall can be written as 2 9 f φ f p k s m s d 2 s d t 2 where f φ re f φ e i ω t f φ f s a f r 1 p c f r 2 s is the consultant force from the wave fields f p re f p e i ω t f p p c c is the consultant force from the air pressure fluctuation inside the pneumatic chamber m is the mass of surging wall which can be expressed as m s ρ s c d 1 w 2 w 1 where ρ s is the density of wall and s re s e i ω t is the surging displacement of the front wall for brevity p c and s namely the dimensionless form of complex amplitude of p c and s satisfy the following equation 2 10 p c p c ρ g a s s a thus the motion equation could be rewritten as 2 11 f r 2 ω 2 m s k s ρ g f r 1 c p c f s where 2 12 f s a i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 s φ 3 s d z f r 1 p c i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 r 1 φ 3 r 1 d z f r 2 s i ω ρ d 1 0 φ 1 r 2 φ 3 r 2 d z 2 3 power take off model to realize the extraction and conversion of the wave energy the power take off pto device is an essential part of the pneumatic wave energy conversion device and a linear wells turbine is installed on the top of the air chamber according to sarmento 1985 and martin rivas and mei 2009 the formal mathematical expression describing the relationship between the varied rate of the air mass and pressure drop inside the pneumatic chamber can be written as 2 13 d m d t d ρ c v d t ρ c 0 d v d t v 0 d ρ c d t k ˆ d n ˆ p c in which m ρ c and v are the instantaneous air mass density and volume inside the chamber respectively ρ c 0 and v 0 are respectively the initial state of the air density and the air volume k ˆ d n ˆ are the parameters revealing the performance of the linear turbine and respective meanings are the dimensionless damping coefficient outer diameter of the turbine rotor the angular rotational speed of the turbine blades an isentropic process of the air compression is assumed falcão and justino 1999 and by combining the sound speed c a 340 m s in air at a constant pressure condition the relationship between the density and pressure of the air inside the chamber can be expressed as 2 14 c a 2 d ρ c d t d p c d t physically d v d t represents the varied rate of the total volume of air inside the chamber obtained by 2 15 q d v d t w 1 w 1 φ 3 z z 0 d x d s d t c where the outflow of air from the chamber is considered positive q re q e i ω t is also considered as a time harmonic motion and q denotes the complex amplitude of the volume flux combining the decomposition of different components in eqn 2 6 q can also be divided into 2 16 q q s q r 1 q r 2 i ω c s where q s is the contribution due to the wave diffraction problem q r 1 is the component from the air pressure oscillation inside the pneumatic chamber q r 2 is the component from the surging motion of front wall they can be obtained by respectively 2 17 q s w 1 w 1 φ 3 s z z 0

p c ρ ω j r 1 i ω s j r 2 2 4 2 auxiliary velocity distribution functions the singular behaviour occurring at the vicinity of lower edges of the owc device when treated in the numerical calculations is much likely to lead to the occurrence of an ill conditioned matrix thus weakening the convergence speed to deal with this problem effectively the galerkin approximation method introduced in evans and porter 1996 is utilized in the present work for the sake of numerical accuracy the singular behaviour near the sharp edges of the structures can be characterized by the horizontal velocity distributions which are expanded in the form of orthogonal polynomials for the four common boundaries in fig 1 i e x w 2 and w 1 they can be expressed as respectively x w 2 2 29 u w 2 j z ξ j r 0 α r

2 i 1 6 i r s c 2 j 1 6 j q p are the even terms of gegenbauer polynomials and γ is the gamma function 2 4 3 solving the unknown coefficients to obtain the unknown coefficients in eqn 2 27 the formal expressions of the velocity potential must satisfy the upper and lower boundary conditions as well as the far field condition meanwhile on the common interface between the different connected sub regions the distribution of horizontal velocity and pressure along the interface must ensure the continuity of fluid field firstly according to the continuity of the horizontal velocities on the common interface i e at the spatial location of x w 2 w 1 w 1 w 2 the following equations must be satisfied 2 35 φ 1 j x u n d 1 z 0 x w 2 u w 2 j z h z d 1 x w 2 2 36 φ 2 j x u w 2 j z h z d 1 x w 2 2 37 φ 2 j x u w 1 j z h z d 1 x w 1 2 38 φ 3 j x u n d 1 z 0 x w 1 u w 1 j z h z d 1 x w 1 2 39 φ 3 j x 0 d 2 z 0 x w 1 u w 1 j z h z d 2 x w 1 2 40 φ 4 j x u w 1 j z h z d 2 x w 1 2 41 φ 4 j x u w 2 j z h z d 2 x w 2 2 42 φ 5 j x 0 d 2 z 0 x w 2 u w 2 j z h z d 2 x w 2 next the orthogonality of the z dependence is applied to calculate all the unknown coefficients except for for b 0 j and f 0 j in eqn 2 27 in this procedure it is general to multiply the two sides of eqns 2 35 2 42 by utilizing the corresponding eigenfunctions eqn 2 22 and eqns 2 25 2 26 and then over the vertical direction the obtained equations can be integrated for further calculations secondly besides the horizontal velocities continuity the continuity condition of pressure distribution must be satisfied as well thus the equations at the common interface can be expressed as respectively 2 43 φ 1 j φ 2 j h z d 1 x w 2 2 44 φ 2 j φ 3 j h z d 1 x w 1 2 45 φ 3 j φ 4 j h z d 2 x w 1 2 46 φ 4 j φ 5 j h z d 2 x w 2 by using u 1 r u 1 s u 1 q and u 1 p respectively to multiply the both sides of eqn 2 43 eqn 2 44 eqn 2 45 and eqn 2 46 and combining the mathematical expressions of coefficients a m j b n j c n j d m j e m j f n j g n j and h m j a set of linear equations can be built together with the unknown coefficients α r j β s j γ q j κ p j b 0 j and f 0 j once the linear system is numerically solved the interested parameters could be further obtained including the velocity potential and other physical quantities 2 5 calculations of relevant quantities 2 5 1 energy absorption efficiency following martin rivas and mei 2009 and deng et al 2014 the wave power absorbed by present owc device can be evaluated by 2 47 p o u t d ρ c v d t p c ρ c 0 k ˆ d n ˆ p c 2 ρ c 0 k ˆ d 2 ρ c 0 n ˆ p c 2 ρ 2 g 2 a 2 k ˆ d 2 ρ c 0 n ˆ p c 2 combining the wave energy flux of incident wave with per unit crest length ρ g a 2 c g 2 c g denotes the group velocity it can be used to normalize the absorbed wave power p o u t to obtain the expression of power absorption efficiency e namely 2 48 e ρ h g h ρ c 0 c g k ˆ d h n ˆ g h p c 2 ρ h g h ρ c 0 c g x 1 2 χ χ re x 2 2 im x 2 2 where 2 49 χ k ˆ d h n ˆ g h 2 50 x 1 ρ c 0 ρ

optimal wave energy conversion efficiency e o p t this can be implemented by the derivative of turbine parameters in eqn 2 48 namely e χ 0 thus the optimal turbine parameter χ o p t is x 2 and the optimal energy conversion efficiency e o p t can be obtained by introducing χ o p t into the formula eqn 2 48 2 5 2 reflection and transmission coefficient the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient of the owc device with a surging wall namely c r and c t can be calculated by the following expressions 2 52 c r n 0 1 2 a 0 s p c a 0 r 1 ω 2 s g a 0 r 2 cos k 0 h c t n 0 1 2 h 0 s p c h 0 r 1 ω 2 s g h 0 r 2 cos k 0 h another function of the introduction of c r and c t lies in that it can be applied to verify the conservation of the total wave energy in the system namely the conservation relation must be always satisfied no matter what the circumstance is 2 53 c r 2 c t 2 e 1 2 5 3 averaged free surface displacement inside the chamber the surface displacement inside the pneumatic chamber is usually introduced to analyse the behaviour of the fluid here the spatially averaged surface elevation namely η which is normalized by the incident wave amplitude a can be divided into three components from wave scattering problem and wave radiation problems respectively 2 54 η η 3 s η 3 r 1 η 3 r 2 where 2 55 η 3 s m 0 m cos k m h k m n m 1 2 2 w 1 d m s e k m w 1 e

loads f x acting on the moving wall is usually another concentrated point the formal mathematical expression of the horizontal loads is written as 2 56 f x a f s p c f r 1 s f r 2 p c c a f s p c ρ g a f r 1 s a f r 2 p c ρ g a c based on the incident wave amplitude a and water depth h the dimensionless form of the horizontal loads acting on the surging front wall can be written as 2 57 f x 2 f x ρ g a h 2 f s p c ρ g f r 1 s f r 2 p c ρ g c ρ g h 3 convergence test and model validation 3 1 convergence test as described in the mathematical expressions of the velocity potentials in eqn 2 27 and horizontal velocities in eqns 2 29 2 32 there exists several infinite summations and it is necessary to determine an appropriate truncated number for these summations to guarantee accurate results according to deng et al 2020b the truncated number of r s q p equalling 6 is enough to obtain satisfying solutions with respect to the truncated number of m and n namely m and n under the condition of r s q p 6 the convergence test is carried out with h 20 m w 1 0 2 h w 2 0 2000001 h d 1 d 2 0 1 h in addition considering the range of interested dimensionless wave parameter k h from 0 3 to 10 the case when k h is 5 0 is taken for illustration the optimal parameters including e o p t c r o p t and c t o p t the subscript o p t denotes the parameter is calculated when χ is x 2 are plotted versus m and n respectively in fig 2 the results displayed in fig 2 demonstrate that the cut off number of n is much easily to achieve a convergent result than the cut off number of m generally when m 50 and n 10 the difference between resulting parameters can almost be ignored in the subsequent computations the value of m 50 and n 10 is adopted without loss of generality the following constant parameters are used unless otherwise specified water depth h 20 m relative density ratio ρ ρ 0 1000 and vertical distance c 0 1 h from the top cover of the owc to the still water level 3 2 model validation to validate the correctness of self programming code for solving present wave scattering and radiation problems the analytical results published by he et al 2019 were used for a calibration and verification in this part the chosen geometry parameters of the owc device proposed in he et al 2019 are half breadth of the pneumatic chamber w 1 0 05 h front wall draft d 1 0 05 h 0 1 h 0 15 h 0 2 h and 0 25h back wall draft d 2 d 1 0 1 h the thickness of front and back wall was neglected in the literature and this can be achieved by setting w 2 w 1 here the parameters including the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t the optimal dimensionless pto damping c o p t and the corresponding wave transmission coefficient c t o p t and reflection coefficient c r o p t are the main concentrated parameters in waves of k h ranging from 0 3 to 10 except for the optimal dimensionless pto damping which is defined as c o p t ρ h χ ρ c other parameters can be calculated according to eqn 2 48 and eqn 2 52 respectively it is worth mentioning that the parameters deduced in sec 2 5 all take the effect of spring stiffness k and the surging motion of the lip wall into consideration in view of the owc model proposed in he et al 2019 is completely stationary and in order to ensure the consistency of present work and model in the literature the value of spring stiffness k is set as so the surging displacement of lip wall can almost be ignored in present model as depicted in fig 3 all the tested variables evidently show that various results obtained in the present model agree well with the theoretical model published by he et al 2019 which effectively guarantee the correctness of the present mathematical deductions and numerical computations in addition the law of energy conservation i e c r 2 c t 2 e 1 is always checked and validated for any case in fig 3 but this is not displayed in it for brevity thus further investigations on related hydrodynamic parameters can be implemented effectively in the following sections 4 results and discussions 4 1 effects of the symmetry wall drafts the structure parameters of the owc device examined in this part are as follows the chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 1 h the thickness of both the front and back wall is ignored by setting w 2 w 1 and the relative density of the moving component ρ s ρ 0 5 the front and back wall drafts d 1 d 2 0 1 h 0 15 h 0 2 h and 0 25h are taken into account in addition the surging motion of the front and back wall of the owc device is considered respectively as shown in fig 4 the comparison of optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t is given for the surging model including surging front wall and surging back wall and the completely stationary model where surging fw and surging bw mean the circumstance with surging front wall and surging back wall respectively regarding the surging part of the owc device the spring stiffness k imposed on is set as 0 here and thus the movement can be regarded as a fully free mode for the fully stationary owc device in fig 4 b there exists only one peak efficiency within the interested range of k h the value of which is approximate to 0 5 with the increase of immersed depth d 1 and d 2 of the owc device there is a trend of left shift of the peak efficiency this is mainly due to that the increase of lip wall draft means the increase of the water column mass trapped inside the chamber and the inertia effect and natural period of the oscillating water column will increase as well in addition the rapid decrease of the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t within the range of 6 k h 10 is much evident owing to the increase of wall drafts generally the increase of wall drafts can make the propagating waves difficult to pass through the back lip wall of the owc device and almost be reflected at the front lip wall thus to some extent reflected wave energy reduces the extracted wave power in turn due to the fact that most wave energy is concentrated at about a fourth wavelength below the sea water level drew et al 2009 reflection effects from the deeper wall drafts will become more dominant and extracted power will seriously decrease when the owc device is composed by a surging back wall k 0 with other parameters unchanged the performance in energy extraction and absorption is much inferior to the fully stationary model the increase of the wall draft not only leads to the reduction of absorption efficiency within a broad range of k h 2 k h 10 but also an evident drop of the peak value in the efficiency curves contrary to the model with a surging back wall the performance of the model with a surging front wall is significantly improved under the same wave conditions especially in the range of 4 k h 10 and over a much wide range of k h a high efficiency frequency band e o p t 0 5 can be achieved which means the owc device with a surging front wall is more beneficial for the extraction of wave energy the curves of the averaged water surface displacement inside the chamber η in fig 5 a show that there exists dual peak values for all the cases including the left peak value and right peak value with the increase of k h the occurring of the violent internal water surface oscillation usually results from the resonance mechanism and is much likely to lead to a considerable energy efficiency rezanejad et al 2013 generally no matter the cases with a surging front wall or a surging back wall the right peak value of η occur at the same k h with the peak of e o p t shown in fig 4 b which is mainly due to the resonance mechanism of the oscillation of the water column inside the chamber when the front wall or back wall is in a surging mode this kind of resonance does not result in noticeable effects on the efficiency curves in fig 4 a nevertheless another resonance mechanism resulting from the surging motion of the lip wall for both the front wall and back wall is much evident in the efficiency curves as the occurring of the left peak value of η in fig 5 a is in accordance with the left peak efficiency displayed in fig 4 a with respect to the resonance from surging motion of the lip wall besides the left peak value of the averaged water surface displacement η actually it can be associated with the response amplitude operator s defined in eqn 2 10 of the moving component of the owc device as well this can be further proved according to the results displayed in fig 5 b as the maximum response amplitude operator s occurs at the same wave parameter k h condition with the left peak value of both the averaged water surface displacement η and optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t in addition the surging location of the lip wall does not make a difference to the occurring of the peak η for both the internal fluid resonance and the surging lip wall resonance moreover it can be noticed that the left peak value of η for surging fw is a little lower than that for surging bw and this can be partially responsible for the lower efficiency for surging fw shown in fig 4 a note that the right peak value of η for surging fw is much larger than that for surging bw and over a broad range of k h the resulting fluid oscillation is more violent for the surging front wall as well which is the main reason for superior characteristics in energy absorption for the owc device with a surging front wall fig 6 illustrates the comparison of reflection and transmission coefficient c r o p t and c t o p t between surging model and fully stationary model when the pto damping is optimized for the energy absorption efficiency e o p t for the fully stationary owc model with the increase of wall drafts d 1 and d 2 an overall larger reflection coefficient but lower transmission coefficient can be obtained regarding the effects of surging motion of front wall and back wall the curves of c r o p t firstly increases to a turning point at k h where surging lip wall resonance occurs then decreases to a local minimum and after that c r o p t increases again with respect to the effects of wall drafts under the lip wall surging mode for small k h smaller than the k h where resonance resulting from the surging mode occurs the difference between surging front and surging back wall can almost be ignored for the range of 3 k h 10 a deeper wall draft can reflect more wave energy for the surging motion of the back wall while the results of c r o p t are opposite for the surging motion of the front wall within the range of 7 k h 10 as for the transmission coefficient c t o p t there exists a valley with the increase of k h which is due to the resonance of surging motion of lip wall the effects on c t o p t from different surging parts of the owc device with the same wall draft can almost be ignored the effective range of k h to obtain a safe transmission coefficient c t o p t 0 5 both for the stationary model and the model with a surging component is similar which indicates the surging motion will not result in a significant improvement in terms of its performance in wave attenuation in addition when the turbine is optimized for the energy extraction efficiency e o p t the amplitude of air pressure p c depicted in fig 7 a illustrates that there exists almost no discrepancy between the model with a surging front wall and with a surging back wall for all cases within the range of k h 2 and the peak value of p c occurs at the same k h with the peak of e o p t and η which is mainly due to the resonance phenomenon from the surging lip wall physically when the oscillation of the internal water surface improves to a more violent extent the resulting internal air pressure p c inside the pneumatic chamber generally will be enhanced simultaneously within the range of 4 k h 10 the air pressure p c for the model with a surging front wall is much larger than the model with a surging back wall referring to eqn 2 47 the energy absorption efficiency is mainly determined by the internal air pressure to a great extent and the pressure difference between different surging components can partially explain the difference of performance in energy extraction and utilization with respect to the horizontal loads f x acting on the moving part of the owc device shown in fig 7 b it can be noticed that horizontal loads for the surging front wall is much larger than that for the surging back wall which is easily understood as the front wall is the most direct load bearing position generally a larger horizontal load will contribute to a larger response amplitude operator s however combining the curves of f x and s shown in figs 7 b and fig 5 b respectively the results are not conform to above regularity especially around the value of resonance condition k h due to the surging lip wall but when k h is away from this resonance condition namely k h increases to the short wave regime a larger horizontal force condition leads to a larger wall displacement 4 2 effects of the chamber breadth the effects of the owc chamber breadth 2 w 1 on the energy absorption efficiency are explored and the comparison of optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t between surging model surging front wall and surging back wall and stationary model for different chamber breadths namely 2 w 1 0 1 h 0 2 h 0 3 h 0 4 h is given in fig 8 a and b in all cases the condition of w 1 w 2 is considered in view of the superior performance in energy extraction with a larger wall draft d 1 and d 2 for the owc device with a surging front wall the drafts d 1 d 2 0 25 h is unchanged in this part for the fully stationary owc model without moving components there exists no difference between the energy absorption efficiency e o p t when k h 4 no matter what the half chamber breadth w 1 is but considerable enhancement of the efficiency can be observed with the increase of chamber breadth for the extremely long wave regime k h 3 in addition a left shift of the peak efficiency could be noticed with the increase of chamber breadth 2 w 1 for the owc device with a surging back lip wall the evident enhancement of energy efficiency e o p t with the increase of w 1 only occurs at a finite range of k h namely 0 8 k h 3 5 while for the model with a surging front wall the high efficiency frequency band for w 1 0 1 h is more broad than when the half chamber breadth w 1 0 05 h and a trend of efficiency attenuation can be noticed when k h is larger than 8 when the half chamber breadth w 1 increases to 0 15 h the attenuation phenomenon starts to occur at a smaller k h around the value 5 and the high efficiency bandwidth becomes much narrower than the case with a half chamber breath w 1 0 1 h for the case with the widest chamber the efficiency curve for w 1 0 2 h and surging fw firstly experiences a peak value due to the surging lip wall resonance then decreases a little but increases dramatically to a larger peak value around 0 92 after that it drops drastically to a zero efficiency point but continues to increase within a limit range of k h the occurrence of the zero efficiency point is mainly owing to the sloshing mode of the fluid inside the owc chamber rezanejad et al 2013 ning et al 2016b which is much likely to happen when the half incident wave length λ 2 is approximately equal to the chamber breadth 2 w 1 it is worth mentioning that the sloshing mode does not occur for the fully stationary model but when it is excited by the surging lip wall it provides an opportunity for the occurrence of this new resonance mechanism due to sloshing mode it can be inferred that the phenomenon with multiple peak efficiency values over 2 is completely applicable to the cases with w 1 0 05 h 0 1 h 0 15 h as well but they do not occur due to the limited range of tested k h referring to the averaged water surface displacement η and the amplitude of air pressure p c inside the chamber shown in fig 9 the k h with a zero value of efficiency meanwhile leads to a weak averaged water fluid oscillation and weak air pressure inside the chamber the existence of other peak values of η and p c have been explained in the previous parts and for brevity this is not be repeated here for the fully stationary owc model and surging model their respective performance in terms of wave reflection and transmission are compared in fig 10 when the owc device is fully fixed for a finite range of k h namely 0 3 k h 2 and 3 k h 4 the increase of chamber breadth will result in a slight improvement in the reflection coefficient c r o p t but a reduction in the transmission coefficient c t o p t almost for the whole tested k h range this is because the increase of the breadth of pneumatic chamber will increase the cross sectional area of the oscillating water column in the chamber and so is the inertia of the internal fluid so wave energy is less likely to transmit to the leeside of the owc device and more prone to be reflected and extracted when considering the surging motion of the back wall the curves of c r o p t and c t o p t will not changed significantly except for the k h when the resonance phenomenon happens including the surging motion resonance of the lip wall k h 0 3 0 8 the vertical oscillation resonance of the water column k h 2 5 3 5 and the sloshing mode of the water column k h 8 8 3 in the pneumatic chamber with respect to the surging motion of the front wall the curves of c r o p t differ a lot between cases with different chamber breadths as illustrated in fig 10 a for each curve there exists a nearly zero reflection coefficient and the corresponding k h is in accordance with the position where the maximum energy absorption efficiency e o p t occurs in fig 8 a and this can be understood by analysing the wave energy distribution in the whole system based on the conservation law overall owing to the ignorable difference for the transmission coefficient c t o p t between the surging model and the stationary model to significantly improve the performance in energy extraction and conversion it can only make efforts from the aspect of reducing the wave energy that reflected by the marine structures combing the purpose of extracting and utilizing the wave energy to a maximum extent within the concentrated wave parameters k h range the owc device with a chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 2h and a surging front wall is the relatively optimal structure design as it can reduce the reflected wave energy as much as possible and contribute to more components of the energy to be conversed 4 3 effects of the spring stiffness in the previous discussions the spring stiffness k is set as zero for considering the surging motion of the front or back lip wall which means the motion of the moving component of the owc device is completely free under the action of external forces actually the function of the spring is not only to provide a new resonance mechanism for the owc device but also to tune the motion response of the moving component for a more desirable performance in energy extraction and conversion to this end in this subsection the spring with different stiffness k the unit of spring stiffness k is n m the value of k is from 0 to 1 10 8 is considered and the corresponding working performance is examined and discussed fig 11 shows the optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t for the owc model with a surging front lip wall and surging back lip wall respectively as a function of both k h and l o g 10 k under the conditions of d 1 d 2 0 25 h w 1 w 2 0 1 h the results of a completely freely surging lip wall namely k 0 are not included due to the l o g 10 function for the owc model with a surging front lip wall the distribution of e o p t can be divided into three main regions the first one is within the range of 0 3 k h 2 and 0 l o g 10 k 8 the feature of which is that under the action of extremely long waves the effects from the variation of stiffness k on e o p t can almost be ignored and the value is always lower than 0 4 the second region is bounded in 3 k h 10 and 0 l o g 10 k 5 which can be regarded as a high efficiency region with the majority of e o p t larger than 0 8 when the stiffness k is smaller than 1 10 4 i e l o g 10 k 4 different k can result in a slight effect on e o p t however when l o g 10 k increases to 5 a rapid decline of the absorption efficiency could be noticed the further increase of l o g 10 k will lead to the distribution of e o p t entering into the third region as mentioned before where is the low efficiency region and the majority of e o p t is less than 0 2 for the owc model with a surging back wall only a finite region which is bounded in 2 k h 3 and 4 l o g 10 k 6 can obtain a relatively satisfying energy absorption efficiency e o p t but far from enough and in other areas the absorption efficiency e o p t is extremely unsatisfactory as the majority of its value is lower than 0 2 owing to the superior performance in energy extraction for the owc model with a surging front lip wall other parameters including optimal energy absorption efficiency e o p t and corresponding averaged water surface displacement η response amplitude operator s and horizontal loads f x are plotted in fig 12 for the superior owc model the efficiency curves in fig 12 a can help understand the distribution of e o p t versus k h and l o g 10 k in fig 11 a when the spring stiffness k is smaller than 1 10 4 including the fully free mode k 0 a slight difference can be observed for the different efficiency curves while when the spring stiffness k increases to a value larger than 1 10 6 the surging motion of the lip wall tends to be restricted and is more prone to be a fixed wall generally the increase of spring stiffness k can lead to a decline in the energy absorption e o p t the averaged water surface displacement η and the response amplitude operator s but a rise in the horizontal loads f x acting on the surging lip wall it is worth noting that for the spring stiffness k 1 10 5 the curves of e o p t η s and f x differ from the curves for both the small spring stiffness and large spring stiffness and this spring stiffness k can be seen as a transition value which means the related performance revealed when the owc device is subjected to ocean waves is determined by the combined effects from the stationary model and the surging model the combination of the two effects can lead to a much violent fluid oscillation an increased motion displacement and an evident increase of horizontal force especially when the resonance phenomenon occurs according to above examinations the proper design of the spring stiffness k is essential and required to achieve a high efficiency in a wide frequency bandwidth generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness and even k 0 a completely free mode of the front lip wall is more recommended 5 conclusions the hydrodynamic performance of an offshore owc device with a surging front lip wall and a surging back lip wall under the excitation of ocean waves with a wide range of frequencies was explored analytically by utilizing the linear potential flow theory the effects resulting from the potential influential factors on the related hydrodynamic properties were compared between the owc device with a surging front lip wall and back lip wall the prime findings from the present work are listed below firstly the increase of the wall drafts will significantly enhance the performance in energy absorption when the owc device is equipped with a surging front lip wall while weaken its efficiency with a surging back lip wall the improvement is not only reflected in the increase of the peak efficiency but also in the considerable expansion of high efficiency frequency bandwidth compared with the stationary model overall in the present work front and back wall draft d 1 d 2 0 25 h is the most recommended design secondly when the front lip wall of the owc device is in the surging mode there exists an optimal chamber breadth in terms of energy extraction and conversion to the best utilization of wave energy within the interested wave frequency range the owc device with a chamber breadth 2 w 1 0 2 h is more desirable however the performance of device with a surging back lip wall is far from satisfactory compared with another model thirdly the positive effects of the spring stiffness on the front surging model is mainly within a limited range namely k 1 10 4 and when k is over the value 1 10 6 the function of surging motion is slight due to the moving wall is prone to be fixed generally a relatively smaller spring stiffness or k 0 a completely free mode of the front lip wall is more advisable finally over a wide range of wave frequency the resulting reflection coefficient from the surging motion of the front wall is far lower than the model with a surging back lip wall but the difference between transmission coefficient for different models can almost be ignored when considering the variation of symmetry wall drafts and chamber breadth the concept proposed in present work can be extended to investigate a fully 3d owc device model coupled with a moving component in practical design the realization of the connections between moving lip walls and the owc device is the main concentrated point in the future which will be reported elsewhere credit authorship contribution statement chen wang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

21146,the stress on an engineering structure tends to be random and is usually assumed to be gaussian or weakly non gaussian in some situations the power spectrum of stress also exhibits two distinct peaks in a bimodal profile this study focuses on the fatigue damage estimation of softening non gaussian bimodal processes kurtosis 3 with emphasis on spectral methods several classical spectral methods for gaussian problems and a newly developed method by authors are examined correction factors derived from the hermite transformation are used to handle the non gaussianity through comprehensive case studies including ideal bimodal spectra and practical bimodal spectra in ocean engineering the accuracy of the underlying gaussian fatigue damage and the corresponding correction factor for each spectral method is investigated separately the results demonstrate that when the non gaussianity is weak kurtosis between 3 and 6 the correction factor is dominated by the nonlinear mapping between the non gaussian stress and the underlying gaussian stress while the bandwidth effect is relatively limited under this situation the narrow banded correction factor proposed by winterstein is conservatively accurate in most cases among all spectral methods the newly developed method coupled with the winterstein s correction factor renders the best accuracy of non gaussian fatigue damage estimation keywords fatigue assessment non gaussian stress bimodal process spectral method correction factor 1 introduction at the preliminary design stage of an engineering structure spectral methods are usually adopted to estimate the structural fatigue life when the response stress of a structural component is gaussian and narrow banded nb its rainflow amplitude can be assumed to follow the rayleigh distribution so that its induced fatigue damage can be analytically derived with the miner s rule miner 1945 and the material s n curve dnvgl 2016 if the stress is wide banded wb the rayleigh approximation is inaccurate and many classical methods were so developed to handle this condition such as the wirsching light wl method wirsching and light 1980 the dirlik dk method dirlik 1985 the zhao barker zb method zhao and barker 1992 the single moment sm method lutes and larsen 1990 the tovo benasciutti tb method tovo 2002 benasciutti and tovo 2006 the jb method park et al 2014 and so on moreover for the wb bimodal stress which has two primary peaks in its power spectrum there were also a number of specific and effective spectral methods such as the jiao moan jm method jiao and moan 1990 the fu cebon fc method fu and cebon 2000 the low method low 2010 and the state of the art gao zheng gz method gao and zheng 2019 in general these spectral methods are based on gaussian assumption some of them were developed through establishing an empirical rainflow distribution i e the dk method the zb method the tb method the jb method whereas some others were developed empirically by simulations or by assuming a novel theoretical fatigue model i e the wl sm jm fc low and gz methods it should be recognized that the action of many loads such as wind sea waves usually exhibits significant non gaussian features their induced structural responses are liable to be non gaussian as well though the non gaussianity of the response would be much weaker than that of loads for example the kurtosis of wave loads may exceed 10 while the kurtosis of wave induced platform motions is only around 5 applying spectral methods to evaluate the structural fatigue life under non gaussian situation is difficult because the corresponding rainflow amplitude distribution is no longer rayleigh its form is always complex and unknown in addition it was shown by the work of gao and moan 2007 that even the rainflow amplitude distribution of the non gaussian stress is known spectral fatigue assessment is neither an easy work for decades the hermite transformation model proposed by winterstein 1985 1988 has been almost the first choice for handling non gaussian problems especially in situations that only the statistical moments and power spectrum are available in winterstein s model winterstein and mackenzie 2011 the non gaussian process is represented as a cubic hermite series in terms of an underlying standard gaussian process the coefficients in the model are determined by mapping the statistical moments of both sides of the cubic transformation and it is assumed that the underlying standard gaussian process retains the same power spectrum of the non gaussian process in fact the power spectrum of the underlying gaussian process tends to deviate from that of the non gaussian process after the nonlinear transformation while such deviation is insignificant for a weakly non gaussian process ding and chen 2016 zheng et al 2020a when using the hermite transformation to compute fatigue damage induced by non gaussian processes one kernel problem is to determine the probability density function pdf of rainflow amplitudes of the underlying gaussian process benasciutti and tovo 2005 investigated the possibility of combing the distribution in the tb method with the hermite transformation aiming to account for the non gaussianity and the bandwidth at the same time in studies by ding and chen 2015 and chang et al 2017 the tb distribution and the dk distribution are modified by the hermite transformation to evaluate fatigue damage for non gaussian stress respectively essentially the hermite transformation can be used with any spectral method as long as the method could produce a peak trough joint probabilistic distribution function jpdf of the rainflow stress cycles of the underlying gaussian process however the dk distribution does not provide such a jpdf and the tb distribution can provide an empirically approximated jpdf the fact is that no analytical peak trough jpdf has been derived in literature for the rainflow stress thus one of the main objectives of this paper is to quantify the error incurred by combining the hermite transformation with an existing spectral method particularly when the asymmetry between the peaks and the troughs in a rainflow cycle cannot be explicitly derived for those methods which do not produce a rainflow pdf it is almost impossible to import the hermite transformation to modify the formula in each method an alternative access is to use a correction by evaluating a correction coefficient for fatigue damage that is directly computed with gaussian spectral methods it is possible to obtain the corresponding fatigue of the desired non gaussian process winterstein proposed a correction factor based on the hermite transformation and the rayleigh distribution in his early work winterstein 1988 this factor ignores the bandwidth effect so that the application of this factor to wide banded processes is theoretically irrational and needs a comprehensive examination similarly correction factors can be derived from the dk method or the tb method however these two correction factors also have limitations when they are applied to wide banded processes in that the dk method cannot consider the asymmetry the dk distribution does not provide a jpdf of peaks and troughs while the tb distribution can consider the asymmetry to a certain extent since it provides an approximated jpdf of peaks and troughs even so it will be of significance to compare these empirical correction factors as they are straightforward for engineers to make a fatigue assessment in the preliminary design stage digging out the inadequacy of these empirical correction factors which are theoretically incomplete when they are applied to wide banded non gaussian processes are of interest and is one of the motivations of the present work moreover relevant studies on application of correction factors to bimodal processes are limited which thus becomes another one of the motivations of the present study also it is of interest to show the bandwidth effect in fatigue assessment of weakly non gaussian processes whose kurtosis are between 3 and 6 especially it is worthy of discussing the role of correction factor when it is applied to the newly proposed gz method it is also of interest to address that braccesi et al 2009 and cianetti et al 2017 proposed two types of factors to correct the estimated fatigue damage for non gaussian stress state the factor by braccesi et al 2009 is based on finite element simulations of a motor vehicle chassis and the factor by cianetti et al 2017 is suitable for unskewed processes as this paper aims to discuss general non gaussian cases in engineering these two factors are not discussed in this paper for their limited applicability besides some researchers wolfsteiner and breuer 2013 wolfsteiner 2017 tried to decompose a non gaussian process into several segments of gaussian processes in the time domain so that the caused fatigue damage can be calculated by the gaussian methods nonetheless such idea can only be used for unskewed processes and the procedures involve the eighth order statistical moment which is of great uncertainty in practice wolfsteiner 2017 on the aforementioned premises the main contents of this paper are organized as follows first section 2 gives a brief introduction of several spectral methods for fatigue assessment of gaussian processes including a recently proposed spectral discretization method i e the gz method gao and zheng 2019 second three types of empirical correction factors based on the hermite transformation and different pdfs i e the rayleigh distribution the tb distribution and the dk distribution are respectively presented in section 3 subsequently section 4 compares these three empirical correction factors against the time domain factor derived from numerical simulations when they are applied to bimodal processes then section 5 investigates the performance of these empirical correction factors coupled with different gaussian spectral methods when they are applied to non gaussian bimodal cases a detailed comparison on existing spectral methods and correction factors for non gaussian fatigue estimation is conducted by a two step algorithm thus the respective effects of gaussian fatigue estimation and non gaussian correction factors in the course of non gaussian fatigue estimation are distinguished lastly significant remarks are concluded in section 6 2 a brief review of spectral fatigue analysis in spectral analysis of fatigue damage spectral moments are often used to describe the characteristics of the stochastic process for the structural stress x t with spectral density function g ω its n th order spectral moment λ n is defined as 1 λ n 0 ω n g ω d ω 0 2 π f n g f d f where ω and f are frequency in rad s and in hz respectively after λ n are calculated the relevant mean zero up crossing rate ν 0 and the occurrence of peaks local maxima ν p can be obtained according to the probabilistic theory 2 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 ν p 1 2 π λ 4 λ 2 to reflect the degree of the bandwidth of a process two familiar bandwidth parameters i e δ vanmarcke 1972 and ε dnvgl 2017 have been widely used i e 3 δ 1 α 1 2 4 ε 1 α 2 2 where 5 α m λ m λ 0 λ 2 m m 1 2 3 when the bandwidth of x t is infinitesimal δ and ε both approach 0 strictly speaking there is no rigorous criterion to demarcate nb and wb random processes in many studies cases of δ 0 1 are treated as nb for a zero mean nb gaussian process u t its amplitude r is of the rayleigh distribution 6 f r r r λ 0 exp r 2 2 λ 0 in which λ 0 σ u 2 is the variance of the gaussian process according to the palmgren miner linear damage accumulation rule miner 1945 and the s n curve dnvgl 2016 the fatigue damage per unit time is 7 d n b ν 0 c 2 2 λ 0 k γ 1 k 2 where c and k are both material parameters in the s n curve and n c s k is the number of cycles to failure when the level of the cyclic stress range is s γ is the gamma function when the process is wb the rayleigh distribution would deviate from the actual rainflow amplitude distribution significantly thus numerous approximate methods have been proposed to handle wb situations in this paper with the focus on bimodal gaussian processes four general wb spectral methods and a recently developed bimodal method are briefed they are the wl method the sm method the dk method the tb method and the gz method 2 1 wirsching light method in 1980 wirsching and light 1980 proposed a method based on the material parameter k in the s n curve and the bandwidth coefficient ε this method introduced a correction factor between the nb fatigue damage d n b and the wb fatigue damage d w l i e the wb fatigue damage per unit time is written as 8 d w l χ w l d n b the correction factor χ w l is a function of k and ε by numerical simulations and rainflow analysis of three wb spectra with k 3 10 χ w l is empirically fitted as follows 9 χ w l k ε a k 1 a k 1 ε b k 10 a k 0 926 0 033 k b k 1 587 k 2 323 from eqs 9 and 10 it can be seen that the wl method assumes the deviation from a nb process to a corresponding wb process in fatigue damage can be efficiently described by λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 and material parameter k when the gaussian process is ideally nb d w l equals d n b as ε 0 and χ w l 1 2 2 single moment method the well known single moment sm method was developed by lutes and larsen 1990 they used the generalized spectral moment of order 2 k to refine the rayleigh formulation in eq 7 i e 11 d s m 2 2 k 2 π c λ 2 k k 2 γ 1 k 2 this formula was empirical but was proven accurate in general wb cases including the bimodal spectrum with two close neighboring spectral peaks i e the frequency ratio of the high frequency peak to the low frequency peak is below 3 recently benasciutti et al 2013 and braccesi et al 2015 provided a mathematical basis for interpreting the sm method from a spectral discretization view 2 3 dirlik method another method widely used in engineering was developed by dirlik 1985 in this method the pdf of stress amplitude r is approximated as 12 f r r 1 σ u h 1 v ⅇ z v h 2 z h 2 ⅇ z 2 2 h 2 h 3 z ⅇ z 2 2 where z is the normalized stress amplitude i e z r σ u and 13 x m λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 λ 4 h 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 h α 2 x m h 1 2 1 α 2 h 1 h 1 2 h 2 1 α 2 h 1 h 1 2 1 h h 3 1 h 1 h 2 v 1 25 α 2 h 3 h 2 h h 1 the fatigue damage per unit time is written as 14 d d k 2 k v p c σ u k h 1 v k γ 1 k 2 k 2 γ 1 k 2 h 2 h k h 3 many studies benasciutti and tovo 2006 park et al 2014 larsen and irvine 2015 have shown that the rainflow amplitude distribution given by the dk method is accurate in many situations however the dk method after all was proposed in 1985 dirlik utilized only 20 segments of time series in the analysis for each power spectrum and each time series contained only 108 stress cycles with only five data points in each cycle in recent studies of the authors gao and zheng 2019 zheng et al 2020b it was shown by many simulations that accurate rainflow fatigue estimation of cases whose material parameter k 5 require time series that contains at least 1 million stress cycles and 32 data points in each cycle thus although the form of dk distribution has proved to be close to the rainflow distribution obtained in the time domain in many gaussian cases it is of interest to revisit the reliability of this method in this paper when it is applied to non gaussian cases coupled with the hermite transformation 2 4 tovo benasciutti tb method in 1993 frendhal and rychlik 1993 pointed that rainflow damage is always bounded by level crossing lc counting and range mean rm counting damages i e 15 d r m d r f c d l c in which 16 d l c ν p c α 2 2 2 σ u k γ 1 k 2 d n b 17 d r m ν p c 2 2 σ u α 2 k γ 1 k 2 α 2 k 1 d n b consequently tovo and benasciutti 2005 2006 took this rule and proposed that the wb damage corrected in terms of nb fatigue damage is 18 d t b b t b d l c 1 b t b d r m b t b 1 b t b α 2 k 1 d n b 19 b t b α 1 α 2 1 112 1 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 e 2 11 α 2 α 1 α 2 α 2 1 2 where b tb is called correction factor obtained from many time domain simulations with five different power spectra note that b tb is a function of spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 and α 2 but not linked to the material parameter k the numerical experiments used by tovo and benasciutti to establish eq 19 only involved two situations i e k 3 and 5 which are important in practice 2 5 gao zheng gz bimodal method the above four spectral methods are all developed for general wb cases meaning that they can be also applied to the fatigue assessment of bimodal processes in a recently work by gao and zheng 2019 a new spectral discretization method was developed to account for the interaction between low frequency lf and high frequency hf modes in the bimodal spectrum this method is much more accurate than other previous wb methods fig 1 shows a typical rectangular bimodal spectrum that has been discussed in many studies jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 gao and zheng 2019 and some useful parameters are defined below 20 γ ω h f m i d ω l f m i d 21 β ω h f l b ω h f u b g ω d ω ω l f l b ω l f u b g ω d ω whereas γ is the mid frequency ratio of hf component to the lf component β is the power ratio subscripts mid ub and lb respectively represent the mid frequency the upper bound frequency and the lower bound frequency in each mode the gao zheng gz method following the previous spectral discretization idea benasciutti et al 2013 braccesi et al 2015 first discretize both lf and hf bands into num infinitesimal nb bands and the total fatigue damage is calculated through 22 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k l f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f h f k 2 23 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f 24 λ 2 k h f i 1 n u m ω i h f 2 k g ω i h f δ ω h f 25 λ 2 k l f h f i 1 n u m ξ ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f ω i h f 2 k g ω i h f δ ω h f where λ 2 k l f and λ 2 k h f correspond to the damage contribution from the lf band and the hf band respectively the new incoming cross term λ 2 k l f h f reflects the coupling between lf and hf in λ 2 k l f h f a coefficient ξ is introduced to describe the degree of the coupling between the two bands the coefficient ξ is a function of γ β k and its empirical expression is obtained through the nonlinear optimization technique combined with a comprehensive data set generated from a great many monte carlo simulations gao and zheng 2019 in the reference paper a large number of combinations of γ β k are considered so as to cover a wide range of engineering problems the resultant expression gao and zheng 2019 shown in eq 26 is applicable to cases of γ 2 15 β 0 05 2 0 and k 3 9 26 ξ p 1 p 2 ln γ p 3 ln β p 4 ln γ 2 p 5 ln β 2 p 6 ln γ ln β 1 p 7 ln γ p 8 ln β p 9 ln γ 2 p 10 ln β 2 p 11 ln γ ln β where p u u 1 2 11 are second order polynomials of k c f gao and zheng 2019 fig 2 illustrates the physical meanings of eqs 22 26 for cross mode coupling specifically when the hf mode in the bimodal process is wb the hf mode is decomposed into several hf sub modes only incurring negligible complexity and additional computation effort gao and zheng 2019 3 hermite transformation and non gaussian fatigue correction factor aforementioned the structural response usually tends to be weakly or mildly non gaussian it is also known that the softening cases whose kurtosis is greater than 3 would cause larger stress cycles than their gaussian counterparts consequently this paper focuses on the softening situations of kurtosis between 3 and 6 3 1 cubic hermite transformation for softening cases winterstein introduced a forward cubic transformation from the underlying standard gaussian variable u to the target non gaussian variable x as follows winterstein 1988 27 x g u κ σ x u c 3 u 2 1 c 4 u 3 3 u m x the cubic transformation in eq 27 has been proven quite accurate for weakly and mildly non gaussian cases in many studies the coefficients κ c 3 and c 4 can be computed by mapping the first four central moments mean variance skewness and kurtosis on both sides of eq 27 in fact to obtain these model coefficients the mapped moments can also be linear moments winterstein and mackenzie 2011 or the combination of central moments and linear moments gao et al 2018 in this paper the conventional cubic hermite transformation model based on central moments are used 3 2 non gaussian fatigue correction factor with the cubic hermite transformation the non gaussian fatigue damage can be computed according to 28 d n g ν p c 0 g r g r k f r d r in which g function denotes the established cubic translation in eq 27 and represents the rainflow amplitude of the underlying gaussian stress and f r is its pdf it is important to mention that eq 28 was proposed by winterstein 1985 1988 2013 and is restricted to narrow banded processes 3 2 1 winterstein s correction factor the non gaussian fatigue correction factor is defined as the ratio of the fatigue damage that induced by the non gaussian stress to that induced by its underlying gaussian stress i e 29 c n g d n g d g for narrow banded processes the widely used c ng by winterstein 1988 based on the rayleigh distribution is 30 c n g w t d n g n b d g n b 0 g r g r k r exp r 2 2 d r 2 2 σ x k γ 1 k 2 notice that in eq 30 both peaks and troughs in every rainflow stress cycle are assumed to be symmetric about the zero mean stress c n g w t is theoretically correct for narrow banded processes however for wide banded processes c n g w t in many situations has to be empirically obtained 3 2 2 correction factor based on dirlik distribution substituting the dirlik s rainflow amplitude distribution in eq 12 into eq 28 the approximate non gaussian fatigue damage based on the dirlik method and the hermite transformation can be obtained consequently the corresponding correction factor is derived 31 c n g d k d n g d k d g d k 0 g r g r k f dk r d r 0 2 r σ x k f dk r d r it should be mentioned that σ u is unity in f dk r as the underlying gaussian process u t is standard in the hermite transformation i e eq 27 notice that although the dirlik distribution was proposed for wide banded gaussian processes it does not provide a jpdf of the peaks and the troughs thus eq 31 proposed herein assumes the peak and the trough in every rainflow stress cycle are symmetric about the zero stress consequently when this equation is applied to a wide banded non gaussian stress inaccuracy might emerge to fatigue damage assessment 3 2 3 correction factor based on tb method actually the idea of the tb method is to relate the rm method with the lc method by a factor b tb thereby the non gaussian fatigue based on the tb method can be written in a form similar to eq 18 according to ding and chen 2015 32 d n g t b b t b d n g l c 1 b t b d n g r m in which d n g l c is calculated through 33 d n g l c ν p c 0 g r g r k f l c r d r 34 f l c r α 2 r σ u 2 exp r 2 2 σ u 2 herein σ u 1 as the underlying gaussian process u t is standard as the rm method considered the jpdf of peaks and troughs the computation of d n g r m would be slightly complicated 35 d n g r m ν p c q g q g v k h r m q v d v d q where 36 h r m q v 1 σ u 2 α 2 2 2 2 π exp q 2 v 2 4 σ u 2 1 α 2 2 exp q v 2 1 2 α 2 2 4 σ u 2 1 α 2 2 2 α 2 2 q v 2 σ u 1 α 2 2 in eq 36 q and v are the peak and trough in the stress cycles counted by the rm method respectively notice that only when q v eq 36 has a physical meaning then the corresponding correction factor is so obtained 37 c n g t b d n g t b d g t b b t b d n g l c 1 b t b d n g r m b t b d g l c 1 b t b d g r m as shown in section 3 2 c n g w t and c n g d k are not derived from a jpdf of the peaks and the troughs c n g w t is established based on the narrow banded theory the formulation of c n g d k uses the dk distribution of amplitudes which was proposed for wide banded processes however c n g d k does not take the asymmetric characteristic of the stress cycles of wide banded processes into consideration c n g t b is based on the tb jpdf combining the lc method and the rm method thus the underlying distribution of c n g t b is wide banded however eq 34 used in c n g t b was also based on a symmetry assumption benasciutti and tovo 2005 in other words the asymmetry considered in the tb method is lc s symmetry plus rm s asymmetry to summarize all these three c ng have limitations summarized in table 1 when they are applied to wide banded processes consequently section 4 and section 5 of this paper are numerical studies to show their levels of validity and accuracy of estimating fatigue damages for non gaussian bimodal processes 4 comparison of non gaussian fatigue correction factors 4 1 bimodal rectangular spectra cng obtained from time domain simulations for the bimodal rectangular power spectrum in fig 1 time domain simulations are carried out to obtain c ng with varying frequency ratio γ power ratio β and bandwidths of hf lf modes δ lf and δ hf in the material fatigue curve coefficient c is assumed to be 1 for evaluations as this number does not affect the stochastic fatigue characteristics note that the time series used in time domain analysis should have 1 sufficient frequency sampling to ensure that peaks of hf stress cycles not be missed 2 sufficient duration length of time simulation to ensure that the rainflow damage converge in this work every time series includes at least 1e6 stress cycles and each stress cycle includes at least 32 steps fig 3 and fig 4 respectively plot the variation of c ng with respect to α 3 0 and α 3 0 6 for the case of nb lf δ lf 0 0576 and nb hf δ hf 0 0576 similarly fig 5 and fig 6 correspond to the wb lf δ lf 0 1429 mildly wide with the wb hf δ lf 0 2774 in these figures the results of γ 3 6 9 and β 0 2 1 are given it should be mentioned that the wb lf discussed here is a mildly wb process if the lf mode is too wide it might overlap the hf mode cases that the lf and the hf mode are overlapped will be discussed in practical case studies in section 5 it can be observed that c ng is more affected by γ than by β because γ reflects bandwidth when the frequency ratio γ is 3 c ng corresponding to β 0 2 and β 1 are close to each other when γ is 9 c ng corresponding to β 0 2 and β 1 greatly differ from figs 3 6 it is also noticed that when the non gaussianity is weak i e kurtosis smaller than 5 common situations of structural dynamic responses in ocean engineering the difference caused by γ and β in c ng is not obvious this implies that for a weakly non gaussian bimodal process the bandwidth has little effect on c ng 4 2 bimodal rectangular spectra cng obtained by spectra methods in order to investigate typical situations in practical engineering and not to repeat cases in section 4 1 the high frequency mode and low frequency mode discussed in section 4 2 have the same power spectral densities i e s ω lf s ω hf and only γ 6 is considered moreover six different non gaussian cases are compared 1 α 3 0 α 4 4 2 α 3 0 4 α 4 4 3 α 3 0 α 4 5 4 α 3 0 6 α 4 5 5 α 3 0 α 4 6 6 α 3 0 8 α 4 6 the comparisons in table 2 and table 3 are for four lf and hf combinations with different bandwidth characteristics table 2 1 δ lf 0 0576 nb δ hf 0 0576 nb 2 δ lf 0 2774 wb δ hf 0 0576 nb table 3 3 δ lf 0 0576 nb δ hf 0 2774 wb 4 δ lf 0 1429 wb δ hf 0 2774 wb from tables 2 and 3 the essential trends of c ng with the bandwidth variation of hf mode can be found when the non gaussianity is weak with kurtosis 6 the bandwidth of hf mode does not change the reference time domain factor c n g t d significantly however when kurtosis 6 the change becomes assignable for example c n g t d is 10 888 for the case that α 3 0 α 4 6 δ lf 0 2774 δ hf 0 0576 k 6 see table 2 while c n g t d is 9 947 for the case that α 3 0 α 4 6 δ lf 0 1429 δ hf 0 2774 see table 3 the relative difference between these two is 9 5 to interpret the differences in spectral methods in table 2 fig 7 shows the rainflow amplitude distribution of the underlying bimodal gaussian process for δ lf 0 2774 and δ hf 0 0576 combination 2 in table 2 there are noticeable differences in pdfs the dk distribution and the tb distribution are better than the rayleigh distribution as they are much closer to the time domain one thus these two pdfs are expected to generate more accurate fatigue damage than that by the rayleigh distribution however the fact is that in table 2 c n g d k and c n g t b are not as accurate as c n g w t this is because when using the spectral method to calculate c ng the non gaussian stress cycle is obtained by subtracting g r from g r see eq 28 an essential premise included in this equation is that the peaks and troughs in each rainflow stress cycle are symmetrical in the underlying gaussian process i e the peak is r and the trough is r but only when the stress is nb gaussian can this premise be satisfied for wb processes no matter gaussian or non gaussian this premise is no longer appropriate thus strictly speaking in order to calculate c ng for wb processes with a specific spectral method it is necessary to obtain the peak trough jpdf of the rainflow stress cycles unfortunately to date this jpdf is still prohibitive to be derived as listed in table 1 only the tb method provides a jpdf of peaks and troughs however the asymmetry considered in this distribution is still empirically approximated rather than rigorously derived i e lc s symmetry plus rm s asymmetry in gaussian cases this asymmetry problem might not obviously affect the fatigue estimation as many studies benasciutti and tovo 2006 jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 gao and zheng 2019 have showed however it is found in this study such asymmetry problem would be amplified to a certain extent due to the non gaussianity in process consequently when the dk distribution and the tb distribution are used with their corresponding bandwidth corrections the calculated c ng may not necessarily be accurate see tables 2 and 3 5 practical case studies of non gaussian bimodal fatigue assessment three practical bimodal cases are studied in this section the bimodal spectrum is referred to the early work by wirsching and light 1980 to describe the stress of joints of offshore structures the expression of the spectrum is written as 38 s ω a 7793 t d 4 ω 5 exp 1948 t d 4 ω 4 1 ω ω n 2 2 4 ζ 2 ω ω n 2 1 where t d 2 π ω d is the period of ocean waves in design ω n is the 1st mode natural frequency of the structure ζ is the damping ratio for structural vibration a is the scaled factor used to adjust the variance of response to unity for convenience note that in the spectrum defined in eq 38 ω n and t d determine the frequency ratio γ of the hf mode and the lf mode while the damping ratio ζ determines the power ratio β of the hf mode and the lf mode just as mentioned in previous sections the fatigue damage calculation of a non gaussian process can be carried out by a two step algorithm i e fatigue calculation of the underlying gaussian process and the non gaussian fatigue correction this algorithm was early suggested by winterstein 1988 and has been used in some studies xu et al 2004 though the corresponding analysis is incomprehensive in order to distinguish the relative errors in these two steps i e the error arising from gaussian fatigue calculation by each spectral method and the error arising from the non gaussian correction factor c ng the route in this section is illustrated in fig 8 5 1 case 1 t d 15s t n 3s ζ 0 009 in this case the variance of response the total power of the spectrum is adjusted to unity the characteristics of the bimodal spectrum in fig 9 are listed in table 4 the saddle point position ω 1 57 rad s the frequency of the minimum power between the two modes is taken as the demarcating line to distinguish the lf mode and the hf mode in spectral analysis the upper cutoff frequency and the lower cutoff frequency of the power spectrum are respectively 3 5 rad s and 0 2 rad s the spectral density at these two places is less than 1e 4 pa2 s the power ratio β of hf to lf mode is 0 3739 0 6261 0 60 the frequency ratio γ of hf to lf mode is 2 09 0 42 4 98 the bandwidth parameter δ of the power spectrum is 0 5541 of which the lf mode is wb δ lf 0 3730 and the hf mode is nb δ hf 0 0468 from fig 9 it can be seen clearly that the two modes are well apart and the power at their boundary 1 57 rad s is very small the fatigue damages of the underlying gaussian process that obtained by the nb method the wl method the tb method the dk method the sm method and the recently proposed bimodal method gz are compared in table 5 where the result from time domain simulations is taken as the benchmark the most accurate method or methods that are more accurate than the gz method are marked in bold as can be seen from table 5 the nb method significantly overestimates the fatigue damage when k 3 6 the errors are all around 20 when k 3 and 4 the wl method can provide results that are very close to that of the time domain however with increasing k the error of the wl method increases when k 6 the error exceeds 10 which is 12 71 when k 3 errors of the tb method the dk method and the sm method are respectively 6 53 8 51 and 7 62 all within 10 nevertheless when k 6 the errors reach 22 63 16 15 and 14 97 by contrast it can be seen that for all situations that k 3 6 the gz method is accurate for all errors are lower than 5 table 6 shows the non gaussian fatigue correction factors c ng obtained by the time domain simulations and by different spectral methods it can be seen that these spectral methods can obtain accurate correction factors for weak non gaussian cases notice that in such a bimodal case c n g w t is better when compared to c n g t b and c n g d k table 7 shows the non gaussian fatigue damage of case 1 relative errors of the fatigue damages obtained by multiplication of gaussian fatigue table 5 and c ng table 6 are also given the combinations of methods in table 7 are explained as follows see table 8 it can be seen from table 7 the nb c n g w t method entirely based on the narrow band assumption significantly overestimates fatigue damage with errors more than 16 in all cases when k 3 4 the wl c n g w t method can obtain the most accurate non gaussian fatigue damage however when k 5 and 6 the non gaussian fatigue damage presented by this method is underestimated similarly damages obtained by the tb c n g t b the dk c n g d k and the sm c n g w t method are also smaller than time domain results by contrast the gz c n g w t method can give accurate and reasonable non gaussian fatigue damage estimations the largest error occurs at the situation that α 3 0 6 α 4 5 and k 5 and this error is only 7 74 5 2 case 2 t d 9s t n 3s ζ 0 055 in this case the total power in spectrum is also adjusted to unity the resultant bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 10 and the corresponding characteristic parameters are listed in table 9 the saddle point position which distinguishes the lf mode and the hf mode is 1 57 rad s the frequency ratio γ of hf to lf mode is 2 07 0 72 2 9 the power ratio β of hf to lf mode is 0 3752 0 6248 0 60 the bandwidth parameter δ of the power spectrum is 0 4001 in which the lf mode is wb δ lf 0 2785 and the hf mode is nb δ hf 0 0997 notice that case 2 has the same β and the same saddle point as case 1 moreover it can be seen in fig 10 that the power at the saddle point 1 57 rad s in case 2 is much larger than that in case 1 see fig 9 the hf mode and lf mode are overlapped in case 2 while they are nearly separated in case 1 table 10 lists the gaussian fatigue damage it can be seen that when the lf mode and hf mode are relatively close with γ 2 9 the errors of the nb method are smaller than that of case 1 because the bandwidth of case 2 is smaller than that of case 1 when k 5 6 the overestimation is around 10 in contrast to the nb approach the wl method and the tb method underestimate the damage when k is 3 the underestimation of the wl method is almost up to 10 the accuracy of tb is slightly improved when compared to that in case 1 and the largest error is 13 08 for k 6 the dk method and the sm method are very accurate in this case when k 3 6 the errors do not exceed 5 when k 3 6 the gz method still gives the most accurate gaussian fatigue estimation its error is even smaller than the dk method and sm method calculated c ng of case 2 are listed in table 11 note that c ng calculated by these spectral methods are also accurate among them c n g t b is the one closest to the time domain result with largest error of only 1 61 while the largest errors of c n g w t and c n g d k are 4 69 and 4 40 respectively table 12 shows all non gaussian fatigue in case 2 it can be seen that as the nb c n g w t method is conservative in the gaussian fatigue calculation stage its overestimation of non gaussian fatigue is obvious the wl c n g w t method finally underestimates the non gaussian fatigue although c n g w t is conservative since its gaussian fatigue underestimation is severe when k 3 the error in table 12 is about 9 when k 6 the error is about 16 similarly the tb method underestimates the gaussian fatigue in the end the non gaussian fatigue damage calculated by tb c n g t b is further smaller the error is about 7 at k 3 and 14 at k 6 the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method provide fairly accurate non gaussian fatigue damage results as they are quite accurate in the first step of the gaussian fatigue in general the gz c n g w t method if of the best performance when k 3 4 its errors are the smallest less than 2 when k 5 6 its errors are slightly larger than the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method but in the conservative side with no more than 7 5 3 case 3 t d 9s t n 3s ζ 0 03 like case 1 2 the total power in the spectrum of case 3 is also unity the shape of the bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 11 and the corresponding characteristic parameters are listed in table 13 in case 3 β is 0 5250 0 4750 1 1055 and γ is 2 09 0 72 2 9 the total bandwidth parameter δ 0 3703 while δ lf 0 2788 wb and δ hf 0 0795 nb notice that the frequency ratio of case 3 is the same as that of case 2 while their power ratios are different moreover the power of the hf mode is larger than that of the lf mode in case 3 table 14 lists the gaussian fatigue damages similar to case 2 the nb method again overestimates the fatigue damage significantly while the wl method and the tb method again underestimate the fatigue damage moreover it is found that the errors of the wl method and the tb method are larger than that of the nb method k 3 the dk method and the sm method are still accurate when k 3 6 errors of the dk method do not exceed 7 and errors of the sm method do not exceed 4 throughout cases 1 3 the varying accuracy levels of these spectral methods reveal that the frequency ratio γ is an important factor affecting the fatigue damage of bimodal processes among all the spectral methods the gz method gives the most accurate gaussian fatigue damage estimation and the largest error occurs when k 3 which is 1 89 such level of accuracy largely outperforms the other spectral methods table 15 lists c ng calculated by different methods and table 16 gives the non gaussian fatigue damages it can be observed that compared to the time domain results the results of the nb c n g w t method are significantly larger while the results of the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method are significantly smaller by contrast the nb c n g w t method performs better than these two wb methods the fatigue damage given by dk c n g d k method is smaller than that of time domain results as well but more accurate than the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method in this case the gaussian fatigue given by the sm method is slightly smaller table 14 and c n g w t is larger compared to that of the time domain table 15 therefore the sm c n g w t method is very accurate in the non gaussian fatigue damage estimation table 16 in all situations that k 3 6 its errors do not exceed 4 the gz method is the most accurate one in gaussian fatigue calculations thus the non gaussian fatigue obtained by the gz c n g w t method is also the best among all methods when k 3 5 when k 6 the gz c n g w t method tends to give a little conservative estimation but the error is less than 4 table 17 gives the statistics of the errors of the methods in these three cases it can be seen that in case 1 the gz c n g w t method gives the most accurate non gaussian fatigue damage estimation in cases 2 and 3 the frequency ratios γ are reduced to 2 9 as compared to 4 98 in case 1 the accuracy of the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method is significantly improved while the fatigue damage estimation given by the gz c n g w t method is still very accurate in these three cases the average error of the gz c n g w t method is the smallest and its maximum error is less than 8 which is far better than other methods whose maximum errors are all greater than 15 this manifests that the gz c n g w t method is more robust than other methods and it can give accurate fatigue damage estimation for different bimodal spectra in addition it is worth to mention that the performance of the nb c n g w t method which ignores the effect of the bandwidth is not always the worst in case 3 although this method overestimates the fatigue damage it outmatches the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method table 18 compares time domain c ng of each case when α 3 0 6 and α 4 5 the strongest non gaussian situation in all cases vs case 1 in table 18 represents that c ng in case 1 are used as reference values table 18 illustrates that although the bandwidth changes from 0 5541 case 1 to 0 3703 case 3 significantly relative difference is 33 17 c ng changes little for k 6 the relative difference is only 5 4 6 concluding remarks by combined use of the hermite transformation and different rainflow amplitude probability models of wb gaussian processes the correction factor for non gaussian fatigue i e c ng can be calculated for various spectral methods thus the accuracy of non gaussian fatigue estimation comes from two aspects one is the estimation of the gaussian fatigue and the other one is c ng some interesting findings and useful conclusions are drawn as follows 1 in this paper many time domain numerical simulations are adopted to study the essential characteristic of c ng of bimodal non gaussian processes it is found that in weakly non gaussian cases the mapping from gaussian amplitude to non gaussian amplitude dominates c ng while the pdf of the rainflow amplitude is in a relatively secondary position this is because at the main body part of the rainflow amplitude distribution the non linear mappings are around 1 thus although the c ng correction method does not take the asymmetry phenomenon into the consideration the results are still in a satisfactory range 2 c ng that based on the dk distribution and the tb distribution are derived by combining them with the hermite transformation it should be mentioned that some scholars have used the dk method chang et al 2017 and the tb method benasciutti and tovo 2005 ding and chen 2015 to estimate non gaussian fatigue damage before but this paper carried out investigations from a view of the useful two step algorithm and it should be noted that using c ng effectively help those methods which do not have a rainflow amplitude pdf handle non gaussian problems 3 it is found that for bimodal and weakly non gaussian processes c ng obtained by the wt method is more accurate than that obtained by the dk method and the tb method when the hf mode is nb however when the hf mode is wb the dk method yields correction factor closest to the time domain result in general c n g w t proposed based on the rayleigh distribution can be applied to most non gaussian processes and is shown more robust than c n g d k and c n g t b 4 c n g d k and c n g t b are unstable and not robust in some situations the reason to account for this is difficult to fathom but an obvious point is that these methods cannot account for the asymmetry of peaks and troughs in each rainflow stress cycle for wb gaussian processes so far existing spectral methods lacks a reasonable description of rainflow peak trough jpdf of wb gaussian processes and it might become a future work of the authors 5 three bimodal spectra in the ocean engineering practice are studied in this paper the accuracy of estimating fatigue damages of weakly and mildly non gaussian processes by different combinations of gaussian spectral methods and correction factor c ng in table 8 i e nb c n g w t wl c n g w t dk c n g d k tb c n g t b sm c n g w t and gz c n g w t are investigated the results shown that in most cases the nb c n g w t method are too conservatives the use of the rayleigh distribution would significantly overestimate the gaussian fatigue damage of the bimodal process in case 1 the frequency ratio of the bimodal spectrum is large the wl c n g w t method is accurate when k 3 and 4 but its accuracy decreases when k 5 and 6 in case 2 and case 3 the accuracy of the wl c n g w t method is lower than that of case 1 which indicates that the accuracy of the wl c n g w t method might change significantly for bimodal spectra with different frequency ratios by contrast the sm c n g w t method and the dk c n g d k method perform very well for case 2 and case 3 with relatively low frequency ratios but neither method has a satisfied accuracy for case 1 thus it can be concluded that these three methods are accurate only in some specific cases their accuracy might change significantly with the spectral profile the bandwidth of a bimodal process one possible reason is that the three underlying gaussian methods i e the wl the sm and the dk methods are all developed around the 1980s and the 1990s due to limited level of simulation technique at that time the amount of fitted sample data was not rich so these may not fit well for all ranges of the bandwidth by contrast in the history of the tb c n g t b method the prototype was proposed in 2002 tovo 2002 and further improved in 2005 benasciutti and tovo 2005 the fitted sample size is much larger than the wl dk and sm methods but it is a pity that only k 3 and k 5 were modelled therefore it is evident in cases 1 3 that the gaussian fatigue errors tables 5 10 and 14 of the tb method at k 3 are 6 53 6 06 and 6 52 which are fairly accurate and robust however when k 4 the errors of the tb method quickly exceed 10 with smaller estimates the gz method proposed in a recent work by authors gao and zheng 2019 is capable of providing accurate gaussian fatigue damage this method fully considers the modal interactions in bimodal processes from the views of the frequency ratio the power ratio and the nonlinear coefficient k in s n curve thus the gz method is robust when handling different shapes of bimodal spectra consequently in the mildly and weakly non gaussian cases its combination with c n g w t provides accurate estimation of non gaussian fatigue damage in all cases investigated in this paper the maximum error of the gz c n g w t method is less than 8 while the maximum error of other spectral methods are all more than 15 therefore the gz c n g w t method introduced in this study is of great potential of application to deal with vast non gaussian bimodal processes in engineering practice data availability statement some or all data models or code that support the findings of this

21146,the stress on an engineering structure tends to be random and is usually assumed to be gaussian or weakly non gaussian in some situations the power spectrum of stress also exhibits two distinct peaks in a bimodal profile this study focuses on the fatigue damage estimation of softening non gaussian bimodal processes kurtosis 3 with emphasis on spectral methods several classical spectral methods for gaussian problems and a newly developed method by authors are examined correction factors derived from the hermite transformation are used to handle the non gaussianity through comprehensive case studies including ideal bimodal spectra and practical bimodal spectra in ocean engineering the accuracy of the underlying gaussian fatigue damage and the corresponding correction factor for each spectral method is investigated separately the results demonstrate that when the non gaussianity is weak kurtosis between 3 and 6 the correction factor is dominated by the nonlinear mapping between the non gaussian stress and the underlying gaussian stress while the bandwidth effect is relatively limited under this situation the narrow banded correction factor proposed by winterstein is conservatively accurate in most cases among all spectral methods the newly developed method coupled with the winterstein s correction factor renders the best accuracy of non gaussian fatigue damage estimation keywords fatigue assessment non gaussian stress bimodal process spectral method correction factor 1 introduction at the preliminary design stage of an engineering structure spectral methods are usually adopted to estimate the structural fatigue life when the response stress of a structural component is gaussian and narrow banded nb its rainflow amplitude can be assumed to follow the rayleigh distribution so that its induced fatigue damage can be analytically derived with the miner s rule miner 1945 and the material s n curve dnvgl 2016 if the stress is wide banded wb the rayleigh approximation is inaccurate and many classical methods were so developed to handle this condition such as the wirsching light wl method wirsching and light 1980 the dirlik dk method dirlik 1985 the zhao barker zb method zhao and barker 1992 the single moment sm method lutes and larsen 1990 the tovo benasciutti tb method tovo 2002 benasciutti and tovo 2006 the jb method park et al 2014 and so on moreover for the wb bimodal stress which has two primary peaks in its power spectrum there were also a number of specific and effective spectral methods such as the jiao moan jm method jiao and moan 1990 the fu cebon fc method fu and cebon 2000 the low method low 2010 and the state of the art gao zheng gz method gao and zheng 2019 in general these spectral methods are based on gaussian assumption some of them were developed through establishing an empirical rainflow distribution i e the dk method the zb method the tb method the jb method whereas some others were developed empirically by simulations or by assuming a novel theoretical fatigue model i e the wl sm jm fc low and gz methods it should be recognized that the action of many loads such as wind sea waves usually exhibits significant non gaussian features their induced structural responses are liable to be non gaussian as well though the non gaussianity of the response would be much weaker than that of loads for example the kurtosis of wave loads may exceed 10 while the kurtosis of wave induced platform motions is only around 5 applying spectral methods to evaluate the structural fatigue life under non gaussian situation is difficult because the corresponding rainflow amplitude distribution is no longer rayleigh its form is always complex and unknown in addition it was shown by the work of gao and moan 2007 that even the rainflow amplitude distribution of the non gaussian stress is known spectral fatigue assessment is neither an easy work for decades the hermite transformation model proposed by winterstein 1985 1988 has been almost the first choice for handling non gaussian problems especially in situations that only the statistical moments and power spectrum are available in winterstein s model winterstein and mackenzie 2011 the non gaussian process is represented as a cubic hermite series in terms of an underlying standard gaussian process the coefficients in the model are determined by mapping the statistical moments of both sides of the cubic transformation and it is assumed that the underlying standard gaussian process retains the same power spectrum of the non gaussian process in fact the power spectrum of the underlying gaussian process tends to deviate from that of the non gaussian process after the nonlinear transformation while such deviation is insignificant for a weakly non gaussian process ding and chen 2016 zheng et al 2020a when using the hermite transformation to compute fatigue damage induced by non gaussian processes one kernel problem is to determine the probability density function pdf of rainflow amplitudes of the underlying gaussian process benasciutti and tovo 2005 investigated the possibility of combing the distribution in the tb method with the hermite transformation aiming to account for the non gaussianity and the bandwidth at the same time in studies by ding and chen 2015 and chang et al 2017 the tb distribution and the dk distribution are modified by the hermite transformation to evaluate fatigue damage for non gaussian stress respectively essentially the hermite transformation can be used with any spectral method as long as the method could produce a peak trough joint probabilistic distribution function jpdf of the rainflow stress cycles of the underlying gaussian process however the dk distribution does not provide such a jpdf and the tb distribution can provide an empirically approximated jpdf the fact is that no analytical peak trough jpdf has been derived in literature for the rainflow stress thus one of the main objectives of this paper is to quantify the error incurred by combining the hermite transformation with an existing spectral method particularly when the asymmetry between the peaks and the troughs in a rainflow cycle cannot be explicitly derived for those methods which do not produce a rainflow pdf it is almost impossible to import the hermite transformation to modify the formula in each method an alternative access is to use a correction by evaluating a correction coefficient for fatigue damage that is directly computed with gaussian spectral methods it is possible to obtain the corresponding fatigue of the desired non gaussian process winterstein proposed a correction factor based on the hermite transformation and the rayleigh distribution in his early work winterstein 1988 this factor ignores the bandwidth effect so that the application of this factor to wide banded processes is theoretically irrational and needs a comprehensive examination similarly correction factors can be derived from the dk method or the tb method however these two correction factors also have limitations when they are applied to wide banded processes in that the dk method cannot consider the asymmetry the dk distribution does not provide a jpdf of peaks and troughs while the tb distribution can consider the asymmetry to a certain extent since it provides an approximated jpdf of peaks and troughs even so it will be of significance to compare these empirical correction factors as they are straightforward for engineers to make a fatigue assessment in the preliminary design stage digging out the inadequacy of these empirical correction factors which are theoretically incomplete when they are applied to wide banded non gaussian processes are of interest and is one of the motivations of the present work moreover relevant studies on application of correction factors to bimodal processes are limited which thus becomes another one of the motivations of the present study also it is of interest to show the bandwidth effect in fatigue assessment of weakly non gaussian processes whose kurtosis are between 3 and 6 especially it is worthy of discussing the role of correction factor when it is applied to the newly proposed gz method it is also of interest to address that braccesi et al 2009 and cianetti et al 2017 proposed two types of factors to correct the estimated fatigue damage for non gaussian stress state the factor by braccesi et al 2009 is based on finite element simulations of a motor vehicle chassis and the factor by cianetti et al 2017 is suitable for unskewed processes as this paper aims to discuss general non gaussian cases in engineering these two factors are not discussed in this paper for their limited applicability besides some researchers wolfsteiner and breuer 2013 wolfsteiner 2017 tried to decompose a non gaussian process into several segments of gaussian processes in the time domain so that the caused fatigue damage can be calculated by the gaussian methods nonetheless such idea can only be used for unskewed processes and the procedures involve the eighth order statistical moment which is of great uncertainty in practice wolfsteiner 2017 on the aforementioned premises the main contents of this paper are organized as follows first section 2 gives a brief introduction of several spectral methods for fatigue assessment of gaussian processes including a recently proposed spectral discretization method i e the gz method gao and zheng 2019 second three types of empirical correction factors based on the hermite transformation and different pdfs i e the rayleigh distribution the tb distribution and the dk distribution are respectively presented in section 3 subsequently section 4 compares these three empirical correction factors against the time domain factor derived from numerical simulations when they are applied to bimodal processes then section 5 investigates the performance of these empirical correction factors coupled with different gaussian spectral methods when they are applied to non gaussian bimodal cases a detailed comparison on existing spectral methods and correction factors for non gaussian fatigue estimation is conducted by a two step algorithm thus the respective effects of gaussian fatigue estimation and non gaussian correction factors in the course of non gaussian fatigue estimation are distinguished lastly significant remarks are concluded in section 6 2 a brief review of spectral fatigue analysis in spectral analysis of fatigue damage spectral moments are often used to describe the characteristics of the stochastic process for the structural stress x t with spectral density function g ω its n th order spectral moment λ n is defined as 1 λ n 0 ω n g ω d ω 0 2 π f n g f d f where ω and f are frequency in rad s and in hz respectively after λ n are calculated the relevant mean zero up crossing rate ν 0 and the occurrence of peaks local maxima ν p can be obtained according to the probabilistic theory 2 ν 0 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 ν p 1 2 π λ 4 λ 2 to reflect the degree of the bandwidth of a process two familiar bandwidth parameters i e δ vanmarcke 1972 and ε dnvgl 2017 have been widely used i e 3 δ 1 α 1 2 4 ε 1 α 2 2 where 5 α m λ m λ 0 λ 2 m m 1 2 3 when the bandwidth of x t is infinitesimal δ and ε both approach 0 strictly speaking there is no rigorous criterion to demarcate nb and wb random processes in many studies cases of δ 0 1 are treated as nb for a zero mean nb gaussian process u t its amplitude r is of the rayleigh distribution 6 f r r r λ 0 exp r 2 2 λ 0 in which λ 0 σ u 2 is the variance of the gaussian process according to the palmgren miner linear damage accumulation rule miner 1945 and the s n curve dnvgl 2016 the fatigue damage per unit time is 7 d n b ν 0 c 2 2 λ 0 k γ 1 k 2 where c and k are both material parameters in the s n curve and n c s k is the number of cycles to failure when the level of the cyclic stress range is s γ is the gamma function when the process is wb the rayleigh distribution would deviate from the actual rainflow amplitude distribution significantly thus numerous approximate methods have been proposed to handle wb situations in this paper with the focus on bimodal gaussian processes four general wb spectral methods and a recently developed bimodal method are briefed they are the wl method the sm method the dk method the tb method and the gz method 2 1 wirsching light method in 1980 wirsching and light 1980 proposed a method based on the material parameter k in the s n curve and the bandwidth coefficient ε this method introduced a correction factor between the nb fatigue damage d n b and the wb fatigue damage d w l i e the wb fatigue damage per unit time is written as 8 d w l χ w l d n b the correction factor χ w l is a function of k and ε by numerical simulations and rainflow analysis of three wb spectra with k 3 10 χ w l is empirically fitted as follows 9 χ w l k ε a k 1 a k 1 ε b k 10 a k 0 926 0 033 k b k 1 587 k 2 323 from eqs 9 and 10 it can be seen that the wl method assumes the deviation from a nb process to a corresponding wb process in fatigue damage can be efficiently described by λ 0 λ 2 and λ 4 and material parameter k when the gaussian process is ideally nb d w l equals d n b as ε 0 and χ w l 1 2 2 single moment method the well known single moment sm method was developed by lutes and larsen 1990 they used the generalized spectral moment of order 2 k to refine the rayleigh formulation in eq 7 i e 11 d s m 2 2 k 2 π c λ 2 k k 2 γ 1 k 2 this formula was empirical but was proven accurate in general wb cases including the bimodal spectrum with two close neighboring spectral peaks i e the frequency ratio of the high frequency peak to the low frequency peak is below 3 recently benasciutti et al 2013 and braccesi et al 2015 provided a mathematical basis for interpreting the sm method from a spectral discretization view 2 3 dirlik method another method widely used in engineering was developed by dirlik 1985 in this method the pdf of stress amplitude r is approximated as 12 f r r 1 σ u h 1 v ⅇ z v h 2 z h 2 ⅇ z 2 2 h 2 h 3 z ⅇ z 2 2 where z is the normalized stress amplitude i e z r σ u and 13 x m λ 1 λ 0 λ 2 λ 4 h 1 2 x m α 2 2 1 α 2 2 h α 2 x m h 1 2 1 α 2 h 1 h 1 2 h 2 1 α 2 h 1 h 1 2 1 h h 3 1 h 1 h 2 v 1 25 α 2 h 3 h 2 h h 1 the fatigue damage per unit time is written as 14 d d k 2 k v p c σ u k h 1 v k γ 1 k 2 k 2 γ 1 k 2 h 2 h k h 3 many studies benasciutti and tovo 2006 park et al 2014 larsen and irvine 2015 have shown that the rainflow amplitude distribution given by the dk method is accurate in many situations however the dk method after all was proposed in 1985 dirlik utilized only 20 segments of time series in the analysis for each power spectrum and each time series contained only 108 stress cycles with only five data points in each cycle in recent studies of the authors gao and zheng 2019 zheng et al 2020b it was shown by many simulations that accurate rainflow fatigue estimation of cases whose material parameter k 5 require time series that contains at least 1 million stress cycles and 32 data points in each cycle thus although the form of dk distribution has proved to be close to the rainflow distribution obtained in the time domain in many gaussian cases it is of interest to revisit the reliability of this method in this paper when it is applied to non gaussian cases coupled with the hermite transformation 2 4 tovo benasciutti tb method in 1993 frendhal and rychlik 1993 pointed that rainflow damage is always bounded by level crossing lc counting and range mean rm counting damages i e 15 d r m d r f c d l c in which 16 d l c ν p c α 2 2 2 σ u k γ 1 k 2 d n b 17 d r m ν p c 2 2 σ u α 2 k γ 1 k 2 α 2 k 1 d n b consequently tovo and benasciutti 2005 2006 took this rule and proposed that the wb damage corrected in terms of nb fatigue damage is 18 d t b b t b d l c 1 b t b d r m b t b 1 b t b α 2 k 1 d n b 19 b t b α 1 α 2 1 112 1 α 1 α 2 α 1 α 2 e 2 11 α 2 α 1 α 2 α 2 1 2 where b tb is called correction factor obtained from many time domain simulations with five different power spectra note that b tb is a function of spectral bandwidth parameters α 1 and α 2 but not linked to the material parameter k the numerical experiments used by tovo and benasciutti to establish eq 19 only involved two situations i e k 3 and 5 which are important in practice 2 5 gao zheng gz bimodal method the above four spectral methods are all developed for general wb cases meaning that they can be also applied to the fatigue assessment of bimodal processes in a recently work by gao and zheng 2019 a new spectral discretization method was developed to account for the interaction between low frequency lf and high frequency hf modes in the bimodal spectrum this method is much more accurate than other previous wb methods fig 1 shows a typical rectangular bimodal spectrum that has been discussed in many studies jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 gao and zheng 2019 and some useful parameters are defined below 20 γ ω h f m i d ω l f m i d 21 β ω h f l b ω h f u b g ω d ω ω l f l b ω l f u b g ω d ω whereas γ is the mid frequency ratio of hf component to the lf component β is the power ratio subscripts mid ub and lb respectively represent the mid frequency the upper bound frequency and the lower bound frequency in each mode the gao zheng gz method following the previous spectral discretization idea benasciutti et al 2013 braccesi et al 2015 first discretize both lf and hf bands into num infinitesimal nb bands and the total fatigue damage is calculated through 22 d t o t a l 2 2 k 2 π c γ 1 k 2 λ 2 k l f λ 2 k h f λ 2 k l f h f k 2 23 λ 2 k l f i 1 n u m ω i l f 2 k g ω i l f δ ω l f 24 λ 2 k h f i 1

the lf band and the hf band respectively the new incoming cross term λ 2 k l f h f reflects the coupling between lf and hf in λ 2 k l f h f a coefficient ξ is introduced to describe the degree of the coupling between the two bands the coefficient ξ is a function of γ β k and its empirical expression is obtained through the nonlinear optimization technique combined with a comprehensive data set generated from a great many monte carlo simulations gao and zheng 2019 in the reference paper a large number of combinations of γ β k are considered so as to cover a wide range of engineering problems the resultant expression gao and zheng 2019 shown in eq 26 is applicable to cases of γ 2 15 β 0 05 2 0 and k 3 9 26 ξ p 1 p 2 ln γ p 3 ln β p 4 ln γ 2 p 5 ln β 2 p 6 ln γ ln β 1 p 7 ln γ p 8 ln β p 9 ln γ 2 p 10 ln β 2 p 11 ln γ ln β where p u u 1 2 11 are second order polynomials of k c f gao and zheng 2019 fig 2 illustrates the physical meanings of eqs 22 26 for cross mode coupling specifically when the hf mode in the bimodal process is wb the hf mode is decomposed into several hf sub modes only incurring negligible complexity and additional computation effort gao and zheng 2019 3 hermite transformation and non gaussian fatigue correction factor aforementioned the structural response usually tends to be weakly or mildly non gaussian it is also known that the softening cases whose kurtosis is greater than 3 would cause larger stress cycles than their gaussian counterparts consequently this paper focuses on the softening situations of kurtosis between 3 and 6 3 1 cubic hermite transformation for softening cases winterstein introduced a forward cubic transformation from the underlying standard gaussian variable u to the target non gaussian variable x as follows winterstein 1988 27 x g u κ σ x u c 3 u 2 1 c 4 u 3 3 u m x the cubic transformation in eq 27 has been proven quite accurate for weakly and mildly non gaussian cases in many studies the coefficients κ c 3 and c 4 can be computed by mapping the first four central moments mean variance skewness and kurtosis on both sides of eq 27 in fact to obtain these model coefficients the mapped moments can also be linear moments winterstein and mackenzie 2011 or the combination of central moments and linear moments gao et al 2018 in this paper the conventional cubic hermite transformation model based on central moments are used 3 2 non gaussian fatigue correction factor with the cubic hermite transformation the non gaussian fatigue damage can be computed according to 28 d n g ν p c 0 g r g r k f r d r in which g function denotes the established cubic translation in eq 27 and represents the rainflow amplitude of the underlying gaussian stress and f r is its pdf it is important to mention that eq 28 was proposed by winterstein 1985 1988 2013 and is restricted to narrow banded processes 3 2 1 winterstein s correction factor the non gaussian fatigue correction factor is defined as the ratio of the fatigue damage that induced by the non gaussian stress to that induced by its underlying gaussian stress i e 29 c n g d n g d g for narrow banded processes the widely used c ng by winterstein 1988 based on the rayleigh distribution is 30 c n g w t d n g n b d g n b 0 g r g r k r exp r 2 2 d r 2 2 σ x k γ 1 k 2 notice that in eq 30 both peaks and troughs in every rainflow stress cycle are assumed to be symmetric about the zero mean stress c n g w t is theoretically correct for narrow banded processes however for wide banded processes c n g w t in many situations has to be empirically obtained 3 2 2 correction factor based on dirlik distribution substituting the dirlik s rainflow amplitude distribution in eq 12 into eq 28 the approximate non gaussian fatigue damage based on the dirlik method and the hermite transformation can be obtained consequently the corresponding correction factor is derived 31 c n g d k d n g d k d g d k 0 g r g r k f dk r d r 0 2 r σ x k f dk r d r it should be mentioned that σ u is unity in f dk r as the underlying gaussian process u t is standard in the hermite transformation i e eq 27 notice that although the dirlik distribution was proposed for wide banded gaussian processes it does not provide a jpdf of the peaks and the troughs thus eq 31 proposed herein assumes the peak and the trough in every rainflow stress cycle are symmetric about the zero stress consequently when this equation is applied to a wide banded non gaussian stress inaccuracy might emerge to fatigue damage assessment 3 2 3 correction factor based on tb method actually the idea of the tb method is to relate the rm method with the lc method by a factor b tb thereby the non gaussian fatigue based on the tb method can be written in a form similar to eq 18 according to ding and chen 2015 32 d n g t b b t b d n g l c 1 b t b d n g r m in which d n g l c is calculated through 33 d n g l c ν p c 0 g r g r k f l c r d r 34 f l c r α 2 r σ u 2 exp r 2 2 σ u 2 herein σ u 1 as the underlying gaussian process u t is standard as the rm method considered the jpdf of peaks and troughs the computation of d n g r m would be slightly complicated 35 d n g r m ν p c q g q g v k h r m q v d v d q where 36 h r m q v 1 σ u 2 α 2 2 2 2 π exp q 2 v 2 4 σ u 2 1 α 2 2 exp q v 2 1 2 α 2 2 4 σ u 2 1 α 2 2 2 α 2 2 q v 2 σ u 1 α 2 2 in eq 36 q and v are the peak and trough in the stress cycles counted by the rm method respectively notice that only when q v eq 36 has a physical meaning then the corresponding correction factor is so obtained 37 c n g t b d n g t b d g t b b t b d n g l c 1 b t b d n g r m b t b d g l c 1 b t b d g r m as shown in section 3 2 c n g w t and c n g d k are not derived from a jpdf of the peaks and the troughs c n g w t is established based on the narrow banded theory the formulation of c n g d k uses the dk distribution of amplitudes which was proposed for wide banded processes however c n g d k does not take the asymmetric characteristic of the stress cycles of wide banded processes into consideration c n g t b is based on the tb jpdf combining the lc method and the rm method thus the underlying distribution of c n g t b is wide banded however eq 34 used in c n g t b was also based on a symmetry assumption benasciutti and tovo 2005 in other words the asymmetry considered in the tb method is lc s symmetry plus rm s asymmetry to summarize all these three c ng have limitations summarized in table 1 when they are applied to wide banded processes consequently section 4 and section 5 of this paper are numerical studies to show their levels of validity and accuracy of estimating fatigue damages for non gaussian bimodal processes 4 comparison of non gaussian fatigue correction factors 4 1 bimodal rectangular spectra cng obtained from time domain simulations for the bimodal rectangular power spectrum in fig 1 time domain simulations are carried out to obtain c ng with varying frequency ratio γ power ratio β and bandwidths of hf lf modes δ lf and δ hf in the material fatigue curve coefficient c is assumed to be 1 for evaluations as this number does not affect the stochastic fatigue characteristics note that the time series used in time domain analysis should have 1 sufficient frequency sampling to ensure that peaks of hf stress cycles not be missed 2 sufficient duration length of time simulation to ensure that the rainflow damage converge in this work every time series includes at least 1e6 stress cycles and each stress cycle includes at least 32 steps fig 3 and fig 4 respectively plot the variation of c ng with respect to α 3 0 and α 3 0 6 for the case of nb lf δ lf 0 0576 and nb hf δ hf 0 0576 similarly fig 5 and fig 6 correspond to the wb lf δ lf 0 1429 mildly wide with the wb hf δ lf 0 2774 in these figures the results of γ 3 6 9 and β 0 2 1 are given it should be mentioned that the wb lf discussed here is a mildly wb process if the lf mode is too wide it might overlap the hf mode cases that the lf and the hf mode are overlapped will be discussed in practical case studies in section 5 it can be observed that c ng is more affected by γ than by β because γ reflects bandwidth when the frequency ratio γ is 3 c ng corresponding to β 0 2 and β 1 are close to each other when γ is 9 c ng corresponding to β 0 2 and β 1 greatly differ from figs 3 6 it is also noticed that when the non gaussianity is weak i e kurtosis smaller than 5 common situations of structural dynamic responses in ocean engineering the difference caused by γ and β in c ng is not obvious this implies that for a weakly non gaussian bimodal process the bandwidth has little effect on c ng 4 2 bimodal rectangular spectra cng obtained by spectra methods in order to investigate typical situations in practical engineering and not to repeat cases in section 4 1 the high frequency mode and low frequency mode discussed in section 4 2 have the same power spectral densities i e s ω lf s ω hf and only γ 6 is considered moreover six different non gaussian cases are compared 1 α 3 0 α 4 4 2 α 3 0 4 α 4 4 3 α 3 0 α 4 5 4 α 3 0 6 α 4 5 5 α 3 0 α 4 6 6 α 3 0 8 α 4 6 the comparisons in table 2 and table 3 are for four lf and hf combinations with different bandwidth characteristics table 2 1 δ lf 0 0576 nb δ hf 0 0576 nb 2 δ lf 0 2774 wb δ hf 0 0576 nb table 3 3 δ lf 0 0576 nb δ hf 0 2774 wb 4 δ lf 0 1429 wb δ hf 0 2774 wb from tables 2 and 3 the essential trends of c ng with the bandwidth variation of hf mode can be found when the non gaussianity is weak with kurtosis 6 the bandwidth of hf mode does not change the reference time domain factor c n g t d significantly however when kurtosis 6 the change becomes assignable for example c n g t d is 10 888 for the case that α 3 0 α 4 6 δ lf 0 2774 δ hf 0 0576 k 6 see table 2 while c n g t d is 9 947 for the case that α 3 0 α 4 6 δ lf 0 1429 δ hf 0 2774 see table 3 the relative difference between these two is 9 5 to interpret the differences in spectral methods in table 2 fig 7 shows the rainflow amplitude distribution of the underlying bimodal gaussian process for δ lf 0 2774 and δ hf 0 0576 combination 2 in table 2 there are noticeable differences in pdfs the dk distribution and the tb distribution are better than the rayleigh distribution as they are much closer to the time domain one thus these two pdfs are expected to generate more accurate fatigue damage than that by the rayleigh distribution however the fact is that in table 2 c n g d k and c n g t b are not as accurate as c n g w t this is because when using the spectral method to calculate c ng the non gaussian stress cycle is obtained by subtracting g r from g r see eq 28 an essential premise included in this equation is that the peaks and troughs in each rainflow stress cycle are symmetrical in the underlying gaussian process i e the peak is r and the trough is r but only when the stress is nb gaussian can this premise be satisfied for wb processes no matter gaussian or non gaussian this premise is no longer appropriate thus strictly speaking in order to calculate c ng for wb processes with a specific spectral method it is necessary to obtain the peak trough jpdf of the rainflow stress cycles unfortunately to date this jpdf is still prohibitive to be derived as listed in table 1 only the tb method provides a jpdf of peaks and troughs however the asymmetry considered in this distribution is still empirically approximated rather than rigorously derived i e lc s symmetry plus rm s asymmetry in gaussian cases this asymmetry problem might not obviously affect the fatigue estimation as many studies benasciutti and tovo 2006 jiao and moan 1990 low 2010 gao and zheng 2019 have showed however it is found in this study such asymmetry problem would be amplified to a certain extent due to the non gaussianity in process consequently when the dk distribution and the tb distribution are used with their corresponding bandwidth corrections the calculated c ng may not necessarily be accurate see tables 2 and 3 5 practical case studies of non gaussian bimodal fatigue assessment three practical bimodal cases are studied in this section the bimodal spectrum is referred to the early work by wirsching and light 1980 to describe the stress of joints of offshore structures the expression of the spectrum is written as 38 s ω a 7793 t d 4 ω 5 exp 1948 t d 4 ω 4 1 ω ω n 2 2 4 ζ 2 ω ω n 2 1 where t d 2 π ω d is the period of ocean waves in design ω n is the 1st mode natural frequency of the structure ζ is the damping ratio for structural vibration a is the scaled factor used to adjust the variance of response to unity for convenience note that in the spectrum defined in eq 38 ω n and t d determine the frequency ratio γ of the hf mode and the lf mode while the damping ratio ζ determines the power ratio β of the hf mode and the lf mode just as mentioned in previous sections the fatigue damage calculation of a non gaussian process can be carried out by a two step algorithm i e fatigue calculation of the underlying gaussian process and the non gaussian fatigue correction this algorithm was early suggested by winterstein 1988 and has been used in some studies xu et al 2004 though the corresponding analysis is incomprehensive in order to distinguish the relative errors in these two steps i e the error arising from gaussian fatigue calculation by each spectral method and the error arising from the non gaussian correction factor c ng the route in this section is illustrated in fig 8 5 1 case 1 t d 15s t n 3s ζ 0 009 in this case the variance of response the total power of the spectrum is adjusted to unity the characteristics of the bimodal spectrum in fig 9 are listed in table 4 the saddle point position ω 1 57 rad s the frequency of the minimum power between the two modes is taken as the demarcating line to distinguish the lf mode and the hf mode in spectral analysis the upper cutoff frequency and the lower cutoff frequency of the power spectrum are respectively 3 5 rad s and 0 2 rad s the spectral density at these two places is less than 1e 4 pa2 s the power ratio β of hf to lf mode is 0 3739 0 6261 0 60 the frequency ratio γ of hf to lf mode is 2 09 0 42 4 98 the bandwidth parameter δ of the power spectrum is 0 5541 of which the lf mode is wb δ lf 0 3730 and the hf mode is nb δ hf 0 0468 from fig 9 it can be seen clearly that the two modes are well apart and the power at their boundary 1 57 rad s is very small the fatigue damages of the underlying gaussian process that obtained by the nb method the wl method the tb method the dk method the sm method and the recently proposed bimodal method gz are compared in table 5 where the result from time domain simulations is taken as the benchmark the most accurate method or methods that are more accurate than the gz method are marked in bold as can be seen from table 5 the nb method significantly overestimates the fatigue damage when k 3 6 the errors are all around 20 when k 3 and 4 the wl method can provide results that are very close to that of the time domain however with increasing k the error of the wl method increases when k 6 the error exceeds 10 which is 12 71 when k 3 errors of the tb method the dk method and the sm method are respectively 6 53 8 51 and 7 62 all within 10 nevertheless when k 6 the errors reach 22 63 16 15 and 14 97 by contrast it can be seen that for all situations that k 3 6 the gz method is accurate for all errors are lower than 5 table 6 shows the non gaussian fatigue correction factors c ng obtained by the time domain simulations and by different spectral methods it can be seen that these spectral methods can obtain accurate correction factors for weak non gaussian cases notice that in such a bimodal case c n g w t is better when compared to c n g t b and c n g d k table 7 shows the non gaussian fatigue damage of case 1 relative errors of the fatigue damages obtained by multiplication of gaussian fatigue table 5 and c ng table 6 are also given the combinations of methods in table 7 are explained as follows see table 8 it can be seen from table 7 the nb c n g w t method entirely based on the narrow band assumption significantly overestimates fatigue damage with errors more than 16 in all cases when k 3 4 the wl c n g w t method can obtain the most accurate non gaussian fatigue damage however when k 5 and 6 the non gaussian fatigue damage presented by this method is underestimated similarly damages obtained by the tb c n g t b the dk c n g d k and the sm c n g w t method are also smaller than time domain results by contrast the gz c n g w t method can give accurate and reasonable non gaussian fatigue damage estimations the largest error occurs at the situation that α 3 0 6 α 4 5 and k 5 and this error is only 7 74 5 2 case 2 t d 9s t n 3s ζ 0 055 in this case the total power in spectrum is also adjusted to unity the resultant bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 10 and the corresponding characteristic parameters are listed in table 9 the saddle point position which distinguishes the lf mode and the hf mode is 1 57 rad s the frequency ratio γ of hf to lf mode is 2 07 0 72 2 9 the power ratio β of hf to lf mode is 0 3752 0 6248 0 60 the bandwidth parameter δ of the power spectrum is 0 4001 in which the lf mode is wb δ lf 0 2785 and the hf mode is nb δ hf 0 0997 notice that case 2 has the same β and the same saddle point as case 1 moreover it can be seen in fig 10 that the power at the saddle point 1 57 rad s in case 2 is much larger than that in case 1 see fig 9 the hf mode and lf mode are overlapped in case 2 while they are nearly separated in case 1 table 10 lists the gaussian fatigue damage it can be seen that when the lf mode and hf mode are relatively close with γ 2 9 the errors of the nb method are smaller than that of case 1 because the bandwidth of case 2 is smaller than that of case 1 when k 5 6 the overestimation is around 10 in contrast to the nb approach the wl method and the tb method underestimate the damage when k is 3 the underestimation of the wl method is almost up to 10 the accuracy of tb is slightly improved when compared to that in case 1 and the largest error is 13 08 for k 6 the dk method and the sm method are very accurate in this case when k 3 6 the errors do not exceed 5 when k 3 6 the gz method still gives the most accurate gaussian fatigue estimation its error is even smaller than the dk method and sm method calculated c ng of case 2 are listed in table 11 note that c ng calculated by these spectral methods are also accurate among them c n g t b is the one closest to the time domain result with largest error of only 1 61 while the largest errors of c n g w t and c n g d k are 4 69 and 4 40 respectively table 12 shows all non gaussian fatigue in case 2 it can be seen that as the nb c n g w t method is conservative in the gaussian fatigue calculation stage its overestimation of non gaussian fatigue is obvious the wl c n g w t method finally underestimates the non gaussian fatigue although c n g w t is conservative since its gaussian fatigue underestimation is severe when k 3 the error in table 12 is about 9 when k 6 the error is about 16 similarly the tb method underestimates the gaussian fatigue in the end the non gaussian fatigue damage calculated by tb c n g t b is further smaller the error is about 7 at k 3 and 14 at k 6 the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method provide fairly accurate non gaussian fatigue damage results as they are quite accurate in the first step of the gaussian fatigue in general the gz c n g w t method if of the best performance when k 3 4 its errors are the smallest less than 2 when k 5 6 its errors are slightly larger than the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method but in the conservative side with no more than 7 5 3 case 3 t d 9s t n 3s ζ 0 03 like case 1 2 the total power in the spectrum of case 3 is also unity the shape of the bimodal spectrum is shown in fig 11 and the corresponding characteristic parameters are listed in table 13 in case 3 β is 0 5250 0 4750 1 1055 and γ is 2 09 0 72 2 9 the total bandwidth parameter δ 0 3703 while δ lf 0 2788 wb and δ hf 0 0795 nb notice that the frequency ratio of case 3 is the same as that of case 2 while their power ratios are different moreover the power of the hf mode is larger than that of the lf mode in case 3 table 14 lists the gaussian fatigue damages similar to case 2 the nb method again overestimates the fatigue damage significantly while the wl method and the tb method again underestimate the fatigue damage moreover it is found that the errors of the wl method and the tb method are larger than that of the nb method k 3 the dk method and the sm method are still accurate when k 3 6 errors of the dk method do not exceed 7 and errors of the sm method do not exceed 4 throughout cases 1 3 the varying accuracy levels of these spectral methods reveal that the frequency ratio γ is an important factor affecting the fatigue damage of bimodal processes among all the spectral methods the gz method gives the most accurate gaussian fatigue damage estimation and the largest error occurs when k 3 which is 1 89 such level of accuracy largely outperforms the other spectral methods table 15 lists c ng calculated by different methods and table 16 gives the non gaussian fatigue damages it can be observed that compared to the time domain results the results of the nb c n g w t method are significantly larger while the results of the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method are significantly smaller by contrast the nb c n g w t method performs better than these two wb methods the fatigue damage given by dk c n g d k method is smaller than that of time domain results as well but more accurate than the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method in this case the gaussian fatigue given by the sm method is slightly smaller table 14 and c n g w t is larger compared to that of the time domain table 15 therefore the sm c n g w t method is very accurate in the non gaussian fatigue damage estimation table 16 in all situations that k 3 6 its errors do not exceed 4 the gz method is the most accurate one in gaussian fatigue calculations thus the non gaussian fatigue obtained by the gz c n g w t method is also the best among all methods when k 3 5 when k 6 the gz c n g w t method tends to give a little conservative estimation but the error is less than 4 table 17 gives the statistics of the errors of the methods in these three cases it can be seen that in case 1 the gz c n g w t method gives the most accurate non gaussian fatigue damage estimation in cases 2 and 3 the frequency ratios γ are reduced to 2 9 as compared to 4 98 in case 1 the accuracy of the dk c n g d k method and the sm c n g w t method is significantly improved while the fatigue damage estimation given by the gz c n g w t method is still very accurate in these three cases the average error of the gz c n g w t method is the smallest and its maximum error is less than 8 which is far better than other methods whose maximum errors are all greater than 15 this manifests that the gz c n g w t method is more robust than other methods and it can give accurate fatigue damage estimation for different bimodal spectra in addition it is worth to mention that the performance of the nb c n g w t method which ignores the effect of the bandwidth is not always the worst in case 3 although this method overestimates the fatigue damage it outmatches the wl c n g w t method and the tb c n g t b method table 18 compares time domain c ng of each case when α 3 0 6 and α 4 5 the strongest non gaussian situation in all cases vs case 1 in table 18 represents that c ng in case 1 are used as reference values table 18 illustrates that although the bandwidth changes from 0 5541 case 1 to 0 3703 case 3 significantly relative difference is 33 17 c ng changes little for k 6 the relative difference is only 5 4 6 concluding remarks by combined use of the hermite transformation and different rainflow amplitude probability models of wb gaussian processes the correction factor for non gaussian fatigue i e c ng can be calculated for various spectral methods thus the accuracy of non gaussian fatigue estimation comes from two aspects one is the estimation of the gaussian fatigue and the other one is c ng some interesting findings and useful conclusions are drawn as follows 1 in this paper many time domain numerical simulations are adopted to study the essential characteristic of c ng of bimodal non gaussian processes it is found that in weakly non gaussian cases the mapping from gaussian amplitude to non gaussian amplitude dominates c ng while the pdf of the rainflow amplitude is in a relatively secondary position this is because at the main body part of the rainflow amplitude distribution the non linear mappings are around 1 thus although the c ng correction method does not take the asymmetry phenomenon into the consideration the results are still in a satisfactory range 2 c ng that based on the dk distribution and the tb distribution are derived by combining them with the hermite transformation it should be mentioned that some scholars have used the dk method chang et al 2017 and the tb method benasciutti and tovo 2005 ding and chen 2015 to estimate non gaussian fatigue damage before but this paper carried out investigations from a view of the useful two step algorithm and it should be noted that using c ng effectively help those methods which do not have a rainflow amplitude pdf handle non gaussian problems 3 it is found that for bimodal and weakly non gaussian processes c ng obtained by the wt method is more accurate than that obtained by the dk method and the tb method when the hf mode is nb however when the hf mode is wb the dk method yields correction factor closest to the time domain result in general c n g w t proposed based on the rayleigh distribution can be applied to most non gaussian processes and is shown more robust than c n g d k and c n g t b 4 c n g d k and c n g t b are unstable and not robust in some situations the reason to account for this is difficult to fathom but an obvious point is that these methods cannot account for the asymmetry of peaks and troughs in each rainflow stress cycle for wb gaussian processes so far existing spectral methods lacks a reasonable description of rainflow peak trough jpdf of wb gaussian processes and it might become a future work of the authors 5 three bimodal spectra in the ocean engineering practice are studied in this paper the accuracy of estimating fatigue damages of weakly and mildly non gaussian processes by different combinations of gaussian spectral methods and correction factor c ng in table 8 i e nb c n g w t wl c n g w t dk c n g d k tb c n g t b sm c n g w t and gz c n g w t are investigated the results shown that in most cases the nb c n g w t method are too conservatives the use of the rayleigh distribution would significantly overestimate the gaussian fatigue damage of the bimodal process in case 1 the frequency ratio of the bimodal spectrum is large the wl c n g w t method is accurate when k 3 and 4 but its accuracy decreases when k 5 and 6 in case 2 and case 3 the accuracy of the wl c n g w t method is lower than that of case 1 which indicates that the accuracy of the wl c n g w t method might change significantly for bimodal spectra with different frequency ratios by contrast the sm c n g w t method and the dk c n g d k method perform very well for case 2 and case 3 with relatively low frequency ratios but neither method has a satisfied accuracy for case 1 thus it can be concluded that these three methods are accurate only in some specific cases their accuracy might change significantly with the spectral profile the bandwidth of a bimodal process one possible reason is that the three underlying gaussian methods i e the wl the sm and the dk methods are all developed around the 1980s and the 1990s due to limited level of simulation technique at that time the amount of fitted sample data was not rich so these may not fit well for all ranges of the bandwidth by contrast in the history of the tb c n g t b method the prototype was proposed in 2002 tovo 2002 and further improved in 2005 benasciutti and tovo 2005 the fitted sample size is much larger than the wl dk and sm methods but it is a pity that only k 3 and k 5 were modelled therefore it is evident in cases 1 3 that the gaussian fatigue errors tables 5 10 and 14 of the tb method at k 3 are 6 53 6 06 and 6 52 which are fairly accurate and robust however when k 4 the errors of the tb method quickly exceed 10 with smaller estimates the gz method proposed in a recent work by authors gao and zheng 2019 is capable of providing accurate gaussian fatigue damage this method fully considers the modal interactions in bimodal processes from the views of the frequency ratio the power ratio and the nonlinear coefficient k in s n curve thus the gz method is robust when handling different shapes of bimodal spectra consequently in the mildly and weakly non gaussian cases its combination with c n g w t provides accurate estimation of non gaussian fatigue damage in all cases investigated in this paper the maximum error of the gz c n g w t method is less than 8 while the maximum error of other spectral methods are all more than 15 therefore the gz c n g w t method introduced in this study is of great potential of application to deal with vast non gaussian bimodal processes in engineering practice data availability statement some or all data models or code that support the findings of this

21147,optimizing the production of wave energy converters using model predictive control mpc requires a real time deterministic prediction of the waves arriving at the device this study presents a new method for deterministic sea wave prediction using the horizontal velocity profile over the water column as a boundary condition for a dedicated nonlinear wave model however direct measurement of the horizontal velocity component over the whole vertical column is hardly achievable at sea a method to reconstruct this profile from measurement devices currently at use such as adcps is thus presented and evaluated the performance of the prediction method itself is then tested using synthetic numerical data first the reconstruction of the horizontal velocity profile as a boundary condition is evaluated then the whole prediction procedure is assessed in both these stages the simulations are based on synthetic numerical data and the outcomes are compared with numerical reference solutions the results show that the method is promising enough to justify further investigation through wave tank experiments keywords deterministic wave prediction nonlinear waves high order spectral method 1 introduction while stochastic wave models such as wam the wamdi group 1988 wawewatch iii tolman 2009 or swan booij et al 1999 are widely used today e g in weather forecast or marine operation planning they only provide statistical quantities on the sea state such as significant wave height h s peak period t p or mean wave direction phase resolved wave models on the other hand can offer a description of the actual shape of the sea surface such information if available in real time would greatly benefit to a range of marine applications such as aircraft take off and landing ship dynamic positioning or the development of control strategies for wave energy converters for this latter application in particular model predictive control mpc appears to be a very promising method richter et al 2013 that could increase the energy harvested by the device by up to 80 compared to regular proportional integral pi control nguyen et al 2016 to be effective a mpc strategy requires prior knowledge of the waves arriving at the device around 20 s ahead advocating the need for an efficient real time deterministic sea wave prediction tool although they provide a detailed description of the sea surface the high computational costs of phase resolved wave models have long restricted their use to small time space simulation domains but recent progress in computational resources has revived interest in their development and they have emerged as a credible alternative for accurate short term wave prediction in the past 20 years morris et al 1998 these deterministic wave models can classically be divided into linear and nonlinear methods as frequently pointed out köllisch et al 2018 klein et al 2020 law et al 2020 linear models benefit from a shorter computation time a critical feature for real time prediction and are thus often preferred for operational purposes morris et al 1998 belmont et al 2006 naaijen and huijsmans 2008 naaijen et al 2009 abusedra and belmont 2011 kosleck 2013 naaijen et al 2014b they offer rather satisfying results for moderate sea states and short propagation distances or for prediction requiring information on quiescent periods only belmont et al 2014 however with increasing steepness of the sea state nonlinear effects become significant and linear models fail to capture correctly the evolution of waves toffoli et al 2008 2010 bonnefoy et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 following the early work of zhang et al 1999 who used a model truncated at second order in wave steepness other weakly nonlinear approaches have then been developed for deterministic wave prediction accounting for nonlinearities up to the third order with a narrow band approximation the nonlinear schrödinger equation nlse framework is able to reproduce some nonlinear effects trulsen and stansberg 2001 adcock et al 2012 simanesew et al 2017 trulsen 2005 conducted experimental validations of the nlse method against laboratory measurements for among others long crested irregular waves results showed that while the regular version of the nlse brings little to no benefits compared to the linear theory the modified version of the equation mnlse enhanced with exact linear dispersion on the other hand greatly improves the wave modelling additionally simanesew et al 2017 compared various versions of the schrödinger equation with linear models and provided an analysis on short crested waves prediction they stressed out that when too little information is available on the directionality of incoming waves nonlinear models do not perform better than linear ones and the lack of reliable input data represents a more constraining blocking point than the propagation step itself among higher order models the hos method wu et al 2000 wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 blondel couprie et al 2013 köllisch et al 2018 klein et al 2019 has proved to be particularly promising for nonlinear wave prediction on large space time domains wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 thanks to its high numerical efficiency and accuracy even for short crested waves and has thus been chosen for this study when using a hos method with operational applications in mind the main difficulty does not lie in the propagation step itself but in initializing the model from field measurements köllisch et al 2018 fucile et al 2018 most of the computational time is actually spent in processing the wave data collected with the technology available at sea in order to provide a valid initial condition this pre processing step today represents the main obstacle to real time prediction blondel et al 2010 köllisch et al 2018 much of the work conducted to overcome this challenge has focused on extracting wave information from sea surface elevation data either through the use of wave buoys or radar imaging blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014b however to properly initialize a conventional hos model a snapshot of the sea surface elevation is not sufficient and additional independent information is required classically the velocity potential at the free surface as this is not a piece of information easily retrievable from field measurements this quantity can either be approximated at first order klein et al 2019 or computed with a data assimilation scheme aragh and nwogu 2008 blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 yoon et al 2016 köllisch et al 2018 none of these methods being fully satisfying because of the approximations or additional computational cost induced the present article thus proposes a different innovative approach based on wave induced fluid velocity data instead of sea surface elevation data information on the incoming sea state is collected in the form of instantaneous vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity over the whole water column at one fixed location upstream the point of interest this data is used as a boundary condition in a propagation model which then provides a wave prediction at the point of interest the propagation model used is the open source nonlinear potential code hos nwt it is based on the pseudo spectral high order spectral hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 and has been developed at centrale nantes ducrozet et al 2006 2012 the hos nwt model was designed to model a numerical wave tank and was slightly adapted here to fit for ocean wave prediction purposes the core of the propagation method remains unchanged with regards to the original hos methods but the boundary and initial conditions differ allowing nonlinear wave prediction without depending on the initialization of the spatial free surface quantities which are difficult to retrieve from field data as the hos nwt model itself is already widely validated bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2006 2012 the propagation part of the prediction procedure does not raise any particular difficulty as long as the underlying hypotheses are met hence the challenge lies in determining a suitable boundary condition from the velocity data collected upstream in the water column as it turns out direct access to instantaneous horizontal velocity profiles is not achievable with the measurement technologies currently available however reconstructing such information from measurements acquired with an adcp acoustic doppler current profiler seems within reach huchet et al 2018 this paper presents a numerical assessment of this new prediction method the ability to produce a good quality boundary condition from velocity data retrievable with the available measurement technologies is evaluated as well as the quality of the wave prediction obtained the numerical verification is conducted on uni directional irregular waves using synthetic measurement data 2 propagation prediction method 2 1 hypotheses this study is carried out in 2d uni directional waves only ignoring wind forcing with a finite constant water depth h and with no ambient currents the considered space domain d has horizontal bounds set at x x 0 and x x 0 l x and vertical bounds delimited by the flat bottom at z h and the free surface position at z η x t it is associated with a cartesian coordinate system o x z its origin o is set at one corner of the domain with o x representing the horizontal axis waves propagating towards x 0 and o z the vertical one oriented upwards with z 0 set at the mean water level at rest see fig 1 we assume that the hypotheses underlying the use of potential flow theory are valid the fluid is considered inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational wave breaking is not accounted for here and z η x t describes the free surface position in the space time domain finally this work was conducted using synthetic numerical data meaning that the results discussed in section 3 do not take into account measurement errors such as instrument bias or noise in the following sections if encountered the term measurements will thus refer to synthetic data generated with a reference numerical model 2 2 general outline the method developed here aims at providing an accurate wave prediction over a horizon of a few wave periods 30 60 s using a fixed velocity measurement device located upstream the area of interest the adopted approach illustrated in fig 1 consists in measuring the instantaneous wave induced velocity in the water column at a fixed position x 0 the collected data is used to recover the profile of the horizontal component of fluid velocity at x 0 u x 0 z t this horizontal velocity profile is then passed on as a boundary condition in the deterministic wave model hos nwt which generates and propagates the corresponding waves downstream to the area of interest the proposed prediction methodology considers the fluid at rest as initial conditions the waves being generated from the boundary condition at x x 0 the method then runs in two steps first the reconstruction of the sea state then the prediction itself the reconstruction phase of duration t and arbitrarily set in the past in this study relies on continuously updated velocity measurements for t t 0 the velocity data collected at coordinate x 0 in the water column is used by the hos nwt model via its boundary condition to generate and propagate the corresponding waves downstream as illustrated in fig 1a in the second step t 0 illustrated in fig 1b data on the incident waves at x 0 is not updated anymore and the boundary condition is set to zero in hos nwt therefore the model only propagates information collected before t 0 this marks the beginning of the prediction phase itself this method allows to model nonlinear irregular sea states accurately more importantly contrary to many other wave models it does not rely on any data assimilation step to provide the surfacic initial conditions usually required resulting in a substantial improvement in computation time the particular steps of reconstructing the boundary condition and propagating the waves are detailed below as well as the need to define correctly the region where an accurate prediction is theoretically available 2 3 theoretical prediction zone as the information collected on the incoming sea state is limited in time and space so is the region where a reliable deterministic wave prediction can be achieved the predictable zone d x t is then defined as the space time domain accessible to deterministic sea wave prediction from the available measurements several publications have already extensively addressed the definition of this predictable zone for various measurement configurations wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014a qi et al 2018b fucile et al 2018 hence only the broad lines for our simplified uni directional case are reminded here a 2d uni directional irregular wave field being continuously measured by a fixed point device located at x x 0 can be represented by its wave power spectral density as in fig 2 a assuming that the energy content of this spectrum is negligible outside some frequency bounds f m i n and f m a x judiciously set the sea surface elevation at a given point x 1 t 1 can be correctly predicted only if all relevant frequency components between f m i n and f m a x were measured at x 0 between t t and t 0 were propagated to x 1 between t t and t t 1 the predictable zone is then bounded by the propagation of both the slowest component measured at t t and the fastest component measured at t 0 as illustrated in fig 2b these bounds translate into limiting group velocities c g m i n and c g m a x which are evaluated here using the linear dispersion relation although the waves considered in this article are nonlinear studies have shown that the predictable region defined assuming a linear sea state is actually more restrictive than when taking nonlinearities into account so the linear definition gives a minimal estimation of the prediction zone wu 2004 blondel couprie 2009 qi et al 2018a c g m i n and c g m a x in turn depend on the choice of the frequency bounds f m i n and f m a x which must represent the wave spectrum as accurately as possible while assuring a sufficient prediction horizon here following blondel et al 2010 but unlike wu 2004 f m i n and f m a x are defined so as to retain only components with an energy density which is at least 5 of the one at the peak of the wave spectrum as illustrated in fig 2a for the considered space time domain where x x 0 and t t the predictable zone is then defined by the following double inequality blondel couprie 2009 1 x 1 t 1 d x t if x 1 x 0 c g m i n t 1 t x 1 x 0 c g m a x and bounded by points x m i n t m i n and x m a x t m a x of coordinates 2 x m i n x 0 x m a x x 0 t c g m i n c g m a x c g m a x c g m i n t m i n t t m a x t c g m i n c g m a x c g m i n t m a x being the maximum time prediction horizon it is represented in fig 2b as already stressed in paragraph 2 2 the predictable zone d x t is actually made up of two subregions a hindcast zone labelled d r e c on fig 2b for t t 0 and the zone where actual prediction takes place labelled d p r e d for t 0 t m a x wave predictions obtained through the use of a single fixed measurement device are considered valid only within the predictable region defined above hence when evaluating the methodology presented in this work the error on the free surface elevation prediction will be calculated only in this zone this restriction does not apply to the results of the horizontal velocity reconstruction as this is not a prediction step 2 4 reconstruction of the boundary condition from wave data the first requirement for wave prediction is to retrieve information on the incoming sea state from field measurements to feed the propagation model in the method developed here the data is needed in the form of instantaneous horizontal velocity profiles along the water column unfortunately due to practical constraints this kind of information is not accessible today no measuring technology is yet able to provide a full horizontal velocity profile with a single instrument to tackle this problem and because the method was developed from the outset with practical applicability in mind a benchmarking study on the velocity measurement technologies currently available was carried out huchet 2017 from this work it appeared that only one type of measurement device was likely to provide instantaneous data on velocity in the whole water column while limiting the number of instruments deployed associated to higher costs acoustic doppler current profilers adcps these instruments rely on the doppler effect to measure the velocity of small suspended particles in the water which are assumed to have the same speed as the fluid itself adpcs are often installed with an up looking bottom mounted configuration they usually present 4 diverging beams with an angle of 20 30 to the instrument s axis and measure radial velocity profiles for each beam the distance between the volumes of water sensed by each beam increasing with the distance to the instrument traditional post processing methods reconstruct the 3d mean velocity components from these radial velocities using trigonometric relations this reconstruction is based on the assumption that the statistical properties of the flow are horizontally homogeneous lu and lueck 1999 meaning that at a given depth the velocities measured by the four diverging beams at different horizontal coordinates present the same mean amplitude and direction at the time scales considered when measuring mean currents this is a reasonable hypothesis and the method has proved its worth over the years in the case of deterministic wave measurements however relying on the statistical horizontal homogeneity of velocities is not useful because we are interested in instantaneous single ping velocity measurements rather than in time averaged quantities other methods were specifically developed for wave measurements from adcp data terray et al 1999 nortek 2017 but they still rely on time averaged quantities therefore they can only provide phase averaged information such as mean wave direction or significant wave height this is not relevant for the present application and a new dedicated method is then needed to recover deterministic useable data from available adcp measurements beside the classical four divergent beams some recent adcp models are also equipped with a fifth vertical one allowing to retrieve a well resolved profile of the vertical velocity component nortek 2017 the present paragraph then proposes a method to reconstruct an instantaneous horizontal velocity profile using the vertical beam of two adcps the other four beams being de activated to avoid interference with the configuration illustrated in fig 3 the two adcps are separated by a distance δ x in the direction of wave propagation and measure instantaneous vertical velocity profiles noted w x 0 δ x 2 z t the assumption of irrotational flow previously stated in paragraph 2 1 v 0 i n d can also be written 3 z u x z t x w x z t i n d with v u w the fluid velocity u and w its horizontal and vertical components in the cartesian coordinates system previously defined and x and z the partial derivatives with respect to x and z at any given time the instantaneous reconstructed horizontal velocity profile u ˆ at x 0 and at an arbitrary depth z 0 can then be expressed as 4 u ˆ x 0 z 0 t z r e f z 0 x w x 0 z t d z u x 0 z r e f t where z r e f is an arbitrary reference depth for which horizontal velocity data u x 0 z r e f t is available assuming vertical velocity measurements are available over the whole water column at x x 0 δ x 2 for example through the use of adcps and provided δ x is small enough and measurements are synchronized in time the instantaneous horizontal derivative for w at given space coordinates can be estimated with 5 x w x 0 z 0 t 1 δ x w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t o δ x 2 δ w x 0 z 0 t δ x o δ x 2 with δ w x 0 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t a classical integration scheme with a composite trapezoidal rule leads to the following approximated expression for u ˆ x 0 z 0 t 6 u ˆ x 0 z 0 t 1 δ x k 1 n z δ w x 0 z k 1 t δ w x 0 z k t 2 δ z k u x 0 z r e f t o δ x 2 o δ z 2 with z k the integration grid points dividing the interval z r e f z 0 into n z subintervals of respective length δ z k with no a priori requirement for a uniform grid here δ z k correspond to the sizes of the measuring cells for the adcps for deep water applications and assuming the vertical velocity profile w is measured until velocity is negligible u x 0 z r e f can be set to zero in intermediate water depth a local measuring device should be added to provide a reference horizontal velocity in this study we assume that the vertical velocity profiles are measured in the whole water column and that the reference velocity u x 0 h is known with this procedure which presently assumes perfect measurements no bias no noise etc the quality of the reconstruction depends mainly on i the quality of the approximation made for the partial derivative x w with a theoretical accuracy in o δ x 2 ii the vertical discretization of vertical velocity profiles responsible for the integration error on z varying in o δ z 2 and iii the accurate knowledge of the horizontal velocity at z z r e f as the method relies on instantaneous data the quality of the reconstruction does not depend on the time discretization of vertical velocity data it should be noted that this reconstruction method here written for uni directional sea states can be extended to short crested waves configurations additional measurement devices located at x 0 y 0 δ y 2 could provide an estimation of y w x 0 y 0 z t allowing to deduce the horizontal velocity along y v x 0 y 0 z t it is also worth mentioning in this critical assessment that the method is expected to be less accurate in the case of a flow with vorticity as well as in the presence of currents because the underlying equation v 0 is not valid anymore 2 5 wave propagation model hos nwt the second part of the prediction method concerns the propagation of the kinematics known at a fixed location once the incoming sea state has been measured at x 0 it is used as a boundary condition to generate and propagate the waves along o x thanks to the open source hos nwt model 1 1 code available at https github com lheea hos nwt a nonlinear deterministic numerical wave tank based on the hos method it was chosen because of its capabilities to model a wavemaker and the induced wave generation and propagation accurately and efficiently ducrozet et al 2012 and has been slightly adapted to fit our prediction purpose the generation of waves through a wavemaker is indeed very similar to the target application of generating waves by imposing a velocity profile at a fixed location the very good numerical performance of the model and its high level of accuracy make it a particularly suitable tool for predicting complex nonlinear sea states while retaining the possibility of real time applications the present section summarizes the main features of the model and the minor changes made for the purposes of this study it is adapted from ducrozet et al 2006 and additional information on the original hos nwt model may be found there here we consider the fluid domain d previously defined with horizontal dimension l x and finite depth h the section x x 0 originally corresponds to the wavemaker s rest position while the section x x 0 l x represents a perfectly reflective wall under the potential flow hypotheses introduced in paragraph 2 1 the continuity equation d i v v 0 leads to the laplace equation for the velocity potential φ δ φ 0 in the fluid domain d the bottom boundary condition is expressed in the form of a no flow condition z φ 0 at z h then following zakharov 1968 the free surface boundary conditions are written in a fully nonlinear form and using surface quantities namely the free surface elevation η and the surface potential φ s x t φ x z η t 7 t η 1 η 2 z φ φ s η 8 t φ s g η 1 2 φ s 2 1 2 1 η 2 z φ 2 on z η x t with this formulation the only remaining non surfacic quantity is the vertical velocity at the free surface w z φ x z η t this term is evaluated using the order consistent high order spectral hos method of west et al 1987 which allows a rapid and accurate resolution of the free surface equations at an arbitrary order of nonlinearity m this primary expression of the free surface boundary conditions is common to both the original hos formulation developed for open domains dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 and to its adapted version for numerical wave tanks used in this article the main difference between the original and the nwt formulations results from the lateral boundary conditions instead of imposing periodic conditions on x x 0 and x x 0 l x in the hos nwt model these boundary conditions are expressed as homogeneous neumann conditions no flow conditions the basis functions used for the spectral representation of the velocity potential are modified accordingly and become the natural modes of the closed wave tank originally in the hos nwt model the boundary reflecting the presence of the wavemaker x x 0 at rest is modelled by a no flow condition imposed between z h and z 0 at the position x of the wavemaker 9 x φ x z t t x z t z x z t z φ x z t at x x z t as this boundary condition is not directly taken into account by the spectral formulation further developments are necessary to be able to impose the exact wavemaker boundary condition the potential φ solution of the total problem is then separated into two components following agnon and bingham 1999 φ φ s p e c φ a d d where φ s p e c is the spectral potential describing the evolution of the free surface in a fixed geometry tank with a no flow condition on x x 0 and φ a d d is the additional potential accounting for the presence of the wavemaker and satisfying equation 9 more details may be found in bonnefoy et al 2010 and ducrozet et al 2012 in the modified version of the model implemented here the decomposition into φ s p e c and φ a d d remains but the no flow condition at the wavemaker s position is simplified into a horizontal velocity profile corresponding to the wave induced kinematics directly imposed at x 0 10 x φ x z t u x z t at x x 0 with u being the instantaneous full depth horizontal velocity profile that could be obtained via on site measurements compared to the original version of hos nwt this modification has the advantage of applying the last boundary condition directly at x x 0 and of removing the difficulties to account for a moving boundary since the potential gradient x φ is directly available finally it can be noted that the reflective wall at x x 0 l x is preceded by an absorbing zone in the numerical model reproducing the beach present near the end wall of most physical wave tanks to absorb the incoming energy its implementation in the model is done through a local modification of the free surface dynamic boundary condition and is not detailed here but can be found in bonnefoy et al 2006 this is useful to our application as well as it prevents wave reflections provided the simulation domain is set long enough i e l x must be large enough for the absorbing zone not to overlap with the prediction area compared to conventional hos methods based on periodic open boundaries this new version adapted from a numerical wave tank is particularly interesting for prediction applications indeed here the model does not require any initialization step based on the knowledge of two independent spatial quantities η and φ s the latter being hardly deducible from field data instead the waves are continuously generated through the boundary condition at x 0 using velocity data which should be more easily available with existing measurement techniques the associated wave prediction is expected to be accurate even for nonlinear sea states the following section aims at evaluating this statement through numerical experiments 3 numerical assessment using 2d synthetic wave fields in this section we present the process followed to numerically assess the potential of the prediction method previously developed first the reconstruction of the boundary condition using vertical velocity profiles is evaluated then the wave generation and prediction phase is also tested in both steps we use synthetic numerical data as a reference for comparison meaning that measurement errors are not taken into account in the final prediction error 3 1 wave cases studied and reference data the wave cases studied were chosen with the same characteristics as in wu 2004 in order to allow comparison on prediction performances generated in infinite water depth they are characterized by a uni directional jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 and a peak period t p 12 s from which the peak wavelength λ p is deduced by the dispersion relation for each wave case the significant wave height and its corresponding wave steepness defined as ε c h s λ p are reported in table 1 the synthetic sea states used as reference data were generated using another open source nonlinear wave model hos ocean 2 2 code available at https github com lheea hos ocean ducrozet et al 2016 this reference model is based on the original open sea hos method with periodic horizontal boundary conditions the method is widely used to study large scale and long time propagation of nonlinear sea states and is assumed to be an accurate representation of the real sea conditions ducrozet et al 2007 toffoli et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 the numerical parameters for the simulations were selected in order to ensure converged results k m a x k p 16 and the tolerance threshold was 10 7 for the time stepping process to be consistent with wu s test cases the reference data sets were generated with an order of hos expansion m 4 additionally for each sea state considered n s i m 100 different phase sets were simulated to ensure the statistical convergence of the results monte carlo simulations each run provided 51 t p of simulation from which only 41 t p were actually available for comparison indeed the simulations were initialized with a linear wave field through a jonswap spectrum and a set of random phases which is known to create risks of numerical instabilities to avoid this the initialization procedure described in dommermuth 2000 was implemented introducing a transition period of duration t a 10 t p during which a relaxation scheme was applied on the nonlinear terms in the free surface boundary conditions equation 7 and 8 this allowed a smooth transition from a linear initial condition to a fully nonlinear wave field which could then be considered realistic after this transition period the remaining 41 t p of actually useable data were divided into 30 t p of hindcast for which the boundary condition provided at x 0 by the reference model was updated in time 11 t p of prediction for which the boundary condition was set to zero in addition to the surfacic information classically made available by such models in these reference simulations the velocities were also evaluated inside the fluid domain thanks to a dedicated method ducrozet et al 2005 choi et al 2017 the reference data sets hence provided fields of sea surface elevation η x t as well as horizontal and vertical velocities u x z t and w x z t available in the whole space time domain 3 2 reconstruction of the horizontal velocity profile this section is dedicated to the numerical verification of the method introduced in section 2 4 to reconstruct the horizontal velocity profile u ˆ x 0 z t used as a boundary condition in our propagation model hos nwt here the synthetic numerical data described in 3 1 are used both as an input data base w x 0 δ x 2 z t to feed the reconstruction method and as reference results u x 0 z t for the assessment of the present method the reconstruction of the boundary condition is needed only in the hindcast phase of the general prediction method hence this step is applied only for t t 0 the velocity reconstruction is evaluated on the sea states described in table 1 it is assumed that the horizontal velocity at z r e f introduced in equation 4 needed as additional information is known here z r e f h the distance between the measuring devices is set to an ideally small value δ x 3 5 m λ p 64 the vertical velocity profiles are also supposedly measured along a very fine grid δ z 0 55 m λ p 410 in order to minimize the integration error as the method relies only on instantaneous velocity data from adjacent locations the quality of the reconstruction is independent from the time stepping used provided the measurement devices are correctly synchronized in time the updating rate of the boundary condition could influence the quality of generation and propagation of the waves but this aspect is independent of how well a single velocity profile is reconstructed hence each reconstruction at a given time step is independent from the others and the duration of the simulation taken into account is the only relevant time parameter here to provide a consolidated view on the results to ensure statistical convergence for each wave case the velocity reconstruction is then computed on the whole hindcast phase of duration t for all the n s i m 100 simulations with different phase sets performance assessment is conducted using statistical indicators such as the bias on velocity amplitudes b u z and the normalized root mean square error n r m s e u z 11 b u z 1 n s i m i 1 n s i m 1 t t 0 u ˆ i x 0 z t u i x 0 z t d t 12 n r m s e u z i 1 n s i m t 0 u ˆ i x 0 z t u i x 0 z t 2 d t i 1 n s i m t 0 u i x 0 z t 2 d t where i 1 n s i m is the realization index t is the duration of the hindcast phase here t 30 t p u i is the reference horizontal velocity profile for the ith random phase set u i ˆ is the corresponding velocity profile reconstructed using equation 4 as illustrated in fig 4 for all sea cases studied the bias on amplitudes is negative the method tends to slightly under estimate the amplitudes both positive and negative of the reconstructed velocity especially near the sea surface however even in the worst sea case considered here the bias on amplitudes remains below 1 5 cm s 1 at z 0 representing 1 1 of the root mean squared velocity at this depth for the corresponding sea state the bias being a dimensional quantity as expected it increases with wave steepness since for a given value of t p the velocities themselves increase with h s regarding the nrms error plotted in fig 5 a common thread to all sea states is that its magnitude depends on depth and increases significantly close to the free surface the figure also brings out a dependency on the sea state considered for the lowest steepnesses the error remains very low under 4 throughout the whole profile whereas for more severe sea states the shape of the error profile is modified and the error near the sea surface undergoes a noticeable increase up to 14 in the worst case however the nrms error is a quadratic indicator and even a rather high value can correspond to quite satisfying results as shown in fig 6 the reference and reconstructed velocity time series are plotted for z 0 at this depth these quantities do not always have a physical meaning and rather represent extrapolated values because when a wave trough passes over x 0 the fluid velocity does not exist at z 0 but the corresponding data is still needed as part of the boundary condition for hos nwt which is defined for z h 0 the time series are plotted for a single realization on a subrange of time steps for which the nrms error matches the converged value fig 6 then illustrates that a nrms error of 14 actually allows an accurate reconstruction of the velocity time series an alternative way of visualizing the results is proposed in fig 7 the probability density function of the absolute error normalized by the rms reference velocity is plotted at z 0 the same precautions as in fig 6 apply as to its physical meaning as can be seen in the figure the vast majority of errors remains below 10 for the three first sea states studied the last sea state h s 7 82 m exhibiting the highest degree of nonlinearity shows a wider distribution curve but the errors stay at very reasonable levels the results presented above were obtained through a numerical verification conducted for various sea states and stabilized over many realizations they give a first insight into the method s ability to reconstruct a suitable instantaneous horizontal velocity profile from synthetic data mimicking the operation of devices that were not primarily designed for deterministic wave measurements of course these results need to be consolidated with experiments taking into account more realistic measurement configurations cell size spacing between devices as well as measurement errors but these preliminary findings allow to extend the numerical study to wave prediction using this reconstructed velocity profile as a boundary condition this is the topic of the next section 3 3 propagation and prediction in this section a numerical verification is conducted on the prediction method the wave prediction is computed using the reconstructed horizontal velocity profile u ˆ x 0 z t as a boundary condition in the propagation model hos nwt although the reference data sets were generated in infinite water depth as stated in section 3 1 in hos nwt depth must be set to a finite value and was thus chosen large enough for the velocities to be near zero at the bottom h 280 m when the dispersion relation gives λ p 225 m the numerical parameters were selected in order to ensure convergence of the results the k m a x k p ratio ranged between 25 and 32 according to the sea state considered and for all cases the tolerance parameter for the time integration was set to 10 6 and the order of nonlinearity for hos nwt simulations to m 5 the quality of the prediction is evaluated by calculating the error on η x t using the same indicators as in wu 2004 a field of rms error normalized by significant wave height is first defined as 13 ε x t i 1 n s i m η p r e d i x t η r e f i x t 2 n s i m 2 h s with n s i m 100 being the number of monte carlo simulations computed to ensure statistical convergence of the results η r e f the output of the reference simulations and η p r e d the output of the prediction method the corresponding maps of the normalized prediction error are presented in fig 8 for all sea states considered the white solid lines mark out the prediction zone as defined in section 2 3 the white dashed line divides it further into hindcast and prediction sub areas here the frequency f m i n and f m a x used to compute the relevant group velocities were chosen so as to cut off wave frequencies accounting for less than 5 of the wave energy at the spectrum s peak as can be seen in fig 8 the prediction zone is a good indicator of where the wave prediction can be considered relevant with a clear error minimization in the area defined as predictable for all sea states considered in the prediction zone the error averaged on 100 runs remains below 15 even for large wave steepness and even stays below 10 up to a moderately high steepness of ε c 2 8 which compares well with the results of wu 2004 the figure also shows that the error increases with the nonlinearity of the sea states yet the propagation part of the hos nwt model is already well validated even for highly nonlinear cases hence this increase in error is probably due to an unsatisfactory implementation of the boundary condition at x 0 this assumption is supported by the observation that the error also increases with x and t in the propagation direction of the waves which is especially visible in the most energetic sea case beside the error maps a more synthetic indicator is also used averaging the previous error ε x t in the prediction zone and resulting in a single scalar error per sea state 14 ε d d x t ε x t d x d t d x t d x d t where d x t stands for the theoretical prediction zone this mean error is reported in table 2 along with the errors obtained by wu 2004 and blondel et al 2010 with the same formula 3 3 the numerical values for blondel et al 2010 were estimated from their figure 13 the results show a similar prediction quality for wu blondel and the new method presented here even the case with a wave steepness ε c 3 5 is quite satisfying considering our reconstructed velocity presents a nrms error of about 14 near the sea surface besides as our prediction method does not require any data assimilation to initialize the propagation model these results represent a significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency while providing a prediction as accurate as that obtained with other nonlinear methods the error indicators presented above are useful to compare our results with previous attempts on deterministic prediction however they lack information on the nature of this error because they do not discriminate between amplitude and phase errors yet the latter is particularly important to model predictive control for wave energy converters since it is crucial to know exactly when each wave will arrive at the device a complementary error quantity is thus proposed here the normalized cross correlation between the reference signal and the predicted one allowing to evaluate the similarity between two time series at a given x c coordinate the cross correlation factor c is expressed as a function of the time shift τ between the two signals 15 c τ 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x η p r e d x c t σ p r e d η r e f x c t τ σ r e f d t where σ r e f s t d η r e f x c t m i n t t m a x is the standard deviation of η r e f in the prediction zone the same applies to σ p r e d and t m i n m a x are the bounds of the theoretical prediction zone at the specific coordinate x c considered from this cross correlation function the maximum value m a x c and its corresponding time shift t s are extracted as indicators of how well the signal is reconstructed at point x c m a x c assesses how well the shape and amplitude of the predicted signal match the reference one and t s indicates the time delay for which signals are best aligned with one another as an example two identical signals with no time shift between them will show m a x c 1 and corresponding t s 0 s for a given sea state and phase set these two quantities m a x c and t s are calculated at each point x c of the simulation domain assessing the evolution of the prediction s quality over space the calculations use data from dedicated simulations run with a refined sampling rate to identify more accurately a potential phase shift for each sea state in table 1 m a x c and t s are computed separately for 25 different phase sets then ensemble averaged allowing to present converged results the results are plotted in fig 9 as a function of a dimensionless fetch expressed as χ ε c 2 k p x this quantity adapted from trulsen and stansberg 2001 save a π multiplication factor corresponds to the propagation distance scaled by the steepness squared it allows displaying results for different sea states on the same graphs and looking for general trends assuming the important nonlinear physical processes at play scale accordingly this applies for example to nonlinear modulation or nonlinear phase velocities this fig 9 presents a comparison between linear and nonlinear prediction capabilities starting from the same information provided by the velocity boundary condition u ˆ x 0 z t the wave propagation part of the method is computed both for linear m 1 and nonlinear m 5 hos nwt simulations the objective here is to assess the influence of nonlinearities during wave propagation all procedures being strictly equivalent otherwise because the steepness associated to h s 0 48 m is small the scaled fetch is too and results for this sea state are hardly readable on fig 9 a dedicated plot would show that for this case as expected the prediction quality is very similar for linear and nonlinear simulations however this is true only for a very small steepness or equivalently short dimensionless fetch the other sea states considered highlight diverging results between linear and nonlinear predictions as the scaled fetch increases even though the cross correlation is computed in the prediction zone only the quality of linear prediction deteriorates rapidly results show a decline in amplitudes similarity as well as the appearance of a phase shift the most noticeable feature is that linear prediction fails to maintain correct phase information even after a relatively short distance and that the increase of the error is driven by the dimensionless fetch χ as the evolution of phase shift shows perfect agreement from one sea state to another discarding the influence of the different y intercepts this scaling is also relevant for the correlation factor m a x c which reaches low values for the largest scaled fetch considered here this evolution was expected as both nonlinear phase velocity effects and nonlinear amplitude modulation are known to scale with ε c 2 zakharov 1968 longuet higgins and phillips 1962 trulsen 2005 nonlinear prediction on the other hand offers a good prediction quality both in terms of correlation magnitude and of phase shift the nonlinear method shows a decrease in the correlation coefficient for short scaled fetch with increasing propagation distance it stabilizes at different values depending on the sea states the worst case level being around 0 9 for the highest steepness considered this is a far more satisfying result than their linear equivalent and a good performance in itself as will be seen shortly with fig 10 the method also proves able to deliver a reliable phase information for all cases considered the different curves do not overlap as much as for the linear predictions but their evolutions are similar and altogether the phase shift remains within less than 5 of t p the common behaviour observed for linear simulations of different sea states confirms that when nonlinearity is not taken into account the error evolves with the steepness squared the disappearance of this scaling in the nonlinear results confirms that the predominant nonlinear effects are well taken into account by the hos method as expected the remaining dispersion of the results according to the steepness considered however suggest that other sources of error should be looked for higher order nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are a first possibility the error made on the boundary condition at x 0 is also a likely candidate here as it was shown in section 3 2 that the quality of the reconstructed velocity depended on the steepness considered the very good performance of the nonlinear method in maintaining the phase information over long distances is finally illustrated in fig 10 it displays time series of η for both linear and nonlinear predictions at χ 0 5 this corresponds to the sea state with the largest steepness ε c 3 5 h s 7 82 m captured at x 6 λ p from the measurement point at x 0 the error ε d associated to this specific realization hence averaged on 1 run only is 10 8 a value slightly superior to the error averaged on 100 runs reported in table 2 and the corresponding correlation factor is 0 95 a little better than the mean value in fig 9 fig 10 highlights the difference in prediction quality between linear and nonlinear wave propagation as well as the ability of the proposed method to deliver a suitable prediction tens of seconds ahead even for highly nonlinear sea states as this improvement is mainly due to a correct calculation of the phase velocity which takes non linearities into account it would be worth investigating the performance of other methods such as weakly nonlinear wave models they could be faster than hos while retaining a correct phase velocity the choppy wave model nouguier et al 2009 would be an interesting candidate especially its improved second order formulation proposed by desmars et al 2018 which introduces corrections for the phase and group velocities accounting for some nonlinearities 4 conclusion a new deterministic wave prediction method was proposed in this article using instantaneous velocity profile measurements as input data for a wave propagation model based on a hos method this allows to model even highly nonlinear sea states accurately a feature which is non negligible in the time and space scales considered here an important aspect of the method is the reconstruction from field data of the horizontal velocity profile used as a boundary condition in the propagation model a pre processing step was developed to ensure the recovery of useable information from the type of in situ velocity measurements actually available nowadays here adcp data were judged the most suitable candidate the velocity reconstruction then the wave prediction process were evaluated numerically using uni directional synthetic sea states and assuming an ideal measurement configuration no measurement error a small distance between the instruments and a very large number of measurement points in the water column the reconstructed velocity profiles were compared to reference time series and the method proved able to provide a reliable boundary condition to the propagation model even though for the steepest wave case the quality of the reconstruction is slightly less satisfying close to the free surface the whole prediction process was then evaluated numerically we used the same test cases and error indicators as previous studies on deterministic wave prediction based on the hos method to compare our results with the state of the art our approach provided a similar prediction quality while dispensing with the step of data assimilation necessary for other methods which should greatly reduce the required computing time the interest of using a nonlinear propagation model was confirmed using cross correlation indicators to compare the amplitude and phase errors between linear and nonlinear predictions it showed evidence that for the space and time scales considered our method provides far superior results than one based on a linear propagation model presenting the evolution of error along a propagation distance scaled by the steepness squared highlighted some common behaviours for linear predictions and further quality deterioration with increasing distance or steepness can be extrapolated for these simulations on the contrary nonlinear prediction results do not scale with this parameter while retaining some variability from one steepness to another as the propagation method used is known to correctly manage the third order nonlinear effects at play with the ε c 2 scaling the remaining differences could be attributed to higher order effects in the propagation and to errors in the reconstruction of the boundary condition at x 0 generalization to any arbitrary sea state remains risky but from the available results one could expect the method to maintain satisfying phase information for any steepness considered while the amplitude and shape accuracy given by the correlation factor is likely to deteriorate with increasing steepness finally as stated above in this article the velocity reconstruction was computed assuming an ideal measurement configuration additional tests not presented here have analyzed the sensitivity of this reconstruction to measurement configuration several measurement parameters were modified such as the spacing between instruments the adcp cell size or the availability of data close to the free surface as could be expected this sensitivity study showed a loss of quality for the velocity reconstruction when numerical tests mimicked a more realistic measurement configuration however the prediction obtained from this less accurate boundary condition remained good enough to justify conducting an experimental validation of the method in the wave basin of centrale nantes the

21147,optimizing the production of wave energy converters using model predictive control mpc requires a real time deterministic prediction of the waves arriving at the device this study presents a new method for deterministic sea wave prediction using the horizontal velocity profile over the water column as a boundary condition for a dedicated nonlinear wave model however direct measurement of the horizontal velocity component over the whole vertical column is hardly achievable at sea a method to reconstruct this profile from measurement devices currently at use such as adcps is thus presented and evaluated the performance of the prediction method itself is then tested using synthetic numerical data first the reconstruction of the horizontal velocity profile as a boundary condition is evaluated then the whole prediction procedure is assessed in both these stages the simulations are based on synthetic numerical data and the outcomes are compared with numerical reference solutions the results show that the method is promising enough to justify further investigation through wave tank experiments keywords deterministic wave prediction nonlinear waves high order spectral method 1 introduction while stochastic wave models such as wam the wamdi group 1988 wawewatch iii tolman 2009 or swan booij et al 1999 are widely used today e g in weather forecast or marine operation planning they only provide statistical quantities on the sea state such as significant wave height h s peak period t p or mean wave direction phase resolved wave models on the other hand can offer a description of the actual shape of the sea surface such information if available in real time would greatly benefit to a range of marine applications such as aircraft take off and landing ship dynamic positioning or the development of control strategies for wave energy converters for this latter application in particular model predictive control mpc appears to be a very promising method richter et al 2013 that could increase the energy harvested by the device by up to 80 compared to regular proportional integral pi control nguyen et al 2016 to be effective a mpc strategy requires prior knowledge of the waves arriving at the device around 20 s ahead advocating the need for an efficient real time deterministic sea wave prediction tool although they provide a detailed description of the sea surface the high computational costs of phase resolved wave models have long restricted their use to small time space simulation domains but recent progress in computational resources has revived interest in their development and they have emerged as a credible alternative for accurate short term wave prediction in the past 20 years morris et al 1998 these deterministic wave models can classically be divided into linear and nonlinear methods as frequently pointed out köllisch et al 2018 klein et al 2020 law et al 2020 linear models benefit from a shorter computation time a critical feature for real time prediction and are thus often preferred for operational purposes morris et al 1998 belmont et al 2006 naaijen and huijsmans 2008 naaijen et al 2009 abusedra and belmont 2011 kosleck 2013 naaijen et al 2014b they offer rather satisfying results for moderate sea states and short propagation distances or for prediction requiring information on quiescent periods only belmont et al 2014 however with increasing steepness of the sea state nonlinear effects become significant and linear models fail to capture correctly the evolution of waves toffoli et al 2008 2010 bonnefoy et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 following the early work of zhang et al 1999 who used a model truncated at second order in wave steepness other weakly nonlinear approaches have then been developed for deterministic wave prediction accounting for nonlinearities up to the third order with a narrow band approximation the nonlinear schrödinger equation nlse framework is able to reproduce some nonlinear effects trulsen and stansberg 2001 adcock et al 2012 simanesew et al 2017 trulsen 2005 conducted experimental validations of the nlse method against laboratory measurements for among others long crested irregular waves results showed that while the regular version of the nlse brings little to no benefits compared to the linear theory the modified version of the equation mnlse enhanced with exact linear dispersion on the other hand greatly improves the wave modelling additionally simanesew et al 2017 compared various versions of the schrödinger equation with linear models and provided an analysis on short crested waves prediction they stressed out that when too little information is available on the directionality of incoming waves nonlinear models do not perform better than linear ones and the lack of reliable input data represents a more constraining blocking point than the propagation step itself among higher order models the hos method wu et al 2000 wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 blondel couprie et al 2013 köllisch et al 2018 klein et al 2019 has proved to be particularly promising for nonlinear wave prediction on large space time domains wu 2004 blondel et al 2010 thanks to its high numerical efficiency and accuracy even for short crested waves and has thus been chosen for this study when using a hos method with operational applications in mind the main difficulty does not lie in the propagation step itself but in initializing the model from field measurements köllisch et al 2018 fucile et al 2018 most of the computational time is actually spent in processing the wave data collected with the technology available at sea in order to provide a valid initial condition this pre processing step today represents the main obstacle to real time prediction blondel et al 2010 köllisch et al 2018 much of the work conducted to overcome this challenge has focused on extracting wave information from sea surface elevation data either through the use of wave buoys or radar imaging blondel et al 2010 naaijen et al 2014b however to properly initialize a conventional hos model a snapshot of the sea surface elevation is not sufficient and additional independent information is required classically the velocity potential at the free surface as this is not a piece of information easily retrievable from field measurements this quantity can either be approximated at first order klein et al 2019 or computed with a data assimilation scheme aragh and nwogu 2008 blondel couprie and naaijen 2012 yoon et al 2016 köllisch et al 2018 none of these methods being fully satisfying because of the approximations or additional computational cost induced the present article thus proposes a different innovative approach based on wave induced fluid velocity data instead of sea surface elevation data information on the incoming sea state is collected in the form of instantaneous vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity over the whole water column at one fixed location upstream the point of interest this data is used as a boundary condition in a propagation model which then provides a wave prediction at the point of interest the propagation model used is the open source nonlinear potential code hos nwt it is based on the pseudo spectral high order spectral hos method dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 and has been developed at centrale nantes ducrozet et al 2006 2012 the hos nwt model was designed to model a numerical wave tank and was slightly adapted here to fit for ocean wave prediction purposes the core of the propagation method remains unchanged with regards to the original hos methods but the boundary and initial conditions differ allowing nonlinear wave prediction without depending on the initialization of the spatial free surface quantities which are difficult to retrieve from field data as the hos nwt model itself is already widely validated bonnefoy et al 2010 ducrozet et al 2006 2012 the propagation part of the prediction procedure does not raise any particular difficulty as long as the underlying hypotheses are met hence the challenge lies in determining a suitable boundary condition from the velocity data collected upstream in the water column as it turns out direct access to instantaneous horizontal velocity profiles is not achievable with the measurement technologies currently available however reconstructing such information from measurements acquired with an adcp acoustic doppler current profiler seems within reach huchet et al 2018 this paper presents a numerical assessment of this new prediction method the ability to produce a good quality boundary condition from velocity data retrievable with the available measurement technologies is evaluated as well as the quality of the wave prediction obtained the numerical verification is conducted on uni directional irregular waves using synthetic measurement data 2 propagation prediction method 2 1 hypotheses this study is carried out in 2d uni directional waves only ignoring wind forcing with a finite constant water depth h and with no ambient currents the considered space domain d has horizontal bounds set at x x 0 and x x 0 l x and vertical bounds delimited by the flat bottom at z h and the free surface position at z η x t it is associated with a cartesian coordinate system o x z its origin o is set at one corner of the domain with o x representing the horizontal axis waves propagating towards x 0 and o z the vertical one oriented upwards with z 0 set at the mean water level at rest see fig 1 we assume that the hypotheses underlying the use of potential flow theory are valid the fluid is considered inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational wave breaking is not accounted for here and z η x t describes the free surface position in the space time domain finally this work was conducted using synthetic numerical data meaning that the results discussed in section 3 do not take into account measurement errors such as instrument bias or noise in the following sections if encountered the term measurements will thus refer to synthetic data generated with a reference numerical model 2 2 general outline the method developed here aims at providing an accurate wave prediction over a horizon of a few wave periods 30 60 s using a fixed velocity measurement device located upstream the area of interest the adopted approach illustrated in fig 1 consists in measuring the instantaneous wave induced velocity in the water column at a fixed position x 0 the collected data is used to recover the profile of the horizontal component of fluid velocity at x 0 u x 0 z t this horizontal velocity profile is then passed on as a boundary condition in the deterministic wave model hos nwt which generates and propagates the corresponding waves downstream to the area of interest the proposed prediction methodology considers the fluid at rest as initial conditions the waves being generated from the boundary condition at x x 0 the method then runs in two steps first the reconstruction of the sea state then the prediction itself the reconstruction phase of duration t and arbitrarily set in the past in this study relies on continuously updated velocity measurements for t t 0 the velocity data collected at coordinate x 0 in the water column is used by the hos nwt model via its boundary condition to generate and propagate the corresponding waves downstream as illustrated in fig 1a in the second step t 0 illustrated in fig 1b data on the incident waves at x 0 is not updated anymore and the boundary condition is set to zero in hos nwt therefore the model only propagates information collected before t 0 this marks the beginning of the prediction phase itself this method allows to model nonlinear irregular sea states accurately more importantly contrary to many other wave models it does not rely on any data assimilation step to provide the surfacic initial conditions usually required resulting in a substantial improvement in computation time the particular steps of reconstructing the boundary condition and propagating the waves are detailed below as well as the need to define correctly the region where an accurate prediction is theoretically available 2 3 theoretical prediction zone as the information collected on the incoming sea state is limited in time and space so is the region where a reliable deterministic wave prediction can be achieved the predictable zone d x t is then defined as the space time domain accessible to deterministic sea wave prediction from the available measurements several publications have already extensively addressed the definition of this predictable zone for various measurement configurations wu 2004 naaijen et al 2014a qi et al 2018b fucile et al 2018 hence only the broad lines for our simplified uni directional case are reminded here a 2d uni directional irregular wave field being continuously measured by a fixed point device located at x x 0 can be represented by its wave power spectral density as in fig 2 a assuming that the energy content of this spectrum is negligible outside some frequency bounds f m i n and f m a x judiciously set the sea surface elevation at a given point x 1 t 1 can be correctly predicted only if all relevant frequency components between f m i n and f m a x were measured at x 0 between t t and t 0 were propagated to x 1 between t t and t t 1 the predictable zone is then bounded by the propagation of both the slowest component measured at t t and the fastest component measured at t 0 as illustrated in fig 2b these bounds translate into limiting group velocities c g m i n and c g m a x which are evaluated here using the linear dispersion relation although the waves considered in this article are nonlinear studies have shown that the predictable region defined assuming a linear sea state is actually more restrictive than when taking nonlinearities into account so the linear definition gives a minimal estimation of the prediction zone wu 2004 blondel couprie 2009 qi et al 2018a c g m i n and c g m a x in turn depend on the choice of the frequency bounds f m i n and f m a x which must represent the wave spectrum as accurately as possible while assuring a sufficient prediction horizon here following blondel et al 2010 but unlike wu 2004 f m i n and f m a x are defined so as to retain only components with an energy density which is at least 5 of the one at the peak of the wave spectrum as illustrated in fig 2a for the considered space time domain where x x 0 and t t the predictable zone is then defined by the following double inequality blondel couprie 2009 1 x 1 t 1 d x t if x 1 x 0 c g m i n t 1 t x 1 x 0 c g m a x and bounded by points x m i n t m i n and x m a x t m a x of coordinates 2 x m i n x 0 x m a x x 0 t c g m i n c g m a x c g m a x c g m i n t m i n t t m a x t c g m i n c g m a x c g m i n t m a x being the maximum time prediction horizon it is represented in fig 2b as already stressed in paragraph 2 2 the predictable zone d x t is actually made up of two subregions a hindcast zone labelled d r e c on fig 2b for t t 0 and the zone where actual prediction takes place labelled d p r e d for t 0 t m a x wave predictions obtained through the use of a single fixed measurement device are considered valid only within the predictable region defined above hence when evaluating the methodology presented in this work the error on the free surface elevation prediction will be calculated only in this zone this restriction does not apply to the results of the horizontal velocity reconstruction as this is not a prediction step 2 4 reconstruction of the boundary condition from wave data the first requirement for wave prediction is to retrieve information on the incoming sea state from field measurements to feed the propagation model in the method developed here the data is needed in the form of instantaneous horizontal velocity profiles along the water column unfortunately due to practical constraints this kind of information is not accessible today no measuring technology is yet able to provide a full horizontal velocity profile with a single instrument to tackle this problem and because the method was developed from the outset with practical applicability in mind a benchmarking study on the velocity measurement technologies currently available was carried out huchet 2017 from this work it appeared that only one type of measurement device was likely to provide instantaneous data on velocity in the whole water column while limiting the number of instruments deployed associated to higher costs acoustic doppler current profilers adcps these instruments rely on the doppler effect to measure the velocity of small suspended particles in the water which are assumed to have the same speed as the fluid itself adpcs are often installed with an up looking bottom mounted configuration they usually present 4 diverging beams with an angle of 20 30 to the instrument s axis and measure radial velocity profiles for each beam the distance between the volumes of water sensed by each beam increasing with the distance to the instrument traditional post processing methods reconstruct the 3d mean velocity components from these radial velocities using trigonometric relations this reconstruction is based on the assumption that the statistical properties of the flow are horizontally homogeneous lu and lueck 1999 meaning that at a given depth the velocities measured by the four diverging beams at different horizontal coordinates present the same mean amplitude and direction at the time scales considered when measuring mean currents this is a reasonable hypothesis and the method has proved its worth over the years in the case of deterministic wave measurements however relying on the statistical horizontal homogeneity of velocities is not useful because we are interested in instantaneous single ping velocity measurements rather than in time averaged quantities other methods were specifically developed for wave measurements from adcp data terray et al 1999 nortek 2017 but they still rely on time averaged quantities therefore they can only provide phase averaged information such as mean wave direction or significant wave height this is not relevant for the present application and a new dedicated method is then needed to recover deterministic useable data from available adcp measurements beside the classical four divergent beams some recent adcp models are also equipped with a fifth vertical one allowing to retrieve a well resolved profile of the vertical velocity component nortek 2017 the present paragraph then proposes a method to reconstruct an instantaneous horizontal velocity profile using the vertical beam of two adcps the other four beams being de activated to avoid interference with the configuration illustrated in fig 3 the two adcps are separated by a distance δ x in the direction of wave propagation and measure instantaneous vertical velocity profiles noted w x 0 δ x 2 z t the assumption of irrotational flow previously stated in paragraph 2 1 v 0 i n d can also be written 3 z u x z t x w x z t i n d with v u w the fluid velocity u and w its horizontal and vertical components in the cartesian coordinates system previously defined and x and z the partial derivatives with respect to x and z at any given time the instantaneous reconstructed horizontal velocity profile u ˆ at x 0 and at an arbitrary depth z 0 can then be expressed as 4 u ˆ x 0 z 0 t z r e f z 0 x w x 0 z t d z u x 0 z r e f t where z r e f is an arbitrary reference depth for which horizontal velocity data u x 0 z r e f t is available assuming vertical velocity measurements are available over the whole water column at x x 0 δ x 2 for example through the use of adcps and provided δ x is small enough and measurements are synchronized in time the instantaneous horizontal derivative for w at given space coordinates can be estimated with 5 x w x 0 z 0 t 1 δ x w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t o δ x 2 δ w x 0 z 0 t δ x o δ x 2 with δ w x 0 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t w x 0 δ x 2 z 0 t a classical integration scheme with a composite trapezoidal rule leads to the following approximated expression for u ˆ x 0 z 0 t 6 u ˆ x 0 z 0 t 1 δ x k 1 n z δ w x 0 z k 1 t δ w x 0 z k t 2 δ z k u x 0 z r e f t o δ x 2 o δ z 2 with z k the integration grid points dividing the interval z r e f z 0 into n z subintervals of respective length δ z k with no a priori requirement for a uniform grid here δ z k correspond to the sizes of the measuring cells for the adcps for deep water applications and assuming the vertical velocity profile w is measured until velocity is negligible u x 0 z r e f can be set to zero in intermediate water depth a local measuring device should be added to provide a reference horizontal velocity in this study we assume that the vertical velocity profiles are measured in the whole water column and that the reference velocity u x 0 h is known with this procedure which presently assumes perfect measurements no bias no noise etc the quality of the reconstruction depends mainly on i the quality of the approximation made for the partial derivative x w with a theoretical accuracy in o δ x 2 ii the vertical discretization of vertical velocity profiles responsible for the integration error on z varying in o δ z 2 and iii the accurate knowledge of the horizontal velocity at z z r e f as the method relies on instantaneous data the quality of the reconstruction does not depend on the time discretization of vertical velocity data it should be noted that this reconstruction method here written for uni directional sea states can be extended to short crested waves configurations additional measurement devices located at x 0 y 0 δ y 2 could provide an estimation of y w x 0 y 0 z t allowing to deduce the horizontal velocity along y v x 0 y 0 z t it is also worth mentioning in this critical assessment that the method is expected to be less accurate in the case of a flow with vorticity as well as in the presence of currents because the underlying equation v 0 is not valid anymore 2 5 wave propagation model hos nwt the second part of the prediction method concerns the propagation of the kinematics known at a fixed location once the incoming sea state has been measured at x 0 it is used as a boundary condition to generate and propagate the waves along o x thanks to the open source hos nwt model 1 1 code available at https github com lheea hos nwt a nonlinear deterministic numerical wave tank based on the hos method it was chosen because of its capabilities to model a wavemaker and the induced wave generation and propagation accurately and efficiently ducrozet et al 2012 and has been slightly adapted to fit our prediction purpose the generation of waves through a wavemaker is indeed very similar to the target application of generating waves by imposing a velocity profile at a fixed location the very good numerical performance of the model and its high level of accuracy make it a particularly suitable tool for predicting complex nonlinear sea states while retaining the possibility of real time applications the present section summarizes the main features of the model and the minor changes made for the purposes of this study it is adapted from ducrozet et al 2006 and additional information on the original hos nwt model may be found there here we consider the fluid domain d previously defined with horizontal dimension l x and finite depth h the section x x 0 originally corresponds to the wavemaker s rest position while the section x x 0 l x represents a perfectly reflective wall under the potential flow hypotheses introduced in paragraph 2 1 the continuity equation d i v v 0 leads to the laplace equation for the velocity potential φ δ φ 0 in the fluid domain d the bottom boundary condition is expressed in the form of a no flow condition z φ 0 at z h then following zakharov 1968 the free surface boundary conditions are written in a fully nonlinear form and using surface quantities namely the free surface elevation η and the surface potential φ s x t φ x z η t 7 t η 1 η 2 z φ φ s η 8 t φ s g η 1 2 φ s 2 1 2 1 η 2 z φ 2 on z η x t with this formulation the only remaining non surfacic quantity is the vertical velocity at the free surface w z φ x z η t this term is evaluated using the order consistent high order spectral hos method of west et al 1987 which allows a rapid and accurate resolution of the free surface equations at an arbitrary order of nonlinearity m this primary expression of the free surface boundary conditions is common to both the original hos formulation developed for open domains dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 ducrozet et al 2007 bonnefoy et al 2010 and to its adapted version for numerical wave tanks used in this article the main difference between the original and the nwt formulations results from the lateral boundary conditions instead of imposing periodic conditions on x x 0 and x x 0 l x in the hos nwt model these boundary conditions are expressed as homogeneous neumann conditions no flow conditions the basis functions used for the spectral representation of the velocity potential are modified accordingly and become the natural modes of the closed wave tank originally in the hos nwt model the boundary reflecting the presence of the wavemaker x x 0 at rest is modelled by a no flow condition imposed between z h and z 0 at the position x of the wavemaker 9 x φ x z t t x z t z x z t z φ x z t at x x z t as this boundary condition is not directly taken into account by the spectral formulation further developments are necessary to be able to impose the exact wavemaker boundary condition the potential φ solution of the total problem is then separated into two components following agnon and bingham 1999 φ φ s p e c φ a d d where φ s p e c is the spectral potential describing the evolution of the free surface in a fixed geometry tank with a no flow condition on x x 0 and φ a d d is the additional potential accounting for the presence of the wavemaker and satisfying equation 9 more details may be found in bonnefoy et al 2010 and ducrozet et al 2012 in the modified version of the model implemented here the decomposition into φ s p e c and φ a d d remains but the no flow condition at the wavemaker s position is simplified into a horizontal velocity profile corresponding to the wave induced kinematics directly imposed at x 0 10 x φ x z t u x z t at x x 0 with u being the instantaneous full depth horizontal velocity profile that could be obtained via on site measurements compared to the original version of hos nwt this modification has the advantage of applying the last boundary condition directly at x x 0 and of removing the difficulties to account for a moving boundary since the potential gradient x φ is directly available finally it can be noted that the reflective wall at x x 0 l x is preceded by an absorbing zone in the numerical model reproducing the beach present near the end wall of most physical wave tanks to absorb the incoming energy its implementation in the model is done through a local modification of the free surface dynamic boundary condition and is not detailed here but can be found in bonnefoy et al 2006 this is useful to our application as well as it prevents wave reflections provided the simulation domain is set long enough i e l x must be large enough for the absorbing zone not to overlap with the prediction area compared to conventional hos methods based on periodic open boundaries this new version adapted from a numerical wave tank is particularly interesting for prediction applications indeed here the model does not require any initialization step based on the knowledge of two independent spatial quantities η and φ s the latter being hardly deducible from field data instead the waves are continuously generated through the boundary condition at x 0 using velocity data which should be more easily available with existing measurement techniques the associated wave prediction is expected to be accurate even for nonlinear sea states the following section aims at evaluating this statement through numerical experiments 3 numerical assessment using 2d synthetic wave fields in this section we present the process followed to numerically assess the potential of the prediction method previously developed first the reconstruction of the boundary condition using vertical velocity profiles is evaluated then the wave generation and prediction phase is also tested in both steps we use synthetic numerical data as a reference for comparison meaning that measurement errors are not taken into account in the final prediction error 3 1 wave cases studied and reference data the wave cases studied were chosen with the same characteristics as in wu 2004 in order to allow comparison on prediction performances generated in infinite water depth they are characterized by a uni directional jonswap spectrum with a peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 and a peak period t p 12 s from which the peak wavelength λ p is deduced by the dispersion relation for each wave case the significant wave height and its corresponding wave steepness defined as ε c h s λ p are reported in table 1 the synthetic sea states used as reference data were generated using another open source nonlinear wave model hos ocean 2 2 code available at https github com lheea hos ocean ducrozet et al 2016 this reference model is based on the original open sea hos method with periodic horizontal boundary conditions the method is widely used to study large scale and long time propagation of nonlinear sea states and is assumed to be an accurate representation of the real sea conditions ducrozet et al 2007 toffoli et al 2010 xiao et al 2013 sergeeva and slunyaev 2013 the numerical parameters for the simulations were selected in order to ensure converged results k m a x k p 16 and the tolerance threshold was 10 7 for the time stepping process to be consistent with wu s test cases the reference data sets were generated with an order of hos expansion m 4 additionally for each sea state considered n s i m 100 different phase sets were simulated to ensure the statistical convergence of the results monte carlo simulations each run provided 51 t p of simulation from which only 41 t p were actually available for comparison indeed the simulations were initialized with a linear wave field through a jonswap spectrum and a set of random phases which is known to create risks of numerical instabilities to avoid this the initialization procedure described in dommermuth 2000 was implemented introducing a transition period of duration t a 10 t p during which a relaxation scheme was applied on the nonlinear terms in the free surface boundary conditions equation 7 and 8 this allowed a smooth transition from a linear initial condition to a fully nonlinear wave field which could then be considered realistic after this transition period the remaining 41 t p of actually useable data were divided into 30 t p of hindcast for which the boundary condition provided at x 0 by the reference model was updated in time 11 t p of prediction for which the boundary condition was set to zero in addition to the surfacic information classically made available by such models in these reference simulations the velocities were also evaluated inside the fluid domain thanks to a dedicated method ducrozet et al 2005 choi et al 2017 the reference data sets hence provided fields of sea surface elevation η x t as well as horizontal and vertical velocities u x z t and w x z t available in the whole space time domain 3 2 reconstruction of the horizontal velocity profile this section is dedicated to the numerical verification of the method introduced in section 2 4 to reconstruct the horizontal velocity profile u ˆ x 0 z t used as a boundary condition in our propagation model hos nwt here the synthetic numerical data described in 3 1 are used both as an input data base w x 0 δ x 2 z t to feed the reconstruction method and as reference results u x 0 z t for the assessment of the present method the reconstruction of the boundary condition is needed only in the hindcast phase of the general prediction method hence this step is applied only for t t 0 the velocity reconstruction is evaluated on the sea states described in table 1 it is assumed that the horizontal velocity at z r e f introduced in equation 4 needed as additional information is known here z r e f h the distance between the measuring devices is set to an ideally small value δ x 3 5 m λ p 64 the vertical velocity profiles are also supposedly measured along a very fine grid δ z 0 55 m λ p 410 in order to minimize the integration error as the method relies only on instantaneous velocity data from adjacent locations the quality of the reconstruction is independent from the time stepping used provided the measurement devices are correctly synchronized in time the updating rate of the boundary condition could influence the quality of generation and propagation of the waves but this aspect is independent of how well a single velocity profile is reconstructed hence each reconstruction at a given time step is independent from the others and the duration of the simulation taken into account is the only relevant time parameter here to provide a consolidated view on the results to ensure statistical convergence for each wave case the velocity reconstruction is then computed on the whole hindcast phase of duration t for all the n s i m 100 simulations with different phase sets performance assessment is conducted using statistical indicators such as the bias on velocity amplitudes b u z and the normalized root mean square error n r m s e u z 11 b u z 1 n s i m i 1 n s i m 1 t t 0 u ˆ i x 0 z t u i x 0 z t d t 12 n r m s e u z i 1 n s i m t 0 u ˆ i x 0 z t u i x 0 z t 2 d t i 1 n s i m t 0 u i x 0 z t 2 d t where i 1 n s i m is the realization index t is the duration of the hindcast phase here t 30 t p u i is the reference horizontal velocity profile for the ith random phase set u i ˆ is the corresponding velocity profile reconstructed using equation 4 as illustrated in fig 4 for all sea cases studied the bias on amplitudes is negative the method tends to slightly under estimate the amplitudes both positive and negative of the reconstructed velocity especially near the sea surface however even in the worst sea case considered here the bias on amplitudes remains below 1 5 cm s 1 at z 0 representing 1 1 of the root mean squared velocity at this depth for the corresponding sea state the bias being a dimensional quantity as expected it increases with wave steepness since for a given value of t p the velocities themselves increase with h s regarding the nrms error plotted in fig 5 a common thread to all sea states is that its magnitude depends on depth and increases significantly close to the free surface the figure also brings out a dependency on the sea state considered for the lowest steepnesses the error remains very low under 4 throughout the whole profile whereas for more severe sea states the shape of the error profile is modified and the error near the sea surface undergoes a noticeable increase up to 14 in the worst case however the nrms error is a quadratic indicator and even a rather high value can correspond to quite satisfying results as shown in fig 6 the reference and reconstructed velocity time series are plotted for z 0 at this depth these quantities do not always have a physical meaning and rather represent extrapolated values because when a wave trough passes over x 0 the fluid velocity does not exist at z 0 but the corresponding data is still needed as part of the boundary condition for hos nwt which is defined for z h 0 the time series are plotted for a single realization on a subrange of time steps for which the nrms error matches the converged value fig 6 then illustrates that a nrms error of 14 actually allows an accurate reconstruction of the velocity time series an alternative way of visualizing the results is proposed in fig 7 the probability density function of the absolute error normalized by the rms reference velocity is plotted at z 0 the same precautions as in fig 6 apply as to its physical meaning as can be seen in the figure the vast majority of errors remains below 10 for the three first sea states studied the last sea state h s 7 82 m exhibiting the highest degree of nonlinearity shows a wider distribution curve but the errors stay at very reasonable levels the results presented above were obtained through a numerical verification conducted for various sea states and stabilized over many realizations they give a first insight into the method s ability to reconstruct a suitable instantaneous horizontal velocity profile from synthetic data mimicking the operation of devices that were not primarily designed for deterministic wave measurements of course these results need to be consolidated with experiments taking into account more realistic measurement configurations cell size spacing between devices as well as measurement errors but these preliminary findings allow to extend the numerical study to wave prediction using this reconstructed velocity profile as a boundary condition this is the topic of the next section 3 3 propagation and prediction in this section a numerical verification is conducted on the prediction method the wave prediction is computed using the reconstructed horizontal velocity profile u ˆ x 0 z t as a boundary condition in the propagation model hos nwt although the reference data sets were generated in infinite water depth as stated in section 3 1 in hos nwt depth must be set to a finite value and was thus chosen large enough for the velocities to be near zero at the bottom h 280 m when the dispersion relation gives λ p 225 m the numerical parameters were selected in order to ensure convergence of the results the k m a x k p ratio ranged between 25 and 32 according to the sea state considered and for all cases the tolerance parameter for the time integration was set to 10 6 and the order of nonlinearity for hos nwt simulations to m 5 the quality of the prediction is evaluated by calculating the error on η x t using the same indicators as in wu 2004 a field of rms error normalized by significant wave height is first defined as 13 ε x t i 1 n s i m η p r e d i x t η r e f i x t 2 n s i m 2 h s with n s i m 100 being the number of monte carlo simulations computed to ensure statistical convergence of the results η r e f the output of the reference simulations and η p r e d the output of the prediction method the corresponding maps of the normalized prediction error are presented in fig 8 for all sea states considered the white solid lines mark out the prediction zone as defined in section 2 3 the white dashed line divides it further into hindcast and prediction sub areas here the frequency f m i n and f m a x used to compute the relevant group velocities were chosen so as to cut off wave frequencies accounting for less than 5 of the wave energy at the spectrum s peak as can be seen in fig 8 the prediction zone is a good indicator of where the wave prediction can be considered relevant with a clear error minimization in the area defined as predictable for all sea states considered in the prediction zone the error averaged on 100 runs remains below 15 even for large wave steepness and even stays below 10 up to a moderately high steepness of ε c 2 8 which compares well with the results of wu 2004 the figure also shows that the error increases with the nonlinearity of the sea states yet the propagation part of the hos nwt model is already well validated even for highly nonlinear cases hence this increase in error is probably due to an unsatisfactory implementation of the boundary condition at x 0 this assumption is supported by the observation that the error also increases with x and t in the propagation direction of the waves which is especially visible in the most energetic sea case beside the error maps a more synthetic indicator is also used averaging the previous error ε x t in the prediction zone and resulting in a single scalar error per sea state 14 ε d d x t ε x t d x d t d x t d x d t where d x t stands for the theoretical prediction zone this mean error is reported in table 2 along with the errors obtained by wu 2004 and blondel et al 2010 with the same formula 3 3 the numerical values for blondel et al 2010 were estimated from their figure 13 the results show a similar prediction quality for wu blondel and the new method presented here even the case with a wave steepness ε c 3 5 is quite satisfying considering our reconstructed velocity presents a nrms error of about 14 near the sea surface besides as our prediction method does not require any data assimilation to initialize the propagation model these results represent a significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency while providing a prediction as accurate as that obtained with other nonlinear methods the error indicators presented above are useful to compare our results with previous attempts on deterministic prediction however they lack information on the nature of this error because they do not discriminate between amplitude and phase errors yet the latter is particularly important to model predictive control for wave energy converters since it is crucial to know exactly when each wave will arrive at the device a complementary error quantity is thus proposed here the normalized cross correlation between the reference signal and the predicted one allowing to evaluate the similarity between two time series at a given x c coordinate the cross correlation factor c is expressed as a function of the time shift τ between the two signals 15 c τ 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t m a x η p r e d x c t σ p r e d η r e f x c t τ σ r e f d t where σ r e f s t d η r e f x c t m i n t t m a x is the standard deviation of η r e f in the prediction zone the same applies to σ p r e d and t m i n m a x are the bounds of the theoretical prediction zone at the specific coordinate x c considered from this cross correlation function the maximum value m a x c and its corresponding time shift t s are extracted as indicators of how well the signal is reconstructed at point x c m a x c assesses how well the shape and amplitude of the predicted signal match the reference one and t s indicates the time delay for which signals are best aligned with one another as an example two identical signals with no time shift between them will show m a x c 1 and corresponding t s 0 s for a given sea state and phase set these two quantities m a x c and t s are calculated at each point x c of the simulation domain assessing the evolution of the prediction s quality over space the calculations use data from dedicated simulations run with a refined sampling rate to identify more accurately a potential phase shift for each sea state in table 1 m a x c and t s are computed separately for 25 different phase sets then ensemble averaged allowing to present converged results the results are plotted in fig 9 as a function of a dimensionless fetch expressed as χ ε c 2 k p x this quantity adapted from trulsen and stansberg 2001 save a π multiplication factor corresponds to the propagation distance scaled by the steepness squared it allows displaying results for different sea states on the same graphs and looking for general trends assuming the important nonlinear physical processes at play scale accordingly this applies for example to nonlinear modulation or nonlinear phase velocities this fig 9 presents a comparison between linear and nonlinear prediction capabilities starting from the same information provided by the velocity boundary condition u ˆ x 0 z t the wave propagation part of the method is computed both for linear m 1 and nonlinear m 5 hos nwt simulations the objective here is to assess the influence of nonlinearities during wave propagation all procedures being strictly equivalent otherwise because the steepness associated to h s 0 48 m is small the scaled fetch is too and results for this sea state are hardly readable on fig 9 a dedicated plot would show that for this case as expected the prediction quality is very similar for linear and nonlinear simulations however this is true only for a very small steepness or equivalently short dimensionless fetch the other sea states considered highlight diverging results between linear and nonlinear predictions as the scaled fetch increases even though the cross correlation is computed in the prediction zone only the quality of linear prediction deteriorates rapidly results show a decline in amplitudes similarity as well as the appearance of a phase shift the most noticeable feature is that linear prediction fails to maintain correct phase information even after a relatively short distance and that the increase of the error is driven by the dimensionless fetch χ as the evolution of phase shift shows perfect agreement from one sea state to another discarding the influence of the different y intercepts this scaling is also relevant for the correlation factor m a x c which reaches low values for the largest scaled fetch considered here this evolution was expected as both nonlinear phase velocity effects and nonlinear amplitude modulation are known to scale with ε c 2 zakharov 1968 longuet higgins and phillips 1962 trulsen 2005 nonlinear prediction on the other hand offers a good prediction quality both in terms of correlation magnitude and of phase shift the nonlinear method shows a decrease in the correlation coefficient for short scaled fetch with increasing propagation distance it stabilizes at different values depending on the sea states the worst case level being around 0 9 for the highest steepness considered this is a far more satisfying result than their linear equivalent and a good performance in itself as will be seen shortly with fig 10 the method also proves able to deliver a reliable phase information for all cases considered the different curves do not overlap as much as for the linear predictions but their evolutions are similar and altogether the phase shift remains within less than 5 of t p the common behaviour observed for linear simulations of different sea states confirms that when nonlinearity is not taken into account the error evolves with the steepness squared the disappearance of this scaling in the nonlinear results confirms that the predominant nonlinear effects are well taken into account by the hos method as expected the remaining dispersion of the results according to the steepness considered however suggest that other sources of error should be looked for higher order nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are a first possibility the error made on the boundary condition at x 0 is also a likely candidate here as it was shown in section 3 2 that the quality of the reconstructed velocity depended on the steepness considered the very good performance of the nonlinear method in maintaining the phase information over long distances is finally illustrated in fig 10 it displays time series of η for both linear and nonlinear predictions at χ 0 5 this corresponds to the sea state with the largest steepness ε c 3 5 h s 7 82 m captured at x 6 λ p from the measurement point at x 0 the error ε d associated to this specific realization hence averaged on 1 run only is 10 8 a value slightly superior to the error averaged on 100 runs reported in table 2 and the corresponding correlation factor is 0 95 a little better than the mean value in fig 9 fig 10 highlights the difference in prediction quality between linear and nonlinear wave propagation as well as the ability of the proposed method to deliver a suitable prediction tens of seconds ahead even for highly nonlinear sea states as this improvement is mainly due to a correct calculation of the phase velocity which takes non linearities into account it would be worth investigating the performance of other methods such as weakly nonlinear wave models they could be faster than hos while retaining a correct phase velocity the choppy wave model nouguier et al 2009 would be an interesting candidate especially its improved second order formulation proposed by desmars et al 2018 which introduces corrections for the phase and group velocities accounting for some nonlinearities 4 conclusion a new deterministic wave prediction method was proposed in this article using instantaneous velocity profile measurements as input data for a wave propagation model based on a hos method this allows to model even highly nonlinear sea states accurately a feature which is non negligible in the time and space scales considered here an important aspect of the method is the reconstruction from field data of the horizontal velocity profile used as a boundary condition in the propagation model a pre processing step was developed to ensure the recovery of useable information from the type of in situ velocity measurements actually available nowadays here adcp data were judged the most suitable candidate the velocity reconstruction then the wave prediction process were evaluated numerically using uni directional synthetic sea states and assuming an ideal measurement configuration no measurement error a small distance between the instruments and a very large number of measurement points in the water column the reconstructed velocity profiles were compared to reference time series and the method proved able to provide a reliable boundary condition to the propagation model even though for the steepest wave case the quality of the reconstruction is slightly less satisfying close to the free surface the whole prediction process was then evaluated numerically we used the same test cases and error indicators as previous studies on deterministic wave prediction based on the hos method to compare our results with the state of the art our approach provided a similar prediction quality while dispensing with the step of data assimilation necessary for other methods which should greatly reduce the required computing time the interest of using a nonlinear propagation model was confirmed using cross correlation indicators to compare the amplitude and phase errors between linear and nonlinear predictions it showed evidence that for the space and time scales considered our method provides far superior results than one based on a linear propagation model presenting the evolution of error along a propagation distance scaled by the steepness squared highlighted some common behaviours for linear predictions and further quality deterioration with increasing distance or steepness can be extrapolated for these simulations on the contrary nonlinear prediction results do not scale with this parameter while retaining some variability from one steepness to another as the propagation method used is known to correctly manage the third order nonlinear effects at play with the ε c 2 scaling the remaining differences could be attributed to higher order effects in the propagation and to errors in the reconstruction of the boundary condition at x 0 generalization to any arbitrary sea state remains risky but from the available results one could expect the method to maintain satisfying phase information for any steepness considered while the amplitude and shape accuracy given by the correlation factor is likely to deteriorate with increasing steepness finally as stated above in this article the velocity reconstruction was computed assuming an ideal measurement configuration additional tests not presented here have analyzed the sensitivity of this reconstruction to measurement configuration several measurement parameters were modified such as the spacing between instruments the adcp cell size or the availability of data close to the free surface as could be expected this sensitivity study showed a loss of quality for the velocity reconstruction when numerical tests mimicked a more realistic measurement configuration however the prediction obtained from this less accurate boundary condition remained good enough to justify conducting an experimental validation of the method in the wave basin of centrale nantes the

21148,the mass source wavemaker in navier stokes equations which is a frequently used wave generation method is relatively difficult to control to resolve this problem a line shaped mass source wavemaker is proposed for generating shallow and intermediate water waves via employing reasonable simplifications only the enhanced factor which is introduced to compensate for the energy loss is unknown during the wave generation process it is derived that the enhanced factor depends on a weighted combination of wave steepness and relative water depth furthermore the velocity field inside the source region is adjusted at each time step to eliminate the undesirable downward velocity which could contaminate the result via inducing strong and persistent vortical activities near source regions with the undesirable velocity eliminated the vortical activity in the vicinity of the source region is weakened significantly compared with other mass source wavemakers the proposed method yields better results when it is used for simulating waves of large steepness compared with piston type wavemakers the proposed method yields satisfactory results when it is used for generating high order waves although it is derived under the linear theory further simulations indicate that the proposed method is competent to reproduce the process of wave structure interactions precisely keywords line shaped mass source enhanced factor shallow water intermediate water 1 introduction wave structure interactions in coastal areas attract considerable attention the aim is to achieve accurate forecast analysis and hindcast for practical problems currently various approaches are available for engineers and scholars owing to the rapid development of experimental equipment and numerical modelling wave generation is probably one of the most critical aspects in the research of coastal engineering regardless of the approach adopted there are three frequently used numerical and experimental wave generation methods moving wall boundary input and internal higuera 2015 each method has its own advantages and disadvantages most hydrodynamic laboratories use the moving wall wave generation method such as piston type or flap type wavemakers several decades ago the linear motion equation of a wave paddle was derived with the use of the potential theory this equation has since been widely employed because it is easy to understand and apply wang et al 2019a however the problem of spurious free waves barthel et al 1983 appears when the first order wave paddle signal is used to suppress the spurious free wave a full second order theory including both sub harmonics and super harmonics was proposed by schäffer 1996 subsequently numerous studies related to the second order wave generation theory have appeared schäffer and steenberg 2003 spinneken and swan 2009a 2009b yang et al 2014a 2014b furthermore the ad hoc unified wavemaker theory proposed by zhang and schäffer 2007 is recommended for both regular and irregular wave generation eldrup and andersen 2018 one of the most critical problems in the moving wall method is the minimisation of unwanted secondary reflections that occur at the wave paddle if not absorbed the secondary reflection could considerably affect the results therefore the capacity of active absorption higuera 2020 is necessary for protracted experiments schäffer and klopman 2000 or numerical modelling newman 2010 higuera et al 2013 wang et al 2019b furthermore the moving wall method is computationally costly particularly in three dimensional simulations for example we consider the widely used cfd toolbox openfoam at each time step the position of the moving boundary should be determined subsequently the position of all grid points is calculated according to the diffusive model and fluid quantities are then adjusted it should also be noted that the simulation of floating structures can become a little bit complicated when the moving wall method is employed because at least two motion solvers are required the boundary input method also called the static boundary method is a numerical technique that cannot be employed in actual facilities waves are produced at a fixed boundary at which the dirichlet type boundary conditions of different wave theories are defined for an incompressible two phase model the velocity and volume fraction should be specified on the wave generation boundary whereas the pressure field is calculated via the governing equation this method has been fully developed and is widely used in numerical simulations particularly in floating structure simulations because it can yield satisfactory results at low computational cost ransley et al 2017 however two issues exist for the boundary input method first the method is not available in lagrangian models such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model liu et al 2014 second the problem of the secondary reflection persists to minimise the effect of the secondary reflection the use of relaxation regions jacobsen et al 2012 is inevitable when the boundary input method is used it should be indicated that the relaxation method which contains relaxation regions can be used for both wave generation and wave absorption generally the relaxation region is arranged in the vicinities of computational domain boundaries in which the blending function that ranges from 0 to 1 is applied to combine the numerical and theoretical solutions in terms of wave generation the relaxation method is actually a kind of internal wave generation methods which is mostly adopted together with the boundary input method on the other hand in terms of wave absorption the relaxation method is analogous to the sponge layer method carmigniani and violeau 2018 the internal wave generation method comprises the relaxation method and the source method under the shallow water condition a source wavemaker was initially presented by larsen and dancy 1983 the wavemaker is located inside the computational domain and it functions as a pump to inject and extract water during a one wave period the greatest advantage of such a source wavemaker is that it is not influenced by reflected waves furthermore it can easily be combined with dynamic mesh this indicates that it is suitable for the simulation of floating structures the source wavemaker can be introduced to boussinesq equations wei et al 1999 mild slope equations schäﬀer and sørensen 2006 and navier stokes equations lin and liu 1999 in this paper we focus on the source wavemaker applied in navier stokes equations depending on the equation in which the source function is embedded source wavemakers can be classified into two categories mass source lin and liu 1999 and momentum source wavemakers choi and yoon 2009 compared with the former the latter is easily controlled because the only unknown parameter is the width of the source region therefore the momentum source method is fully developed and it has been used in vof ha et al 2013 cip li et al 2018 and sph liu et al 2015 models although the mass source wavemaker also has been successfully used in numerical simulations lara et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2019 the difficulty of determining the source region is persistent the distribution of the mass source region could considerably affect the result and no unified criterion is available to resolve this problem chen and hsiao 2016 proposed a distribution formula in their study the top and bottom of the source region were assumed to be fixed as per the horizontal velocity profile of a designated wave therefore only the width of the source region should be determined numerous numerical tests of various wave conditions were conducted and the formula for calculating the width of the source region was obtained via curve fitting it was demonstrated that the distribution of the mass source region is significantly related to the relative water depth of the target wave however in the formula of chen and hsiao 2016 the effect of wave height was neglected hence this method is not sufficiently precise when wave nonlinearity ratio of wave height and water depth increases perić and abdel maksoud 2015 investigated the influence of the shape and location of the source region under deep water conditions they demonstrated that the mass source expression should be modified under intermediate and deep water conditions because one of the basic assumptions proposed by lin and liu 1999 is not satisfied therefore an enhanced factor was added to the mass source to compensate for the energy loss during the wave generation process furthermore the distance between the source region and still water level was proved to have an exponential effect on the wave height and a formula was derived to describe this effect however no formula was presented for the source region distribution and a constant enhanced factor may not be appropriate for various wave conditions the mass source wavemaker performs unsatisfactorily when it is used to generate waves of large steepness the wave height generated is likely to decrease during propagation saincher and banerjee 2017 investigated this wave height reduction problem by simulating several shallow and deep water waves of different steepness from 0 004 to 0 052 in the case of deep water waves it was observed that the height reduction problem is largely attributable to free surface damping as predicted by airy theory in the case of shallow water waves it was observed that the mass source wavemaker induces strong and persistent vortical activities which in turn lead to dissipation of source injected momentum to address the issues of the mass source wavemaker an in depth investigation based on the remarkable achievements mentioned above is conducted to retain only one unknown parameter to be determined after a reasonable simplification a line shaped source region is adopted as per the recommendation of lin and liu 1999 this recommendation is that the width of the source region should be less than 5 of the wavelength with the use of the line shaped source region the only unknown parameter is an enhanced factor whose value depends on the weighted combination of wave steepness and relative water depth the formula for calculating the enhanced factor is obtained by curve fitting evidently the effect of wave height is considered making the enhanced factor mutable for different waves therefore this is a combination of the ideas of chen and hsiao 2016 and perić and abdel maksoud 2015 furthermore under relaxation is introduced to the cells inside the source region to adjust the velocity field moderately it is demonstrated that the vortical activity reported by saincher and banerjee 2017 is significantly weakened the structure of the paper is as follows in section 1 the background is introduced as well as the motivation for writing this paper in section 2 the numerical model is elaborated followed by a detailed description of the mass source wavemaker proposed in the present paper in section 3 the numerical model is validated and the discussion on the velocity adjustment inside the source region is conducted in section 4 the formula for calculating the enhanced factor is obtained by curve fitting in section 5 the comparison between the present method and other published methods is presented in section 6 two cases of wave structure interactions are calculated and satisfactory results are observed in section 7 the conclusion of the study is summarised 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model in the case of two phase incompressible flow the mass conservation equation is 1 u i x i 0 o u t s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n s t i n s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n where u i is the mean component of the velocity the cartesian coordinates are denoted by x i t represents time the expression of the mass source s t will be discussed in section 2 2 the momentum equation is 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j p x i g j x j ρ x i x j 2 μ s i j σ κ α x i w d where ρ is the density field of air or water g j is the gravitational acceleration p p ρ g j x j is the hydrodynamic pressure only if the still water level is located at x k 0 μ is the dynamic viscosity s ij is the mean strain rate tensor it should be noted that turbulence viscosity is not considered in eq 2 because the simulation in the present study is performed under the laminar condition the source term of wave damping is denoted by wd perić and abdel maksoud 2018 3 w d γ b x u i where γ is the forcing strength which is calculated according to perić and abdel maksoud 2018 to obtain a minimum reflection coefficient and its value varies from 6 to 10 in the present study b x is the blending function which is only valid inside the wave damping region 4 b x e x x s x e x s 2 1 e 1 where x s and x e are the start and end of the wave damping region respectively in eq 2 σ is the coefficient of the surface tensor κ is the curve of the interface α represents the volume fraction which is defined in the vof scheme hirt and nichols 1981 the vof equation is 5 α t α u i x i x i α 1 α u i r γ b x α r e f α o u t s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n α s t γ b x α r e f α i n s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n where u i r is the relative velocity used for interface compression the source term γb x α ref α is used for wave absorption and its value equals zero outside the wave damping region because b x equals zero α ref is the target value of the α field whose value is constantly equal to the α field at the initial time step adding this term to the vof equation alleviates the mass conservation problem caused by eq 3 and the mass source wavemaker the source term α s t is added because the velocity field is not divergence free owing to the local mass source term despite the addition of this source term undesirable values of the volume fraction may occur in fluid injection and extraction for the cell in the vicinity of the source region the α value becomes slightly greater or smaller than 1 0 this is numerically logical but physically illogical because in the vof scheme the maximum value of the volume fraction is assumed to be 1 0 and the α value of all the cells beneath the free surface should be 1 0 the unwanted volume fraction value corrupts the result particularly in the source region vicinity therefore the volume fraction value of each cell is moderately modified at the end of each time step as follows 6 α i c 0 α i c 1 α 0 where i represents the i th cell and α 0 is the target value 1 0 under the assumption that the mass source is always located beneath the free surface whereas c 0 and c 1 are weights calculated by 7 c 0 α i α 0 α i and 8 c 1 1 c 0 it should be noted that eq 6 is valid only for cells with α i α 0 0 001 or cells located inside the mass source region the threshold is set to 0 001 to minimise the effect on cells located in the other part of the computational domain moreover eq 6 is adopted at the end of each time step this ensures that the threshold is not overly small because the source term in eq 5 has a finite contribution per time step 2 2 mass source wavemaker 2 2 1 derivation according to lin and liu 1999 there are two critical assumptions in the derivation i the width of the source region should be significantly smaller than the target wavelength ii the mass increase or decrease introduced by the source function contributes to the generation of the target wave entirely the first assumption indicates that the free surface directly above the source region responds immediately to the mass change induced by the source the second assumption implies that there is no energy loss during wave generation let us consider the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system of which the origin of the z axis is at the still water level according to the theory of airy wave the horizontal and vertical velocity components are 9 u h x z t k g h 2 ω cosh k d z cosh k d cos k x ω t 10 u v x z t k g h 2 ω sinh k d z cosh k d sin k x ω t the wave height and wave period are denoted by h and t respectively l and k are the wavelength and wave number respectively ω is the circular frequency d is the water depth under the shallow water condition kd 1 we have 11 cosh k d 1 and 12 sinh k d z cosh k d k d z with the use of eqs 11 and 12 eqs 9 and 10 can be rewritten as 13 u h x t k g h 2 ω cos k x ω t and 14 u v x z t k g h 2 ω k d 1 z d sin k x ω t from eq 13 it is observed that the horizontal velocity is uniform along the water depth direction compared with eq 13 eq 14 is negligible because kd 1 therefore under the two previously mentioned assumptions the mass flux of the mass source is 15 ω s t d x d z 2 d u h x t 2 k g d ω η x t where ω is the source region η x t is the time history of the free surface displacement of linear monochromatic waves the factor 2 implies there are two waves travelling oppositely along the horizontal direction moreover the shallow water dispersion relationship is 16 ω 2 g k tanh k d g k 2 d on substituting eq 16 into eq 15 the general expression of the mass source can be obtained 17 ω s t d x d z 2 ω k η x t 2 c η x t where c is the phase velocity eq 17 is the most widely accepted expression of the mass source wavemaker from which it can be concluded that a target wave could be generated once the phase velocity and surface elevation are known at each time step it should be noted that the effect of wave height is ignored in eq 15 therefore it is clear that the mass source wavemaker is first order and only the linear shallow water wave is its theoretical solution however it is widely accepted that the mass source wavemaker can also be used to approximately generate intermediate water waves as long as the approaches for calculating both the surface elevation and phase velocity are adjusted as per the corresponding wave theory chen and hsiao 2016 saincher and banerjee 2017 therefore generating shallow and intermediate water waves of small amplitudes can be respectively defined as the basic and extended applications of the mass source wavemaker furthermore using a high order wave theory to calculate the phase velocity and surface elevation is preferable when the nonlinearity of the target wave is relatively strong lin and liu 1999 the use of the high order wave theory is equivalent to giving an evolution solution to the internal boundary the word evolution means that an approximate solution instead of an analytical solution is passed to the wavemaker and this solution evolves towards the expected wave solution as the wave propagates for shallow water waves wave nonlinearity h d can be used for estimating the difficulty in wave generation for intermediate water waves wave steepness h l can be used for estimating the difficulty in wave generation however when the target wave is the deep water wave eq 17 becomes inappropriate because the velocity distributions of shallow and deep water waves differ considerably the difference cannot be overcome even though the high order wave theory is adopted which is unlike the cases of generating intermediate water waves this is the reason why the mass source wavemaker always suffers from unsuccessful wave generation under the deep water condition however most waves no matter in laboratories or actual coastal regions are shallow or intermediate water waves therefore the focus of the present study is on accurate wave generation under shallow and intermediate water conditions for deep water waves readers may refer to the study of perić and abdel maksoud 2015 2 2 2 source region distribution according to eq 17 if the mass source is spatially uniform inside ω its expression is 18 s t 2 c η t a s where a s is the area of the source region the horizontal position of the mass source is supposed to be at x 0 for a linear monochromatic wave η t and c are expressed as 19 η t h 2 cos ω t and 20 c l t fig 1 shows point shaped and line shaped mass source regions for a point shaped mass source region three parameters should be determined the distance between the upper surface of the source region and still water level h t as well as the height and width of the source region h s and w s respectively the most difficult aspect of defining the point shaped mass source region is determining the value of h t which has an exponential effect on the wave height generated perić and abdel maksoud 2015 to overcome the difficulty in determining the source region a line shaped mass source is proposed if a line shaped region is used h t can be linked with d as follows 21 d h s h t h s n h where h t is scaled by the target wave height and n is a non dimensional coefficient whose value is to be determined the width of the source region w s is scaled by the wavelength according to lin and liu 1999 the width of the mass source region should be significantly smaller than the wavelength and a significant error can be observed when w s 0 05l therefore a medium value of w s 0 02l is selected for monochromatic wave generation with all the above formulae eq 18 can be rewritten as 22 s t l h 0 02 l d n h t cos ω t evidently for a designated wave the only remaining variable is n which represents the number of wave heights in the distance between the top surface of the source region and still water level if a new variable θ n is introduced as 23 θ n l h 0 02 l d n h t then eq 22 can be clearly expressed as 24 s t θ n cos ω t eq 24 is similar to eq 19 the amplitude and fluctuation parts are represented by θ n and the trigonometric factor respectively a new problem that arises is determining the appropriate value of n under various wave conditions first eq 23 should be rewritten as 25 θ n h d 0 02 1 n h d t where l is eliminated and both the numerator and denominator are divided by d for a designated wave the nonlinearity ε is the ratio of wave height and water depth expressed as 26 ε h d on substituting eq 26 into eq 25 the final expression of the amplitude part is obtained as 27 θ n ε 0 02 t 1 n ε f 0 02 ε 1 n ε where f is the frequency of the target wave according to eq 27 it can be concluded that the amplitude part of a mass source can be divided into two parts the first is dependent on the target wave frequency and the ratio of w s and l 0 02 in this study the other is dependent on wave nonlinearity and the distance between the top of the mass source region and still water level i e ε and n respectively these four variables are inter independent except for ε and n therefore their relationship should be investigated to obtain the appropriate value of n the basic relationship is expressed as 28 1 n ε 0 the left hand side of eq 28 represents the non dimensional source region height scaled by the water depth however according to lin and liu 1999 a more stringent condition should be adopted that is the maximum distance between the top of the mass source region and still water level should be less than half of the water depth that is 29 1 n ε 0 5 the minimum value of n is set as 1 0 to ensure that the source region always remains beneath the free surface even with the occurrence of standing waves finally the range of the coefficient value is 30 1 n 1 2 ε eq 30 indicates that for a designated wave the only unknown variable n is restrained by ε that is a stronger nonlinearity yields a smaller value range of n fig 2 shows the value of the second item in eq 27 as a function of n it can be seen that θ n increases as n becomes larger this tendency becomes intense for waves with a strong nonlinearity ε 0 1 however a larger n indicates a longer distance between the upper surface of the source region and still water level leading to a smaller wave height generated perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the interaction of these two opposite effects may somehow explain why nonlinear waves are not easily generated by mass source wavemakers therefore it is difficult to determine an appropriate value of n so that all the requirements under different wave conditions may be met a novel approach is proposed to resolve this problem in this method a constant value of n is used and an enhanced factor is accordingly introduced into eq 27 a similar wave height compensation factor was also used by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 for deep water wave generation to compensate for undesirable energy loss as shown in fig 2 n 1 5 is selected to match various waves particularly those with a strong nonlinearity that is ε 0 3 with the introduction of the enhanced factor f c eq 27 can be rewritten as 31 θ f 0 02 ε 1 1 5 ε f c the final expression of the line shaped mass source wavemaker is 32 s t 2 c η t a s f c although eq 32 is identical to the expression proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the approaches for calculating f c are different for linear shallow water waves the value of f c is close to 1 0 when the values of wave nonlinearity or wave steepness are large the value of f c required increases details on the calculation of f c are presented in section 4 2 2 3 velocity adjustment inside the source region according to the study of saincher and banerjee 2017 the vortex in the vicinity of the source region significantly affects the wave generation the reason why the vortex appears can be elaborated as follows in the wave generation process the downward velocity injected flows out from the lower surface of the source region in terms of point shaped source regions if the target wave height is relatively large the downward velocity accumulates and finally hits against the bottom of the computational domain in the process of which the vortex is formed when the line shaped mass source region is used the effect of the downward velocity is noticeable even though the target wave height is relatively small this is because the downward velocity cannot be released from the lower surface of the source region it directly hits against the bottom of the computational domain to minimise the effect of the vortex near the source region the downward velocity needs to be adjusted along the water depth direction therefore a relaxation function is introduced to adjust the velocity field inside the source region mildly in other words after the solving process of each time step the velocity field inside the source region is multiplied by the relaxation function the expression of the relaxation function is 33 r z 1 z s z z t sin λ π 2 z z e z s z e z e z z s it should be noted the relaxation function is only valid inside the source region in eq 33 z s and z e represent the z directional coordinates of the start and end of the adjustment region respectively z t is the z directional coordinate of the upper surface of the source region λ is the shape factor the values of z t and z e can be directly obtained 34 z t h t n h 1 5 h z e d furthermore an additional factor f s is used to calculate the value of z s 35 z s f s h s z e f s z t z e z e where f s represents the non dimensional height of the adjustment region and its value is in the range of 0 1 if the value of f s equals 1 0 the adjustment starts from the upper surface of the source region if the value of f s equals 0 there is no adjustment during the simulation as shown in section 3 the proposed values of f s and λ are 1 0 and 0 1 respectively 3 validation 3 1 sensitivity to grid size the sensitivity of the numerical model to the grid size is investigated in this section an intermediate water wave is adopted for the simulation and the wave properties are listed in table 1 from the table it is clear that the values of the nonlinearity and steepness of the target wave are relatively large therefore the value of f c should be greater than 1 0 to determine the appropriate f c value several f c values are tried and it is found that the result calculated with f c 1 2 matches the theoretical result therefore the value of f c is set as 1 2 the layout of the two dimensional computational domain is presented in fig 3 the length of the computational domain is 7 5l the work length is set as 3 5l to achieve a balance between cost and efficiency sponge layers are placed on both sides of the computational domain with a length of 2 0l according to the study of chen and hsiao 2016 the distance between the source region and the left sponge layer is set as 0 5l four wave gauges wgs are used for measuring the surface elevation the wgs are placed along the wave direction spaced 1 0l apart the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 is adopted for updating the surface elevation and phase velocity at each time step the time step is automatically adjusted based on the maximum courant number whose value is 0 25 and the total simulation time is 20t as listed in table 2 three mesh refinement levels are considered the grids in the vicinities of the source region and free surface are simultaneously refined furthermore as proposed by larsen et al 2019 a diffusion balance should be achieved to resolve the problem of wave decay during propagation therefore the upwind scheme is adopted for calculating the convection of momentum and the crank nicolson cn scheme is adopted for calculating the time derivative the weight of the cn scheme is set as 0 3 larsen et al 2019 the outer loop of the pimple algorithm is set as 1 0 which makes the piso algorithm adopted the velocity adjustment is not performed during the simulation the calculated result is exhibited in fig 4 the horizontal axis represents the non dimensional time which is normalised by the wave period the vertical axis represents the non dimensional surface elevation which is normalised by the wave amplitude a from the figure it is evident that the result is convergent when the medium mesh is used it can be observed that the wave amplitude measured above the source region is larger than the target wave amplitude this is logical because the value of f c adopted is greater than 1 0 however at the position of wg 2 the agreement between the calculated and theoretical signals is unsatisfactory after the moment of t t 6 likewise the agreement at the position of wg 3 is unsatisfactory the reason for the mismatch between the calculated and theoretical signals is that the velocity adjustment is not performed during the simulation 3 2 factors of velocity adjustment in this section the proposed values of f s and λ are obtained and the necessity of introducing the velocity adjustment is stressed fig 5 displays the distribution of the relaxation function along the water depth direction in which several different f s and λ are considered the horizontal axis represents the value of the relaxation function and the vertical axis represents the non dimensional z directional coordinate from the figure it can be deduced that if the value of f s is close to 1 0 the value of λ should be small otherwise the velocity field inside the source region would be overly adjusted on the other hand if the value of f s is relatively small the value of λ should be large to eliminate the undesirable velocity completely therefore two combinations of f s and λ are considered i f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 ii f s 0 5 and λ 2 0 the case adopted in section 3 1 is recalculated with the use of the refined mesh and the velocity adjustment is performed at each time step the result is presented in fig 6 from the figure it is observed that the three calculated signals coincide at the position of wg 1 no matter whether the velocity adjustment is performed or not at the position of wg 2 the signals calculated with the velocity adjustment are in agreement with the theoretical signal while the signal calculated without the velocity adjustment is not at the position of wg 3 the agreement between the calculated and theoretical signals is not perfect the amplitude of the signal calculated with the velocity adjustment is larger than the theoretical amplitude in contrast the amplitude of the signal calculated without the velocity adjustment is smaller than the theoretical amplitude at the position of wg 4 all of the three calculated signals are in agreement with the theoretical signal to provide a quantitative description of the numerical result the relative error re is introduced 36 r e φ i φ i φ 0 φ 0 100 where φ i is the mean wave height or mean wave period calculated by the data within the time range of 10t 20t at the i th wg and φ 0 is the target value furthermore the normalised root mean square rms error chen and hsiao 2016 is adopted to reflect the overall discrepancy between the numerical and theoretical surface elevations 37 r m s 1 h i 1 n η t i η n i 2 n 100 where η t i and η n i represent theoretical and numerical surface elevation data respectively n is the total number of the data point of the surface elevations within the time range of 10t 20t the values of the relative error for the mean wave height and mean wave period as well as the rms values are presented in fig 7 from the figure it can be observed that the relative error calculated using the mean wave period is significantly smaller than that calculated using the mean wave height therefore our focus is on the relative error calculated by the mean wave height at the position of wg 2 the value of re h 2 becomes smaller with the introduction of the velocity adjustment and the relevant rms value decreases to less than 5 which is acceptable for engineering problems at the position of wg 3 the value of re h 3 calculated without the velocity adjustment is close to 0 which is smaller than the other two re h 3 values calculated with the velocity adjustment however for the case without the velocity adjustment the mean wave height decreases considerably from 7 2 to 0 4 in terms of the relative error as the wave travels from wg 2 to wg 3 therefore it can be deduced that the velocity field has been disturbed as a result of the vortex generated in the vicinity of the source region saincher and banerjee 2017 to prove this a velocity probe is used for sampling the velocity field in the vicinity of the source region the horizontal distance between the probe and the source region is 0 5l and the vertical distance between the probe and the bottom of the computational domain is 0 125d the comparison between the calculated and theoretical velocity curves is presented in fig 8 the horizontal axis represents the non dimensional time and the vertical axis represents the non dimensional velocity as shown in fig 8 the velocity field is significantly contaminated by the undesirable velocity when the velocity adjustment is off in contrast with the introduction of the velocity adjustment both the horizontal and vertical velocities match the theoretical velocities to highlight the effect of the velocity adjustment the vorticity field which is the curl of the velocity field in the vicinity of the source region is presented in fig 9 the left part of fig 9 is the result calculated with the velocity adjustment in which the first parameter combination f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 is adopted and the right part of fig 9 is the result calculated without the velocity adjustment obviously at t 2t the two results are analogous the magnitude of the vorticity field is relatively small however as time proceeds strong vorticity activities can be observed in the result calculated without the velocity adjustment while the vorticity field in the result calculated with the velocity adjustment is almost unchanged it is demonstrated that the strong vorticity activity is induced by the undesirable velocity which hits against the bottom of the computational domain furthermore the use of the velocity adjustment can also decrease the simulation time in our simulation the case of the refined mesh is run in parallel modes with the computational domain being decomposed into 6 subdomains when the velocity adjustment is adopted the total simulation time is 4409 and 4980 s with the use of the first and second parameter combinations respectively if the velocity adjustment is blocked the total simulation time is 5869 s that is the introduction of the velocity adjustment shortens the simulation time by 30 approximately the reason for the reduction in the total simulation time can be elaborated as follows with the undesirable downward velocity inside the source region eliminated the velocity gradient in the vicinity of the source region bottom is diminished considerably therefore the time step span can be relatively large as per the maximum courant number rule as a result the total simulation time is shortened significantly the analysis above demonstrates that the velocity adjustment is necessary for a line shaped mass source wavemaker now the final problem is the selection of the parameter combination although it is observed that the two combinations of f s and λ yield a similar result the first combination f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 is selected for the subsequent simulation this is because the use of the first parameter combination yields smaller relative error for the mean wave height as well as smaller rms error fig 9 furthermore the simulation time is shorter when the first parameter combination is used 4 enhanced factor 4 1 intermediate water waves the use of curve fitting requires a certain number of samples therefore several numerical experiments are conducted in which intermediate water waves of different steepness are considered the properties of the target wave condition as well as the grid size are listed in table 3 the computational domain is identical to the one presented in fig 3 the total simulation time is 20t and the other numerical settings remain unchanged from those listed in section 3 1 the water depth is 0 4 m and the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 is adopted the wave period varies from 0 75 to 3 0 s which makes the d l vary from 0 069 to 0 46 the wave height varies from 0 01 to 0 12 m which makes the ε vary from 0 025 to 0 3 as proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the wave whose steepness is larger than 0 056 is difficult to be generated by the mass source wavemaker therefore the wave with h l 0 056 is not considered in the present study finally the h l adopted varies from 0 003 to 0 055 in table 3 the appropriate f c values are also presented for a given wave several f c values are attempted and the one that can yield a satisfactory result is selected as the appropriate value furthermore according to table 3 two basic rules can be concluded first d l has a major effect on f c the value of f c is close to 1 0 if d l is small while the value of f c increases significantly as the increase of d l second for a designated d l the effect of the wave height increases considerably when ε 0 05 if ε 0 05 the effect of the wave height is so limited that it may even be ignored before curve fitting there still remains the issue of finding an independent variable θ to take the effect of wave height water depth and wave period into account simultaneously a linear combination of wave steepness and relative water depth is used as the independent variable of curve fitting 38 θ β ξ h l 1 β d l where β is a weighted factor whose value is between 0 and 1 ξ is a scaling factor for scaling h l to the same order of magnitude as that of d l this is necessary because h l is generally considerably smaller than d l for most waves if no scaling is performed the effect of h l may be submerged by d l the value of ξ will be discussed later eq 38 can be rewritten as 39 θ β ξ h d 1 β d l 1 1 ξ ε β d l then if we treat d l as a variable the following expression can be obtained 40 θ d l 1 1 ξ ε β it is evident that under the conditions of 0 ε 0 3 0 β 1 0 and ξ 1 the expression in eq 40 is always positive as eq 39 is monotone θ increases with d l which is in accordance with the expected tendency described by the first aforementioned rule we now consider the value of ξ the proposed range is 1 0 3 33 because ε is the ratio of h l and d l and the largest ε value of the target wave is 0 3 in the present study if ξ 3 3 ξh l will be larger than d l for the strong nonlinear wave with ε 0 3 opposing the first aforementioned rule therefore the value of ξ is calculated as 41 ξ exp 4 ε with the use of eq 41 the range of ξ is 1 0 3 32 furthermore ξ will increase considerably when ε increases which is in accordance with the second aforementioned rule the only unknown variable is now the weighted factor β for intermediate water waves the value of d l is less than 0 5 if d l is selected as the weighted factor the weighted factor of ξh l is always smaller than that of d l in other words d l has a major effect on the calculation of θ which is in accordance with the first aforementioned rule therefore d l is selected as the weighted factor 42 θ d l ξ h l 1 d l d l or 43 θ 1 1 ξ ε β d l 1 1 ξ ε d l d l on recalculating the derivative of eq 43 we obtain 44 θ d l 1 2 1 ξ ε d l for intermediate water waves d l is smaller than 0 5 thus ensuring that eq 44 is always positive therefore θ increases monotonically with d l moreover a similar tendency can be observed with respect to h l or ε with the use of curve fitting the relationship of θ and f c is obtained eq 45 fig 10 shows the appropriate f c values as well as the values calculated using eq 45 it is evident that the independent variable θ can perfectly link wave properties to f c values a larger θ corresponds to a larger f c as expected the largest value of f c is 1 97 for intermediate water waves with a relatively strong nonlinearity case m3 if θ increases to the limit between intermediate water and deep water conditions for example d l 0 5 f c will also increase considerably this tendency is consistent with the result of perić and abdel maksoud 2015 where a constant f c value of 4 7 was proposed for point shaped mass source wave generation under deep water conditions 45 f c θ 183 88 θ 3 63 26 θ 2 7 58 θ 0 72 fig 11 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the cases of different θ the measurement point is placed three wavelengths downstream the wavemaker the value of θ varies from 0 065 to 0 28 and the value of f c varies from 1 0 to 1 97 the nonlinearity varies from 0 05 to 0 3 the overall agreement between the theoretical and numerical signals is acceptable and hardly changes as the variety of wave properties the data within the time range of 10t 20t is used for calculating the relative error and rms error and the calculated values are shown in fig 12 compared to the mean wave height the mean wave period has considerably smaller re values therefore our focus is on the re values calculated using the mean wave height as well as the rms values at the position of wg 1 the re value is close to or even less than 0 when θ 0 15 whereas it increases considerably when θ 0 22 similarly the rms value is less than 5 when θ 0 2 while it exceeds 5 significantly when θ 0 22 regarding the wave height measured at wgs 2 4 it is evident that practically all re and rms values are less than 5 0 which is acceptable in engineering problems finally the characteristics of wave generation and propagation could be concluded as follows for intermediate water waves with small d l the mean wave height measured above the source region is close to or even smaller than the target value and the wave height is stable in the process of wave propagation for intermediate water waves with large d l the mean wave height measured above the source region is considerably larger than the target value and the wave height decreases to the target value in the process of wave propagation 4 2 shallow water waves generating shallow water waves by a mass source wavemaker is relatively easy because the mass source wavemaker is derived under the shallow water condition two shallow water wave theories are considered the first is the fifth order cnoidal theory proposed by fenton 1979 however the original theory proposed in 1979 is complicated and performs poorly for higher waves therefore in a later work fenton 1990 the original theory was improved the theory was simplified and the result calculated was accurate for longer and higher waves the second theory considered is the ninth order solitary theory presented by fenton 1972 for solitary waves the mass source distribution is slightly different from that of periodic waves according to liu et al 2006 the characteristic length l 99 of a solitary wave is adopted for calculating the source region width 46 l 99 4 d 3 3 h ln 1 0 99 1 0 99 furthermore it should be noted that for solitary wave generation n is set as 1 0 this is because i the profile of a solitary wave is located above the still water level and there are no standing waves ii solitary waves with a strong nonlinearity of ε 0 5 are expected to be generated this makes n 1 5 inappropriate according to fig 2 the other settings are identical to those for periodic waves tables 4 and 5 list the cnoidal and solitary wave conditions used in this section respectively the computational domain is identical to the one presented in fig 3 and the numerical settings are unchanged from those listed in section 4 1 fig 13 presents the re and rms values calculated with the cnoidal wave conditions the result is acceptable because most of the re values are in the range of 5 5 furthermore in table 4 it is observed that all of the appropriated f c values are equal to 1 0 therefore the process of curve fitting is no longer needed finally eq 45 can be rewritten as 47 f c θ 183 88 θ 3 63 26 θ 2 7 58 θ 0 72 θ 0 07 1 0 θ 0 07 fig 14 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the cnoidal wave cases the measurement point is placed three wavelengths downstream the wavemaker the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is relatively good however high order harmonics can be observed for the wave of strong nonlinearity because the high order wave theory has already been used it can be deduced that the reason for the appearance of the high order harmonics is that the mass source wavemaker is derived under the linear theory in the case of solitary waves the appropriate f c values are listed in table 5 it is evident that the tendency of f c to increase is not significant this is logical because solitary waves are derived under shallow water conditions therefore curve fitting is no longer required for estimating f c in fact the proposed method combined with an enhanced factor whose value is 1 0 is sufficient to generate the target solitary wave with acceptable accuracy and only a slight adjustment is required if necessary fig 15 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the solitary wave cases when the wave nonlinearity is weak ε 0 2 the wave amplitude is stable as the solitary wave propagates when the wave nonlinearity is strong the wave amplitude measured above the source region wg 1 is smaller than the target amplitude however the wave amplitude increases to the target value as the solitary wave propagates furthermore when ε 0 2 an obvious coda wave is observed at the position of wg 2 and it becomes more evident as ε increases however the coda wave decreases as the solitary wave propagates at the position of wg 4 the coda wave practically vanishes and only the accurate wave profile remains as in section 2 2 1 these phenomena appear because the nonlinearity of the target wave is strong which makes the difference between the target wave and the analytical wave solution linear shallow water waves non negligible with the use of the high order wave theory the wave profile is observed to evolve towards the target wave profile during the process of propagation this evolution phenomenon was also observed by wu and hsiao 2018 4 3 application scope the application scope of the proposed wavemaker is summarised in fig 16 in which the red solid points indicate the wave conditions concerned in the present study the kd value of 0 314 is the divide between the shallow and intermediate water conditions while the kd value of 3 144 is the divide between the intermediate and deep water conditions in fig 16 the limit of the proposed mass source wavemaker h d 0 3 and h l 0 056 is displayed as well as the wave conditions concerned in the present study it is evident that for the wave whose kd is less than 1 1 approximately the limit of h d 0 3 is primary while for the wave whose kd is greater than 1 1 approximately the limit of h l 0 056 is primary 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with published mass source wavemakers in this section a comparison between the present mass source wavemaker and two previously published mass source wavemakers is made the first is the original mass source wavemaker proposed by lin and liu 1999 the second is the updated mass source wavemaker proposed more recently by chen and hsiao 2016 in the first method only the optimal design rules of the source region were proposed i the width of source region should be less than 5 l ii the height of the source region should be in the range of 0 2d to 0 25d iii the distance between the centre of the source region and still water level should be in the range of 0 33d to 0 5d in the second method the positions of the top and bottom of the source region are calculated according to the normalised horizontal velocity profile the width of the source region is calculated using a formula derived by curve fitting in which kd is used as the independent variable the two waves considered in the study of lin and liu 1999 are adopted for the simulation the two waves share the same water depth of 0 2 m and the same wave period of 1 0 s the wave heights are 0 04 m and 0 06 m for the first and second waves respectively according to the linear theory the wavelength is 1 21 m it can be calculated that these two waves are intermediate water waves with strong nonlinearities of 0 2 and 0 3 respectively it is evident that using a mass source wavemaker to generate them is difficult because they are far from the optimal condition shallow water waves with weak nonlinearity as in lin and liu 1999 the first wave is generated according to the second order stokes theory silva et al 2018 whereas the second wave is generated according to the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 the detailed size of the mass source region for each method is listed in table 6 as in section 2 2 3 z t and z e are the z directional coordinate values of the top and bottom of the source region assuming that the zero position is at the still water level in the method of lin and liu 1999 no exact rules are proposed for source region determination therefore we could only set the mass source region according to the optimal design rules mentioned above in fact in this method several trials are required before a satisfactory result may be obtained and this is quite complicated in the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the effect of wave height is neglected therefore the mass source region is constant although ε becomes stronger the h l values of the two target waves are 0 0331 and 0 0496 respectively furthermore the f c values are 1 06 1 054 calculated by eq 47 and 1 08 1 075 calculated by eq 47 for the wave conditions corresponding to h 0 04 m and h 0 06 m respectively the layout of the computational domain is identical to the one listed in fig 3 all the cases share a constant spatial resolution in the vicinities of the free surface and mass source region the x and z directional grid size is 0 006 m and 0 002 m respectively the time step is automatically adjusted based on the maximum courant number whose value is 0 25 the total simulation time is 20t fig 17 shows the comparison of the simulation results for h 0 04 m at the position of wg 1 the amplitude calculated via the present method is smaller than the target amplitude in contrast the amplitudes calculated via the other two methods are larger than the target amplitude it can be observed that harmonics appear in the signal calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the reason for the appearance of the harmonics is that the source region is too wide which makes the velocity field inside the source region asymmetric after several wave periods at the position of wg 2 the values calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 are smaller than the target values at the wave trough the result calculated via the present method matches the result calculated via the method of lin and liu 1999 at the positions of wg 3 and wg 4 an analogous phenomenon can be observed in summary the three methods perform similarly and the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is acceptable fig 18 shows the comparison of the simulation results for h 0 06 m obviously the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is not as good as that in fig 17 among the three methods the proposed method could yield the best result at the position of wg 1 the results calculated via the two published methods deviate from the theoretical result significantly for the result calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the harmonics become more evident than those observed in fig 17 for the result calculated via the method of lin and liu 1999 it can be observed that the signal is severely affected by the undesirable velocity in contrast the signal calculated via the present method matches well with the theoretical signal at the position of wg 2 for the results calculated via the two previously published methods the wave profile is uplifted and the wave crest becomes sharper as the wave propagates the disturbance still exists and therefore the results are not as satisfactory as expected in contrast the present method performs better it is demonstrated that the velocity adjustment used in the present method is effective in weakening the effect of the undesirable velocity 5 2 comparison with moving wall wavemakers in this section the present line shaped mass source wavemaker is compared with the moving wall wavemaker two moving wall wavemakers are considered the first is the second order piston type wavemaker proposed by schäffer 1996 the second is the ad hoc unified piston type wavemaker proposed by zhang and schäffer 2007 the wave adopted is selected from the study of schäffer 1996 the water depth is 0 7 m the wave height and wave period are 0 14 m and 3 0 s respectively the fifth order stokes wave theory is used for updating the phase velocity and surface elevation the layout of the computational domain is identical to the experiment proposed by schäffer 1996 four wgs are used for capturing the surface elevation the distances between the four wgs and wavemaker are 1 0 4 0 4 4 and 8 7 m respectively the value of f c is 1 06 and the total simulation time is 10t the other numerical settings are unchanged from those listed in the previous sections the comparison of the numerical experimental and theoretical results is presented in fig 19 the experimental data used is extracted from fig 9 of the study of schäffer 1996 and the theoretical signal is calculated via the stream function wave theory fenton 1999 to make the figure clear the theoretical curve is drawn without phase adjustment from the figure it is observed that the numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical result furthermore the experimental wave amplitude is slightly smaller than the theoretical value this is logical because the experimental facility has friction loss at the position of wave crests the signal calculated via the mass source wavemaker is in agreement with the second order wavemaker signal at the position of wave troughs the signal calculated via the mass source wavemaker is in agreement with the ad hoc wavemaker signal at x 8 7 m compared with the wave profiles calculated via the piston type wavemakers the wave profile calculated via the mass source wavemaker is sharper at the wave crest and flatter at the wave trough it is demonstrated that the proposed mass source wavemaker can be used for generating nonlinear intermediate water waves relatively precisely although it is derived under the condition of linear shallow water waves 6 application 6 1 interaction between monochromatic waves and submerged breakwater the experiment conducted by ning et al 2016 in which the wave structure interaction of monochromatic waves and a submerged breakwater was studied is reproduced in this section a rectangular submerged breakwater is adopted in the present simulation the height and width of the submerged breakwater are 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively the water depth is 0 6 m the wave height and period are 0 076 m and 2 0 s respectively the layout of the computational domain is shown in fig 20 the total length of the computational domain is 32 7 m that is 7 5l two sponge layers are placed on both sides of the numerical flume to absorb reflected waves the distance between the seaside wall of the breakwater and the source region is 8 72 m the positions of the five wgs from x 1 to x 5 are 16 37 17 37 19 87 22 37 and 23 37 m respectively the distribution of the mass source region follows the rule obtained in the previous section using eq 44 the obtained f c value is 1 04 the total simulation time is 25 0t the other settings are identical to those discussed in the previous sections a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is shown in fig 21 the horizontal and vertical axes represent the non dimensional time and non dimensional surface elevation respectively fig 21 shows that the numerical results agree well with the experimental results as expected standard periodic wave signals can be observed at the positions of wg 1 and wg 2 these two signals are the combination of incident and reflected waves and their amplitudes are different because the distances between them and the structures differ at the position of wg 3 wave shape changes are observed as a result of the shoaling effect flatter wave troughs are observed and wave skewness occurs this indicates that the nonlinear effect becomes significant as water depth decreases ning et al 2016 at the positions of wg 4 and wg 5 distinct high order harmonics and deformations are observed that is when water depth increases abruptly high order harmonic waves that are mainly generated by the nonlinear wave wave interactions over the submerged breakwater are released as free waves on the leeside evidently all the typical features of the interaction between monochromatic waves and a submerged breakwater presented by ning et al 2016 are well captured by the present numerical model 6 2 interaction between solitary wave and thin submerged breakwater wu et al 2012 presented an experiment in which the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged vertical thin barrier is investigated in a recent study jaf and wang 2015 derived a theoretical solution to predict the reflected and transmitted wave surfaces during the interaction between a solitary wave and a vertical thin submerged breakwater in this subsection the results obtained by the experiment and the theoretical solution are compared with numerical results the layout of the numerical wave flume is shown in fig 22 the length of the computational domain is 8 5l 99 a sponge layers is placed on the left side of the numerical wave flume a thin plate whose height and width are 0 1 and 0 02 m respectively is placed 5 0l 99 from the mass source region the left bottom of the plate is located at x 9 08 m three wgs are used to capture the reflected and transmitted waves as in the setup of the experiment wg 1 is placed 0 657 m upstream the thin plate whereas wg 3 is placed 0 357 m downstream the thin plate wg 2 is placed immediately above the plate x 9 09 m the water depth is 0 14 m and the wave height is 0 07 m the total simulation time is set to 8 0 s according to the aforementioned conclusion the value of f c is initially set as 1 02 the theoretical solution by jaf and wang 2015 was presented in non dimensional form therefore all the variables in the present study should first be normalised for example time should be normalised by multiplying it with g d 0 5 and the submerged height should be normalised by dividing it by d that is 0 1 m 0 14 m 0 714 the normalisation of other variables such as the wave number and phase velocity can be found in jaf and wang 2015 fig 23 shows a comparison of the surface elevations obtained by the experiment theoretical solution and numerical simulation at x 1 0 l 99 the theoretical and numerical signals of the incident wave are in relatively good agreement a coda wave which will become indistinct as the distance of the wave propagation increases can be observed with regard to the reflected wave the numerical and experimental results match well whereas the theoretical solution exhibits an overestimation tendency which is also reported in jaf and wang 2015 the difference may be attributed to energy dissipation which is not included in the theoretical solution at the position of wg 2 the experimental signal is close to the numerical result this again demonstrates that the effect of the coda wave is limited after the propagation of a solitary wave at the position of wg 3 the theoretical solution underestimates the amplitude of the transmitted wave a similar phenomenon is also observed in jaf and wang 2015 generally the theoretical solution is satisfactory with a non dimensional submerged depth smaller than 0 5 and solitary wave nonlinearity smaller than 0 3 as the non dimensional submerged height increases large energy dissipation and wave breaking will occur this makes the theoretical solution less suitable the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results indicates that although there is a coda wave the proposed method is capable of accurately generating solitary waves it should be mentioned that the legend presented in the top sub figure of fig 23 is the overall legend for all the sub figures at the position of x 1 0 l 99 the experimental result is not available while at the position of wg 2 the theoretical result is not available the comparison of the experimental and numerical velocity distributions is displayed in fig 24 the first row lists the velocity distribution in the pre breaking stage while the second row lists the velocity distribution in the post breaking stage the biggest deviation observed is in the vertical velocity distribution appearing in the post breaking stage at the position of x 9 22 m the reason for the mismatch might be the use of the laminar model which is supposed to be inappropriate to for simulating this kind of turbulence process i e flow separation for the present study since the mesh sensitivity test the validation of the numerical model and the determination of enhanced factors are all conducted under the laminar condition it is logical to apply the numerical model under the laminar condition for further simulation furthermore in figs 23 and 24 the overall agreement between the experimental and numerical results is satisfactory the phenomenon demonstrates that for this problem the use of the laminar model could yield a relatively good result if the numerical setting used is appropriate however the above analysis does not mean the turbulence model is totally unnecessary in the simulation we believe that if turbulence models are used the result will be improved 7 conclusions in this study a line shaped mass source internal wavemaker was proposed for generating shallow and intermediate water waves the formula for determining source region distribution was derived under the linear wave condition after reasonable simplifications the only unknown parameter during wave generation was an enhanced factor that depends on the weighted combination of h l and d l based on a mesh refinement study the effect of the undesirable downward velocity was discussed the velocity adjustment was introduced to eliminate this undesirable velocity it was observed that the effect of the undesirable velocity is significantly weakened the value of the enhanced factor was investigated in the case of intermediate water waves the independent variable for curve fitting was derived it was demonstrated that the derived independent variable is sufficiently accurate to represent wave properties subsequently the formula for calculating the enhanced factor was obtained by curve fitting in the case of shallow water waves the values of the enhanced factor were equal to 1 and therefore curve fitting was not performed finally the formula for calculating the value of the enhanced factor was obtained eq 47 the proposed method was also compared with other existing methods compared with the two published internal source wavemakers the present wavemaker can yield better results more conveniently because the source region could be determined according to different target waves compared with the piston type wavemaker it was demonstrated that the present wavemaker can generate nonlinear waves relatively accurately although it is derived under the condition of linear shallow water waves two cases of wave structure interactions were simulated using the proposed method the good agreement observed between the numerical and experimental results indicated that the formula obtained in this study is sufficient for providing a relatively good estimation of the enhanced factor value accordingly such a line shaped mass source method can be an alternative wave generation approach when a mass source internal wavemaker is

21148,the mass source wavemaker in navier stokes equations which is a frequently used wave generation method is relatively difficult to control to resolve this problem a line shaped mass source wavemaker is proposed for generating shallow and intermediate water waves via employing reasonable simplifications only the enhanced factor which is introduced to compensate for the energy loss is unknown during the wave generation process it is derived that the enhanced factor depends on a weighted combination of wave steepness and relative water depth furthermore the velocity field inside the source region is adjusted at each time step to eliminate the undesirable downward velocity which could contaminate the result via inducing strong and persistent vortical activities near source regions with the undesirable velocity eliminated the vortical activity in the vicinity of the source region is weakened significantly compared with other mass source wavemakers the proposed method yields better results when it is used for simulating waves of large steepness compared with piston type wavemakers the proposed method yields satisfactory results when it is used for generating high order waves although it is derived under the linear theory further simulations indicate that the proposed method is competent to reproduce the process of wave structure interactions precisely keywords line shaped mass source enhanced factor shallow water intermediate water 1 introduction wave structure interactions in coastal areas attract considerable attention the aim is to achieve accurate forecast analysis and hindcast for practical problems currently various approaches are available for engineers and scholars owing to the rapid development of experimental equipment and numerical modelling wave generation is probably one of the most critical aspects in the research of coastal engineering regardless of the approach adopted there are three frequently used numerical and experimental wave generation methods moving wall boundary input and internal higuera 2015 each method has its own advantages and disadvantages most hydrodynamic laboratories use the moving wall wave generation method such as piston type or flap type wavemakers several decades ago the linear motion equation of a wave paddle was derived with the use of the potential theory this equation has since been widely employed because it is easy to understand and apply wang et al 2019a however the problem of spurious free waves barthel et al 1983 appears when the first order wave paddle signal is used to suppress the spurious free wave a full second order theory including both sub harmonics and super harmonics was proposed by schäffer 1996 subsequently numerous studies related to the second order wave generation theory have appeared schäffer and steenberg 2003 spinneken and swan 2009a 2009b yang et al 2014a 2014b furthermore the ad hoc unified wavemaker theory proposed by zhang and schäffer 2007 is recommended for both regular and irregular wave generation eldrup and andersen 2018 one of the most critical problems in the moving wall method is the minimisation of unwanted secondary reflections that occur at the wave paddle if not absorbed the secondary reflection could considerably affect the results therefore the capacity of active absorption higuera 2020 is necessary for protracted experiments schäffer and klopman 2000 or numerical modelling newman 2010 higuera et al 2013 wang et al 2019b furthermore the moving wall method is computationally costly particularly in three dimensional simulations for example we consider the widely used cfd toolbox openfoam at each time step the position of the moving boundary should be determined subsequently the position of all grid points is calculated according to the diffusive model and fluid quantities are then adjusted it should also be noted that the simulation of floating structures can become a little bit complicated when the moving wall method is employed because at least two motion solvers are required the boundary input method also called the static boundary method is a numerical technique that cannot be employed in actual facilities waves are produced at a fixed boundary at which the dirichlet type boundary conditions of different wave theories are defined for an incompressible two phase model the velocity and volume fraction should be specified on the wave generation boundary whereas the pressure field is calculated via the governing equation this method has been fully developed and is widely used in numerical simulations particularly in floating structure simulations because it can yield satisfactory results at low computational cost ransley et al 2017 however two issues exist for the boundary input method first the method is not available in lagrangian models such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model liu et al 2014 second the problem of the secondary reflection persists to minimise the effect of the secondary reflection the use of relaxation regions jacobsen et al 2012 is inevitable when the boundary input method is used it should be indicated that the relaxation method which contains relaxation regions can be used for both wave generation and wave absorption generally the relaxation region is arranged in the vicinities of computational domain boundaries in which the blending function that ranges from 0 to 1 is applied to combine the numerical and theoretical solutions in terms of wave generation the relaxation method is actually a kind of internal wave generation methods which is mostly adopted together with the boundary input method on the other hand in terms of wave absorption the relaxation method is analogous to the sponge layer method carmigniani and violeau 2018 the internal wave generation method comprises the relaxation method and the source method under the shallow water condition a source wavemaker was initially presented by larsen and dancy 1983 the wavemaker is located inside the computational domain and it functions as a pump to inject and extract water during a one wave period the greatest advantage of such a source wavemaker is that it is not influenced by reflected waves furthermore it can easily be combined with dynamic mesh this indicates that it is suitable for the simulation of floating structures the source wavemaker can be introduced to boussinesq equations wei et al 1999 mild slope equations schäﬀer and sørensen 2006 and navier stokes equations lin and liu 1999 in this paper we focus on the source wavemaker applied in navier stokes equations depending on the equation in which the source function is embedded source wavemakers can be classified into two categories mass source lin and liu 1999 and momentum source wavemakers choi and yoon 2009 compared with the former the latter is easily controlled because the only unknown parameter is the width of the source region therefore the momentum source method is fully developed and it has been used in vof ha et al 2013 cip li et al 2018 and sph liu et al 2015 models although the mass source wavemaker also has been successfully used in numerical simulations lara et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 ma et al 2019 the difficulty of determining the source region is persistent the distribution of the mass source region could considerably affect the result and no unified criterion is available to resolve this problem chen and hsiao 2016 proposed a distribution formula in their study the top and bottom of the source region were assumed to be fixed as per the horizontal velocity profile of a designated wave therefore only the width of the source region should be determined numerous numerical tests of various wave conditions were conducted and the formula for calculating the width of the source region was obtained via curve fitting it was demonstrated that the distribution of the mass source region is significantly related to the relative water depth of the target wave however in the formula of chen and hsiao 2016 the effect of wave height was neglected hence this method is not sufficiently precise when wave nonlinearity ratio of wave height and water depth increases perić and abdel maksoud 2015 investigated the influence of the shape and location of the source region under deep water conditions they demonstrated that the mass source expression should be modified under intermediate and deep water conditions because one of the basic assumptions proposed by lin and liu 1999 is not satisfied therefore an enhanced factor was added to the mass source to compensate for the energy loss during the wave generation process furthermore the distance between the source region and still water level was proved to have an exponential effect on the wave height and a formula was derived to describe this effect however no formula was presented for the source region distribution and a constant enhanced factor may not be appropriate for various wave conditions the mass source wavemaker performs unsatisfactorily when it is used to generate waves of large steepness the wave height generated is likely to decrease during propagation saincher and banerjee 2017 investigated this wave height reduction problem by simulating several shallow and deep water waves of different steepness from 0 004 to 0 052 in the case of deep water waves it was observed that the height reduction problem is largely attributable to free surface damping as predicted by airy theory in the case of shallow water waves it was observed that the mass source wavemaker induces strong and persistent vortical activities which in turn lead to dissipation of source injected momentum to address the issues of the mass source wavemaker an in depth investigation based on the remarkable achievements mentioned above is conducted to retain only one unknown parameter to be determined after a reasonable simplification a line shaped source region is adopted as per the recommendation of lin and liu 1999 this recommendation is that the width of the source region should be less than 5 of the wavelength with the use of the line shaped source region the only unknown parameter is an enhanced factor whose value depends on the weighted combination of wave steepness and relative water depth the formula for calculating the enhanced factor is obtained by curve fitting evidently the effect of wave height is considered making the enhanced factor mutable for different waves therefore this is a combination of the ideas of chen and hsiao 2016 and perić and abdel maksoud 2015 furthermore under relaxation is introduced to the cells inside the source region to adjust the velocity field moderately it is demonstrated that the vortical activity reported by saincher and banerjee 2017 is significantly weakened the structure of the paper is as follows in section 1 the background is introduced as well as the motivation for writing this paper in section 2 the numerical model is elaborated followed by a detailed description of the mass source wavemaker proposed in the present paper in section 3 the numerical model is validated and the discussion on the velocity adjustment inside the source region is conducted in section 4 the formula for calculating the enhanced factor is obtained by curve fitting in section 5 the comparison between the present method and other published methods is presented in section 6 two cases of wave structure interactions are calculated and satisfactory results are observed in section 7 the conclusion of the study is summarised 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model in the case of two phase incompressible flow the mass conservation equation is 1 u i x i 0 o u t s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n s t i n s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n where u i is the mean component of the velocity the cartesian coordinates are denoted by x i t represents time the expression of the mass source s t will be discussed in section 2 2 the momentum equation is 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j p x i g j x j ρ x i x j 2 μ s i j σ κ α x i w d where ρ is the density field of air or water g j is the gravitational acceleration p p ρ g j x j is the hydrodynamic pressure only if the still water level is located at x k 0 μ is the dynamic viscosity s ij is the mean strain rate tensor it should be noted that turbulence viscosity is not considered in eq 2 because the simulation in the present study is performed under the laminar condition the source term of wave damping is denoted by wd perić and abdel maksoud 2018 3 w d γ b x u i where γ is the forcing strength which is calculated according to perić and abdel maksoud 2018 to obtain a minimum reflection coefficient and its value varies from 6 to 10 in the present study b x is the blending function which is only valid inside the wave damping region 4 b x e x x s x e x s 2 1 e 1 where x s and x e are the start and end of the wave damping region respectively in eq 2 σ is the coefficient of the surface tensor κ is the curve of the interface α represents the volume fraction which is defined in the vof scheme hirt and nichols 1981 the vof equation is 5 α t α u i x i x i α 1 α u i r γ b x α r e f α o u t s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n α s t γ b x α r e f α i n s i d e s o u r c e r e g i o n where u i r is the relative velocity used for interface compression the source term γb x α ref α is used for wave absorption and its value equals zero outside the wave damping region because b x equals zero α ref is the target value of the α field whose value is constantly equal to the α field at the initial time step adding this term to the vof equation alleviates the mass conservation problem caused by eq 3 and the mass source wavemaker the source term α s t is added because the velocity field is not divergence free owing to the local mass source term despite the addition of this source term undesirable values of the volume fraction may occur in fluid injection and extraction for the cell in the vicinity of the source region the α value becomes slightly greater or smaller than 1 0 this is numerically logical but physically illogical because in the vof scheme the maximum value of the volume fraction is assumed to be 1 0 and the α value of all the cells beneath the free surface should be 1 0 the unwanted volume fraction value corrupts the result particularly in the source region vicinity therefore the volume fraction value of each cell is moderately modified at the end of each time step as follows 6 α i c 0 α i c 1 α 0 where i represents the i th cell and α 0 is the target value 1 0 under the assumption that the mass source is always located beneath the free surface whereas c 0 and c 1 are weights calculated by 7 c 0 α i α 0 α i and 8 c 1 1 c 0 it should be noted that eq 6 is valid only for cells with α i α 0 0 001 or cells located inside the mass source region the threshold is set to 0 001 to minimise the effect on cells located in the other part of the computational domain moreover eq 6 is adopted at the end of each time step this ensures that the threshold is not overly small because the source term in eq 5 has a finite contribution per time step 2 2 mass source wavemaker 2 2 1 derivation according to lin and liu 1999 there are two critical assumptions in the derivation i the width of the source region should be significantly smaller than the target wavelength ii the mass increase or decrease introduced by the source function contributes to the generation of the target wave entirely the first assumption indicates that the free surface directly above the source region responds immediately to the mass change induced by the source the second assumption implies that there is no energy loss during wave generation let us consider the two dimensional cartesian coordinate system of which the origin of the z axis is at the still water level according to the theory of airy wave the horizontal and vertical velocity components are 9 u h x z t k g h 2 ω cosh k d z cosh k d cos k x ω t 10 u v x z t k g h 2 ω sinh k d z cosh k d sin k x ω t the wave height and wave period are denoted by h and t respectively l and k are the wavelength and wave number respectively ω is the circular frequency d is the water depth under the shallow water condition kd 1 we have 11 cosh k d 1 and 12 sinh k d z cosh k d k d z with the use of eqs 11 and 12 eqs 9 and 10 can be rewritten as 13 u h x t k g h 2 ω cos k x ω t and 14 u v x z t k g h 2 ω k d 1 z d sin k x ω t from eq 13 it is observed that the horizontal velocity is uniform along the water depth direction compared with eq 13 eq 14 is negligible because kd 1 therefore under the two previously mentioned assumptions the mass flux of the mass source is 15 ω s t d x d z 2 d u h x t 2 k g d ω η x t where ω is the source region η x t is the time history of the free surface displacement of linear monochromatic waves the factor 2 implies there are two waves travelling oppositely along the horizontal direction moreover the shallow water dispersion relationship is 16 ω 2 g k tanh k d g k 2 d on substituting eq 16 into eq 15 the general expression of the mass source can be obtained 17 ω s t d x d z 2 ω k η x t 2 c η x t where c is the phase velocity eq 17 is the most widely accepted expression of the mass source wavemaker from which it can be concluded that a target wave could be generated once the phase velocity and surface elevation are known at each time step it should be noted that the effect of wave height is ignored in eq 15 therefore it is clear that the mass source wavemaker is first order and only the linear shallow water wave is its theoretical solution however it is widely accepted that the mass source wavemaker can also be used to approximately generate intermediate water waves as long as the approaches for calculating both the surface elevation and phase velocity are adjusted as per the corresponding wave theory chen and hsiao 2016 saincher and banerjee 2017 therefore generating shallow and intermediate water waves of small amplitudes can be respectively defined as the basic and extended applications of the mass source wavemaker furthermore using a high order wave theory to calculate the phase velocity and surface elevation is preferable when the nonlinearity of the target wave is relatively strong lin and liu 1999 the use of the high order wave theory is equivalent to giving an evolution solution to the internal boundary the word evolution means that an approximate solution instead of an analytical solution is passed to the wavemaker and this solution evolves towards the expected wave solution as the wave propagates for shallow water waves wave nonlinearity h d can be used for estimating the difficulty in wave generation for intermediate water waves wave steepness h l can be used for estimating the difficulty in wave generation however when the target wave is the deep water wave eq 17 becomes inappropriate because the velocity distributions of shallow and deep water waves differ considerably the difference cannot be overcome even though the high order wave theory is adopted which is unlike the cases of generating intermediate water waves this is the reason why the mass source wavemaker always suffers from unsuccessful wave generation under the deep water condition however most waves no matter in laboratories or actual coastal regions are shallow or intermediate water waves therefore the focus of the present study is on accurate wave generation under shallow and intermediate water conditions for deep water waves readers may refer to the study of perić and abdel maksoud 2015 2 2 2 source region distribution according to eq 17 if the mass source is spatially uniform inside ω its expression is 18 s t 2 c η t a s where a s is the area of the source region the horizontal position of the mass source is supposed to be at x 0 for a linear monochromatic wave η t and c are expressed as 19 η t h 2 cos ω t and 20 c l t fig 1 shows point shaped and line shaped mass source regions for a point shaped mass source region three parameters should be determined the distance between the upper surface of the source region and still water level h t as well as the height and width of the source region h s and w s respectively the most difficult aspect of defining the point shaped mass source region is determining the value of h t which has an exponential effect on the wave height generated perić and abdel maksoud 2015 to overcome the difficulty in determining the source region a line shaped mass source is proposed if a line shaped region is used h t can be linked with d as follows 21 d h s h t h s n h where h t is scaled by the target wave height and n is a non dimensional coefficient whose value is to be determined the width of the source region w s is scaled by the wavelength according to lin and liu 1999 the width of the mass source region should be significantly smaller than the wavelength and a significant error can be observed when w s 0 05l therefore a medium value of w s 0 02l is selected for monochromatic wave generation with all the above formulae eq 18 can be rewritten as 22 s t l h 0 02 l d n h t cos ω t evidently for a designated wave the only remaining variable is n which represents the number of wave heights in the distance between the top surface of the source region and still water level if a new variable θ n is introduced as 23 θ n l h 0 02 l d n h t then eq 22 can be clearly expressed as 24 s t θ n cos ω t eq 24 is similar to eq 19 the amplitude and fluctuation parts are represented by θ n and the trigonometric factor respectively a new problem that arises is determining the appropriate value of n under various wave conditions first eq 23 should be rewritten as 25 θ n h d 0 02 1 n h d t where l is eliminated and both the numerator and denominator are divided by d for a designated wave the nonlinearity ε is the ratio of wave height and water depth expressed as 26 ε h d on substituting eq 26 into eq 25 the final expression of the amplitude part is obtained as 27 θ n ε 0 02 t 1 n ε f 0 02 ε 1 n ε where f is the frequency of the target wave according to eq 27 it can be concluded that the amplitude part of a mass source can be divided into two parts the first is dependent on the target wave frequency and the ratio of w s and l 0 02 in this study the other is dependent on wave nonlinearity and the distance between the top of the mass source region and still water level i e ε and n respectively these four variables are inter independent except for ε and n therefore their relationship should be investigated to obtain the appropriate value of n the basic relationship is expressed as 28 1 n ε 0 the left hand side of eq 28 represents the non dimensional source region height scaled by the water depth however according to lin and liu 1999 a more stringent condition should be adopted that is the maximum distance between the top of the mass source region and still water level should be less than half of the water depth that is 29 1 n ε 0 5 the minimum value of n is set as 1 0 to ensure that the source region always remains beneath the free surface even with the occurrence of standing waves finally the range of the coefficient value is 30 1 n 1 2 ε eq 30 indicates that for a designated wave the only unknown variable n is restrained by ε that is a stronger nonlinearity yields a smaller value range of n fig 2 shows the value of the second item in eq 27 as a function of n it can be seen that θ n increases as n becomes larger this tendency becomes intense for waves with a strong nonlinearity ε 0 1 however a larger n indicates a longer distance between the upper surface of the source region and still water level leading to a smaller wave height generated perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the interaction of these two opposite effects may somehow explain why nonlinear waves are not easily generated by mass source wavemakers therefore it is difficult to determine an appropriate value of n so that all the requirements under different wave conditions may be met a novel approach is proposed to resolve this problem in this method a constant value of n is used and an enhanced factor is accordingly introduced into eq 27 a similar wave height compensation factor was also used by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 for deep water wave generation to compensate for undesirable energy loss as shown in fig 2 n 1 5 is selected to match various waves particularly those with a strong nonlinearity that is ε 0 3 with the introduction of the enhanced factor f c eq 27 can be rewritten as 31 θ f 0 02 ε 1 1 5 ε f c the final expression of the line shaped mass source wavemaker is 32 s t 2 c η t a s f c although eq 32 is identical to the expression proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the approaches for calculating f c are different for linear shallow water waves the value of f c is close to 1 0 when the values of wave nonlinearity or wave steepness are large the value of f c required increases details on the calculation of f c are presented in section 4 2 2 3 velocity adjustment inside the source region according to the study of saincher and banerjee 2017 the vortex in the vicinity of the source region significantly affects the wave generation the reason why the vortex appears can be elaborated as follows in the wave generation process the downward velocity injected flows out from the lower surface of the source region in terms of point shaped source regions if the target wave height is relatively large the downward velocity accumulates and finally hits against the bottom of the computational domain in the process of which the vortex is formed when the line shaped mass source region is used the effect of the downward velocity is noticeable even though the target wave height is relatively small this is because the downward velocity cannot be released from the lower surface of the source region it directly hits against the bottom of the computational domain to minimise the effect of the vortex near the source region the downward velocity needs to be adjusted along the water depth direction therefore a relaxation function is introduced to adjust the velocity field inside the source region mildly in other words after the solving process of each time step the velocity field inside the source region is multiplied by the relaxation function the expression of the relaxation function is 33 r z 1 z s z z t sin λ π 2 z z e z s z e z e z z s it should be noted the relaxation function is only valid inside the source region in eq 33 z s and z e represent the z directional coordinates of the start and end of the adjustment region respectively z t is the z directional coordinate of the upper surface of the source region λ is the shape factor the values of z t and z e can be directly obtained 34 z t h t n h 1 5 h z e d furthermore an additional factor f s is used to calculate the value of z s 35 z s f s h s z e f s z t z e z e where f s represents the non dimensional height of the adjustment region and its value is in the range of 0 1 if the value of f s equals 1 0 the adjustment starts from the upper surface of the source region if the value of f s equals 0 there is no adjustment during the simulation as shown in section 3 the proposed values of f s and λ are 1 0 and 0 1 respectively 3 validation 3 1 sensitivity to grid size the sensitivity of the numerical model to the grid size is investigated in this section an intermediate water wave is adopted for the simulation and the wave properties are listed in table 1 from the table it is clear that the values of the nonlinearity and steepness of the target wave are relatively large therefore the value of f c should be greater than 1 0 to determine the appropriate f c value several f c values are tried and it is found that the result calculated with f c 1 2 matches the theoretical result therefore the value of f c is set as 1 2 the layout of the two dimensional computational domain is presented in fig 3 the length of the computational domain is 7 5l the work length is set as 3 5l to achieve a balance between cost and efficiency sponge layers are placed on both sides of the computational domain with a length of 2 0l according to the study of chen and hsiao 2016 the distance between the source region and the left sponge layer is set as 0 5l four wave gauges wgs are used for measuring the surface elevation the wgs are placed along the wave direction spaced 1 0l apart the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 is adopted for updating the surface elevation and phase velocity at each time step the time step is automatically adjusted based on the maximum courant number whose value is 0 25 and the total simulation time is 20t as listed in table 2 three mesh refinement levels are considered the grids in the vicinities of the source region and free surface are simultaneously refined furthermore as proposed by larsen et al 2019 a diffusion balance should be achieved to resolve the problem of wave decay during propagation therefore the upwind scheme is adopted for calculating the convection of momentum and the crank nicolson cn scheme is adopted for calculating the time derivative the weight of the cn scheme is set as 0 3 larsen et al 2019 the outer loop of the pimple algorithm is set as 1 0 which makes the piso algorithm adopted the velocity adjustment is not performed during the simulation the calculated result is exhibited in fig 4 the horizontal axis represents the non dimensional time which is normalised by the wave period the vertical axis represents the non dimensional surface elevation which is normalised by the wave amplitude a from the figure it is evident that the result is convergent when the medium mesh is used it can be observed that the wave amplitude measured above the source region is larger than the target wave amplitude this is logical because the value of f c adopted is greater than 1 0 however at the position of wg 2 the agreement between the calculated and theoretical signals is unsatisfactory after the moment of t t 6 likewise the agreement at the position of wg 3 is unsatisfactory the reason for the mismatch between the calculated and theoretical signals is that the velocity adjustment is not performed during the simulation 3 2 factors of velocity adjustment in this section the proposed values of f s and λ are obtained and the necessity of introducing the velocity adjustment is stressed fig 5 displays the distribution of the relaxation function along the water depth direction in which several different f s and λ are considered the horizontal axis represents the value of the relaxation function and the vertical axis represents the non dimensional z directional coordinate from the figure it can be deduced that if the value of f s is close to 1 0 the value of λ should be small otherwise the velocity field inside the source region would be overly adjusted on the other hand if the value of f s is relatively small the value of λ should be large to eliminate the undesirable velocity completely therefore two combinations of f s and λ are considered i f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 ii f s 0 5 and λ 2 0 the case adopted in section 3 1 is recalculated with the use of the refined mesh and the velocity adjustment is performed at each time step the result is presented in fig 6 from the figure it is observed that the three calculated signals coincide at the position of wg 1 no matter whether the velocity adjustment is performed or not at the position of wg 2 the signals calculated with the velocity adjustment are in agreement with the theoretical signal while the signal calculated without the velocity adjustment is not at the position of wg 3 the agreement between the calculated and theoretical signals is not perfect the amplitude of the signal calculated with the velocity adjustment is larger than the theoretical amplitude in contrast the amplitude of the signal calculated without the velocity adjustment is smaller than the theoretical amplitude at the position of wg 4 all of the three calculated signals are in agreement with the theoretical signal to provide a quantitative description of the numerical result the relative error re is introduced 36 r e φ i φ i φ 0 φ 0 100 where φ i is the mean wave height or mean wave period calculated by the data within the time range of 10t 20t at the i th wg and φ 0 is the target value furthermore the normalised root mean square rms error chen and hsiao 2016 is adopted to reflect the overall discrepancy between the numerical and theoretical surface elevations 37 r m s 1 h i 1 n η t i η n i 2 n 100 where η t i and η n i represent theoretical and numerical surface elevation data respectively n is the total number of the data point of the surface elevations within the time range of 10t 20t the values of the relative error for the mean wave height and mean wave period as well as the rms values are presented in fig 7 from the figure it can be observed that the relative error calculated using the mean wave period is significantly smaller than that calculated using the mean wave height therefore our focus is on the relative error calculated by the mean wave height at the position of wg 2 the value of re h 2 becomes smaller with the introduction of the velocity adjustment and the relevant rms value decreases to less than 5 which is acceptable for engineering problems at the position of wg 3 the value of re h 3 calculated without the velocity adjustment is close to 0 which is smaller than the other two re h 3 values calculated with the velocity adjustment however for the case without the velocity adjustment the mean wave height decreases considerably from 7 2 to 0 4 in terms of the relative error as the wave travels from wg 2 to wg 3 therefore it can be deduced that the velocity field has been disturbed as a result of the vortex generated in the vicinity of the source region saincher and banerjee 2017 to prove this a velocity probe is used for sampling the velocity field in the vicinity of the source region the horizontal distance between the probe and the source region is 0 5l and the vertical distance between the probe and the bottom of the computational domain is 0 125d the comparison between the calculated and theoretical velocity curves is presented in fig 8 the horizontal axis represents the non dimensional time and the vertical axis represents the non dimensional velocity as shown in fig 8 the velocity field is significantly contaminated by the undesirable velocity when the velocity adjustment is off in contrast with the introduction of the velocity adjustment both the horizontal and vertical velocities match the theoretical velocities to highlight the effect of the velocity adjustment the vorticity field which is the curl of the velocity field in the vicinity of the source region is presented in fig 9 the left part of fig 9 is the result calculated with the velocity adjustment in which the first parameter combination f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 is adopted and the right part of fig 9 is the result calculated without the velocity adjustment obviously at t 2t the two results are analogous the magnitude of the vorticity field is relatively small however as time proceeds strong vorticity activities can be observed in the result calculated without the velocity adjustment while the vorticity field in the result calculated with the velocity adjustment is almost unchanged it is demonstrated that the strong vorticity activity is induced by the undesirable velocity which hits against the bottom of the computational domain furthermore the use of the velocity adjustment can also decrease the simulation time in our simulation the case of the refined mesh is run in parallel modes with the computational domain being decomposed into 6 subdomains when the velocity adjustment is adopted the total simulation time is 4409 and 4980 s with the use of the first and second parameter combinations respectively if the velocity adjustment is blocked the total simulation time is 5869 s that is the introduction of the velocity adjustment shortens the simulation time by 30 approximately the reason for the reduction in the total simulation time can be elaborated as follows with the undesirable downward velocity inside the source region eliminated the velocity gradient in the vicinity of the source region bottom is diminished considerably therefore the time step span can be relatively large as per the maximum courant number rule as a result the total simulation time is shortened significantly the analysis above demonstrates that the velocity adjustment is necessary for a line shaped mass source wavemaker now the final problem is the selection of the parameter combination although it is observed that the two combinations of f s and λ yield a similar result the first combination f s 1 0 and λ 0 1 is selected for the subsequent simulation this is because the use of the first parameter combination yields smaller relative error for the mean wave height as well as smaller rms error fig 9 furthermore the simulation time is shorter when the first parameter combination is used 4 enhanced factor 4 1 intermediate water waves the use of curve fitting requires a certain number of samples therefore several numerical experiments are conducted in which intermediate water waves of different steepness are considered the properties of the target wave condition as well as the grid size are listed in table 3 the computational domain is identical to the one presented in fig 3 the total simulation time is 20t and the other numerical settings remain unchanged from those listed in section 3 1 the water depth is 0 4 m and the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 is adopted the wave period varies from 0 75 to 3 0 s which makes the d l vary from 0 069 to 0 46 the wave height varies from 0 01 to 0 12 m which makes the ε vary from 0 025 to 0 3 as proposed by perić and abdel maksoud 2015 the wave whose steepness is larger than 0 056 is difficult to be generated by the mass source wavemaker therefore the wave with h l 0 056 is not considered in the present study finally the h l adopted varies from 0 003 to 0 055 in table 3 the appropriate f c values are also presented for a given wave several f c values are attempted and the one that can yield a satisfactory result is selected as the appropriate value furthermore according to table 3 two basic rules can be concluded first d l has a major effect on f c the value of f c is close to 1 0 if d l is small while the value of f c increases significantly as the increase of d l second for a designated d l the effect of the wave height increases considerably when ε 0 05 if ε 0 05 the effect of the wave height is so limited that it may even be ignored before curve fitting there still remains the issue of finding an independent variable θ to take the effect of wave height water depth and wave period into account simultaneously a linear combination of wave steepness and relative water depth is used as the independent variable of curve fitting 38 θ β ξ h l 1 β d l where β is a weighted factor whose value is between 0 and 1 ξ is a scaling factor for scaling h l to the same order of magnitude as that of d l this is necessary because h l is generally considerably smaller than d l for most waves if no scaling is performed the effect of h l may be submerged by d l the value of ξ will be discussed later eq 38 can be rewritten as 39 θ β ξ h d 1 β d l 1 1 ξ ε β d l then if we treat d l as a variable the following expression can be obtained 40 θ d l 1 1 ξ ε β it is evident that under the conditions of 0 ε 0 3 0 β 1 0 and ξ 1 the expression in eq 40 is always positive as eq 39 is monotone θ increases with d l which is in accordance with the expected tendency described by the first aforementioned rule we now consider the value of ξ the proposed range is 1 0 3 33 because ε is the ratio of h l and d l and the largest ε value of the target wave is 0 3 in the present study if ξ 3 3 ξh l will be larger than d l for the strong nonlinear wave with ε 0 3 opposing the first aforementioned rule therefore the value of ξ is calculated as 41 ξ exp 4 ε with the use of eq 41 the range of ξ is 1 0 3 32 furthermore ξ will increase considerably when ε increases which is in accordance with the second aforementioned rule the only unknown variable is now the weighted factor β for intermediate water waves the value of d l is less than 0 5 if d l is selected as the weighted factor the weighted factor of ξh l is always smaller than that of d l in other words d l has a major effect on the calculation of θ which is in accordance with the first aforementioned rule therefore d l is selected as the weighted factor 42 θ d l ξ h l 1 d l d l or 43 θ 1 1 ξ ε β d l 1 1 ξ ε d l d l on recalculating the derivative of eq 43 we obtain 44 θ d l 1 2 1 ξ ε d l for intermediate water waves d l is smaller than 0 5 thus ensuring that eq 44 is always positive therefore θ increases monotonically with d l moreover a similar tendency can be observed with respect to h l or ε with the use of curve fitting the relationship of θ and f c is obtained eq 45 fig 10 shows the appropriate f c values as well as the values calculated using eq 45 it is evident that the independent variable θ can perfectly link wave properties to f c values a larger θ corresponds to a larger f c as expected the largest value of f c is 1 97 for intermediate water waves with a relatively strong nonlinearity case m3 if θ increases to the limit between intermediate water and deep water conditions for example d l 0 5 f c will also increase considerably this tendency is consistent with the result of perić and abdel maksoud 2015 where a constant f c value of 4 7 was proposed for point shaped mass source wave generation under deep water conditions 45 f c θ 183 88 θ 3 63 26 θ 2 7 58 θ 0 72 fig 11 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the cases of different θ the measurement point is placed three wavelengths downstream the wavemaker the value of θ varies from 0 065 to 0 28 and the value of f c varies from 1 0 to 1 97 the nonlinearity varies from 0 05 to 0 3 the overall agreement between the theoretical and numerical signals is acceptable and hardly changes as the variety of wave properties the data within the time range of 10t 20t is used for calculating the relative error and rms error and the calculated values are shown in fig 12 compared to the mean wave height the mean wave period has considerably smaller re values therefore our focus is on the re values calculated using the mean wave height as well as the rms values at the position of wg 1 the re value is close to or even less than 0 when θ 0 15 whereas it increases considerably when θ 0 22 similarly the rms value is less than 5 when θ 0 2 while it exceeds 5 significantly when θ 0 22 regarding the wave height measured at wgs 2 4 it is evident that practically all re and rms values are less than 5 0 which is acceptable in engineering problems finally the characteristics of wave generation and propagation could be concluded as follows for intermediate water waves with small d l the mean wave height measured above the source region is close to or even smaller than the target value and the wave height is stable in the process of wave propagation for intermediate water waves with large d l the mean wave height measured above the source region is considerably larger than the target value and the wave height decreases to the target value in the process of wave propagation 4 2 shallow water waves generating shallow water waves by a mass source wavemaker is relatively easy because the mass source wavemaker is derived under the shallow water condition two shallow water wave theories are considered the first is the fifth order cnoidal theory proposed by fenton 1979 however the original theory proposed in 1979 is complicated and performs poorly for higher waves therefore in a later work fenton 1990 the original theory was improved the theory was simplified and the result calculated was accurate for longer and higher waves the second theory considered is the ninth order solitary theory presented by fenton 1972 for solitary waves the mass source distribution is slightly different from that of periodic waves according to liu et al 2006 the characteristic length l 99 of a solitary wave is adopted for calculating the source region width 46 l 99 4 d 3 3 h ln 1 0 99 1 0 99 furthermore it should be noted that for solitary wave generation n is set as 1 0 this is because i the profile of a solitary wave is located above the still water level and there are no standing waves ii solitary waves with a strong nonlinearity of ε 0 5 are expected to be generated this makes n 1 5 inappropriate according to fig 2 the other settings are identical to those for periodic waves tables 4 and 5 list the cnoidal and solitary wave conditions used in this section respectively the computational domain is identical to the one presented in fig 3 and the numerical settings are unchanged from those listed in section 4 1 fig 13 presents the re and rms values calculated with the cnoidal wave conditions the result is acceptable because most of the re values are in the range of 5 5 furthermore in table 4 it is observed that all of the appropriated f c values are equal to 1 0 therefore the process of curve fitting is no longer needed finally eq 45 can be rewritten as 47 f c θ 183 88 θ 3 63 26 θ 2 7 58 θ 0 72 θ 0 07 1 0 θ 0 07 fig 14 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the cnoidal wave cases the measurement point is placed three wavelengths downstream the wavemaker the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is relatively good however high order harmonics can be observed for the wave of strong nonlinearity because the high order wave theory has already been used it can be deduced that the reason for the appearance of the high order harmonics is that the mass source wavemaker is derived under the linear theory in the case of solitary waves the appropriate f c values are listed in table 5 it is evident that the tendency of f c to increase is not significant this is logical because solitary waves are derived under shallow water conditions therefore curve fitting is no longer required for estimating f c in fact the proposed method combined with an enhanced factor whose value is 1 0 is sufficient to generate the target solitary wave with acceptable accuracy and only a slight adjustment is required if necessary fig 15 exhibits the comparison between the non dimensional theoretical and numerical surface elevations calculated by the solitary wave cases when the wave nonlinearity is weak ε 0 2 the wave amplitude is stable as the solitary wave propagates when the wave nonlinearity is strong the wave amplitude measured above the source region wg 1 is smaller than the target amplitude however the wave amplitude increases to the target value as the solitary wave propagates furthermore when ε 0 2 an obvious coda wave is observed at the position of wg 2 and it becomes more evident as ε increases however the coda wave decreases as the solitary wave propagates at the position of wg 4 the coda wave practically vanishes and only the accurate wave profile remains as in section 2 2 1 these phenomena appear because the nonlinearity of the target wave is strong which makes the difference between the target wave and the analytical wave solution linear shallow water waves non negligible with the use of the high order wave theory the wave profile is observed to evolve towards the target wave profile during the process of propagation this evolution phenomenon was also observed by wu and hsiao 2018 4 3 application scope the application scope of the proposed wavemaker is summarised in fig 16 in which the red solid points indicate the wave conditions concerned in the present study the kd value of 0 314 is the divide between the shallow and intermediate water conditions while the kd value of 3 144 is the divide between the intermediate and deep water conditions in fig 16 the limit of the proposed mass source wavemaker h d 0 3 and h l 0 056 is displayed as well as the wave conditions concerned in the present study it is evident that for the wave whose kd is less than 1 1 approximately the limit of h d 0 3 is primary while for the wave whose kd is greater than 1 1 approximately the limit of h l 0 056 is primary 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with published mass source wavemakers in this section a comparison between the present mass source wavemaker and two previously published mass source wavemakers is made the first is the original mass source wavemaker proposed by lin and liu 1999 the second is the updated mass source wavemaker proposed more recently by chen and hsiao 2016 in the first method only the optimal design rules of the source region were proposed i the width of source region should be less than 5 l ii the height of the source region should be in the range of 0 2d to 0 25d iii the distance between the centre of the source region and still water level should be in the range of 0 33d to 0 5d in the second method the positions of the top and bottom of the source region are calculated according to the normalised horizontal velocity profile the width of the source region is calculated using a formula derived by curve fitting in which kd is used as the independent variable the two waves considered in the study of lin and liu 1999 are adopted for the simulation the two waves share the same water depth of 0 2 m and the same wave period of 1 0 s the wave heights are 0 04 m and 0 06 m for the first and second waves respectively according to the linear theory the wavelength is 1 21 m it can be calculated that these two waves are intermediate water waves with strong nonlinearities of 0 2 and 0 3 respectively it is evident that using a mass source wavemaker to generate them is difficult because they are far from the optimal condition shallow water waves with weak nonlinearity as in lin and liu 1999 the first wave is generated according to the second order stokes theory silva et al 2018 whereas the second wave is generated according to the fifth order stokes theory skjelbreia and hendrickson 1961 the detailed size of the mass source region for each method is listed in table 6 as in section 2 2 3 z t and z e are the z directional coordinate values of the top and bottom of the source region assuming that the zero position is at the still water level in the method of lin and liu 1999 no exact rules are proposed for source region determination therefore we could only set the mass source region according to the optimal design rules mentioned above in fact in this method several trials are required before a satisfactory result may be obtained and this is quite complicated in the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the effect of wave height is neglected therefore the mass source region is constant although ε becomes stronger the h l values of the two target waves are 0 0331 and 0 0496 respectively furthermore the f c values are 1 06 1 054 calculated by eq 47 and 1 08 1 075 calculated by eq 47 for the wave conditions corresponding to h 0 04 m and h 0 06 m respectively the layout of the computational domain is identical to the one listed in fig 3 all the cases share a constant spatial resolution in the vicinities of the free surface and mass source region the x and z directional grid size is 0 006 m and 0 002 m respectively the time step is automatically adjusted based on the maximum courant number whose value is 0 25 the total simulation time is 20t fig 17 shows the comparison of the simulation results for h 0 04 m at the position of wg 1 the amplitude calculated via the present method is smaller than the target amplitude in contrast the amplitudes calculated via the other two methods are larger than the target amplitude it can be observed that harmonics appear in the signal calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the reason for the appearance of the harmonics is that the source region is too wide which makes the velocity field inside the source region asymmetric after several wave periods at the position of wg 2 the values calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 are smaller than the target values at the wave trough the result calculated via the present method matches the result calculated via the method of lin and liu 1999 at the positions of wg 3 and wg 4 an analogous phenomenon can be observed in summary the three methods perform similarly and the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is acceptable fig 18 shows the comparison of the simulation results for h 0 06 m obviously the overall agreement between the numerical and theoretical results is not as good as that in fig 17 among the three methods the proposed method could yield the best result at the position of wg 1 the results calculated via the two published methods deviate from the theoretical result significantly for the result calculated via the method of chen and hsiao 2016 the harmonics become more evident than those observed in fig 17 for the result calculated via the method of lin and liu 1999 it can be observed that the signal is severely affected by the undesirable velocity in contrast the signal calculated via the present method matches well with the theoretical signal at the position of wg 2 for the results calculated via the two previously published methods the wave profile is uplifted and the wave crest becomes sharper as the wave propagates the disturbance still exists and therefore the results are not as satisfactory as expected in contrast the present method performs better it is demonstrated that the velocity adjustment used in the present method is effective in weakening the effect of the undesirable velocity 5 2 comparison with moving wall wavemakers in this section the present line shaped mass source wavemaker is compared with the moving wall wavemaker two moving wall wavemakers are considered the first is the second order piston type wavemaker proposed by schäffer 1996 the second is the ad hoc unified piston type wavemaker proposed by zhang and schäffer 2007 the wave adopted is selected from the study of schäffer 1996 the water depth is 0 7 m the wave height and wave period are 0 14 m and 3 0 s respectively the fifth order stokes wave theory is used for updating the phase velocity and surface elevation the layout of the computational domain is identical to the experiment proposed by schäffer 1996 four wgs are used for capturing the surface elevation the distances between the four wgs and wavemaker are 1 0 4 0 4 4 and 8 7 m respectively the value of f c is 1 06 and the total simulation time is 10t the other numerical settings are unchanged from those listed in the previous sections the comparison of the numerical experimental and theoretical results is presented in fig 19 the experimental data used is extracted from fig 9 of the study of schäffer 1996 and the theoretical signal is calculated via the stream function wave theory fenton 1999 to make the figure clear the theoretical curve is drawn without phase adjustment from the figure it is observed that the numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical result furthermore the experimental wave amplitude is slightly smaller than the theoretical value this is logical because the experimental facility has friction loss at the position of wave crests the signal calculated via the mass source wavemaker is in agreement with the second order wavemaker signal at the position of wave troughs the signal calculated via the mass source wavemaker is in agreement with the ad hoc wavemaker signal at x 8 7 m compared with the wave profiles calculated via the piston type wavemakers the wave profile calculated via the mass source wavemaker is sharper at the wave crest and flatter at the wave trough it is demonstrated that the proposed mass source wavemaker can be used for generating nonlinear intermediate water waves relatively precisely although it is derived under the condition of linear shallow water waves 6 application 6 1 interaction between monochromatic waves and submerged breakwater the experiment conducted by ning et al 2016 in which the wave structure interaction of monochromatic waves and a submerged breakwater was studied is reproduced in this section a rectangular submerged breakwater is adopted in the present simulation the height and width of the submerged breakwater are 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively the water depth is 0 6 m the wave height and period are 0 076 m and 2 0 s respectively the layout of the computational domain is shown in fig 20 the total length of the computational domain is 32 7 m that is 7 5l two sponge layers are placed on both sides of the numerical flume to absorb reflected waves the distance between the seaside wall of the breakwater and the source region is 8 72 m the positions of the five wgs from x 1 to x 5 are 16 37 17 37 19 87 22 37 and 23 37 m respectively the distribution of the mass source region follows the rule obtained in the previous section using eq 44 the obtained f c value is 1 04 the total simulation time is 25 0t the other settings are identical to those discussed in the previous sections a comparison between the numerical and experimental results is shown in fig 21 the horizontal and vertical axes represent the non dimensional time and non dimensional surface elevation respectively fig 21 shows that the numerical results agree well with the experimental results as expected standard periodic wave signals can be observed at the positions of wg 1 and wg 2 these two signals are the combination of incident and reflected waves and their amplitudes are different because the distances between them and the structures differ at the position of wg 3 wave shape changes are observed as a result of the shoaling effect flatter wave troughs are observed and wave skewness occurs this indicates that the nonlinear effect becomes significant as water depth decreases ning et al 2016 at the positions of wg 4 and wg 5 distinct high order harmonics and deformations are observed that is when water depth increases abruptly high order harmonic waves that are mainly generated by the nonlinear wave wave interactions over the submerged breakwater are released as free waves on the leeside evidently all the typical features of the interaction between monochromatic waves and a submerged breakwater presented by ning et al 2016 are well captured by the present numerical model 6 2 interaction between solitary wave and thin submerged breakwater wu et al 2012 presented an experiment in which the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged vertical thin barrier is investigated in a recent study jaf and wang 2015 derived a theoretical solution to predict the reflected and transmitted wave surfaces during the interaction between a solitary wave and a vertical thin submerged breakwater in this subsection the results obtained by the experiment and the theoretical solution are compared with numerical results the layout of the numerical wave flume is shown in fig 22 the length of the computational domain is 8 5l 99 a sponge layers is placed on the left side of the numerical wave flume a thin plate whose height and width are 0 1 and 0 02 m respectively is placed 5 0l 99 from the mass source region the left bottom of the plate is located at x 9 08 m three wgs are used to capture the reflected and transmitted waves as in the setup of the experiment wg 1 is placed 0 657 m upstream the thin plate whereas wg 3 is placed 0 357 m downstream the thin plate wg 2 is placed immediately above the plate x 9 09 m the water depth is 0 14 m and the wave height is 0 07 m the total simulation time is set to 8 0 s according to the aforementioned conclusion the value of f c is initially set as 1 02 the theoretical solution by jaf and wang 2015 was presented in non dimensional form therefore all the variables in the present study should first be normalised for example time should be normalised by multiplying it with g d 0 5 and the submerged height should be normalised by dividing it by d that is 0 1 m 0 14 m 0 714 the normalisation of other variables such as the wave number and phase velocity can be found in jaf and wang 2015 fig 23 shows a comparison of the surface elevations obtained by the experiment theoretical solution and numerical simulation at x 1 0 l 99 the theoretical and numerical signals of the incident wave are in relatively good agreement a coda wave which will become indistinct as the distance of the wave propagation increases can be observed with regard to the reflected wave the numerical and experimental results match well whereas the theoretical solution exhibits an overestimation tendency which is also reported in jaf and wang 2015 the difference may be attributed to energy dissipation which is not included in the theoretical solution at the position of wg 2 the experimental signal is close to the numerical result this again demonstrates that the effect of the coda wave is limited after the propagation of a solitary wave at the position of wg 3 the theoretical solution underestimates the amplitude of the transmitted wave a similar phenomenon is also observed in jaf and wang 2015 generally the theoretical solution is satisfactory with a non dimensional submerged depth smaller than 0 5 and solitary wave nonlinearity smaller than 0 3 as the non dimensional submerged height increases large energy dissipation and wave breaking will occur this makes the theoretical solution less suitable the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results indicates that although there is a coda wave the proposed method is capable of accurately generating solitary waves it should be mentioned that the legend presented in the top sub figure of fig 23 is the overall legend for all the sub figures at the position of x 1 0 l 99 the experimental result is not available while at the position of wg 2 the theoretical result is not available the comparison of the experimental and numerical velocity distributions is displayed in fig 24 the first row lists the velocity distribution in the pre breaking stage while the second row lists the velocity distribution in the post breaking stage the biggest deviation observed is in the vertical velocity distribution appearing in the post breaking stage at the position of x 9 22 m the reason for the mismatch might be the use of the laminar model which is supposed to be inappropriate to for simulating this kind of turbulence process i e flow separation for the present study since the mesh sensitivity test the validation of the numerical model and the determination of enhanced factors are all conducted under the laminar condition it is logical to apply the numerical model under the laminar condition for further simulation furthermore in figs 23 and 24 the overall agreement between the experimental and numerical results is satisfactory the phenomenon demonstrates that for this problem the use of the laminar model could yield a relatively good result if the numerical setting used is appropriate however the above analysis does not mean the turbulence model is totally unnecessary in the simulation we believe that if turbulence models are used the result will be improved 7 conclusions in this study a line shaped mass source internal wavemaker was proposed for generating shallow and intermediate water waves the formula for determining source region distribution was derived under the linear wave condition after reasonable simplifications the only unknown parameter during wave generation was an enhanced factor that depends on the weighted combination of h l and d l based on a mesh refinement study the effect of the undesirable downward velocity was discussed the velocity adjustment was introduced to eliminate this undesirable velocity it was observed that the effect of the undesirable velocity is significantly weakened the value of the enhanced factor was investigated in the case of intermediate water waves the independent variable for curve fitting was derived it was demonstrated that the derived independent variable is sufficiently accurate to represent wave properties subsequently the formula for calculating the enhanced factor was obtained by curve fitting in the case of shallow water waves the values of the enhanced factor were equal to 1 and therefore curve fitting was not performed finally the formula for calculating the value of the enhanced factor was obtained eq 47 the proposed method was also compared with other existing methods compared with the two published internal source wavemakers the present wavemaker can yield better results more conveniently because the source region could be determined according to different target waves compared with the piston type wavemaker it was demonstrated that the present wavemaker can generate nonlinear waves relatively accurately although it is derived under the condition of linear shallow water waves two cases of wave structure interactions were simulated using the proposed method the good agreement observed between the numerical and experimental results indicated that the formula obtained in this study is sufficient for providing a relatively good estimation of the enhanced factor value accordingly such a line shaped mass source method can be an alternative wave generation approach when a mass source internal wavemaker is

21149,seven stiffened panels subjected to in plane longitudinal compression are tested to investigate the load carrying capacity of the specimens which are considered as part of the hull girder of ship structures the initial deflections have been measured before testing which is used to determine the realistic levels of plate distortions the strain gauges are set on the plate stiffeners and frames to record the evolution of strain distribution of the stiffened panels under compressive loading to study the influence of the unsupported lateral edges on the plates narrow and wide panels having two and four stiffeners are adopted the experimental results of the present study are compared with the other test results it is found that the constraint on the end loading edges and on the lateral edges of the stiffened panels are very important the imposed compressive load is symmetrical to reduce the influence of the boundary conditions keywords ship stiffened panel test longitudinal

strength of the stiffened panels 1 introduction the stiffened panels of ship structures on the deck or bottom need to sustain in plane compression due to the longitudinal bending moment caused by the still water and waves to design the economic and safe ships it is vital to assess the collapse strength of stiffened panels which is a complex task as it includes the combined effect of geometries non linear materials initial imperfections residual stresses and load combination when these aspects are accounted for the accurate prediction of collapse strength for stiffened panel becomes difficult the experimental approach is a good way to calibrate the proposed calculation methods many kinds of geometric models and boundary configurations have been used to study the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels by means of experimental programs for instance instead of one span model mathewson and vinner 1962 and horne and narayanan 1976 adopted three spans panels to consider the interference of adjacent members and to reduce the influence of the eccentricity of load application faulkner 1977 and smith 1979 used large models with multi spans on experimental programs of stiffened panels with longitudinal compression tanaka and endo 1988 and ghavami 1994 also employed three spans stiffened panels supported by two transverse frames for in plane compression tests which were intended to make sure the collapse of the central span and to reduce the influence of the boundary conditions based on the two previous tests a series of simulations were performed by ghavami and khedmati 2006 to investigate the effect of the cross section shape and the number of spans and stiffeners shanmugam 1996 and chen et al 1997 also performed collapse strength tests of stiffened plates under the combination of in plane and lateral loads they found that the ultimate strength decreases with the increase of plate slenderness ratio hu et al 1997 adopted discrete constrains on the longitudinal unloaded edges in the grillage system to approximate the symmetric boundary conditions and the transverse edges were supported by pins that provide in plane compression and allow rotation using experimental and numerical methods the effect of influential aspects on the collapse strength of stiffened panels were investigated by grondin et al 1999 and sheikh et al 2003 including bending moments initial deflections residual stresses and the dimensional combination of plate and stiffener gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 and 2012 conducted series experimental studies as well aimed at comparing a new shape of u stiffeners to be used in very fast ships made of ultra high strength steels h690 with panels reinforced by the usual shapes of stiffeners instead of single span panels the specimens with three spans longitudinally were adopted in order to consider the effect of adjacent member and reduce the effect of boundary conditions problems that was vital luís et al 2008a 2008b in these researches many kinds of geometric models and boundary configurations were adopted in the collapse tests of stiffened panels it is very important to investigate the influence of geometry and boundary condition on the collapse strength of stiffened panels specimen with 1 2 1 1 2 spans were selected for discussing the dimensional and similarity behaviour between full and small scale stiffened panels with various buckling modes as in song et al 2019 furthermore various boundary conditions and spans have been investigated by xu and guedes soares 2011 2012a which shows that the two or three spans model with simply or clamped support at the end edges of the stiffened panels could reduce the influence of load eccentricity and account for the influence of neighbouring members to verify this conclusion in the numerical analyses and then develop an experimental program the stiffened panels with two spans under longitudinal compression were tested to investigate the collapse behaviour xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b for the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans the lateral displacement at the loading edge of the outer 1 2 span was constrained which is different from the actual boundary in ship structures and might overestimate the collapse strength of stiffened panels xu and guedes soares 2012b 2013c the present experiment using three spans aims to investigate the effect of geometric model and boundary condition on the collapse strength of stiffened panels which belong to the extended series tests of the panels with two spans xu and guedes soares 2012b 2013a the motive of the present paper is to develop a relevant experimental program for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel for marine applications 2 description of the models in the experiment since full scale model tests are more expensive and are more difficult to conduct in laboratory conditions small scale specimens are used in the present study the collapse behaviour of small scale specimens cannot completely represent the behaviour of actual stiffened plates of ship structures since the complete similitude is not fulfilled but it is possible to have partial similitude of stiffened panels song et al 2019 moreover the experimental results for small scale models can be used to validate finite element models which can be used to analyse full scale models the effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during buckling are different for wide and narrow panels hence the test specimens consist of plates with two and 4 bar stiffeners to account for the influence of the geometrical variation in the transverse direction the geometrical dimensions of the stiffened panels are based on typical members from an actual type of ship s hull structure gordo and guedes soares 1993 changing the length of the stiffened panels will induce various collapse modes and the purpose of the present paper is to determine a reasonable configuration of the geometry and supporting system for the compressive testing of stiffened panels more combinations of various dimensions could be considered in the numerical simulations after the tests the dimensions of the models are the same as adopted in the tests of box girders of gordo and guedes soares 2004 2009 2014 2015 the master curves average stress strain curves will be used to further studies of the ultimate strength of hull girders hence the width and thickness of the plates are the same herein fig 1 and table 1 show the coordinate system and the dimensions of the specimens in which l s and b are the length and width of plates and the width of stiffened panels respectively the yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the plate stiffener and frame are 483 mp 200000 mpa and 0 3 the thickness of the plate and stiffener are 4 mm and 8 mm and the height of the flat bars is 30 mm twenty points for each specimen have been defined for the measurements of thickness along the plates and stiffeners surfaces in which the average value are 4 01 mm and 8 03 mm for the plates and stiffeners respectively the meanings of specimens name are explained as follows the dimensional variables that influence the collapse strength of stiffened panels are given by 1 plate slenderness β s t p σ y d e 2 column slenderness λ l e π r σ y d e 3 radius of gyration r i a effective width of plate φ p is assessed by faulkner 1975 4 φ p 2 β 1 β 2 where le is the buckling length of stiffeners that relate to the constraint condition at the end edges which are l and 0 6l for simply and clamped supports iacs 2014 respectively l is the spacing between transverse frames a is the area of stiffeners with attached plate there exists rotation at the end of testing specimens which is more like simply supported boundary conditions hence le is taken as l in the theoretical analysis 3 experimental setup fig 2 shows the supporting system and boundary conditions of the specimen in the experiment a 300 ton hydraulic press is used to move the steel block in the longitudinal x direction to generate a compressive force until the stiffened panels collapse a load sensor is also set up on the support of the piston of the hydraulic press to record the compressive load a displacement transducer with a measuring range of 50 mm and an accuracy of 0 1 is fixed to the steel block which is used to measure the longitudinal movement of the support connected with the piston the end edges of specimens a1b1 a4b4 in fig 1 laid on the v groove steel see fig 2 f in which the rotation degree around the plate edge is not constrained to approximate the simply supported boundary condition the out plane displacements z direction at the frame are supported by two steel bars that are put in a u shape groove which allows the frames to move in the longitudinal direction and to be constrained in the lateral out plane movement the lateral support on the frames by the u shape groove is close to the plate at e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 and is close to the flange of the frame at f2 and f3 for the other panels in figs 1 and 2 there are no constraints on the unloaded longitudinal edges a1a4 b1b4 in fig 1 a displacement transducer is also installed at the central of the plates t1 to record the lateral displacement in fig 1 a b and fig 2 c the welding procedure of the plates can cause distortion and residual stresses in the specimens the initial geometric deflection influences significantly the collapse strength of stiffened panels the specified value of initial imperfection in the codes e g iacs csr might be different from the actual one hence a displacement transducer has been used to measure the initial imperfections of the plates before testing see fig 3 the measurement paths 50 mm apart have been defined along the plate surface which based on the procedure adopted by kmiecik et al 1995 the residual stresses of stiffened panels are not measured in the present tests due to the absence of the measurement equipment eight uniaxial strain gauges with 10 mm length are installed on the specimens to record the strain histories and the corresponding positions are given in fig 4 the labels are denoted as e1 to e8 representing different locations of the strain gauges the strain gauges on the plate middle e g e1 e2 and e3 for fb2a3f6 are used to give the information of the buckling mode in the transverse direction and the strain gauges on e3 e6 and e7 reflect the differences of strain distribution in the longitudinal direction the strain gauges e7 and e8 for the specimens fb2b3f6 and fb4a3f6 are set on the stiffeners which can provide the tripping buckling behaviour of the stiffeners the strain gauge e6 for the specimen fb2b3f6 is set on the frame intending to monitor the stress state to check if the frame structure is strong enough 4 analysis of initial imperfections to describe statistically the initial deflections realistic and acceptance levels of imperfections are important in the calculations from the design and inspection viewpoints the initial geometrical imperfections measured are shown in fig 5 the maximum amplitude of plate distortions has been used to study the irregular spatial distribution by faulkner 1975 and sommerville et al 1977 it was found that the distortion of plate can be isolated as twisting and bending displacement and represented by fourier series czujko and kmiecik 1975 kaminski 1990 the initial deflection on each plate was approximated as follows kmiecik et al 1995 5 w 0 x y sin π y s i 1 3 w 0 i 1 sin i π x l where l is the length of plate s is the width of plate fig 6 illustrates the distributions of the measurement distortions of the plates for the statistical data of the plate distortions two types of distributions are considered the normal and the weibull distributions the coefficients wmax w0 11 w0 21 and w0 31 are retrieved from the plates imperfections data including the present test specimens and those used in xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b the mean values x and standard deviations ρ are calculated as shown in table 2 the hypotheses of the distribution types are verified by means of the kolmogorov smirnov and chi square goodness of fit tests at the 5 level of significance the results show that wmax and w0 11 are approximated to be weibull distributions and w0 21 and w0 31 are modelled to be normal distributions the statistical data of the initial deflection of plates are shown in table 2 due to limitations of the measurement equipment the data of the stiffening elements are not included in the study the geometrical initial imperfection prescribed in the iacs csr requirements 2014 is the minimum of l 250 s 250 10 in mm where l and s are the length and width of the plates respectively the sum of x for w0 11 w0 21 and w0 31 is 0 46 mm which is smaller than the 0 60 mm prescribed by the iacs csr requirements 2014 one of the reasons causing this difference is that the formulas in the iacs csr requirements 2014 were developed from the measurement data of actual ship structures and the specimens used in the present tests are small scale models it was found that the most influential parameters of plate distortions are the aspect ratio l s and the slenderness s t and to a lesser degree the stiffener web thickness tw antoniou 1980 antoniou et al 1984 this phenomenon should be paid attention when the formulas in the iacs csr requirements are used to assess the initial imperfection for small scale models when the method of statistical analysis is used to investigate the acceptance levels of imperfections it is very important that different dimensions and types of ship structures should be considered for obtaining reliable results the measured geometrical initial imperfections can be used in the further numerical analysis 5 analysis of testing results the average stress of specimens is calculated as the imposed force divided by the area of the cross section the average strain representing the structural shortening is the ratio of longitudinal displacement to the length of stiffened panels the load magnitude at the beginning is very small fig 7 because there exist gaps between the end edges of stiffened panels and the supports which would be rearranged with the increase of compression this shortening stage with low stresses is not included in the analysis because of lack of interest the initial two loading cycles might cause the redistribution of the residual stress at the parts with large initial deflection and result in the shortening of longitudinal length at the firstly contact parts then the first and second load cycles have been made to improve the contact on the loaded edges and release part of welding residual stress which should not produce significant plastic deformation there are residual strains during the first and second loading cycles which are mainly caused by the release of welding residual stress actually the maximum magnitudes in the initial loading cycles are difficult to be estimated for releasing the residual stress of welding the maximum compression load for first and second loading cycles are around 1 4 and 1 2 of load carrying capacity that assessed by the numerical analysis in advance see table 3 after two initial loading cycles the third loading cycle is applied until collapse and post buckling and then totally discharge the collapse strength of the specimens in the tests are shown in table 3 fig 8 shows the average stresses average strain relationships of the stiffened panels and the corresponding structural modulus assessed by the linear regression method the detailed regression analysis of the loading cycles shows that the average stress average strain relationships during first loading cycle are nonlinear however the ones in the final cycles are almost linear at the beginning stage this indicates that the stiffened panels and the supports would fully contact each other after the first and second loading cycles the maximum external strength during first and second loading cycles are around 100 mpa and 200 mpa which are both lower than the yield stress of the steel material this illustrates that the specimens should be still in the elastic stage it can be seen that the structural modulus of the stiffened panel in the first loading cycle is smaller than that of the other two load cycles because there are gaps between the specimens and the supporting v groove due to fabrication defects see fig 2 f the redistribution of internal residual stress and rearrangement of deformations during first loading will promote some shakedown of average stress average strain curves the average stress average strain relationships of the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners are very close for the stiffened panels with 200 mm frame space the maximum average stress iss achieved at the third loading cycle with a value of 387 mpa and 371 mpa for the panels fb2a3f6 and fb2b3f6 which only have a 1 6 difference this means that the number of stiffeners only influences slightly the ultimate strength for stocky stiffened panels however the results between the narrow and wide stiffened panels with longer frame spacing are very different the average stress of the narrow panel fb3a3f6 has two close peak values which reached the absolute maximum 263 mpa with 3 8 mm m shortening and then reduced slightly to 238 mpa and increased again until second peak 249 mpa with 5 8 mm m shortening it seems that there exits unexpected premature failure for the narrow panels which causes that the load carrying capacities to be underestimated the ultimate strength of the narrow and wide stiffened panels are different which has not been expected before testing from fig 9 the narrow specimens with longer steel bar have less lateral constraint stiffness than that of wide ones which causes the loading carry capability of the narrow panels to be underestimated when the frames are not or are inefficiently supported in the lateral direction the buckling length le of stiffener in column slenderness should be 3l which would give smaller ultimate strength according to eq 2 another aspect should be that the dissipated energies of the residual stress during the first and second loading cycles are different between the narrow and wide stiffened panels one approach to evaluate the level of residual stress is based on the dissipated energy on each cycle of loading which assumes that the material has an elastic perfectly plastic behaviour and the neutral axis does not move during the loading path the evaluation of the dissipated energy in each cycle of loading is given by gordo and guedes soares 2004 6 e d f d z where ed energy dissipated the f the axial load and dz the displacement increment at the loading point when the external loads have been discharged totally after the first and second cycles the residual longitudinal strains between the first and the second load cycles are 1 5 mm m and 0 5 mm m for the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3b3f6 respectively which correspond to different energy dissipation between them it can be seen that the average energy dissipated of the narrow panel fb3a3f6 during the first and second loading cycles is larger than that of the wide one fb3b3f6 from fig 8 b moreover some of experiments of the narrow panels may have not been conducted well the stiffened panels collapsed at the outer span for the fb3a3f6 fig 10 but at the central span for fb3b3f6 which would underestimate the loading carry capacity the uniformity of axial strains during first loading cycle might be improved by reducing the gap between the end edges of the specimens and supporting structure the average structural modulus is defined as the slope of the average stress average strain curve of stiffened panels in fig 8 it can be observed that the initial average structural moduli of the narrow and wide stiffened panels are very close during the final loading cycle which means that the geometrical range affect slightly on the structural modulus the structural moduli of the stiffened panels are smaller than the young modulus of steel material because the three spans do not collapse at the same time and thus a localization of deformation decrease the overall shortening of the stiffened panels the stiffened panels were put on the v groove that is similar to simply supported boundary conditions at the end transverse edges which may give weaker rotation constraint on the loading edge for the outer span than that of the central one this inefficient constraint causes the collapse to be localized in the outer span as shown in fig 10 resulting in the reduction of the average stress for smaller increase in average overall strain and then the structural modulus it is necessary that the constraint at the transverse edges of the test specimens should be large enough to make sure that the central span collapse first in the test eight strain gauges fig 4 are installed on the plates stiffeners and frames to record the histories of the strain during loading which could be used to understand the collapse process of specimens for most of the specimens the strain distributions in the transverse direction on the central plate are non uniform during loading and unloading process as shown in fig 11 fig 13 such as the panel fb2b3f6 at the earlier stage of the loading during the final cycle loading the strain distribution on the plate shows the magnification of strain with the increase of external longitudinal compression in fig 12 a during the unloading stage the strain distributions at e1 e5 are still non uniform and the strains nearby the stiffeners at e2 e4 and e5 increase more quickly than those at e1 and e3 in fig 14 because the transverse edges of specimens and the supporting system of v groove are not fully contact with each other due to fabrication defects this will cause the extreme non uniform strain distributions relative to the narrow panel fig 11 a the wide one fig 12 a has more symmetrical strain distribution in the transverse direction during loading and give more obvious buckling wave shape after unloading although the wide panel to some degree can reduce some of the uncertainty of the non uniform support at the loading edge relative to the narrow one the stiffened panel with more stiffeners can t still eliminate the problem of unsymmetrical supports however for the panel fb3a3f8 it can be seen that there is an obvious buckling wave after collapse which is almost symmetrical as shown in fig 15 the distribution evolution of strain for the panel fb3a3f8 is different from the others which is caused by the different lateral support position of the frames in the experiments as shown in fig 2 the lateral support of the frames by the steel bar is close to the plate on e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 and is close to the flange of the frame on f2 and f3 for the other panels in figs 1 and 2 a c the stiffened panels are on a support steel block and then the axial compression caused by the longitudinal movement of the hydraulic press does not actually go through the neutral axis of the specimens which causes the eccentricity of the loading and thus the support position on the frames is very important the eccentric load caused by external compression can cause the rotation of the frames with respect to the f2 and f3 for the panel fb3a3f6 and e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 fig 1 c respectively which produced the difference of load carrying capacity around 17 and the evolution of the strain distributions between the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3a3f8 with the increase of external compression the out plane deformations of the specimens and rotations of the frame around shear centre of cross section are observed which is on the web and close to the plate when the effective attached plating is included from the comparisons of the strain evolution it is found that the lateral constraint of the frame close to plate side can reduce the eccentricity of loading hence it is vital to keep the external loads going through the neutral axis in the design of supporting system for the collapse experiment a displacement transducer has been set up on the central span t1 in fig 1 to record the lateral displacements of the stiffened panels with 300 mm and 400 mm length as shown in fig 16 for the panel fb3a3f6 after the imposed load is totally discharged in the first load cycle the residual lateral displacement on t1 is 1 3 mm which should be the gap distance between the frame and the u bar support in fig 2 since the whole structure are still elastic at this moment the residual lateral displacements on t1 are close after the first load cycle which are 1 3 mm 1 5 mm and 1 2 mm for the panels fb3a3f6 fb3a3f8 and fb3a3f6 respectively however it is difficult to eliminate completely the gaps between the panels and the u guide bars during fabrication and installation of the support structures which can be considered as the experimental uncertainty moreover the stiffened panels have the same boundary condition at the transverse end edges but the steel bar connected are set on the stiffeners and plate sides for the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3a3f8 see fig 2 b c respectively this may also cause the lateral displacements to be different between them because the stiffened panels have been put on a steel block the axial compression did not actually go through the neutral axis of the specimens which would cause the out plane eccentricity load the directions of out plane deformation on the central spans of the panels fb4a3f6 and fb4b3f6 are opposite after collapse fig 16 b the lateral deformation is very sensitive to the constraint side on the frames and the gaps between the supporting systems of the specimen the lateral support on the frames is very important for the load carrying capacity and thus the influence of the gaps should be eliminated as much as possible in test it is suggested that the support on the frame is set on the plate side to make sure the longitudinal compression go through neutral axial of cross section of the stiffener instead of the flange of frame 6 discussion a series of experimental results for scaled models conducted by xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and ghavami and khedmati 2006 are compared herein which include different number of longitudinal stiffeners two and four stiffeners frame spacing and number of spans the dimensions of the test specimens of ghavami and khedmati 2006 are given in table 4 fig 17 a shows the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels in the tests of ghavami and khedmati 2006 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and the present tests based on the test results a regression analysis is used to derive a linear expression see fig 17 the percentage of the experimental results within the 20 error band is 17 and the coefficient r2 of multiple determination is 0 6 which illustrates that there exists a significant scatter of the experimental results actually the experimental data are very different themselves even for the same structural dimensions hence to improve the accuracy of the experimental results it is very important to properly design the geometry of the test specimens and supporting system in the test program the support at the end edges of the stiffened panels are the same for the two and three spans specimens in the tests however it can be seen that the results for the stiffened panels with three spans are generally lower than those with two spans in fig 17 because of the outer half spans of the two spans specimen provide larger rotation stiffness for central span than that of the three spans the 1 2 1 1 2 spans models generally collapsed at the central spans in the test xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b which can avoid the outer span collapse first but might slightly overestimate the ultimate strength of stiffened panel because the rotation stiffness of the outer half span is larger than that of one full span when the models with three full spans are adopted in the tests most of the stiffened panels collapse in the outer span see fig 10 instead of the central span which may underestimate the load carrying capacity this phenomenon also happened in the tests of gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 2012 see fig 18 hence the initial intent of the present paper is to improve the configuration of the boundary setup in the test program the constraint at the end of the stiffened panel in the present tests is still deficient which causes the level of rotational stiffness on the end edge for the outer span not to be large enough and should be further improved although the perfect clamped boundary condition is difficult to apply in laboratory conditions the constraint should also be strong enough to avoid the rotation of stiffeners at the end edges in which the bolt or weld connection between the end edges of testing specimen and support system is suggested for three full spans model the mean value of the ultimate strength of the wide panels is 17 larger than that of the narrow ones the percentage of the total cross section area with reduced effectiveness due to unsupported lateral edges for the wide panels is smaller than that for the narrow ones this means that the stiffened panels with large geometrical dimensions should be less affected by the lack of effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during buckling the non uniform strain distributions might be caused by the imposed unsymmetrical loading and by the local high levels of imperfections or residual stresses which decrease the loading carry capacity of the stiffened panels this phenomenon is more obviously in the narrow panels than that in the wide ones hence the constraint conditions on the end loading edges and frame of the stiffened panels are both very important the imposed compressive load should be symmetrical to reduce the influence of boundary conditions when the same support system is used in the narrow and wide panels the narrow panel has a longer steel bar than the wide one to support the frames in the tests resulting that the narrow panels have weaker lateral stiffness provided by the steel bar which reduces the loading carrying capability of the narrow panels relative to wide ones 7 conclusions the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners under in plane compressive load are tested to investigate their collapse behaviour the conclusions are given as follows 1 there are two types of distributions of the plate geometrical initial imperfections which are approximated to be normal distribution for wmax and w0 11 and weibull distribution for w0 21 and w0 31 that can be used for the reliability analysis 2 the lateral support configurations for the frame is also very important in the collapse tests of the stiffened panels the support position for the frame is recommended to be on the intersection of the web and plate instead of the flange the rotation stiffness at the end loading edges should also be strong enough to make the central span to buckle first 3 the wide panels should be less affected by the non uniformity of the support of the loading considering the existing uncertainty of fabrication and the lack of effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during

21149,seven stiffened panels subjected to in plane longitudinal compression are tested to investigate the load carrying capacity of the specimens which are considered as part of the hull girder of ship structures the initial deflections have been measured before testing which is used to determine the realistic levels of plate distortions the strain gauges are set on the plate stiffeners and frames to record the evolution of strain distribution of the stiffened panels under compressive loading to study the influence of the unsupported lateral edges on the plates narrow and wide panels having two and four stiffeners are adopted the experimental results of the present study are compared with the other test results it is found that the constraint on the end loading edges and on the

strength of the stiffened panels 1 introduction the stiffened panels of ship structures on the deck or bottom need to sustain in plane compression due to the longitudinal bending moment caused by the still water and waves to design the economic and safe ships it is vital to assess the collapse strength of stiffened panels which is a complex task as it includes the combined effect of geometries non linear materials initial imperfections residual stresses and load combination when these aspects are accounted for the accurate prediction of collapse strength for stiffened panel becomes difficult the experimental approach is a good way to calibrate the proposed calculation methods many kinds of geometric models and boundary configurations have been used to study the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels by means of experimental programs for instance instead of one span model mathewson and vinner 1962 and horne and narayanan 1976 adopted three spans panels to consider the interference of adjacent members and to reduce the influence of the eccentricity of load application faulkner 1977 and smith 1979 used large models with multi spans on experimental programs of stiffened panels with longitudinal compression tanaka and endo 1988 and ghavami 1994 also employed three spans stiffened panels supported by two transverse frames for in plane compression tests which were intended to make sure the collapse of the central span and to reduce the influence of the boundary conditions based on the two previous tests a series of simulations were performed by ghavami and khedmati 2006 to investigate the effect of the cross section shape and the number of spans and stiffeners shanmugam 1996 and chen et al 1997 also performed collapse strength tests of stiffened plates under the combination of in plane and lateral loads they found that the ultimate strength decreases with the increase of plate slenderness ratio hu et al 1997 adopted discrete constrains on the longitudinal unloaded edges in the grillage system to approximate the symmetric boundary conditions and the transverse edges were supported by pins that provide in plane compression and allow rotation using experimental and numerical methods the effect of influential aspects on the collapse strength of stiffened panels were investigated by grondin et al 1999 and sheikh et al 2003 including bending moments initial deflections residual stresses and the dimensional combination of plate and stiffener gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 and 2012 conducted series experimental studies as well aimed at comparing a new shape of u stiffeners to be used in very fast ships made of ultra high strength steels h690 with panels reinforced by the usual shapes of stiffeners instead of single span panels the specimens with three spans longitudinally were adopted in order to consider the effect of adjacent member and reduce the effect of boundary conditions problems that was vital luís et al 2008a 2008b in these researches many kinds of geometric models and boundary configurations were adopted in the collapse tests of stiffened panels it is very important to investigate the influence of geometry and boundary condition on the collapse strength of stiffened panels specimen with 1 2 1 1 2 spans were selected for discussing the dimensional and similarity behaviour between full and small scale stiffened panels with various buckling modes as in song et al 2019 furthermore various boundary conditions and spans have been investigated by xu and guedes soares 2011 2012a which shows that the two or three spans model with simply or clamped support at the end edges of the stiffened panels could reduce the influence of load eccentricity and account for the influence of neighbouring members to verify this conclusion in the numerical analyses and then develop an experimental program the stiffened panels with two spans under longitudinal compression were tested to investigate the collapse behaviour xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b for the stiffened panels with 1 2 1 1 2 spans the lateral displacement at the loading edge of the outer 1 2 span was constrained which is different from the actual boundary in ship structures and might overestimate the collapse strength of stiffened panels xu and guedes soares 2012b 2013c the present experiment using three spans aims to investigate the effect of geometric model and boundary condition on the collapse strength of stiffened panels which belong to the extended series tests of the panels with two spans xu and guedes soares 2012b 2013a the motive of the present paper is to develop a relevant experimental program for predicting the load carrying capacity of stiffened panel for marine applications 2 description of the models in the experiment since full scale model tests are more expensive and are more difficult to conduct in laboratory conditions small scale specimens are used in the present study the collapse behaviour of small scale specimens cannot completely represent the behaviour of actual stiffened plates of ship structures since the complete similitude is not fulfilled but it is possible to have partial similitude of stiffened panels song et al 2019 moreover the experimental results for small scale models can be used to validate finite element models which can be used to analyse full scale models the effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during buckling are different for wide and narrow panels hence the test specimens consist of plates with two and 4 bar stiffeners to account for the influence of the geometrical variation in the transverse direction the geometrical dimensions of the stiffened panels are based on typical members from an actual type of ship s hull structure gordo and guedes soares 1993 changing the length of the stiffened panels will induce various collapse modes and the purpose of the present paper is to determine a reasonable configuration of the geometry and supporting system for the compressive testing of stiffened panels more combinations of various dimensions could be considered in the numerical simulations after the tests the dimensions of the models are the same as adopted in the tests of box girders of gordo and guedes soares 2004 2009 2014 2015 the master curves average stress strain curves will be used to further studies of the ultimate strength of hull girders hence the width and thickness of the plates are the same herein fig 1 and table 1 show the coordinate system and the dimensions of the specimens in which l s and b are the length and width of plates and the width of stiffened panels respectively the yield stress young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the plate stiffener and frame are 483 mp 200000 mpa and 0 3 the thickness of the plate and stiffener are 4 mm and 8 mm and the height of the flat bars is 30 mm twenty points for each specimen have been defined for the measurements of thickness along the plates and stiffeners surfaces in which the average value are 4 01 mm and 8 03 mm for the plates and stiffeners respectively the meanings of specimens name are explained as follows the dimensional variables that influence the collapse strength of stiffened panels are given by 1 plate slenderness β s t p σ y d e 2 column slenderness λ l e π r σ y d e 3 radius of gyration r i a effective width of plate φ p is assessed by faulkner 1975 4 φ p 2 β 1 β 2 where le is the buckling length of stiffeners that relate to the constraint condition at the end edges which are l and 0 6l for simply and clamped supports iacs 2014 respectively l is the spacing between transverse frames a is the area of stiffeners with attached plate there exists rotation at the end of testing specimens which is more like simply supported boundary conditions hence le is taken as l in the theoretical analysis 3 experimental setup fig 2 shows the supporting system and boundary conditions of the specimen in the experiment a 300 ton hydraulic press is used to move the steel block in the longitudinal x direction to generate a compressive force until the stiffened panels collapse a load sensor is also set up on the support of the piston of the hydraulic press to record the compressive load a displacement transducer with a measuring range of 50 mm and an accuracy of 0 1 is fixed to the steel block which is used to measure the longitudinal movement of the support connected with the piston the end edges of specimens a1b1 a4b4 in fig 1 laid on the v groove steel see fig 2 f in which the rotation degree around the plate edge is not constrained to approximate the simply supported boundary condition the out plane displacements z direction at the frame are supported by two steel bars that are put in a u shape groove which allows the frames to move in the longitudinal direction and to be constrained in the lateral out plane movement the lateral support on the frames by the u shape groove is close to the plate at e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 and is close to the flange of the frame at f2 and f3 for the other panels in figs 1 and 2 there are no constraints on the unloaded longitudinal edges a1a4 b1b4 in fig 1 a displacement transducer is also installed at the central of the plates t1 to record the lateral displacement in fig 1 a b and fig 2 c the welding procedure of the plates can cause distortion and residual stresses in the specimens the initial geometric deflection influences significantly the collapse strength of stiffened panels the specified value of initial imperfection in the codes e g iacs csr might be different from the actual one hence a displacement transducer has been used to measure the initial imperfections of the plates before testing see fig 3 the measurement paths 50 mm apart have been defined along the plate surface which based on the procedure adopted by kmiecik et al 1995 the residual stresses of stiffened panels are not measured in the present tests due to the absence of the measurement equipment eight uniaxial strain gauges with 10 mm length are installed on the specimens to record the strain histories and the corresponding positions are given in fig 4 the labels are denoted as e1 to e8 representing different locations of the strain gauges the strain gauges on the plate middle e g e1 e2 and e3 for fb2a3f6 are used to give the information of the buckling mode in the transverse direction and the strain gauges on e3 e6 and e7 reflect the differences of strain distribution in the longitudinal direction the strain gauges e7 and e8 for the specimens fb2b3f6 and fb4a3f6 are set on the stiffeners which can provide the tripping buckling behaviour of the stiffeners the strain gauge e6 for the specimen fb2b3f6 is set on the frame intending to monitor the stress state to check if the frame structure is strong enough 4 analysis of initial imperfections to describe statistically the initial deflections realistic and acceptance levels of imperfections are important in the calculations from the design and inspection viewpoints the initial geometrical imperfections measured are shown in fig 5 the maximum amplitude of plate distortions has been used to study the irregular spatial distribution by faulkner 1975 and sommerville et al 1977 it was found that the distortion of plate can be isolated as twisting and bending displacement and represented by fourier series czujko and kmiecik 1975 kaminski 1990 the initial deflection on each plate was approximated as follows kmiecik et al 1995 5 w 0 x y sin π y s i 1 3 w 0 i 1 sin i π x l where l is the length of plate s is the width of plate fig 6 illustrates the distributions of the measurement distortions of the plates for the statistical data of the plate distortions two types of distributions are considered the normal and the weibull distributions the coefficients wmax w0 11 w0 21 and w0 31 are retrieved from the plates imperfections data including the present test specimens and those used in xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b the mean values x and standard deviations ρ are calculated as shown in table 2 the hypotheses of the distribution types are verified by means of the kolmogorov smirnov and chi square goodness of fit tests at the 5 level of significance the results show that wmax and w0 11 are approximated to be weibull distributions and w0 21 and w0 31 are modelled to be normal distributions the statistical data of the initial deflection of plates are shown in table 2 due to limitations of the measurement equipment the data of the stiffening elements are not included in the study the geometrical initial imperfection prescribed in the iacs csr requirements 2014 is the minimum of l 250 s 250 10 in mm where l and s are the length and width of the plates respectively the sum of x for w0 11 w0 21 and w0 31 is 0 46 mm which is smaller than the 0 60 mm prescribed by the iacs csr requirements 2014 one of the reasons causing this difference is that the formulas in the iacs csr requirements 2014 were developed from the measurement data of actual ship structures and the specimens used in the present tests are small scale models it was found that the most influential parameters of plate distortions are the aspect ratio l s and the slenderness s t and to a lesser degree the stiffener web thickness tw antoniou 1980 antoniou et al 1984 this phenomenon should be paid attention when the formulas in the iacs csr requirements are used to assess the initial imperfection for small scale models when the method of statistical analysis is used to investigate the acceptance levels of imperfections it is very important that different dimensions and types of ship structures should be considered for obtaining reliable results the measured geometrical initial imperfections can be used in the further numerical analysis 5 analysis of testing results the average stress of specimens is calculated as the imposed force divided by the area of the cross section the average strain representing the structural shortening is the ratio of longitudinal displacement to the length of stiffened panels the load magnitude at the beginning is very small fig 7 because there exist gaps between the end edges of stiffened panels and the supports which would be rearranged with the increase of compression this shortening stage with low stresses is not included in the analysis because of lack of interest the initial two loading cycles might cause the redistribution of the residual stress at the parts with large initial deflection and result in the shortening of longitudinal length at the firstly contact parts then the first and second load cycles have been made to improve the contact on the loaded edges and release part of welding residual stress which should not produce significant plastic deformation there are residual strains during the first and second loading cycles which are mainly caused by the release of welding residual stress actually the maximum magnitudes in the initial loading cycles are difficult to be estimated for releasing the residual stress of welding the maximum compression load for first and second loading cycles are around 1 4 and 1 2 of load carrying capacity that assessed by the numerical analysis in advance see table 3 after two initial loading cycles the third loading cycle is applied until collapse and post buckling and then totally discharge the collapse strength of the specimens in the tests are shown in table 3 fig 8 shows the average stresses average strain relationships of the stiffened panels and the corresponding structural modulus assessed by the linear regression method the detailed regression analysis of the loading cycles shows that the average stress average strain relationships during first loading cycle are nonlinear however the ones in the final cycles are almost linear at the beginning stage this indicates that the stiffened panels and the supports would fully contact each other after the first and second loading cycles the maximum external strength during first and second loading cycles are around 100 mpa and 200 mpa which are both lower than the yield stress of the steel material this illustrates that the specimens should be still in the elastic stage it can be seen that the structural modulus of the stiffened panel in the first loading cycle is smaller than that of the other two load cycles because there are gaps between the specimens and the supporting v groove due to fabrication defects see fig 2 f the redistribution of internal residual stress and rearrangement of deformations during first loading will promote some shakedown of average stress average strain curves the average stress average strain relationships of the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners are very close for the stiffened panels with 200 mm frame space the maximum average stress iss achieved at the third loading cycle with a value of 387 mpa and 371 mpa for the panels fb2a3f6 and fb2b3f6 which only have a 1 6 difference this means that the number of stiffeners only influences slightly the ultimate strength for stocky stiffened panels however the results between the narrow and wide stiffened panels with longer frame spacing are very different the average stress of the narrow panel fb3a3f6 has two close peak values which reached the absolute maximum 263 mpa with 3 8 mm m shortening and then reduced slightly to 238 mpa and increased again until second peak 249 mpa with 5 8 mm m shortening it seems that there exits unexpected premature failure for the narrow panels which causes that the load carrying capacities to be underestimated the ultimate strength of the narrow and wide stiffened panels are different which has not been expected before testing from fig 9 the narrow specimens with longer steel bar have less lateral constraint stiffness than that of wide ones which causes the loading carry capability of the narrow panels to be underestimated when the frames are not or are inefficiently supported in the lateral direction the buckling length le of stiffener in column slenderness should be 3l which would give smaller ultimate strength according to eq 2 another aspect should be that the dissipated energies of the residual stress during the first and second loading cycles are different between the narrow and wide stiffened panels one approach to evaluate the level of residual stress is based on the dissipated energy on each cycle of loading which assumes that the material has an elastic perfectly plastic behaviour and the neutral axis does not move during the loading path the evaluation of the dissipated energy in each cycle of loading is given by gordo and guedes soares 2004 6 e d f d z where ed energy dissipated the f the axial load and dz the displacement increment at the loading point when the external loads have been discharged totally after the first and second cycles the residual longitudinal strains between the first and the second load cycles are 1 5 mm m and 0 5 mm m for the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3b3f6 respectively which correspond to different energy dissipation between them it can be seen that the average energy dissipated of the narrow panel fb3a3f6 during the first and second loading cycles is larger than that of the wide one fb3b3f6 from fig 8 b moreover some of experiments of the narrow panels may have not been conducted well the stiffened panels collapsed at the outer span for the fb3a3f6 fig 10 but at the central span for fb3b3f6 which would underestimate the loading carry capacity the uniformity of axial strains during first loading cycle might be improved by reducing the gap between the end edges of the specimens and supporting structure the average structural modulus is defined as the slope of the average stress average strain curve of stiffened panels in fig 8 it can be observed that the initial average structural moduli of the narrow and wide stiffened panels are very close during the final loading cycle which means that the geometrical range affect slightly on the structural modulus the structural moduli of the stiffened panels are smaller than the young modulus of steel material because the three spans do not collapse at the same time and thus a localization of deformation decrease the overall shortening of the stiffened panels the stiffened panels were put on the v groove that is similar to simply supported boundary conditions at the end transverse edges which may give weaker rotation constraint on the loading edge for the outer span than that of the central one this inefficient constraint causes the collapse to be localized in the outer span as shown in fig 10 resulting in the reduction of the average stress for smaller increase in average overall strain and then the structural modulus it is necessary that the constraint at the transverse edges of the test specimens should be large enough to make sure that the central span collapse first in the test eight strain gauges fig 4 are installed on the plates stiffeners and frames to record the histories of the strain during loading which could be used to understand the collapse process of specimens for most of the specimens the strain distributions in the transverse direction on the central plate are non uniform during loading and unloading process as shown in fig 11 fig 13 such as the panel fb2b3f6 at the earlier stage of the loading during the final cycle loading the strain distribution on the plate shows the magnification of strain with the increase of external longitudinal compression in fig 12 a during the unloading stage the strain distributions at e1 e5 are still non uniform and the strains nearby the stiffeners at e2 e4 and e5 increase more quickly than those at e1 and e3 in fig 14 because the transverse edges of specimens and the supporting system of v groove are not fully contact with each other due to fabrication defects this will cause the extreme non uniform strain distributions relative to the narrow panel fig 11 a the wide one fig 12 a has more symmetrical strain distribution in the transverse direction during loading and give more obvious buckling wave shape after unloading although the wide panel to some degree can reduce some of the uncertainty of the non uniform support at the loading edge relative to the narrow one the stiffened panel with more stiffeners can t still eliminate the problem of unsymmetrical supports however for the panel fb3a3f8 it can be seen that there is an obvious buckling wave after collapse which is almost symmetrical as shown in fig 15 the distribution evolution of strain for the panel fb3a3f8 is different from the others which is caused by the different lateral support position of the frames in the experiments as shown in fig 2 the lateral support of the frames by the steel bar is close to the plate on e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 and is close to the flange of the frame on f2 and f3 for the other panels in figs 1 and 2 a c the stiffened panels are on a support steel block and then the axial compression caused by the longitudinal movement of the hydraulic press does not actually go through the neutral axis of the specimens which causes the eccentricity of the loading and thus the support position on the frames is very important the eccentric load caused by external compression can cause the rotation of the frames with respect to the f2 and f3 for the panel fb3a3f6 and e2 and e3 for the panel fb3a3f8 fig 1 c respectively which produced the difference of load carrying capacity around 17 and the evolution of the strain distributions between the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3a3f8 with the increase of external compression the out plane deformations of the specimens and rotations of the frame around shear centre of cross section are observed which is on the web and close to the plate when the effective attached plating is included from the comparisons of the strain evolution it is found that the lateral constraint of the frame close to plate side can reduce the eccentricity of loading hence it is vital to keep the external loads going through the neutral axis in the design of supporting system for the collapse experiment a displacement transducer has been set up on the central span t1 in fig 1 to record the lateral displacements of the stiffened panels with 300 mm and 400 mm length as shown in fig 16 for the panel fb3a3f6 after the imposed load is totally discharged in the first load cycle the residual lateral displacement on t1 is 1 3 mm which should be the gap distance between the frame and the u bar support in fig 2 since the whole structure are still elastic at this moment the residual lateral displacements on t1 are close after the first load cycle which are 1 3 mm 1 5 mm and 1 2 mm for the panels fb3a3f6 fb3a3f8 and fb3a3f6 respectively however it is difficult to eliminate completely the gaps between the panels and the u guide bars during fabrication and installation of the support structures which can be considered as the experimental uncertainty moreover the stiffened panels have the same boundary condition at the transverse end edges but the steel bar connected are set on the stiffeners and plate sides for the panels fb3a3f6 and fb3a3f8 see fig 2 b c respectively this may also cause the lateral displacements to be different between them because the stiffened panels have been put on a steel block the axial compression did not actually go through the neutral axis of the specimens which would cause the out plane eccentricity load the directions of out plane deformation on the central spans of the panels fb4a3f6 and fb4b3f6 are opposite after collapse fig 16 b the lateral deformation is very sensitive to the constraint side on the frames and the gaps between the supporting systems of the specimen the lateral support on the frames is very important for the load carrying capacity and thus the influence of the gaps should be eliminated as much as possible in test it is suggested that the support on the frame is set on the plate side to make sure the longitudinal compression go through neutral axial of cross section of the stiffener instead of the flange of frame 6 discussion a series of experimental results for scaled models conducted by xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and ghavami and khedmati 2006 are compared herein which include different number of longitudinal stiffeners two and four stiffeners frame spacing and number of spans the dimensions of the test specimens of ghavami and khedmati 2006 are given in table 4 fig 17 a shows the ultimate strength of the stiffened panels in the tests of ghavami and khedmati 2006 xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b and the present tests based on the test results a regression analysis is used to derive a linear expression see fig 17 the percentage of the experimental results within the 20 error band is 17 and the coefficient r2 of multiple determination is 0 6 which illustrates that there exists a significant scatter of the experimental results actually the experimental data are very different themselves even for the same structural dimensions hence to improve the accuracy of the experimental results it is very important to properly design the geometry of the test specimens and supporting system in the test program the support at the end edges of the stiffened panels are the same for the two and three spans specimens in the tests however it can be seen that the results for the stiffened panels with three spans are generally lower than those with two spans in fig 17 because of the outer half spans of the two spans specimen provide larger rotation stiffness for central span than that of the three spans the 1 2 1 1 2 spans models generally collapsed at the central spans in the test xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b which can avoid the outer span collapse first but might slightly overestimate the ultimate strength of stiffened panel because the rotation stiffness of the outer half span is larger than that of one full span when the models with three full spans are adopted in the tests most of the stiffened panels collapse in the outer span see fig 10 instead of the central span which may underestimate the load carrying capacity this phenomenon also happened in the tests of gordo and guedes soares 2008 2011 2012 see fig 18 hence the initial intent of the present paper is to improve the configuration of the boundary setup in the test program the constraint at the end of the stiffened panel in the present tests is still deficient which causes the level of rotational stiffness on the end edge for the outer span not to be large enough and should be further improved although the perfect clamped boundary condition is difficult to apply in laboratory conditions the constraint should also be strong enough to avoid the rotation of stiffeners at the end edges in which the bolt or weld connection between the end edges of testing specimen and support system is suggested for three full spans model the mean value of the ultimate strength of the wide panels is 17 larger than that of the narrow ones the percentage of the total cross section area with reduced effectiveness due to unsupported lateral edges for the wide panels is smaller than that for the narrow ones this means that the stiffened panels with large geometrical dimensions should be less affected by the lack of effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during buckling the non uniform strain distributions might be caused by the imposed unsymmetrical loading and by the local high levels of imperfections or residual stresses which decrease the loading carry capacity of the stiffened panels this phenomenon is more obviously in the narrow panels than that in the wide ones hence the constraint conditions on the end loading edges and frame of the stiffened panels are both very important the imposed compressive load should be symmetrical to reduce the influence of boundary conditions when the same support system is used in the narrow and wide panels the narrow panel has a longer steel bar than the wide one to support the frames in the tests resulting that the narrow panels have weaker lateral stiffness provided by the steel bar which reduces the loading carrying capability of the narrow panels relative to wide ones 7 conclusions the stiffened panels with two and four stiffeners under in plane compressive load are tested to investigate their collapse behaviour the conclusions are given as follows 1 there are two types of distributions of the plate geometrical initial imperfections which are approximated to be normal distribution for wmax and w0 11 and weibull distribution for w0 21 and w0 31 that can be used for the reliability analysis 2 the lateral support configurations for the frame is also very important in the collapse tests of the stiffened panels the support position for the frame is recommended to be on the intersection of the web and plate instead of the flange the rotation stiffness at the end loading edges should also be strong enough to make the central span to buckle first 3 the wide panels should be less affected by the non uniformity of the support of the loading considering the existing uncertainty of fabrication and the lack of effectiveness at the unloaded free edges during
