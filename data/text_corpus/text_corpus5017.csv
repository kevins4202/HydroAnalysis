25085,dengue fever a vector borne disease represents a priority public health problem in ecuador previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector aedes aegypti is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior however the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features in this study we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in ecuador the maximum entropy algorithm maxent was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of aedes aegypti under current and future 2050 climatic conditions using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors the model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment additionally we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression pls r to predict the number of total dengue cases tdc and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the pls r population density elevation and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito s geographical distribution maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the tdc in the ecuadorian coast region the results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050 the temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from march to june and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018 these results present a good intel for solutions of reduction of dengue cases in the country this further will allow the responsible authorities to pinpoint proper vector control measurements by province abbreviations auc area under the curve maxent

climate change ecuador 1 introduction dengue fever is one of the most extensively spread vector borne diseases in latin america and the caribbean where low income countries are particularly susceptible to its effects due to social cultural economic and environmental factors stewart ibarra et al 2013 heydari et al 2017 aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus are the primary vectors transmitting the dengue virus in rural and urban areas around the world fatima et al 2016 in ecuador dengue fever became evident after the introduction of serotype den1 in 1988 and gained strength after the entry of serotype den2 in 1990 and den4 in 1993 real cotto et al 2017 in 2000 the introduction of serotype den3 and the asian genotype of den2 was reported since then the number of severe cases has increased initially in adults and later in children alava et al 2005 the transmission of dengue fever is considered as endemic throughout the year showing epidemic cycles that usually coincide with the rainy season when conditions favor accelerated vector reproduction ministerio de salud pública 2013 jácome et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that mosquito population dynamics are influenced by climate variability chowell and sanchez 2006 chowell et al 2011 which affects larval growth adult biting rates gonotrophic development and the extrinsic incubation period of the virus in the mosquito stewart ibarra et al 2013 the geographic distribution and life cycle of the major vector aedes aegypti are climate sensitive mosquito borne diseases are thus strongly associated with environmental factors karim et al 2012 fatima et al 2016 however issues such as climate change socioeconomics settlements globalization and viral evolution can also influence the spread of dengue which can be worsened by inadequate disease surveillance difficulties in diagnosis and low levels of reporting anne et al 2013 climate can influence the dengue vector in diverse ways a heavy rainfall can increase the availability of habitat for juvenile mosquitos but it can also flush away eggs and larvae from containers whereas drought can influence mosquito abundance through water storage in houses stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 on the other hand high temperatures can reduce the viral incubation time and increase mosquito mortality naish et al 2014 in order to analyze those patterns the spatial and temporal suitability for dengue fever can be mathematically modeled using species distribution models sdms and machine learning techniques where occurrence records and environmental variables are integrated in the context of transmission modeling to propose future public health interventions and surveillance systems several studies have determined the climatic suitability for mosquitos in tropical and subtropical regions around the world to identify priority areas for vector control actions and surveillance systems mweya et al 2013 cardoso leite et al 2014 fischer et al 2014 kraemer et al 2015 fatima et al 2016 koch et al 2016 in south america chowell et al 2011 analyzed differences in the timing of dengue epidemics between two geographical regions in peru and found that they were potentially connected with the timing of the seasonal cycle of mean temperature arboleda et al 2011 compared two models to map the ecological niche and dynamics of breeding sites for aedes aegypti in bello colombia in ecuador stewart ibarra et al 2014 studied the dengue vector in urban sectors of the ecuadorian coast to assess the influence of social and climatic factors especially during outbreaks however a national scale study is needed in ecuador to enable preventive actions in areas with a greater probability of dengue infection in this study we implemented a spatial analysis using the maximum entropy algorithm maxent to identify mosquito suitable habitat and thereby the areas at risk of infection using current and future climatic conditions a comparative evaluation of the model performance was carried out at the national and coast region levels to select the most accurate model assess collinearity issues and determine whether microclimatic variability across the ecuadorian highlands andes mountains influences model performance complementarily we applied a partial least square regression pls r to acquire a temporal analysis and assess the climatic factors that influence dengue cases in the coastal regions of ecuador developing an outbreak prediction model for each coastal ecuadorian province 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and presence records this study focuses on a national scale as a first analysis and on the coast region of ecuador as a second analysis since this is the region with more influential climatic variables affecting the occurrence of dengue cases stewart ibarra et al 2013 ecuador is a country with tropical characteristics based on its latitudinal location fig 1 however its three clearly identified regions have climatic and microclimatic variability based on their geographic features pourrut 1983 the coast region which is the area most affected by dengue disease has a humid and tropical climate with a rainy season that extends from january to may and a dry season from june to december this region registers the circulation of all four serotypes of dengue virus identified in the country and is considered to be the most affected since dengue re emerged in the country in 1988 stewart ibarra et al 2013 dengue has increased during the past decade even with ongoing vector control interventions stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 reports of outbreaks or epidemics are registered in approximately 70 of the country real cotto et al 2017 however the total number of dengue cases can vary in each province table 1 due to socioeconomic and population features along with vector ecology and its relationship with local climate and the el niño southern oscillation stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 in ecuador dengue fever is managed by the ministry of health through the national service for the control of vector borne diseases which develops year round vector control campaigns that intensify leading up to and during the rainy season stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 real cotto et al 2017 for this reason our objective in this research is to identify areas for priority attention and determine the climatic factors that influence the spatial and temporal trends of dengue fever in ecuador for this study the ministry of health of ecuador which operates a disease surveillance system that collects information about all clinically suspected cases of dengue fever provided the number of dengue cases without warning signs reported by week in health centers and hospitals in urban and rural areas during 2013 2014 and 2015 we considered the sites where dengue was reported as records of the presence of aedes aegypti with a total of 984 points at the national level for the sites at which occurrences were not georeferenced and only location names were provided a standard procedure was used to assign coordinates using the geonames website www geonames org the moran s i method was applied to the dengue fever data using arcmap 10 1 to test whether dengue cases were randomly distributed in space stewart ibarra et al 2014 jácome et al 2019 where 1 shows good negative spatial autocorrelation dispersed 0 indicates perfect spatial randomness and 1 proves positive spatial autocorrelation clustered tu and xia 2008 jácome et al 2019 2 2 environmental variables temperature precipitation elevation and population density were used to determine the distribution of aedes aegypti the annual seasonal and intra seasonal temperatures and precipitation layers were obtained as bioclimatic variables from the worldclim website http www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 with 1 km of spatial resolution for current and future conditions projection for 2050 the a2 emission scenario of the intergovernmental panel on climate change was used to generate the future projection because it is currently considered to be the most accurate nakicenovic and sward 2000 cardoso leite et al 2014 a digital elevation model was downloaded from the consortium for spatial information website with 250 m of spatial resolution jarvis et al 2008 the human population density was obtained using worldpop products www worldpop org uk with a spatial resolution of 100 m all of these environmental variables were resampled using the resample tool in arcmap 10 1 to provide a spatial resolution of 100 m to all of them 2 3 spatial analysis modeling procedure species distribution models sdms are the most important tools that have been used widely to predict the suitable habitat of a particular species using either presence or presence and absence data along with physical and environmental variables assumed to influence its distribution alava et al 2005 cardoso leite et al 2014 kraemer et al 2015 varela et al 2015 moya et al 2017 sdms can be vulnerable to variable selection porfirio et al 2014 when they are performed with a large dataset of correlated variables which can result in multicollinearity moya et al 2017 a statistical feature that can cause problems in estimating parameters because it expands the variance of regression parameters possibly generating incorrect identifications in the model dormann et al 2013 in this study we generated our model at the national level and the coast region level to observe whether the model performance was influenced by collinearity issues or micro climatic variability across the andes mountains we constructed a specific model for the coast region because it consistently registers the highest number of dengue cases in ecuador bioclimatic variables are well known to have a high correlation that can differ spatially fatima et al 2016 therefore we used principal component analysis pca to remove multicollinearity identifying uncorrelated variables through the varimax loading analysis dormann et al 2013 fatima et al 2016 the number of principal components pcs was selected based on the cumulative variance percentage johnson and wichern 1992 four pcs showed a variance higher than 85 we selected the variables with loadings greater than the proportional variance shown by the pca 0 473 for the national level and 0 366 for the coast region level table 2 since they represent 10 of variance for the variable being explained by the pc axes dormann et al 2013 six variables were selected for the national level and a set of 13 variables was identified as uncorrelated for the coast region level there were developed four models with different specifications model 1 used all 19 bioclimatic variables at a national level model 2 included only the plain non correlated variables and the physical factors at the national level model 3 and 4 follow similar procedure for only the coast region level fig 2 for each model future suitability was obtained using the variables projected for 2050 in this way we obtained two models the first one shows dengue fever climatic suitability under current conditions and the second one shows the suitability under future conditions 2050 because data showing vector absence are not usually found we used the maxent software phillips et al 2017 for its capacity to deal with presence only records fatima et al 2016 which makes it suitable for constructing ecological niche and risk models alava et al 2005 cardoso leite et al 2014 moya et al 2017 maxent is a machine learning technique that shows a probability distribution based on maximizing the entropy subject with a logistic model output showing the predicted suitability of conditions for the species in each grid cell ranging from 0 not suitable to 1 suitable fox and estay 2016 koch et al 2016 to generate the national and coast region level models we assigned 75 of the presence records as training data and 25 as test data in the software settings we used the random seed selection method to ensure that the model used different sets of presence records for training and testing on every replication the jackknife test was generated to calculate variable importance and variable contributions were obtained to identify the single variable most effective in predicting distribution the model performance was determined using the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc this method corresponds to a plot of sensitivity versus 1 specificity and calculates the ability of the maxent model to differentiate between presence and background sites phillips and dudik 2008 fox and estay 2016 jácome et al 2019 where sensitivity corresponds to the fraction of observed presences predicted by the model and measures omission errors and specificity is the fraction of observed absences predicted as such and measures commission errors cardoso leite et al 2014 the auc value indicates predictive precision using the following categories excellent 1 0 90 good 0 9 0 8 acceptable 0 8 0 7 bad 0 7 0 6 and invalid 0 6 0 5 araujo et al 2005 jácome et al 2019 the final maps were generated using arcmap 10 1 2 4 temporal analysis and future estimations additional climate data on daily humidity rainfall maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed sunshine and cloudiness were provided by the oceanographic institute of the army of ecuador the data from four weather stations located across the coastal region are from 2013 2014 and 2015 complementary data for the remaining coastal provinces were provided by the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador for the same study period the galapagos province was excluded from this temporal analysis due to its low rate of dengue cases missing weather station data were estimated by interpolation with information from the closest station using the inverse distance weight method in arcgis 10 1 this technique gives higher weights to the cells nearest the original values assuming that objects closer to one another are more comparable than those farther away ifaei et al 2017 jácome et al 2018 all data were used in a temporal analysis to identify the climatic factors that influence dengue cases in the coast region of ecuador as well as to predict those cases in a pls r which can handle collinearity and is commonly used to analyze a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors li et al 2002 the prediction is made by obtaining orthogonal factors known as latent variables from the predictors with the most accurate predictive capacity and achieve the least squares regression on those factors rather than on the original data helland 1990 johnson and wichern 1992 climatic factors were used as independent variables and the total number of dengue cases tdc was used as the dependent variable in the pls r for each province in the coast region the variables with non normal distribution were log transformed to get a better estimate because the data showed positive skewness skewness 4 44 the dependent variable was also log transformed for the regression karim et al 2012 the data set was centered and standardized since the variables are not measured on the same units the accuracy of the model was evaluated using the q2 and r2 of the dependent variable values of variable importance in the projection vip were used to identify the factors with the most influence in the models those values range in ascending order with values 1 considered important and those 0 5 considered unimportant values between 1 and 0 5 inhabit a gray area in which the importance of the variables depends on the size of the data eriksson et al 2001 model validation was performed with simca software using a permutation validity testing technique in the training dataset of this method the independent variables hold intact and the numerical value of dependent variable remains identical but it changes its position randomly then another pls r is made for the new permutated data where r2 and q2 are calculated using cross validation with the aim of comparing them with the previous results of model accuracy and examine their significance the same procedure is run according to the number of permutations that have been selected eriksson et al 2001 islam 2012 we estimated future dengue cases using the predictive equation generated by the pls r for this all independent variables were estimated to the year 2020 using an autoregressive model in which a new predictor variable was generated using the original variable lagged by one or more periods based on the quality of the results significant p value 0 001 faruk and durdu 2010 zarzalejo et al 2010 jácome et al 2019 the auto regression is expressed by the following equation y t b 0 i 1 p b i y t i e t where yt represents the dependent variable values at moment t bi yt i are the matrices of coefficients to be calculated and et is vector of error terms which are correlated with each other but uncorrelated with their own lags and yt the lag length p was set at 12 which correspond to one year of data sadorsky 2006 zarzalejo et al 2010 3 results 3 1 statistical performance of sdms the dengue fever presence data were significantly clustered moran s i 0 336 p value 0 001 with a less than 1 likelihood that this clustered pattern could be the result of chance higher concentrations of occurrence and clusters occurred in the coast region than elsewhere two models were generated at the national level model 1 included all 19 bioclimatic variables and model 2 used the uncorrelated bioclimatic variables identified by pca and the physical parameters two additional models were elaborated using the ecuadorian coast region as the study area model 3 used the 19 bioclimatic covariates and model 4 used the main non correlated variables both models 3 and 4 also used elevation and population the modeling results revealed excellent performance for current conditions and acceptably good performance for the future conditions 2050 according to the auc evaluation categories araujo et al 2005 however different results were obtained when the study area was reduced at the national level no improvement was observed when collinearity was removed model 1 with all the bioclimatic variables showed similar spatial predictive capacity auc 0 911 than model 2 auc 0 913 and the two models of future conditions 2050 revealed a better performance for model 1 auc 0 845 than for model 2 auc 0 809 interestingly better performance was observed for current and future conditions when the study area covered only the coast region and collinearity was eliminated this result correspond to model 4 which obtained a training auc 0 930 higher than model 3 auc 0 923 a similar result was observed in the model of 2050 conditions model 4 obtained a higher training auc 0 900 than model 3 auc 0 848 this outcome suggests that maxent tends to perform better in relatively flat areas when collinearity is removed and that a varied landscape with micro climatic diversity and steep biogeographic gradients can influence model performance for this reason and because the coastal region is the most affected by dengue fever we report only the results obtained with model 4 3 2 suitable habitat under current and future climatic conditions the coast region of ecuador reported 645 localities affected by dengue fever during 2013 2015 with the provinces of guayas manabí and el oro having the greatest number of occurrences the maxent modeling results revealed a high probability of aedes aegypti distribution across four provinces guayas los rios el oro and manabí except the north section under current climatic conditions fig 3 a esmeraldas and santa elena showed a high probability of distribution around areas with high population density the galapagos islands did not show a highly suitable habitat for the mosquito which matches with its low rate of dengue disease as shown in table 1 the mosquito s suitable habitat under the a2 climate change scenario for 2050 reveals an increase in the probability of spatial distribution across the region fig 3b and the areas currently under a high probability 0 7 of suitability will reach a very high occurrence probability 0 9 1 thus the incidence of dengue fever is likely to increase in the peripheral areas around urban centers and in rural areas of guayas los rios el oro and manabí all variables used to run model 4 were assessed using the jackknife test population elevation and temperature are the most important variables as shown by their regularized training gain values fig 4 a population is the variable that can decrease the gain the most by its omission reducing it from 1 25 to 0 65 the highest regularized gain among the bioclimatic variables was for the mean temperature of the warmest quarter bio10 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio08 and annual mean temperature bio01 fig 4a thus temperature plays an important role in mosquito distribution dynamics the response curves of one variable models of the most important environmental variables were additionally identified by the jackknife test the curves present variations in the probability distribution of aedes aegypti according to each environmental covariate fig 4b the response curve of mosquito to population probes the increase in mosquito presence as population density increases considering elevation the curve shows that the most suitable habitat in the coast region is in areas with an altitude between 0 and 120 m a s l with a lower probability of occurrence up to 600 m a s l further increases in elevation cause gradual suitability decreases populations stabilize in a temperature range of 27 c 30 c for both covariates 3 3 climatic factors influencing dengue cases the tdc reported in the coast region during 2013 2015 varied by year a similar number was reported for 2013 n 10 054 and 2014 n 12 321 but many more cases were registered in 2015 n 37 239 indicating an outbreak of great magnitude in each year dengue cases revealed a specific pattern of occurrence which is well known to be related to climatic variables the monthly average of climatic parameters such as the tmax tmin humidity and rainfall for all the provinces in the coast region are found to influence the dengue outbreaks fig 5 from march the temperature and number of dengue cases were increased similarly while the temperature decreased in the months of june and july the dengue cases decreased gradually fig 5a a similar pattern is followed for the parameters of average humidity and rainfall when these increased about two months before the outbreak periods and finished two months before the dengue cases began to diminish fig 5b the log transformation of tdc was predicted using pls r with monthly climatic data from the study period 2013 2015 for each coastal province the variance inflation factor vif was applied to assess the multicollinearity of all 7 climatic variables used in the pls r for each province the results present small vif values indicating low correlation among variables under ideal conditions vif 10 the standardized residuals of each model ranged between 1 8 and 2 0 suggesting minimal outliers in the dataset the scatter plots of the standardized residuals versus the standardized predicted values expose a largely symmetrical distribution suggesting the required constant variance for the models pls r was performed using two latent variables which accounted for a cumulative variance higher than 90 the model statistics for predicting log tdc obtained a q2 ranging from 0 411 to 0 558 mean square errors close to zero indicating a fit appropriate for prediction and a coefficient of determination r2 between 0 501 and 0 698 table 3 similar values for r2 have been obtained in previous research that applied regression methods islam 2012 karim et al 2012 young et al 2016 the vip values summarize the importance of the variables in terms of explaining the independent variables and correlating them with the dependent variable table 3 the climatic variables obtained different vip results for each province however tmin and tmax were important in all of them which suggests that temperature has an important influence in the mosquito lifecycle in the ecuadorian coast region humidity was important in guayas santa elena and santo domingo rainfall was important in the provinces that reported the highest precipitation during the study period interestingly sunshine was also important in four of the seven coastal provinces the regression equation was used to predict tdc showing that the predicted curve properly follows the intra seasonal variability of dengue risk in all the provinces although the model predicted a slightly lower number of dengue cases than was observed during high outbreaks with the highest at 2015 fig 6 thus caution is essential when interpreting results during an outbreak the observed and predicted tdc for the study period 2013 2015 showed a significant correlation with spearman correlation coefficient values 0 705 and significant p values p 0 05 in all the provinces simca software was used to implement a validity testing technique applying 25 permutations for the two latent variables of the seven models the criteria suggested to check the validity of a model establish that all q2 values to the left of the permutations plot must be lower than the original points in the right or the regression line of the q2 values must intersect the vertical axis at or below zero islam 2012 considering these criteria a positive conclusion was made about the validity of the models performed in this study since the plots of each model met the established conditions log tdc was estimated to the year 2020 using an autoregressive model to predict the climatic conditions and putting those predicted conditions into the regression equations previously obtained for each province the regression plot presented a good model performance r2 0 89 for all provinces showing when the outbreaks will occur rather than just predicting an exact number of future cases fig 7 the most important finding of this approach is that provinces with the highest incidence of dengue fever show the likelihood of a large outbreak during 2018 beginning in march and lasting until august followed by a regrowth that varies by province santa elena and santo domingo with a low rate of cases show variability in the estimation but the highest records occur in months with climatic influences 4 discussion our aim in this study was to investigate the potential spatial distribution of dengue fever and the geographically suitable habitat for aedes aegypti under current and future climatic conditions in ecuador as well as to identify the most influential variables over time using maxent models many studies have shown better performance when collinearity is removed cruz cardenas et al 2013 moya et al 2017 qin et al 2017 which we also observed in model 4 for the coast region however we did not detect that effect in model 2 at the national level our results suggest that removing collinearity is a good option as long as the study area is homogeneous in addition data limitations were faced for accomplishing a full spatio temporal analysis the temporal dataset of cases of dengue were incomplete in some areas of ecuador as the disease was not continuously monitored throughout the years in the country similarly the spatial dataset of presence of the mosquito species showed missing data at some locations of the country however the spatial analysis showed that the physical factors used in this research are very important to the success of this species in the ecuadorian coast region this mosquito is well known for its close association with human settlements due to the human blood feeding behavior fatima et al 2016 of its adult females and its preference for tropical climates and low altitudes chowell et al 2011 elevation the second most important variable influencing the spatial distribution is a factor connected with the climatic variables that determine the mosquito s ideal habitat and regulate its physiological behavior increasing elevations correlate with a progressive decrease in temperature and variation in rainfall fatima et al 2016 which means that high elevations can act as biogeographic barriers however a study conducted in colombia an andean country with geographic features similar to those in ecuador reported finding the mosquito at 2 302 m a s l and infection with dengue virus at 1 984 m a s l ruiz lópez et al 2016 which suggests changes in the distribution patterns of this vector in the andean region of ecuador the maximum elevation at which the mosquito could be present is 1500 m a s l suarez and nelson 1981 our results also show that aedes aegypti can find ideal conditions up to a mean temperature in the wettest quarter and warmest quarter of 25 c and 25 8 c respectively further research should update and strengthen current and future vector surveillance and control according to the literature optimal mosquito development including breeding sites for egg deposition occurs in locations with at least 500 mm of annual rainfall and a summer temperature between 25 c and 30 c medlock et al 2015 which is consistent with the results of our one variable response curves which identified similar ranges for rainfall and temperature during the warmest quarter thus the climatic influence is evident with a 1 2 month lag because mosquitos take 7 45 days to mature from an egg to an adult karim et al 2012 the model for the future panorama in the ecuadorian coast region contributes to the assumption that dengue vectors will extend their suitable habitat as the climate changes as has been reported by several researchers benedict et al 2007 anne et al 2013 fischer et al 2014 koch et al 2016 the world health organization who has stated that the endemicity of vector borne diseases will change and epidemics could take place in areas where they are presently unusual as a consequence of climate change who 2012 the most affected areas will be those hitherto unprepared to respond robustly to such events however the precision and predictive capacity of models seeking to determine future epidemiological scenarios influenced by climate change remain a source of considerable debate and investigation who 2012 temperature the most important climatic variable identified by the spatial and temporal analysis is an essential factor for the mosquito lifecycle that jointly with humidity affects both eggs and adults gu et al 2016 the models developed with two components could explain between 50 1 and 69 8 of the variability in the response variables for dengue cases the results show that the mean temperatures of the wettest and warmest quarters from the wet and dry seasons respectively influence mosquito geographic distribution and that tmax and tmin influence its temporal patterns tmin showed a slightly higher importance than tmax in the vip values to date there is a lack of studies about the ecological modeling of the dengue vector at the national or regional scale in ecuador however a research carried out in the southern coastal city of machala in el oro province corroborates our results the study found that minimum air temperature is a significant regulating climate factor for dengue fever stewart ibarra et al 2013 stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 they concluded that a gradual increase in minimum temperature caused by global warming could increase the number of optimal transmission days per year stewart ibarra et al 2013 in general an increase in atmospheric temperature would decrease the incubation period reduce the gonotrophic cycle and decrease the development rates of immature mosquitoes pant and yasuno 1973 stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 it would also affect mating behaviors and cause more rapid viral replication and longer mosquito survival gu et al 2016 humidity sunshine wind speed cloudiness and rainfall in that order showed lower importance scores in the temporal analysis their influence on dengue fever is complex but they are nonetheless essential in the management of the disease the high humidity of the rainy season can promote mosquito growth and survival which could increase the successful propagation of the virus wu et al 2007 karim et al 2012 barbazan et al 2010 reported that an intensification of mosquito longevity can disproportionately augment the number of potential transmissions by as much as five times when the survival rate rises from 0 80 to 0 95 relative humidity can also affect mating oviposition wu et al 2007 and newly laid eggs which are vulnerable to desiccation gu et al 2016 the coastal region of ecuador experiences an increase in sunshine duration from january to june which matches the increase in tdc sunshine can affect the behavior of the vector directly specifically with regard to its blood feeding during sunrise and sunset gu et al 2016 the wind speed parameter can be associated with rainfall because stormy days usually bring rain and wind together it s well known that precipitation and its interaction with human behavior can increase larval habitat through water stagnation which leads to a proliferation of vector populations stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 on the other hand excessive rain can eliminate habitats through flooding wu et al 2007 however a study showed that vector population densities were less susceptible to seasonal fluctuations in rainfall in localities where year round water storage containers are the main mosquito breeding sites barrera et al 2011 therefore household water storage is an important contributor to the rise of dengue risk stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 for this reason a more specific modeling approach is needed to include the specific social and ecological elements that influence aedes aegypti habitat in ecuador the climatic variables used in the temporal analysis should remain in the new model using historical and updated data to assess the strength of their associations we also suggest extending time series models and include geographical variation and thereby obtain more accurate surveillance information for the coast region predictions from such a model could provide an increased lead time for vector control interventions and develop early warning systems for efficient prevention of dengue fever outbreaks 5 conclusion the areas at risk for dengue virus infection are well established in and around populated areas of the coast region of ecuador with a high emphasis in the central and south region the maxent model projection for 2050 shows an increase in mosquito suitable habitat that would cause a large rise in dengue fever incidence especially around urban centers and in the rural areas of guayas los rios el oro and manabí provinces factors such as population elevation and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were identified as main contributors to the mosquito spatial pattern distribution a temporal analysis showed tmin and tmax to be the most important climatic variables in the prediction of dengue cases determining which factors influence the risk of dengue infection is important in controlling the spread of this disease and is essential in the development of predictive models for use as decision support tools and early warning systems therefore ecuadorian government institutions need to organize and facilitate access to climate vector and dengue virus information as a geospatial database to integrate the socioenvironmental factors that influence mosquito habitat and to generate appropriate intervention strategies the results from sdms with maxent showed better performance when collinearity was removed and the study area was relatively flat which indicates that a large steep geography with micro climatic variety can influence model performance when it is part of a wide section of the study area acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the ministry of health of ecuador for the dengue case data and to the oceanographic institute of the army of ecuador and the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador for the climatic data used in the temporal analysis this work was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the ministry of science and ict no 2017r1e1a1a03070713 and korea ministry of environment moe as graduate school specialized in climate change 
25085,dengue fever a vector borne disease represents a priority public health problem in ecuador previous studies indicated that the ecology of the transmitter vector aedes aegypti is influenced by environmental parameters and human behavior however the effects of those variables on mosquito population dynamics depend on local environmental features in this study we identified the most important factors influencing the risk of dengue virus infection in ecuador the maximum entropy algorithm maxent was used to determine the areas with a high probability of the presence of aedes aegypti under current and future 2050 climatic conditions using the location of reported dengue cases and potential environmental factors the model performance was quantified based on an accuracy assessment additionally we used meteorological data from the study period in a partial least square regression pls r to predict the number of total dengue cases tdc and then estimated the future number of cases using the equation obtained with the pls r population density elevation and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were found to be the most important variables influencing the mosquito s geographical distribution maximum temperature and minimum temperature were the climatic factors with the best projecting capacity in predicting the tdc in the ecuadorian coast region the results show a greater mosquito presence probability in populated areas with a considerable expansion of suitable habitat across the central and southern provinces by 2050 the temporal analysis revealed that the regional dengue outbreak season goes from march to june and the future estimation predicted that the next large outbreak would occur in 2018 these results present a good intel for solutions of

climate change ecuador 1 introduction dengue fever is one of the most extensively spread vector borne diseases in latin america and the caribbean where low income countries are particularly susceptible to its effects due to social cultural economic and environmental factors stewart ibarra et al 2013 heydari et al 2017 aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus are the primary vectors transmitting the dengue virus in rural and urban areas around the world fatima et al 2016 in ecuador dengue fever became evident after the introduction of serotype den1 in 1988 and gained strength after the entry of serotype den2 in 1990 and den4 in 1993 real cotto et al 2017 in 2000 the introduction of serotype den3 and the asian genotype of den2 was reported since then the number of severe cases has increased initially in adults and later in children alava et al 2005 the transmission of dengue fever is considered as endemic throughout the year showing epidemic cycles that usually coincide with the rainy season when conditions favor accelerated vector reproduction ministerio de salud pública 2013 jácome et al 2019 studies have demonstrated that mosquito population dynamics are influenced by climate variability chowell and sanchez 2006 chowell et al 2011 which affects larval growth adult biting rates gonotrophic development and the extrinsic incubation period of the virus in the mosquito stewart ibarra et al 2013 the geographic distribution and life cycle of the major vector aedes aegypti are climate sensitive mosquito borne diseases are thus strongly associated with environmental factors karim et al 2012 fatima et al 2016 however issues such as climate change socioeconomics settlements globalization and viral evolution can also influence the spread of dengue which can be worsened by inadequate disease surveillance difficulties in diagnosis and low levels of reporting anne et al 2013 climate can influence the dengue vector in diverse ways a heavy rainfall can increase the availability of habitat for juvenile mosquitos but it can also flush away eggs and larvae from containers whereas drought can influence mosquito abundance through water storage in houses stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 on the other hand high temperatures can reduce the viral incubation time and increase mosquito mortality naish et al 2014 in order to analyze those patterns the spatial and temporal suitability for dengue fever can be mathematically modeled using species distribution models sdms and machine learning techniques where occurrence records and environmental variables are integrated in the context of transmission modeling to propose future public health interventions and surveillance systems several studies have determined the climatic suitability for mosquitos in tropical and subtropical regions around the world to identify priority areas for vector control actions and surveillance systems mweya et al 2013 cardoso leite et al 2014 fischer et al 2014 kraemer et al 2015 fatima et al 2016 koch et al 2016 in south america chowell et al 2011 analyzed differences in the timing of dengue epidemics between two geographical regions in peru and found that they were potentially connected with the timing of the seasonal cycle of mean temperature arboleda et al 2011 compared two models to map the ecological niche and dynamics of breeding sites for aedes aegypti in bello colombia in ecuador stewart ibarra et al 2014 studied the dengue vector in urban sectors of the ecuadorian coast to assess the influence of social and climatic factors especially during outbreaks however a national scale study is needed in ecuador to enable preventive actions in areas with a greater probability of dengue infection in this study we implemented a spatial analysis using the maximum entropy algorithm maxent to identify mosquito suitable habitat and thereby the areas at risk of infection using current and future climatic conditions a comparative evaluation of the model performance was carried out at the national and coast region levels to select the most accurate model assess collinearity issues and determine whether microclimatic variability across the ecuadorian highlands andes mountains influences model performance complementarily we applied a partial least square regression pls r to acquire a temporal analysis and assess the climatic factors that influence dengue cases in the coastal regions of ecuador developing an outbreak prediction model for each coastal ecuadorian province 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and presence records this study focuses on a national scale as a first analysis and on the coast region of ecuador as a second analysis since this is the region with more influential climatic variables affecting the occurrence of dengue cases stewart ibarra et al 2013 ecuador is a country with tropical characteristics based on its latitudinal location fig 1 however its three clearly identified regions have climatic and microclimatic variability based on their geographic features pourrut 1983 the coast region which is the area most affected by dengue disease has a humid and tropical climate with a rainy season that extends from january to may and a dry season from june to december this region registers the circulation of all four serotypes of dengue virus identified in the country and is considered to be the most affected since dengue re emerged in the country in 1988 stewart ibarra et al 2013 dengue has increased during the past decade even with ongoing vector control interventions stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 reports of outbreaks or epidemics are registered in approximately 70 of the country real cotto et al 2017 however the total number of dengue cases can vary in each province table 1 due to socioeconomic and population features along with vector ecology and its relationship with local climate and the el niño southern oscillation stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 in ecuador dengue fever is managed by the ministry of health through the national service for the control of vector borne diseases which develops year round vector control campaigns that intensify leading up to and during the rainy season stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 real cotto et al 2017 for this reason our objective in this research is to identify areas for priority attention and determine the climatic factors that influence the spatial and temporal trends of dengue fever in ecuador for this study the ministry of health of ecuador which operates a disease surveillance system that collects information about all clinically suspected cases of dengue fever provided the number of dengue cases without warning signs reported by week in health centers and hospitals in urban and rural areas during 2013 2014 and 2015 we considered the sites where dengue was reported as records of the presence of aedes aegypti with a total of 984 points at the national level for the sites at which occurrences were not georeferenced and only location names were provided a standard procedure was used to assign coordinates using the geonames website www geonames org the moran s i method was applied to the dengue fever data using arcmap 10 1 to test whether dengue cases were randomly distributed in space stewart ibarra et al 2014 jácome et al 2019 where 1 shows good negative spatial autocorrelation dispersed 0 indicates perfect spatial randomness and 1 proves positive spatial autocorrelation clustered tu and xia 2008 jácome et al 2019 2 2 environmental variables temperature precipitation elevation and population density were used to determine the distribution of aedes aegypti the annual seasonal and intra seasonal temperatures and precipitation layers were obtained as bioclimatic variables from the worldclim website http www worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 with 1 km of spatial resolution for current and future conditions projection for 2050 the a2 emission scenario of the intergovernmental panel on climate change was used to generate the future projection because it is currently considered to be the most accurate nakicenovic and sward 2000 cardoso leite et al 2014 a digital elevation model was downloaded from the consortium for spatial information website with 250 m of spatial resolution jarvis et al 2008 the human population density was obtained using worldpop products www worldpop org uk with a spatial resolution of 100 m all of these environmental variables were resampled using the resample tool in arcmap 10 1 to provide a spatial resolution of 100 m to all of them 2 3 spatial analysis modeling procedure species distribution models sdms are the most important tools that have been used widely to predict the suitable habitat of a particular species using either presence or presence and absence data along with physical and environmental variables assumed to influence its distribution alava et al 2005 cardoso leite et al 2014 kraemer et al 2015 varela et al 2015 moya et al 2017 sdms can be vulnerable to variable selection porfirio et al 2014 when they are performed with a large dataset of correlated variables which can result in multicollinearity moya et al 2017 a statistical feature that can cause problems in estimating parameters because it expands the variance of regression parameters possibly generating incorrect identifications in the model dormann et al 2013 in this study we generated our model at the national level and the coast region level to observe whether the model performance was influenced by collinearity issues or micro climatic variability across the andes mountains we constructed a specific model for the coast region because it consistently registers the highest number of dengue cases in ecuador bioclimatic variables are well known to have a high correlation that can differ spatially fatima et al 2016 therefore we used principal component analysis pca to remove multicollinearity identifying uncorrelated variables through the varimax loading analysis dormann et al 2013 fatima et al 2016 the number of principal components pcs was selected based on the cumulative variance percentage johnson and wichern 1992 four pcs showed a variance higher than 85 we selected the variables with loadings greater than the proportional variance shown by the pca 0 473 for the national level and 0 366 for the coast region level table 2 since they represent 10 of variance for the variable being explained by the pc axes dormann et al 2013 six variables were selected for the national level and a set of 13 variables was identified as uncorrelated for the coast region level there were developed four models with different specifications model 1 used all 19 bioclimatic variables at a national level model 2 included only the plain non correlated variables and the physical factors at the national level model 3 and 4 follow similar procedure for only the coast region level fig 2 for each model future suitability was obtained using the variables projected for 2050 in this way we obtained two models the first one shows dengue fever climatic suitability under current conditions and the second one shows the suitability under future conditions 2050 because data showing vector absence are not usually found we used the maxent software phillips et al 2017 for its capacity to deal with presence only records fatima et al 2016 which makes it suitable for constructing ecological niche and risk models alava et al 2005 cardoso leite et al 2014 moya et al 2017 maxent is a machine learning technique that shows a probability distribution based on maximizing the entropy subject with a logistic model output showing the predicted suitability of conditions for the species in each grid cell ranging from 0 not suitable to 1 suitable fox and estay 2016 koch et al 2016 to generate the national and coast region level models we assigned 75 of the presence records as training data and 25 as test data in the software settings we used the random seed selection method to ensure that the model used different sets of presence records for training and testing on every replication the jackknife test was generated to calculate variable importance and variable contributions were obtained to identify the single variable most effective in predicting distribution the model performance was determined using the area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc this method corresponds to a plot of sensitivity versus 1 specificity and calculates the ability of the maxent model to differentiate between presence and background sites phillips and dudik 2008 fox and estay 2016 jácome et al 2019 where sensitivity corresponds to the fraction of observed presences predicted by the model and measures omission errors and specificity is the fraction of observed absences predicted as such and measures commission errors cardoso leite et al 2014 the auc value indicates predictive precision using the following categories excellent 1 0 90 good 0 9 0 8 acceptable 0 8 0 7 bad 0 7 0 6 and invalid 0 6 0 5 araujo et al 2005 jácome et al 2019 the final maps were generated using arcmap 10 1 2 4 temporal analysis and future estimations additional climate data on daily humidity rainfall maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin wind speed sunshine and cloudiness were provided by the oceanographic institute of the army of ecuador the data from four weather stations located across the coastal region are from 2013 2014 and 2015 complementary data for the remaining coastal provinces were provided by the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador for the same study period the galapagos province was excluded from this temporal analysis due to its low rate of dengue cases missing weather station data were estimated by interpolation with information from the closest station using the inverse distance weight method in arcgis 10 1 this technique gives higher weights to the cells nearest the original values assuming that objects closer to one another are more comparable than those farther away ifaei et al 2017 jácome et al 2018 all data were used in a temporal analysis to identify the climatic factors that influence dengue cases in the coast region of ecuador as well as to predict those cases in a pls r which can handle collinearity and is commonly used to analyze a set of dependent variables from a set of independent variables or predictors li et al 2002 the prediction is made by obtaining orthogonal factors known as latent variables from the predictors with the most accurate predictive capacity and achieve the least squares regression on those factors rather than on the original data helland 1990 johnson and wichern 1992 climatic factors were used as independent variables and the total number of dengue cases tdc was used as the dependent variable in the pls r for each province in the coast region the variables with non normal distribution were log transformed to get a better estimate because the data showed positive skewness skewness 4 44 the dependent variable was also log transformed for the regression karim et al 2012 the data set was centered and standardized since the variables are not measured on the same units the accuracy of the model was evaluated using the q2 and r2 of the dependent variable values of variable importance in the projection vip were used to identify the factors with the most influence in the models those values range in ascending order with values 1 considered important and those 0 5 considered unimportant values between 1 and 0 5 inhabit a gray area in which the importance of the variables depends on the size of the data eriksson et al 2001 model validation was performed with simca software using a permutation validity testing technique in the training dataset of this method the independent variables hold intact and the numerical value of dependent variable remains identical but it changes its position randomly then another pls r is made for the new permutated data where r2 and q2 are calculated using cross validation with the aim of comparing them with the previous results of model accuracy and examine their significance the same procedure is run according to the number of permutations that have been selected eriksson et al 2001 islam 2012 we estimated future dengue cases using the predictive equation generated by the pls r for this all independent variables were estimated to the year 2020 using an autoregressive model in which a new predictor variable was generated using the original variable lagged by one or more periods based on the quality of the results significant p value 0 001 faruk and durdu 2010 zarzalejo et al 2010 jácome et al 2019 the auto regression is expressed by the following equation y t b 0 i 1 p b i y t i e t where yt represents the dependent variable values at moment t bi yt i are the matrices of coefficients to be calculated and et is vector of error terms which are correlated with each other but uncorrelated with their own lags and yt the lag length p was set at 12 which correspond to one year of data sadorsky 2006 zarzalejo et al 2010 3 results 3 1 statistical performance of sdms the dengue fever presence data were significantly clustered moran s i 0 336 p value 0 001 with a less than 1 likelihood that this clustered pattern could be the result of chance higher concentrations of occurrence and clusters occurred in the coast region than elsewhere two models were generated at the national level model 1 included all 19 bioclimatic variables and model 2 used the uncorrelated bioclimatic variables identified by pca and the physical parameters two additional models were elaborated using the ecuadorian coast region as the study area model 3 used the 19 bioclimatic covariates and model 4 used the main non correlated variables both models 3 and 4 also used elevation and population the modeling results revealed excellent performance for current conditions and acceptably good performance for the future conditions 2050 according to the auc evaluation categories araujo et al 2005 however different results were obtained when the study area was reduced at the national level no improvement was observed when collinearity was removed model 1 with all the bioclimatic variables showed similar spatial predictive capacity auc 0 911 than model 2 auc 0 913 and the two models of future conditions 2050 revealed a better performance for model 1 auc 0 845 than for model 2 auc 0 809 interestingly better performance was observed for current and future conditions when the study area covered only the coast region and collinearity was eliminated this result correspond to model 4 which obtained a training auc 0 930 higher than model 3 auc 0 923 a similar result was observed in the model of 2050 conditions model 4 obtained a higher training auc 0 900 than model 3 auc 0 848 this outcome suggests that maxent tends to perform better in relatively flat areas when collinearity is removed and that a varied landscape with micro climatic diversity and steep biogeographic gradients can influence model performance for this reason and because the coastal region is the most affected by dengue fever we report only the results obtained with model 4 3 2 suitable habitat under current and future climatic conditions the coast region of ecuador reported 645 localities affected by dengue fever during 2013 2015 with the provinces of guayas manabí and el oro having the greatest number of occurrences the maxent modeling results revealed a high probability of aedes aegypti distribution across four provinces guayas los rios el oro and manabí except the north section under current climatic conditions fig 3 a esmeraldas and santa elena showed a high probability of distribution around areas with high population density the galapagos islands did not show a highly suitable habitat for the mosquito which matches with its low rate of dengue disease as shown in table 1 the mosquito s suitable habitat under the a2 climate change scenario for 2050 reveals an increase in the probability of spatial distribution across the region fig 3b and the areas currently under a high probability 0 7 of suitability will reach a very high occurrence probability 0 9 1 thus the incidence of dengue fever is likely to increase in the peripheral areas around urban centers and in rural areas of guayas los rios el oro and manabí all variables used to run model 4 were assessed using the jackknife test population elevation and temperature are the most important variables as shown by their regularized training gain values fig 4 a population is the variable that can decrease the gain the most by its omission reducing it from 1 25 to 0 65 the highest regularized gain among the bioclimatic variables was for the mean temperature of the warmest quarter bio10 mean temperature of the wettest quarter bio08 and annual mean temperature bio01 fig 4a thus temperature plays an important role in mosquito distribution dynamics the response curves of one variable models of the most important environmental variables were additionally identified by the jackknife test the curves present variations in the probability distribution of aedes aegypti according to each environmental covariate fig 4b the response curve of mosquito to population probes the increase in mosquito presence as population density increases considering elevation the curve shows that the most suitable habitat in the coast region is in areas with an altitude between 0 and 120 m a s l with a lower probability of occurrence up to 600 m a s l further increases in elevation cause gradual suitability decreases populations stabilize in a temperature range of 27 c 30 c for both covariates 3 3 climatic factors influencing dengue cases the tdc reported in the coast region during 2013 2015 varied by year a similar number was reported for 2013 n 10 054 and 2014 n 12 321 but many more cases were registered in 2015 n 37 239 indicating an outbreak of great magnitude in each year dengue cases revealed a specific pattern of occurrence which is well known to be related to climatic variables the monthly average of climatic parameters such as the tmax tmin humidity and rainfall for all the provinces in the coast region are found to influence the dengue outbreaks fig 5 from march the temperature and number of dengue cases were increased similarly while the temperature decreased in the months of june and july the dengue cases decreased gradually fig 5a a similar pattern is followed for the parameters of average humidity and rainfall when these increased about two months before the outbreak periods and finished two months before the dengue cases began to diminish fig 5b the log transformation of tdc was predicted using pls r with monthly climatic data from the study period 2013 2015 for each coastal province the variance inflation factor vif was applied to assess the multicollinearity of all 7 climatic variables used in the pls r for each province the results present small vif values indicating low correlation among variables under ideal conditions vif 10 the standardized residuals of each model ranged between 1 8 and 2 0 suggesting minimal outliers in the dataset the scatter plots of the standardized residuals versus the standardized predicted values expose a largely symmetrical distribution suggesting the required constant variance for the models pls r was performed using two latent variables which accounted for a cumulative variance higher than 90 the model statistics for predicting log tdc obtained a q2 ranging from 0 411 to 0 558 mean square errors close to zero indicating a fit appropriate for prediction and a coefficient of determination r2 between 0 501 and 0 698 table 3 similar values for r2 have been obtained in previous research that applied regression methods islam 2012 karim et al 2012 young et al 2016 the vip values summarize the importance of the variables in terms of explaining the independent variables and correlating them with the dependent variable table 3 the climatic variables obtained different vip results for each province however tmin and tmax were important in all of them which suggests that temperature has an important influence in the mosquito lifecycle in the ecuadorian coast region humidity was important in guayas santa elena and santo domingo rainfall was important in the provinces that reported the highest precipitation during the study period interestingly sunshine was also important in four of the seven coastal provinces the regression equation was used to predict tdc showing that the predicted curve properly follows the intra seasonal variability of dengue risk in all the provinces although the model predicted a slightly lower number of dengue cases than was observed during high outbreaks with the highest at 2015 fig 6 thus caution is essential when interpreting results during an outbreak the observed and predicted tdc for the study period 2013 2015 showed a significant correlation with spearman correlation coefficient values 0 705 and significant p values p 0 05 in all the provinces simca software was used to implement a validity testing technique applying 25 permutations for the two latent variables of the seven models the criteria suggested to check the validity of a model establish that all q2 values to the left of the permutations plot must be lower than the original points in the right or the regression line of the q2 values must intersect the vertical axis at or below zero islam 2012 considering these criteria a positive conclusion was made about the validity of the models performed in this study since the plots of each model met the established conditions log tdc was estimated to the year 2020 using an autoregressive model to predict the climatic conditions and putting those predicted conditions into the regression equations previously obtained for each province the regression plot presented a good model performance r2 0 89 for all provinces showing when the outbreaks will occur rather than just predicting an exact number of future cases fig 7 the most important finding of this approach is that provinces with the highest incidence of dengue fever show the likelihood of a large outbreak during 2018 beginning in march and lasting until august followed by a regrowth that varies by province santa elena and santo domingo with a low rate of cases show variability in the estimation but the highest records occur in months with climatic influences 4 discussion our aim in this study was to investigate the potential spatial distribution of dengue fever and the geographically suitable habitat for aedes aegypti under current and future climatic conditions in ecuador as well as to identify the most influential variables over time using maxent models many studies have shown better performance when collinearity is removed cruz cardenas et al 2013 moya et al 2017 qin et al 2017 which we also observed in model 4 for the coast region however we did not detect that effect in model 2 at the national level our results suggest that removing collinearity is a good option as long as the study area is homogeneous in addition data limitations were faced for accomplishing a full spatio temporal analysis the temporal dataset of cases of dengue were incomplete in some areas of ecuador as the disease was not continuously monitored throughout the years in the country similarly the spatial dataset of presence of the mosquito species showed missing data at some locations of the country however the spatial analysis showed that the physical factors used in this research are very important to the success of this species in the ecuadorian coast region this mosquito is well known for its close association with human settlements due to the human blood feeding behavior fatima et al 2016 of its adult females and its preference for tropical climates and low altitudes chowell et al 2011 elevation the second most important variable influencing the spatial distribution is a factor connected with the climatic variables that determine the mosquito s ideal habitat and regulate its physiological behavior increasing elevations correlate with a progressive decrease in temperature and variation in rainfall fatima et al 2016 which means that high elevations can act as biogeographic barriers however a study conducted in colombia an andean country with geographic features similar to those in ecuador reported finding the mosquito at 2 302 m a s l and infection with dengue virus at 1 984 m a s l ruiz lópez et al 2016 which suggests changes in the distribution patterns of this vector in the andean region of ecuador the maximum elevation at which the mosquito could be present is 1500 m a s l suarez and nelson 1981 our results also show that aedes aegypti can find ideal conditions up to a mean temperature in the wettest quarter and warmest quarter of 25 c and 25 8 c respectively further research should update and strengthen current and future vector surveillance and control according to the literature optimal mosquito development including breeding sites for egg deposition occurs in locations with at least 500 mm of annual rainfall and a summer temperature between 25 c and 30 c medlock et al 2015 which is consistent with the results of our one variable response curves which identified similar ranges for rainfall and temperature during the warmest quarter thus the climatic influence is evident with a 1 2 month lag because mosquitos take 7 45 days to mature from an egg to an adult karim et al 2012 the model for the future panorama in the ecuadorian coast region contributes to the assumption that dengue vectors will extend their suitable habitat as the climate changes as has been reported by several researchers benedict et al 2007 anne et al 2013 fischer et al 2014 koch et al 2016 the world health organization who has stated that the endemicity of vector borne diseases will change and epidemics could take place in areas where they are presently unusual as a consequence of climate change who 2012 the most affected areas will be those hitherto unprepared to respond robustly to such events however the precision and predictive capacity of models seeking to determine future epidemiological scenarios influenced by climate change remain a source of considerable debate and investigation who 2012 temperature the most important climatic variable identified by the spatial and temporal analysis is an essential factor for the mosquito lifecycle that jointly with humidity affects both eggs and adults gu et al 2016 the models developed with two components could explain between 50 1 and 69 8 of the variability in the response variables for dengue cases the results show that the mean temperatures of the wettest and warmest quarters from the wet and dry seasons respectively influence mosquito geographic distribution and that tmax and tmin influence its temporal patterns tmin showed a slightly higher importance than tmax in the vip values to date there is a lack of studies about the ecological modeling of the dengue vector at the national or regional scale in ecuador however a research carried out in the southern coastal city of machala in el oro province corroborates our results the study found that minimum air temperature is a significant regulating climate factor for dengue fever stewart ibarra et al 2013 stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 they concluded that a gradual increase in minimum temperature caused by global warming could increase the number of optimal transmission days per year stewart ibarra et al 2013 in general an increase in atmospheric temperature would decrease the incubation period reduce the gonotrophic cycle and decrease the development rates of immature mosquitoes pant and yasuno 1973 stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 it would also affect mating behaviors and cause more rapid viral replication and longer mosquito survival gu et al 2016 humidity sunshine wind speed cloudiness and rainfall in that order showed lower importance scores in the temporal analysis their influence on dengue fever is complex but they are nonetheless essential in the management of the disease the high humidity of the rainy season can promote mosquito growth and survival which could increase the successful propagation of the virus wu et al 2007 karim et al 2012 barbazan et al 2010 reported that an intensification of mosquito longevity can disproportionately augment the number of potential transmissions by as much as five times when the survival rate rises from 0 80 to 0 95 relative humidity can also affect mating oviposition wu et al 2007 and newly laid eggs which are vulnerable to desiccation gu et al 2016 the coastal region of ecuador experiences an increase in sunshine duration from january to june which matches the increase in tdc sunshine can affect the behavior of the vector directly specifically with regard to its blood feeding during sunrise and sunset gu et al 2016 the wind speed parameter can be associated with rainfall because stormy days usually bring rain and wind together it s well known that precipitation and its interaction with human behavior can increase larval habitat through water stagnation which leads to a proliferation of vector populations stewart ibarra et al 2013 naish et al 2014 on the other hand excessive rain can eliminate habitats through flooding wu et al 2007 however a study showed that vector population densities were less susceptible to seasonal fluctuations in rainfall in localities where year round water storage containers are the main mosquito breeding sites barrera et al 2011 therefore household water storage is an important contributor to the rise of dengue risk stewart ibarra and lowe 2013 for this reason a more specific modeling approach is needed to include the specific social and ecological elements that influence aedes aegypti habitat in ecuador the climatic variables used in the temporal analysis should remain in the new model using historical and updated data to assess the strength of their associations we also suggest extending time series models and include geographical variation and thereby obtain more accurate surveillance information for the coast region predictions from such a model could provide an increased lead time for vector control interventions and develop early warning systems for efficient prevention of dengue fever outbreaks 5 conclusion the areas at risk for dengue virus infection are well established in and around populated areas of the coast region of ecuador with a high emphasis in the central and south region the maxent model projection for 2050 shows an increase in mosquito suitable habitat that would cause a large rise in dengue fever incidence especially around urban centers and in the rural areas of guayas los rios el oro and manabí provinces factors such as population elevation and mean temperatures of the warmest and wettest quarters were identified as main contributors to the mosquito spatial pattern distribution a temporal analysis showed tmin and tmax to be the most important climatic variables in the prediction of dengue cases determining which factors influence the risk of dengue infection is important in controlling the spread of this disease and is essential in the development of predictive models for use as decision support tools and early warning systems therefore ecuadorian government institutions need to organize and facilitate access to climate vector and dengue virus information as a geospatial database to integrate the socioenvironmental factors that influence mosquito habitat and to generate appropriate intervention strategies the results from sdms with maxent showed better performance when collinearity was removed and the study area was relatively flat which indicates that a large steep geography with micro climatic variety can influence model performance when it is part of a wide section of the study area acknowledgements the authors express their gratitude to the ministry of health of ecuador for the dengue case data and to the oceanographic institute of the army of ecuador and the national institute of meteorology and hydrology of ecuador for the climatic data used in the temporal analysis this work was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the ministry of science and ict no 2017r1e1a1a03070713 and korea ministry of environment moe as

modeling 1 introduction water quality is affected by anthropic activities discharges of domestic agricultural and untreated industrial wastewater result in contamination of water bodies such is the case of the bogotá river in colombia which receives discharges from 190 tanneries agricultural drainage and other industrial wastewater discharges as well as untreated or partially treated wastewater from 26 towns car 2009 rodríguez et al 2018 river contamination results in low dissolved oxygen levels as well as high concentrations of heavy metals nutrients and the presence of volatile organic compounds antibiotics and many other contaminants hernández et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2018 microorganisms are capable of adapting to the presence of contaminants through processes such as positive selection gene duplication and lateral gene transfer baker et al 2012 hemme et al 2010 manickam et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 metagenomic studies have revealed adaptations of microbial communities to contamination these adaptations include an abundance of nitrite nitrate antiporters under nitrate stress hemme et al 2010 several possibilities for acid resistance response under ph stress pathways for the degradation of 1 2 dichloroethene acetone and detoxification of formaldehyde under organic solvent stress and metabolic mechanisms for resistance to mercury uranium chromium and zinc among other heavy metals under heavy metal stress hemme et al 2010 as environmental conditions change the diversity of the microbiomes may be altered in favor of organisms that can survive in high stress environments on the available metabolites hollister et al 2010 the effect of contamination on microbial communities in water ecosystems is known to reduce biological diversity jung et al 2016 zeglin 2015 the surviving community has increased tolerance to current stressors but changes in biodiversity may have affected the metabolic potential and the metabolic activity it can recover after other environmental changes occur the effect reduced biodiversity on the active biochemical functions and the metabolic robustness of a microbiome has not been studied in depth metagenomes obtained from whole genome shotgun sequencing of environmental samples provide large amounts of information on microbial communities oulas et al 2015 protein prediction and taxonomic analyses of the metagenomes are common practice to uncover the activity of the microbiomes and their impact on the environment raes et al 2011 however the relationship between the composition of the microbiome and the functional activity of an ecosystem is hard to connect because of the great range of metabolic functions carried by microbial communities and the interdependence between its members insight into metabolic functions and pathways in a metagenome can provide information on important ecological services provided by the microbiome and complex ecological phenomena organic matter degradation production of greenhouse gases eutrophication assimilation of metallic pollutants degradation of xenobiotic compounds and biogeochemical cycling are examples of the processes catalyzed by microorganisms that can be studied through genomic data and metabolic network reconstruction perez garcia et al 2016 metabolic network reconstructions are more frequently modeled for isolated genomes feist et al 2007 förster et al 2003 lee et al 2008 metabolic reconstructions from isolated genomes can be linked by metabolite exchange reactions to a common extracellular space in an in silico artificial community klitgord and segrè 2010 such models have been used to analyze the ecological strategies of single organisms freilich et al 2009 recent approaches in systems biology have modeled metabolic networks at a metagenomic level in either a single cellular space alvarez yela et al 2017 or several sub cellular compartments alvarez silva et al 2017 these reconstructions can be analyzed through constraint based models where complex interactions between individual species and the environment can be incorporated through biological and thermodynamic restrictions orth et al 2010 reed and palsson 2003 predictive models can be created with additional omic data and can be used for biomedical industrial and environmental and ecological management applications muller et al 2018 in this study we wanted to evaluate how the high degree of contamination has affected the microbiome of the bogotá river to do so we reconstructed metabolic network models using metagenomic data of 1 water samples from the bogotá river collected for this study and public metagenomic data from mg rast glass and meyer 2011 of water samples from 2 the mississippi river at twin cities and 3 lake itasca staley et al 2013 4 produced water from the medicine hat glauconitic c field in canada agrawal et al 2012 5 industrial discharges from a tannery in china wang et al 2013 and 6 fecal samples from the human microbiome project turnbaugh et al 2007 each as a single meta organism to evaluate the effect of contamination on the microbiome of the bogotá river we compared the metagenomes of the less and more contaminated ecosystems by implementing flux balance analysis fba this is a constraint based method in which an objective function based on a biological driver such as cellular growth is optimized to predict metabolite fluxes varma and palsson 1994 due to high contamination in the bogotá river it was expected that its microbiome would functionally behave as a polluted system 2 materials and methods 2 1 bogotá river sample collection and processing 5 water samples form the bogotá river middle basin were collected below puente de guadua 4 43 39 5 n 74 07 34 4 w in bogotá colombia in october 2014 october 16th october 20th and october 26th this point is located within 1 mile downstream of bogotá city s wastewater treatment plant discharge water quality parameters for these samples are available in table s2 samples were centrifuged at 2890 rpm 1360 g for 15 min to obtain biomass dna was extracted from pellets using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories with a modification proposed by wesolowska andersen wesolowska andersen et al 2014 to increase extraction yield after centrifugation approximately 250 mg of pellet were transferred to the powerbead tubes to which solution c1 was added and mixed with the pellet once a homogenous mixture was obtained the tube was heated to 65 c for 10 min and then 95 c for 10 min the remaining dna extraction was conducted following manufacturer s protocol finally dna was eluted 50 μl in tris buffer mobio solution c6 dna concentration and purity of each sample varied 72 108 ng μl all the samples were combined to produce 250 μl with a concentration of 86 9 ng μl and stored at 20 c until sent for sequencing 100 μl of dna elution were shipped overnight to genewiz south plainfield nj usa dna was sequenced using the illumina hiseq2500 platform illumina san diego ca with a 2 100 pe configuration in high output mode at genewiz nj sequence quality was evaluated with fastqc andrews 2010 and sequence cleaning was performed using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 in order to remove artifacts and barcodes delete reads with low quality and to ensure uniformity in the nucleotide content parameters were set as leading 3 trailing 28 sliding window 4 20 minlen 40 and headcrop 3 subsequently sequence assembly was performed with clc assembler sequencing 2011 using default assembly values frey et al 2014 taking a separation between the end of the first read and the beginning of the second between 80 and 250 base pairs to obtain longer sequences that represent functional genes 2 2 selection of other samples five additional samples were selected from the metagenomic rast server s mg rast metagenome repository glass and meyer 2011 along with the bogotá river sample to perform metabolic network reconstruction analyses table 1 1 produced water from an oilfield in canada agrawal et al 2012 2 the headwaters of the mississippi river at lake itasca 3 the mississippi river at the twin cities region in minnesota us staley et al 2013 4 a consolidation of feces metagenomes from the nih human microbiome project peterson et al 2009 turnbaugh et al 2007 and 5 a wastewater sample from a tannery in china wang et al 2013 data was selected to model contamination problems in the bogotá river and contrast with an unpolluted water body lake itasca only raw reads or assembled contigs from whole genome shotgun samples sequenced using illumina technology were selected table 1 summarizes the selected samples 2 3 metagenome annotation annotation of the six metagenomes was performed implementing mg rast glass and meyer 2011 automated analysis tools using the img database markowitz et al 2012 and the refseq protein database pruitt et al 2007 the identity threshold was set to 70 while the default e value threshold was used taxonomic identification of microorganisms was performed within mg rast functional annotation links enzymatic activity and predicted genes in order to identify the enzymes that catalyze reactions and the function they carry in an organism this process returns enzymes classified according to the seed categories overbeek et al 2014 with enzyme commission ec numbers where available 2 4 metabolic network reconstruction to identify the catalyzed reactions and metabolites involved in each reaction the enzymes obtained through annotation were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg ogata et al 1999 using the ec numbers an additional step was carried out to mine enzymes from annotated function names without ec numbers by mapping them against kegg reaction data was fitted to the metanetx standard ganter et al 2013 moretti et al 2016 since it is one of the largest metabolic reaction databases and would be used in the curation steps unbalanced reactions containing generic metabolites such as polymer elongations were either removed or the metabolites were replaced with each specific instance to ensure elemental balance directionality of the reactions was verified with information from metanetx and with thermodynamic data available in the metacyc database reports caspi et al 2018 free energy values available in metacyc are calculated by the group contributions method jankowski et al 2008 reactions with standard free energy values 1 5 to 1 5 k c a l m o l 1 were considered to have double directionality information of mass charge and formula of the metabolites was introduced assuming a ph of 7 2 within the cell to model cellular growth additional reactions from a bigg database king et al 2016 were added these reactions describe the rate at which biomass precursors are produced feist and palsson 2010 metabolite uptake reactions adapted from those used by alvarez yela et al 2017 fig 1 2 5 curation of metabolic networks pathologies in the metabolic reconstructions arise when there are connectivity issues no production pathologies represent metabolites that have no reactions producing them and propagate through the network maranas and zomorrodi 2016 network curations were performed using the gapfind and gapfill algorithms satish kumar et al 2007 gapfind was used to find no production metabolites gapfill was used to restore network connectivity gapfind restores connectivity by i relaxing the directionality of reactions ii adding reactions from an external database or iii adding metabolite exchange reaction metanetx was used to create the external database of balanced reactions curation was implemented in gams 23 7 1 in an intel i7 computer with 16 gb ram algorithm total processing time was between 1 10 min for gapfind and between 15 to 78 h for gapfill 2 6 topological analysis of metabolic networks topological analysis was performed using gephi 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 to compare the metabolic reconstructions in each network graph nodes represent metabolites and edges represent biochemical reactions the network topology of the six samples was assessed taking into account the directionality and thermodynamic constraints eigenvector centrality was calculated using 10 000 iterations to determine the most important metabolites in each network pavlopoulos et al 2011 modularity was calculated with a randomized parameter no weights and a 1 0 resolution average degree network diameter average clustering coefficient and average path length were also calculated to evaluate the connectivity between nodes visualization of the metabolic networks was done using the yifan hu proportional layout algorithm with default parameters hu 2005 2 7 flux balance analysis to study the active reactions and metabolite fluxes the metabolic network models were represented in a stoichiometric based mathematical form which was used to implement a fba each simulation of the fba optimizes an objective function orth et al 2010 1 z c t v where v is a vector that contains the flux of each metabolic reaction and c is a binary vector containing ones and zeros defining the weight coefficient for each of the fluxes in v the vector c can be manipulated to formulate diverse objective functions the maximization of z is a linear programming problem that finds a solution vector v orth et al 2010 the optimization problem is expressed as follows 2 m a x i m i z e z j 1 n c j t v j subject to 3 j 1 n s i j v j 0 i 1 m 4 v j l b v j v j u b j 1 n where s is the stoichiometric matrix with m metabolites by n reactions v is the vector of metabolic reaction fluxes v l b is a vector of the lower flux bound of each reaction and v u b is a vector of the upper flux bound of each reaction the values of the lower and upper bounds on reaction fluxes were 0 and 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 respectively for reversible reactions the lower bound was set to 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 these values were selected after varying the upper bounds from 100 to 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 as proposed by alvarez silva et al 2017 to obtain solutions that maximize the number of active fluxes a cplex solver was implemented in gams 23 7 1 to solve the linear programming problems and find the solutions to the flux balance analyses 2 8 selecting the objective functions the objective function should model the behavior of the microbial community under specific environmental conditions maximizing cell growth and biomass production is not always possible for environmental microbial communities maranas and zomorrodi 2016 microbes must adapt to stressful conditions by altering their allocation of resources from growth to survival pathways schimel et al 2007 river microbial communities in the bogotá river for example may experience a great deal of stress reduced oxygen concentrations result in anoxic nitrate or sulfate respiration and hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination also affects the microbiome to simulate the stressful conditions found in the bogotá river a set of four objective functions was selected for these study 1 the maximization of biomass production 2 the use of nitrate and 3 sulfate as electron acceptors to simulate the anoxic conditions found in the river and 4 the degradation of xenobiotic compounds table 2 the modeled objective functions are linear combinations of reaction fluxes within the networks 2 9 metagenomic sample flux dissimilarity analysis spearman dissimilarity measures jackson et al 1989 were used to compare the active reactions in each of the samples metabolic network reconstruction simulations at a flux level and at a reaction module level additionally distance between flux values changing with objective function were analyzed using the pearson dissimilarity coefficient wolda 1981 dissimilarity coefficients and matrices were calculated using orange demšar et al 2013 heat maps and nearest distance dendograms in newick format were obtained in matlab 2017a mathworks inc dendogram visualizations were generated using itol letunic and bork 2016 3 results the bogotá river sample and the five other samples were processed in mg rast curation of the networks was performed obtaining six reconstructions curated networks were compared by topological analysis and fba analysis using objective functions modeling low oxygen concentrations biomass production and degradation of xenobiotic compounds 3 1 taxonomic distribution the six samples have a high percentage of bacterial abundance table 3 the produced water sample has the highest abundance of archaea while samples from the bogotá river mississippi river at twin cities and lake itasca as well as the feces sample have low abundance of archaea the feces sample contains the highest abundance of bacteria composed of bacteroidetes and firmicutes fig s1 proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in the water samples of this phylum betaproteobacteria is the most abundant class in itasca twin cities and produced water samples while gammaproteobacteria is more abundant in the bogotá river lake itasca sample has a significantly higher abundance of actinobacteria fig 2 3 2 metabolic network reconstruction and curation recovery of biochemical reactions from ec numbers resulted in networks containing different number of reactions and metabolites before curation a large proportion of metabolites presented connection problems resulting in root and downstream no production metabolites as well as blocked cell growth reactions satish kumar et al 2007 network gaps can arise due to incomplete gene annotations related to lack of experimental or homology evidence maranas and zomorrodi 2016 the produced water sample had the greatest amount of disconnected metabolites the other networks had problem metabolites as follows tannery 569 bogotá river 1088 twin cities 971 itasca 935 feces 753 several reactions were added to each model to correct network pathologies table 4 there is a trade off between possible solutions to restore connectivity relaxing directionality can introduce thermodynamically infeasible reactions and reaction cycles which can cause blocked pathways in flux balance analyses maranas and zomorrodi 2016 while introducing reactions from an external database reduces the representation of metagenomic data in the model most problem metabolites were fixed by adding reactions from an external database however the percentage of added reactions in the final model are relatively small and do not significantly dilute data encoded in the metagenome other studies using gap filling curation strategy have obtained between 10 to 25 of participation of reactions added from an external database in the final model alvarez yela et al 2017 saha et al 2011 satish kumar et al 2011 suthers et al 2009 the representation of sample data in the models means the results are driven by metagenomic information encoded in each sample the models of bogotá river metagenome as well as the other five models presented similar curation levels in terms of final metagenomic representation all had a high representation of reactions initially obtained from metagenome annotation and similar proportion of reactions added from the database the tannery produced water and feces network models required the addition of more reactions from an external database than directionality relaxation the twin cities sample has the lowest representation of metagenomic data additionally the model for the twin cities metagenome required higher relaxation of directionality of reactions in the metagenome similar curation levels make the network reconstruction comparable between each other 3 3 topological analysis metabolic networks were represented as graphs where nodes represent metabolites and edges represent biochemical reaction linking these metabolites no weight was assigned to the edges topological parameters for each graph show that the structure of the metabolic networks is very similar between the different samples table 5 the complexity of the metabolic networks is related to the abundance of metabolic functions which the microbial community carries out under certain environmental conditions the clustering coefficient reflects the level of connectivity between metabolites a more complex and connected network has a higher number of metabolic functions available and has a better response to changing environmental conditions making it more robust jeong et al 2000 bogotá river produced water twin cities itasca and feces sample have a similar complexity while the tannery sample has a lower complexity as evidenced by a lower network diameter average path length and average degree however the tannery network has a higher average clustering coefficient than the other samples network graphs display similar structure with a central region of highly connected metabolites and a surrounding region of a variety of metabolites fig 3 visualizations of network graphs show analogous response for all metagenomic samples the eigencentrality parameter was calculated for each node in the network graphs while the degree of the nodes shows the most connected metabolites the eigencentrality assigns higher value to nodes connected to high degree nodes this allows the identification of the most important metabolites in the metabolic networks the six network reconstructions share 19 metabolites in the top 15 nodes with highest eigencentrality values these metabolites are related to basic metabolic functions and are shared by all samples except the tannery sample table s3 3 4 functional annotation and metabolic characterization the metabolic potential is similar between all samples this represents the metabolic functions for which enzymes were annotated in the metagenomes and constitutes the repertoire of reactions that could be used by the microbial community fig 4 the general trend shows a higher representation of reactions in carbohydrate metabolism followed by amino acid metabolism glycan metabolism has the lowest abundance in all samples the tannery sample has a higher representation of lipid metabolism reactions than other samples the twin cities sample and tannery sample share a high abundance of reactions that are part of the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism module 3 5 metabolic potential similarities the spearman dissimilarity on the abundance of reaction modules was calculated for each curated network reconstruction the three water bodies are closely related in potential metabolic functions samples from the mississippi river itasca and twin cities clustered together in a nearest distance dendrogram in fig 5 a showing that their geographical and hydrological relationship dominates meanwhile the bogotá river is most closely related to the produced water sample in potential metabolic functions this is likely the result of the high degree of contamination of the bogotá river which shows hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination the tannery sample has the most distant network in comparison even after correcting for number of reactions composing each reconstruction however the metabolic potential is similar between all six samples with spearman dissimilarity values lower than 0 1 this shows that their metabolic potential is similar and that the difference in terms of enzymatic reactions in the metagenomes is low 3 6 flux balance analysis flux balance analyses were performed on the six samples using four different objective functions to simulate biomass growth an anoxic environment and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds resulting fluxes are comparable between samples and between conditions simulated by objective functions within each sample flux results were also grouped by kegg reaction modules providing the number of active reactions in each module to allow comparison with the metabolic potential a high abundance of extreme flux values 0 1000 1000 are evidence of possible pathologies existing in the curated network reconstructions which leave some reactions unbounded fig s2 these unbounded reactions could correspond to reversible reactions or thermodynamically infeasible cycles additionally the distribution of the fluxes is similar in all six metagenomes which indicates that the results are comparable between the samples after simulating the fluxes of the metabolic networks with different conditions differences start to appear in respect to metabolic potential functional dissimilarity is greater with higher spearman distances and the mississippi river samples itasca and twin cities no longer group together fig 5b the active reaction module abundance of the bogotá river is closer to that of produced water than to lake itasca active metabolic reaction modules are not the same as the potential functions to confirm the dissimilarity patterns found at kegg module level the spearman dissimilarity was also calculated at a reaction flux level fig s3 at an active reaction flux level the dissimilarity between samples increases but the general pattern continues to be the same the bogotá river active metabolic functions across all objective functions is closer to produced water followed by feces and lake itasca with the tannery and twin cities samples having the highest dissimilarities separately observing the results of fba with different objective functions shows that optimizing cell growth and maximizing the degradation of xenobiotic compounds located produced water followed by feces and lake itasca as the samples closest in active fluxes to the bogotá river on the other hand maximizing nitrate and sulfate use as electron acceptor located produced water followed by lake itasca and feces as the samples closest in active metabolic functions to the bogotá river fig 6 shows the resulting heat maps for each objective function evaluated the resultant fba fluxes compared by objective function within the sample metagenomes can provide insight into the active functions the pearson dissimilarity was calculated to evaluate the difference in flux values obtained in the bogotá river network model for each objective function the results from the bogotá river show that in this sample maximizing cell growth produces reaction fluxes more closely related to sulfate use as electron acceptor but distant to all objective functions fig 7 the simulations for use of nitrate as electron acceptor and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds produced the most similar active metabolism 4 discussion metabolic network analysis provides a tool to model metagenomes at a functional level through this systems biology approach we were able to construct metagenome level curated network reconstructions that allowed the comparison of environmental samples functional analysis through fba highlights that the metabolic potential of environmental samples is not the same as active metabolic functions the bogotá river metagenome shares characteristics of other polluted water samples such as produced water this observation is consistent with our initial hypothesis that the microbiome of the bogotá river has adapted to the high degree of contamination as it resembles functionally the microbiome of a highly contaminated ecosystem 4 1 taxonomic distribution can be an indicator of pollution the six metagenomic samples analyzed presented differences in the taxonomic distribution of their microbial community the high abundance of proteobacteria in the bogotá river sample could be associated to the diversity of metabolic functions found to be used by members of this bacterial phylum jung et al 2016 spain et al 2009 the dominance of this phylum in the tannery sample is consistent with a high level of heavy metals high lipid concentrations and presence other contaminants that induce the abundance of proteobacteria especially betaproteobacteria at a phylum level lake itasca showed a more diverse microbiome with high abundance of actinobacteria low contamination levels of this location suggest that a decreased abundance of actinobacteria and increased abundance of proteobacteria could be indicators of downstream pollution of the mississippi river observed at twin cities this observation however is not consistent with a previous study in which the ratio of actinobacteria and proteobacteria was about the same in pristine and contaminated environments labbé et al 2007 in fact a previous study that evaluated the pristine water column of the amazon river found higher percentage of proteobacteria than actinobacteria in pristine waters ghai et al 2011 our results are consistent with the fact that contaminated sites have a high percentage of proteobacteria labbé et al 2007 margesin et al 2011 4 2 network topology reveals similar levels of plasticity the topological parameters of metabolic networks graphs indicate that the network reconstructions of the samples are structurally similar this coincides with results reported by alvarez silva et al 2017 for metagenomic reconstructions of soil samples network similarities seen in fig 3 and similar network topologies evidence an analogous response to changes in the networks the six networks have a similar response capacity to environmental changes however the high number of metagenomic sequences that are not annotated could contribute to the observed similarities in the networks the average path length of all samples except for the tannery sample is close to values found for genome scale reconstructions for 43 organisms while the average clustering coefficient of all samples is significantly lower jeong et al 2000 a low average clustering coefficient has been found for metagenome level reconstructions alvarez silva et al 2017 low clustering reflects a large number of metabolites with few connections and a small number of highly connected metabolites jeong et al 2000 the reduced complexity and higher connectivity of the tannery network can be related to the decreased microbial diversity at taxonomic level presented in the tannery sample such a difference suggests that changing microbial diversity affects the metabolic network topology at a greater degree than it affects the potential functional diversity common biomass cell growth and transport reactions between the samples may confound the structural similarities this limitation can also affect the observation of the most connected metabolites according to eigenvector centrality all networks except for the tannery sample have the same top 15 metabolites these metabolites are related to the central metabolic functions while network topology appears to be affected by taxonomic distribution variations in microbial taxa abundance do not greatly affect the potential functional diversity of the samples microbial diversity increases network complexity and makes the metabolic networks more plastic and robust this reflects and increasing robustness of microbial communities with high diversity 4 3 network curation is essential for flux balance analysis modeling of metabolic networks is helpful to reveal what functions are active in each sample however network curation is a crucial step to perform these analyses network pathologies reduce the connectivity between metabolites and affect the resulting fluxes the curation steps restore the connectivity of the network recovers missing reaction information and allows modelling artifacts may arise as reactions are introduced from databases additional manual curation can improve the accuracy of the modeled networks and make the analysis more robust in this case the curation level was similar between all networks with a high representation of reactions found through metagenome annotation this makes the models fit for simulation and the results comparable flux balance analysis results showed that the twin cities model was considerably different from the other six models these differences may arise due to variations in metabolic pathways present in this model as well as a larger amount of initial network pathologies improvements in metagenome annotation would help reduce the gap of reactions that create these problems persisting network pathologies can affect the fba deeper automated and manual curation can help improve the robustness of the analysis 4 4 metabolic potential is not the same as active metabolic functions in spite of the differences in taxonomic distribution metabolic potential is similar in all samples with few exceptions found in an increased representation of lipid and energy metabolism in the tannery sample which can be related to high lipid content in the discharges of the tanning process previous metagenomic studies had found this lack of connection between taxonomic distribution and function in ocean samples raes et al 2011 redundancy in functional characteristics within microbial communities could mean a decrease in taxonomic diversity does not affect functional diversity comparing the metabolic networks at a potential and active functional level provides evidence of similarities between samples fba results reveal that not all potential functions are active table s4 metabolic reaction fluxes depend on the simulated environmental conditions the selection of objective functions to model these environmental conditions is key to analyzing the functional activity of the microbial communities the bogotá river has a metabolic potential close to other freshwater samples lake itasca and the mississippi river at twin cities however metabolic potential is most closely related to that of the produced water sample at an active functional level the bogotá river was also closely associated to produced water followed by lake itasca this was no surprise as the bogotá river is highly contaminated similarity to lake itasca suggests that improving the water quality of the bogotá river could restore affected metabolic functions 4 5 bogotá river metabolic functions are driven by contamination the distance between fluxes that optimize cell growth with the rest of the objective functions indicates that biomass production is not the main metabolic driver in the bogotá river this is supported by the results from cell growth optimization having the lowest number of active reactions in contrast optimization of sulfate use as electron acceptor had the largest number of active fluxes closely followed by both the use of nitrate as electron acceptor and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds this was expected as the bogotá river has low dissolved oxygen concentration and presence of xenobiotics hernöndez et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2018 sulfate respiration is a clear indicator of the lack of oxygen in the river which leads to the displacement of macrofauna fba results present an image close to the reality of the river these similarities between fba results with different objective functions show the plasticity of the bogotá river network model where similar flux distributions satisfy different phenotypes 5 conclusions taxonomic distribution and potential functional distribution present an incomplete view of the active function of microbiomes metabolic network reconstruction is a systems biology tool that coupled with computational analysis through constraint based methods such as fba increases the information that can be drawn from metagenomic data in this study metagenome level metabolic networks of the bogotá river and five additional samples were constructed topological analysis of the networks shows close structural similarities between samples microbial diversity does not have a big effect on the potential metabolic repertoire but does make the metabolic network models more complex and robust fba analysis reveals functional differences in active reactions and reveals that the active metabolism is not the same as the potential metabolic functions the microbiome of the bogotá river was found to be more closely related to the microbiome of produced water both in potential and active metabolic functions this is an indicator of the contamination of the river however similarity to the functional diversity of lake itasca suggests that the water quality of the river can be recovered future studies should focus on the integration of multi omic data to metabolic network models to improve the predictive power of the models and propose or assess ecological management and

25086,the microbiomes of contaminated water bodies have altered microbial communities and functional capacity metagenomic data provides information on the microbiome at taxonomic and functional level

modeling 1 introduction water quality is affected by anthropic activities discharges of domestic agricultural and untreated industrial wastewater result in contamination of water bodies such is the case of the bogotá river in colombia which receives discharges from 190 tanneries agricultural drainage and other industrial wastewater discharges as well as untreated or partially treated wastewater from 26 towns car 2009 rodríguez et al 2018 river contamination results in low dissolved oxygen levels as well as high concentrations of heavy metals nutrients and the presence of volatile organic compounds antibiotics and many other contaminants hernández et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2018 microorganisms are capable of adapting to the presence of contaminants through processes such as positive selection gene duplication and lateral gene transfer baker et al 2012 hemme et al 2010 manickam et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 metagenomic studies have revealed adaptations of microbial communities to contamination these adaptations include an abundance of nitrite nitrate antiporters under nitrate stress hemme et al 2010 several possibilities for acid resistance response under ph stress pathways for the degradation of 1 2 dichloroethene acetone and detoxification of formaldehyde under organic solvent stress and metabolic mechanisms for resistance to mercury uranium chromium and zinc among other heavy metals under heavy metal stress hemme et al 2010 as environmental conditions change the diversity of the microbiomes may be altered in favor of organisms that can survive in high stress environments on the available metabolites hollister et al 2010 the effect of contamination on microbial communities in water ecosystems is known to reduce biological diversity jung et al 2016 zeglin 2015 the surviving community has increased tolerance to current stressors but changes in biodiversity may have affected the metabolic potential and the metabolic activity it can recover after other environmental changes occur the effect reduced biodiversity on the active biochemical functions and the metabolic robustness of a microbiome has not been studied in depth metagenomes obtained from whole genome shotgun sequencing of environmental samples provide large amounts of information on microbial communities oulas et al 2015 protein prediction and taxonomic analyses of the metagenomes are common practice to uncover the activity of the microbiomes and their impact on the environment raes et al 2011 however the relationship between the composition of the microbiome and the functional activity of an ecosystem is hard to connect because of the great range of metabolic functions carried by microbial communities and the interdependence between its members insight into metabolic functions and pathways in a metagenome can provide information on important ecological services provided by the microbiome and complex ecological phenomena organic matter degradation production of greenhouse gases eutrophication assimilation of metallic pollutants degradation of xenobiotic compounds and biogeochemical cycling are examples of the processes catalyzed by microorganisms that can be studied through genomic data and metabolic network reconstruction perez garcia et al 2016 metabolic network reconstructions are more frequently modeled for isolated genomes feist et al 2007 förster et al 2003 lee et al 2008 metabolic reconstructions from isolated genomes can be linked by metabolite exchange reactions to a common extracellular space in an in silico artificial community klitgord and

level in either a single cellular space alvarez yela et al 2017 or several sub cellular compartments alvarez silva et al 2017 these reconstructions can be analyzed through constraint based models where complex interactions between individual species and the environment can be incorporated through biological and thermodynamic restrictions orth et al 2010 reed and palsson 2003 predictive models can be created with additional omic data and can be used for biomedical industrial and environmental and ecological management applications muller et al 2018 in this study we wanted to evaluate how the high degree of contamination has affected the microbiome of the bogotá river to do so we reconstructed metabolic network models using metagenomic data of 1 water samples from the bogotá river collected for this study and public metagenomic data from mg rast glass and meyer 2011 of water samples from 2 the mississippi river at twin cities and 3 lake itasca staley et al 2013 4 produced water from the medicine hat glauconitic c field in canada agrawal et al 2012 5 industrial discharges from a tannery in china wang et al 2013 and 6 fecal samples from the human microbiome project turnbaugh et al 2007 each as a single meta organism to evaluate the effect of contamination on the microbiome of the bogotá river we compared the metagenomes of the less and more contaminated ecosystems by implementing flux balance analysis fba this is a constraint based method in which an objective function based on a biological driver such as cellular growth is optimized to predict metabolite fluxes varma and palsson 1994 due to high contamination in the bogotá river it was expected that its microbiome would functionally behave as a polluted system 2 materials and methods 2 1 bogotá river sample collection and processing 5 water samples form the bogotá river middle basin were collected below puente de guadua 4 43 39 5 n 74 07 34 4 w in bogotá colombia in october 2014 october 16th october 20th and october 26th this point is located within 1 mile downstream of bogotá city s wastewater treatment plant discharge water quality parameters for these samples are available in table s2 samples were centrifuged at 2890 rpm 1360 g for 15 min to obtain biomass dna was extracted from pellets using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories with a modification proposed by wesolowska andersen wesolowska andersen et al 2014 to increase extraction yield after centrifugation approximately 250 mg of pellet were transferred to the powerbead tubes to which solution c1 was added and mixed with the pellet once a homogenous mixture was obtained the tube was heated to 65 c for 10 min and then 95 c for 10 min the remaining dna extraction was conducted following manufacturer s protocol finally dna was eluted 50 μl in tris buffer mobio solution c6 dna concentration and purity of each sample varied 72 108 ng μl all the samples were combined to produce 250 μl with a concentration of 86 9 ng μl and stored at 20 c until sent for sequencing 100 μl of dna elution were shipped overnight to genewiz south plainfield nj usa dna was sequenced using the illumina hiseq2500 platform illumina san diego ca with a 2 100 pe configuration in high output mode at genewiz nj sequence quality was evaluated with fastqc andrews 2010 and sequence cleaning was performed using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 in order to remove artifacts and barcodes delete reads with low quality and to ensure uniformity in the nucleotide content parameters were set as leading 3 trailing 28 sliding window 4 20 minlen 40 and headcrop 3 subsequently sequence assembly was performed with clc assembler sequencing 2011 using default assembly values frey et al 2014 taking a separation between the end of the first read and the beginning of the second between 80 and 250 base pairs to obtain longer sequences that represent functional genes 2 2 selection of other samples five additional samples were selected from the metagenomic rast server s mg rast metagenome repository glass and meyer 2011 along with the bogotá river sample to perform metabolic network reconstruction analyses table 1 1 produced water from an oilfield in canada agrawal et al 2012 2 the headwaters of the mississippi river at lake itasca 3 the mississippi river at the twin cities region in minnesota us staley et al 2013 4 a consolidation of feces metagenomes from the nih human microbiome project peterson et al 2009 turnbaugh et al 2007 and 5 a wastewater sample from a tannery in china wang et al 2013 data was selected to model contamination problems in the bogotá river and contrast with an unpolluted water body lake itasca only raw reads or assembled contigs from whole genome shotgun samples sequenced using illumina technology were selected table 1 summarizes the selected samples 2 3 metagenome annotation annotation of the six metagenomes was performed implementing mg rast glass and meyer 2011 automated analysis tools using the img database markowitz et al 2012 and the refseq protein database pruitt et al 2007 the identity threshold was set to 70 while the default e value threshold was used taxonomic identification of microorganisms was performed within mg rast functional annotation links enzymatic activity and predicted genes in order to identify the enzymes that catalyze reactions and the function they carry in an organism this process returns enzymes classified according to the seed categories overbeek et al 2014 with enzyme commission ec numbers where available 2 4 metabolic network reconstruction to identify the catalyzed reactions and metabolites involved in each reaction the enzymes obtained through annotation were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg ogata et al 1999 using the ec numbers an additional step was carried out to mine enzymes from annotated function names without ec numbers by mapping them against kegg reaction data was fitted to the metanetx standard ganter et al 2013 moretti et al 2016 since it is one of the largest metabolic reaction databases and would be used in the curation steps unbalanced reactions containing generic metabolites such as polymer elongations were either removed or the metabolites were replaced with each specific instance to ensure elemental balance directionality of the reactions was verified with information from metanetx and with thermodynamic data available in the metacyc database reports caspi et al 2018 free energy values available in metacyc are calculated by the group contributions method jankowski et al 2008 reactions with standard free energy values 1 5 to 1 5 k c a l m o l 1 were considered to have double directionality information of mass charge and formula of the metabolites was introduced assuming a ph of 7 2 within the cell to model cellular growth additional reactions from a bigg database king et al 2016 were added these reactions describe the rate at which biomass precursors are produced feist and palsson 2010 metabolite uptake reactions adapted from those used by alvarez yela et al 2017 fig 1 2 5 curation of metabolic networks pathologies in the metabolic reconstructions arise when there are connectivity issues no production pathologies represent metabolites that have no reactions producing them and propagate through the network maranas and zomorrodi 2016 network curations were performed using the gapfind and gapfill algorithms satish kumar et al 2007 gapfind was used to find no production metabolites gapfill was used to restore network connectivity gapfind restores connectivity by i relaxing the directionality of reactions ii adding reactions from an external database or iii adding metabolite exchange reaction metanetx was used to create the external database of balanced reactions curation was implemented in gams 23 7 1 in an intel i7 computer with 16 gb ram algorithm total processing time was between 1 10 min for gapfind and between 15 to 78 h for gapfill 2 6 topological analysis of metabolic networks topological analysis was performed using gephi 0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 to compare the metabolic reconstructions in each network graph nodes represent metabolites and edges represent biochemical reactions the network topology of the six samples was assessed taking into account the directionality and thermodynamic constraints eigenvector centrality was calculated using 10 000 iterations to determine the most important metabolites in each network pavlopoulos et al 2011 modularity was calculated with a randomized parameter no weights and a 1 0 resolution average degree network diameter average clustering coefficient and average path length were also calculated to evaluate the connectivity between nodes visualization of the metabolic networks was done using the yifan hu proportional layout algorithm with default parameters hu 2005 2 7 flux balance analysis to study the active reactions and metabolite fluxes the metabolic network models were represented in a stoichiometric based mathematical form which was used to implement a fba each simulation of the fba optimizes an objective function orth et al 2010 1 z c t v where v is a vector that contains the flux of each metabolic reaction and c is a binary vector containing ones and zeros defining the weight coefficient for each of the fluxes in v the vector c can be manipulated to formulate diverse objective functions the maximization of z is a linear programming problem that finds a solution vector v orth et al 2010 the optimization problem is expressed as follows 2 m a x i m i z e z j 1 n c j t v j subject to 3 j 1 n s i j v j 0 i 1 m 4 v j l b v j v j u b j 1 n where s is the stoichiometric matrix with m metabolites by n reactions v is the vector of metabolic reaction fluxes v l b is a vector of the lower flux bound of each reaction and v u b is a vector of the upper flux bound of each reaction the values of the lower and upper bounds on reaction fluxes were 0 and 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 respectively for reversible reactions the lower bound was set to 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 these values were selected after varying the upper bounds from 100 to 1000 m m o l g d w 1 h 1 as proposed by alvarez silva et al 2017 to obtain solutions that maximize the number of active fluxes a cplex solver was implemented in gams 23 7 1 to solve the linear programming problems and find the solutions to the flux balance analyses 2 8 selecting the objective functions the objective function should model the behavior of the microbial community under specific environmental conditions maximizing cell growth and biomass production is not always possible for environmental microbial communities maranas and zomorrodi 2016 microbes must adapt to stressful conditions by altering their allocation of resources from growth to survival pathways schimel et al 2007 river microbial communities in the bogotá river for example may experience a great deal of stress reduced oxygen concentrations result in anoxic nitrate or sulfate respiration and hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination also affects the microbiome to simulate the stressful conditions found in the bogotá river a set of four objective functions was selected for these study 1 the maximization of biomass production 2 the use of nitrate and 3 sulfate as electron acceptors to simulate the anoxic conditions found in the river and 4 the degradation of xenobiotic compounds table 2 the modeled objective functions are linear combinations of reaction fluxes within the networks 2 9 metagenomic sample flux dissimilarity analysis spearman dissimilarity measures jackson et al 1989 were used to compare the active reactions in each of the samples metabolic network reconstruction simulations at a flux level and at a reaction module level additionally distance between flux values changing with objective function were analyzed using the pearson dissimilarity coefficient wolda 1981 dissimilarity coefficients and matrices were calculated using orange demšar et al 2013 heat maps and nearest distance dendograms in newick format were obtained in matlab 2017a mathworks inc dendogram visualizations were generated using itol letunic and bork 2016 3 results the bogotá river sample and the five other samples were processed in mg rast curation of the networks was performed obtaining six reconstructions curated networks were compared by topological analysis and fba analysis using objective functions modeling low oxygen concentrations biomass production and degradation of xenobiotic compounds 3 1 taxonomic distribution the six samples have a high percentage of bacterial abundance table 3 the produced water sample has the highest abundance of archaea while samples from the bogotá river mississippi river at twin cities and lake itasca as well as the feces sample have low abundance of archaea the feces sample contains the highest abundance of bacteria composed of bacteroidetes and firmicutes fig s1 proteobacteria is the most abundant phylum in the water samples of this phylum betaproteobacteria is the most abundant class in itasca twin cities and produced water samples while gammaproteobacteria is more abundant in the bogotá river lake itasca sample has a significantly higher abundance of actinobacteria fig 2 3 2 metabolic network reconstruction and curation recovery of biochemical reactions from ec numbers resulted in networks containing different number of reactions and metabolites before curation a large proportion of metabolites presented connection problems resulting in root and downstream no production metabolites as well as blocked cell growth reactions satish kumar et al 2007 network gaps can arise due to incomplete gene annotations related to lack of experimental or homology evidence maranas and zomorrodi 2016 the produced water sample had the greatest amount of disconnected metabolites the other networks had problem metabolites as follows tannery 569 bogotá river 1088 twin cities 971 itasca 935 feces 753 several reactions were added to each model to correct network pathologies table 4 there is a trade off between possible solutions to restore connectivity relaxing directionality can introduce thermodynamically infeasible reactions and reaction cycles which can cause blocked pathways in flux balance analyses maranas and zomorrodi 2016 while introducing reactions from an external database reduces the representation of metagenomic data in the model most problem metabolites were fixed by adding reactions from an external database however the percentage of added reactions in the final model are relatively small and do not significantly dilute data encoded in the metagenome other studies using gap filling curation strategy have obtained between 10 to 25 of participation of reactions added from an external database in the final model alvarez yela et al 2017 saha et al 2011 satish kumar et al 2011 suthers et al 2009 the representation of sample data in the models means the results are driven by metagenomic information encoded in each sample the models of bogotá river metagenome as well as the other five models presented similar curation levels in terms of final metagenomic representation all had a high representation of reactions initially obtained from metagenome annotation and similar proportion of reactions added from the database the tannery produced water and feces network models required the addition of more reactions from an external database than directionality relaxation the twin cities sample has the lowest representation of metagenomic data additionally the model for the twin cities metagenome required higher relaxation of directionality of reactions in the metagenome similar curation levels make the network reconstruction comparable between each other 3 3 topological analysis metabolic networks were represented as graphs where nodes represent metabolites and edges represent biochemical reaction linking these metabolites no weight was assigned to the edges topological parameters for each graph show that the structure of the metabolic networks is very similar between the different samples table 5 the complexity of the metabolic networks is related to the abundance of metabolic functions which the microbial community carries out under certain environmental conditions the clustering coefficient reflects the level of connectivity between metabolites a more complex and connected network has a higher number of metabolic functions available and has a better response to changing environmental conditions making it more robust jeong et al 2000 bogotá river produced water twin cities itasca and feces sample have a similar complexity while the tannery sample has a lower complexity as evidenced by a lower network diameter average path length and average degree however the tannery network has a higher average clustering coefficient than the other samples network graphs display similar structure with a central region of highly connected metabolites and a surrounding region of a variety of metabolites fig 3 visualizations of network graphs show analogous response for all metagenomic samples the eigencentrality parameter was calculated for each node in the network graphs while the degree of the nodes shows the most connected metabolites the eigencentrality assigns higher value to nodes connected to high degree nodes this allows the identification of the most important metabolites in the metabolic networks the six network reconstructions share 19 metabolites in the top 15 nodes with highest eigencentrality values these metabolites are related to basic metabolic functions and are shared by all samples except the tannery sample table s3 3 4 functional annotation and metabolic characterization the metabolic potential is similar between all samples this represents the metabolic functions for which enzymes were annotated in the metagenomes and constitutes the repertoire of reactions that could be used by the microbial community fig 4 the general trend shows a higher representation of reactions in carbohydrate metabolism followed by amino acid metabolism glycan metabolism has the lowest abundance in all samples the tannery sample has a higher representation of lipid metabolism reactions than other samples the twin cities sample and tannery sample share a high abundance of reactions that are part of the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism module 3 5 metabolic potential similarities the spearman dissimilarity on the abundance of reaction modules was calculated for each curated network reconstruction the three water bodies are closely related in potential metabolic functions samples from the mississippi river itasca and twin cities clustered together in a nearest distance dendrogram in fig 5 a showing that their geographical and hydrological relationship dominates meanwhile the bogotá river is most closely related to the produced water sample in potential metabolic functions this is likely the result of the high degree of contamination of the bogotá river which shows hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination the tannery sample has the most distant network in comparison even after correcting for number of reactions composing each reconstruction however the metabolic potential is similar between all six samples with spearman dissimilarity values lower than 0 1 this shows that their metabolic potential is similar and that the difference in terms of enzymatic reactions in the metagenomes is low 3 6 flux balance analysis flux balance analyses were performed on the six samples using four different objective functions to simulate biomass growth an anoxic environment and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds resulting fluxes are comparable between samples and between conditions simulated by objective functions within each sample flux results were also grouped by kegg reaction modules providing the number of active reactions in each module to allow comparison with the metabolic potential a high abundance of extreme flux values 0 1000 1000 are evidence of possible pathologies existing in the curated network reconstructions which leave some reactions unbounded fig s2 these unbounded reactions could correspond to reversible reactions or thermodynamically infeasible cycles additionally the distribution of the fluxes is similar in all six metagenomes which indicates that the results are comparable between the samples after simulating the fluxes of the metabolic networks with different conditions differences start to appear in respect to metabolic potential functional dissimilarity is greater with higher spearman distances and the mississippi river samples itasca and twin cities no longer group together fig 5b the active reaction module abundance of the bogotá river is closer to that of produced water than to lake itasca active metabolic reaction modules are not the same as the potential functions to confirm the dissimilarity patterns found at kegg module level the spearman dissimilarity was also calculated at a reaction flux level fig s3 at an active reaction flux level the dissimilarity between samples increases but the general pattern continues to be the same the bogotá river active metabolic functions across all objective functions is closer to produced water followed by feces and lake itasca with the tannery and twin cities samples having the highest dissimilarities separately observing the results of fba with different objective functions shows that optimizing cell growth and maximizing the degradation of xenobiotic compounds located produced water followed by feces and lake itasca as the samples closest in active fluxes to the bogotá river on the other hand maximizing nitrate and sulfate use as electron acceptor located produced water followed by lake itasca and feces as the samples closest in active metabolic functions to the bogotá river fig 6 shows the resulting heat maps for each objective function evaluated the resultant fba fluxes compared by objective function within the sample metagenomes can provide insight into the active functions the pearson dissimilarity was calculated to evaluate the difference in flux values obtained in the bogotá river network model for each objective function the results from the bogotá river show that in this sample maximizing cell growth produces reaction fluxes more closely related to sulfate use as electron acceptor but distant to all objective functions fig 7 the simulations for use of nitrate as electron acceptor and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds produced the most similar active metabolism 4 discussion metabolic network analysis provides a tool to model metagenomes at a functional level through this systems biology approach we were able to construct metagenome level curated network reconstructions that allowed the comparison of environmental samples functional analysis through fba highlights that the metabolic potential of environmental samples is not the same as active metabolic functions the bogotá river metagenome shares characteristics of other polluted water samples such as produced water this observation is consistent with our initial hypothesis that the microbiome of the bogotá river has adapted to the high degree of contamination as it resembles functionally the microbiome of a highly contaminated ecosystem 4 1 taxonomic distribution can be an indicator of pollution the six metagenomic samples analyzed presented differences in the taxonomic distribution of their microbial community the high abundance of proteobacteria in the bogotá river sample could be associated to the diversity of metabolic functions found to be used by members of this bacterial phylum jung et al 2016 spain et al 2009 the dominance of this phylum in the tannery sample is consistent with a high level of heavy metals high lipid concentrations and presence other contaminants that induce the abundance of proteobacteria especially betaproteobacteria at a phylum level lake itasca showed a more diverse microbiome with high abundance of actinobacteria low contamination levels of this location suggest that a decreased abundance of actinobacteria and increased abundance of proteobacteria could be indicators of downstream pollution of the mississippi river observed at twin cities this observation however is not consistent with a previous study in which the ratio of actinobacteria and proteobacteria was about the same in pristine and contaminated environments labbé et al 2007 in fact a previous study that evaluated the pristine water column of the amazon river found higher percentage of proteobacteria than actinobacteria in pristine waters ghai et al 2011 our results are consistent with the fact that contaminated sites have a high percentage of proteobacteria labbé et al 2007 margesin et al 2011 4 2 network topology reveals similar levels of plasticity the topological parameters of metabolic networks graphs indicate that the network reconstructions of the samples are structurally similar this coincides with results reported by alvarez silva et al 2017 for metagenomic reconstructions of soil samples network similarities seen in fig 3 and similar network topologies evidence an analogous response to changes in the networks the six networks have a similar response capacity to environmental changes however the high number of metagenomic sequences that are not annotated could contribute to the observed similarities in the networks the average path length of all samples except for the tannery sample is close to values found for genome scale reconstructions for 43 organisms while the average clustering coefficient of all samples is significantly lower jeong et al 2000 a low average clustering coefficient has been found for metagenome level reconstructions alvarez silva et al 2017 low clustering reflects a large number of metabolites with few connections and a small number of highly connected metabolites jeong et al 2000 the reduced complexity and higher connectivity of the tannery network can be related to the decreased microbial diversity at taxonomic level presented in the tannery sample such a difference suggests that changing microbial diversity affects the metabolic network topology at a greater degree than it affects the potential functional diversity common biomass cell growth and transport reactions between the samples may confound the structural similarities this limitation can also affect the observation of the most connected metabolites according to eigenvector centrality all networks except for the tannery sample have the same top 15 metabolites these metabolites are related to the central metabolic functions while network topology appears to be affected by taxonomic distribution variations in microbial taxa abundance do not greatly affect the potential functional diversity of the samples microbial diversity increases network complexity and makes the metabolic networks more plastic and robust this reflects and increasing robustness of microbial communities with high diversity 4 3 network curation is essential for flux balance analysis modeling of metabolic networks is helpful to reveal what functions are active in each sample however network curation is a crucial step to perform these analyses network pathologies reduce the connectivity between metabolites and affect the resulting fluxes the curation steps restore the connectivity of the network recovers missing reaction information and allows modelling artifacts may arise as reactions are introduced from databases additional manual curation can improve the accuracy of the modeled networks and make the analysis more robust in this case the curation level was similar between all networks with a high representation of reactions found through metagenome annotation this makes the models fit for simulation and the results comparable flux balance analysis results showed that the twin cities model was considerably different from the other six models these differences may arise due to variations in metabolic pathways present in this model as well as a larger amount of initial network pathologies improvements in metagenome annotation would help reduce the gap of reactions that create these problems persisting network pathologies can affect the fba deeper automated and manual curation can help improve the robustness of the analysis 4 4 metabolic potential is not the same as active metabolic functions in spite of the differences in taxonomic distribution metabolic potential is similar in all samples with few exceptions found in an increased representation of lipid and energy metabolism in the tannery sample which can be related to high lipid content in the discharges of the tanning process previous metagenomic studies had found this lack of connection between taxonomic distribution and function in ocean samples raes et al 2011 redundancy in functional characteristics within microbial communities could mean a decrease in taxonomic diversity does not affect functional diversity comparing the metabolic networks at a potential and active functional level provides evidence of similarities between samples fba results reveal that not all potential functions are active table s4 metabolic reaction fluxes depend on the simulated environmental conditions the selection of objective functions to model these environmental conditions is key to analyzing the functional activity of the microbial communities the bogotá river has a metabolic potential close to other freshwater samples lake itasca and the mississippi river at twin cities however metabolic potential is most closely related to that of the produced water sample at an active functional level the bogotá river was also closely associated to produced water followed by lake itasca this was no surprise as the bogotá river is highly contaminated similarity to lake itasca suggests that improving the water quality of the bogotá river could restore affected metabolic functions 4 5 bogotá river metabolic functions are driven by contamination the distance between fluxes that optimize cell growth with the rest of the objective functions indicates that biomass production is not the main metabolic driver in the bogotá river this is supported by the results from cell growth optimization having the lowest number of active reactions in contrast optimization of sulfate use as electron acceptor had the largest number of active fluxes closely followed by both the use of nitrate as electron acceptor and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds this was expected as the bogotá river has low dissolved oxygen concentration and presence of xenobiotics hernöndez et al 2015 rodríguez et al 2018 sulfate respiration is a clear indicator of the lack of oxygen in the river which leads to the displacement of macrofauna fba results present an image close to the reality of the river these similarities between fba results with different objective functions show the plasticity of the bogotá river network model where similar flux distributions satisfy different phenotypes 5 conclusions taxonomic distribution and potential functional distribution present an incomplete view of the active function of microbiomes metabolic network reconstruction is a systems biology tool that coupled with computational analysis through constraint based methods such as fba increases the information that can be drawn from metagenomic data in this study metagenome level metabolic networks of the bogotá river and five additional samples were constructed topological analysis of the networks shows close structural similarities between samples microbial diversity does not have a big effect on the potential metabolic repertoire but does make the metabolic network models more complex and robust fba analysis reveals functional differences in active reactions and reveals that the active metabolism is not the same as the potential metabolic functions the microbiome of the bogotá river was found to be more closely related to the microbiome of produced water both in potential and active metabolic functions this is an indicator of the contamination of the river however similarity to the functional diversity of lake itasca suggests that the water quality of the river can be recovered future studies should focus on the integration of multi omic data to metabolic network models to improve the predictive power of the models and propose or assess ecological management and

25087,marine ecosystems are characterized by an intricate set of interactions one of the most important occurs through the exchange of dissolved organic matter dom provided by phototrophs and used by heterotrophic bacteria as their main carbon and energy source this metabolic interaction represents the foundation of the entire ocean food web here we have assembled a synthetic ecosystem to assist the systems level investigation of this biological association this was achieved by building an integrated genome scale metabolic reconstruction using two model organisms a diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum and an heterotrophic bacterium pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis the model was initially analysed using a constraint based approach flux balance analysis fba and then turned into a dynamic dfba model to simulate a diatom bacteria co culture and to study the effect of changes in growth parameters on such a system furthermore we developed a simpler dynamic ordinary differential equations odes system that fed with dfba results was able to qualitatively describe this synthetic ecosystem and allowed performing stochastic simulations to assess the effect of noise on the overall balance of this co culture we show that our model represents known metabolic cross talks of a phototroph heterotroph system including mutualism and competition for inorganic ions i e phosphate and sulphate in addition the dynamic simulation predicts realistic growth rates for both the diatom and the bacterium and a steady state balance between diatom and bacterial cell concentration that matches those determined in experimental co cultures this steady state however is reached following an oscillatory trend a behaviour that is typically observed in the presence of metabolic co dependencies finally we show that at high diatom bacteria cell concentration ratio stochastic fluctuations can lead to the extinction of bacteria from the co culture causing an explosion of diatom population we anticipate that the developed synthetic ecosystem will serve as a basis for the generation of testable hypotheses and as a scaffold for integrating and interpreting omics data from experimental co cultures keywords microbial loop flux balance analysis metabolic modelling 1 introduction the term microbial loop refers to the production and microbial assimilation of dissolved organic matter dom in the marine environment azam et al 1983 fenchel 2008 a key role in such process is possessed by phytoplankton the pool of free floating photosynthetic organisms capable of capturing energy from sunlight and thus transforming inorganic matter into organic matter buchan et al 2014 carbon fixation by phytoplankton enters the microbial loop in two key ways as the phytoplankton is directly grazed by zooplankton and exudes carbon that is used a substrate by heterotrophic bacteria and subsequently transferred to higher trophic levels buchan et al 2014 ecologically speaking the microbial loop has a tremendous importance given that i roughly one half of the available atmospheric oxygen derives from photosynthetic organisms within the marine microbial loop and ii it represents the foundation of the entire marine food web pomeroy et al 2007 at the same time this biological process is hard to understand in detail given the many complex interactions at different cellular levels among different species this is a typical feature of marine ecosystems that encompass many cellular levels metabolism signalling etc and that connect every species to many others through different interaction types such as mutualism competition and parasitism amin et al 2012 a well known association occurring within the microbial loop involves diatoms and bacteria amin et al 2012 diatoms are ubiquitous photosynthetic eukaryotes that are responsible for about 20 of photosynthesis on earth amin et al 2012 such phototrophic organisms are key players in shaping the global carbon cycle as they can serve as food for higher eukaryotes and more importantly in the context of the present work for heterotrophic bacteria this latter group of bacteria includes ubiquitous microorganisms that usually thrive on organic carbon compounds produced by diatoms or other phototrophs thus recycling them back to carbon dioxide and water indeed from a metabolic perspective the phycosphere the region that extends outward from an algal cell bell and mitchell 1972 is characterized by an intense activity this includes commensalism based on organic carbon supplied by phytoplankton and competition for mineral nutrients diner et al 2016 additionally in some cases diatoms have been shown to benefit from the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in their surroundings cooper and smith 2015 sonnenschein et al 2012 suleiman et al 2016 as the latter can synthesize and release essential nutrients to their partners on one hand dom release by diatoms a widespread process that may result in up to 50 of the fixed carbon leaving the cell represents the main nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria occupying the phycosphere morán et al 2001a morán et al 2001b moran and estrada 2002 on the other hand diatoms and bacteria compete for the usage of several inorganic ions studies concerning the assimilation of inorganic phosphate and nitrate for example have shown that bacteria compete with phytoplankton for these nutrients bratbak and thingstad 1985 thingstad et al 1993 diner et al 2016 phototroph heterotroph interactions can be tackled both experimentally and theoretically co cultures embedding these two types of microorganisms represent excellent platforms for identifying possible metabolic cross talks and other interactions between these two organisms wang et al 2014 l et al 2017 complementary theoretical models have allowed shedding light on system level characteristics of this biological association stone 1990 baretta bekker et al 1994 bratbak and thingstad 1985 this latter approach has been mainly based on the use of systems of ordinary differential equations odes to predict the variation in time of phytoplankton and bacteria cell number in simulated co culture experiments in such systems biological entities e g bacterial and or phytoplankton cells are represented as discrete units whose concentration in time i e growth rate is a function of a few parameters such as the nutrient concentration and or the growth rate of the eventual competitor the increasingly popular genome scale metabolic modelling gsmm approach offers the opportunity to examine the phototroph heterotroph association and ecosystems in general succurro and ebenhöh 2018 bosi et al 2017 under a different perspective and with higher resolution indeed despite being demanding the assembly of genome scale metabolic reconstructions accounting for the almost entire set of metabolic reactions of a cell is today feasible in a reasonable amount of time and for virtually every strain whose genome has been sequenced kim et al 2017 additionally the use of constraint based metabolic modelling tools e g flux balance analysis fba allows simulating metabolic fluxes at the whole cell level given the available nutrients to date however this approach has never been exploited to investigate the metabolic cross talk between diatom and bacterial representatives systemically the aim of this work is the construction of a metabolic model to reproduce the interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs in silico for this purpose we used available resources for two model organisms i e the heterotrophic bacterium pseudoalteromonas haloplanktins tac125 phtac125 and the phototrophic diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum ptri our group has recently assembled and experimentally validated a genome scale metabolic reconstruction for the heterotrophic antarctic bacterium p haloplanktins tac125 fondi et al 2015 this microorganism is considered the model of cold adapted bacteria and a growing body of literature has illustrated its main physiological features wilmes et al 2010 sannino et al 2017 similarly p tricornutum is considered one of the model diatom representatives and many experiments have contributed to the deep characterization of its physiology available nowadays genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been performed for this diatom most recently in early 2017 levering et al 2017 importantly representatives of these taxa have been shown to co occur in oceanic samples moejes et al 2017 here we show that this combined metabolic reconstruction is able to represent the main known features of this simple microbial community including competition and commensalism and to predict the behaviour of this biological system dynamically being based on genome scale reconstructions our approach allows exploring and interrogating the model at the single metabolic reaction metabolite level further using the fixed points predicted by constraint based metabolic modelling cbmm a simpler odes model was implemented and used to model the dynamics of the phtac125 ptri co culture and to perform stochastic modelling of this synthetic ecosystem we anticipate that the implemented modelling framework will represent a valuable resource for a more focused experimental design to study diatom bacteria interactions 2 methods 2 1 the constraint based model the diatom bacterium synthetic ecosystem was built starting from the single organism models of p tricornutum levering et al 2016 2017 and p haloplanktis tac125 fondi et al 2015 we adopted the following strategy to build a multi compartment metabolic model accounting for the metabolic interactions of these two organisms 1 as the two reconstructions encompassed different naming schemes we mapped the two reconstructions to the same name space using the metanetx server bernard et al 2012 2 to minimize the required interventions on the original reconstructions only the names of the boundary metabolites common to the two reconstructions were changed to the corresponding metanetx code in other words only the set of metabolites that can be exported and imported by the two organisms were named according to the same name space these 14 metabolites supplementary material s1 will represent the pool of nutrients that can be eventually shared among the two organisms by means of different interaction types namely competition and cooperation 3 a multi compartment model was built this included a compartment s in which the two single organism reconstructions are inserted and in which extracellular metabolites can be secreted and or taken up this compartment ideally represents the growth medium exchange reactions regulating the amount of nutrients present in this common compartment were included in the overall model to modulate their availability to the two organisms additional compartments included extracellular and cytoplasmic bacterial compartments z and t respectively extracellular cytoplasmic chloroplastic mitocondrial thylakoid lumen and peroxisomic diatom compartments e c h m u x respectively a schematic representation of the multi compartment model is reported in fig 1 concerning community biomass we defined a community level objective function by linearly merging the species biomass equations into the following biomass generating reaction b c b d b b where b c b d and b b represent community diatom and bacterial biomasses respectively in our integrated reconstruction dom is secreted by the diatom and represents the only carbon source for the bacterium more in detail we introduced a dom release reaction in the combined model accounting for the exudation of a fraction 10 of the biomass produced by the diatom through auxotrophic growth following experimental evidences the composition of the secreted dom included carbohydrates glucose mannose arabinose xylose fucose galactose and glucuronate fatty acids myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid palmitoleic acid alpha linoleic acid eicosapentanoic acid and all the 20 amino acids the kind and the relative amount of each single compound released in the external medium by the diatom was derived from the biomass composition equation of the original diatom metabolic reconstruction and or from specific literature levering et al 2017 benavides et al 2013 see supplementary material s1 for the specific model reactions accounting for dom release concerning phtac125 carbon uptake it is well established that when grown in a complex medium i the metabolism of this bacterium is geared towards the consumption of amino acids medigue et al 2005 fondi et al 2016 sannino et al 2017 wilmes et al 2010 and ii the bacterium thrives on a very narrow spectrum of carbohydrates fondi et al 2015 we then assumed that the bacterium would preferentially feed on a reduced set of dom derived compounds rather than on the entire set of single dom constituents listed above in particular when facing a complex mixture of amino acids phtac125 selectively starts feeding on glutamate serine threonine asparagine and aspartate the remaining amino acids are consumed only after the exhaustion of this set wilmes et al 2010 we then assumed that out of all the compounds released by the diatom the bacterium would only feed on these amino acids dom derived amino acids hereinafter dom aa lower bounds of amino acids uptake reactions of phtac125 were initially set to 1 mmol g h 1 a value representative for this bacterium when it is grown in a medium rich in amino acids fondi et al 2015 the other boundaries of the integrated model were set as described in supplementary material s1 the integrated phtac125 ptri metabolic reconstruction was next converted into a dynamic constraint based model of this co culture using the approach implemented in dfbalab gomez et al 2014 as described in detail in supplementary material s1 mirroring the previously described constraint based static model ptri thrives only on photons and co 2 and releases dom in the culture dom aa in turn represents the only carbon source for phtac125 further the growth of both organisms is dependent on phosphate and accordingly they compete for it all the other micro nutrients were considered to be present in non limiting concentrations i e the lower bounds of the corresponding reactions were set to 1000 a negligible initial amount 1x10 5 mmol l of the other nutrients whose concentrations were allowed to change in time e g dom components was assumed to ensure their accumulation during the dynamic simulation non zero derivatives a set of differential equations was then used to model the dynamic co growth of phtac125 and ptri and the consumption of the nutrients in the medium see supplementary material s1 2 2 the stochastic model of the synthetic ecosystem the dynamic description of the phtac125 ptri co culture was also formulated as an ensemble of stochastic rules using a set of chemical equations to this end we lumped all the species of the constraint based model and denote by d b c and p one individual of diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate respectively in this system mimicking the previous set up the diatom relies on phosphate and light to produce biomass and dissolved carbon that in turn represents the only carbon source for the bacterium as we decided not to include the constant inflow of photons in this odes dynamic system of equations the equation describing the growth of diatoms in the system can be written as 1 d p α 2 d h c where α represents the overall rate of the reaction while h is the number of produced molecules of carbon bacteria in the system rely on dissolved carbon produced exclusively by the diatom and phosphate to duplicate and eventually increase their biomass we describe this relationship using the following equation 2 b p c γ 2 b where γ represents the overall rate of the reaction similar to bratbak and thingstad 1985 the growth rate of the diatom is a function of p and d whereas bacterial growth depends on p and c availability additionally phosphate and carbon are injected into the system at a constant rate 3 ε p 4 η c it is to be noted that in our synthetic ecosystem c can only be produced by the activity of the diatom and no influx of external c was allowed for this reason the parameter regulating the inflow of c η was set to 0 during the dynamic simulations eventually all the species undergo degradation according to 5 d ξ d δ 6 b ξ b δ 7 c ξ c δ 8 p ξ p δ where δ is the degradation rate and ξ i with i d b c p are dilution rate constants at each time t the system is fully described by n n d n b n c n p a vector whose components n i for i d b c p are discrete quantities that identify the total number of elements of species i to proceed in the analysis it is necessary to introduce the transition rates t n n from the state n to the new state n these transitions originate from eq 1 8 and their explicit forms can be found in in section 1 4 of supplementary information s1 in this way the dynamics of the system is governed by a master equation whose generic form reads 9 d dt p n t n n t n n p n t t n n p n t where p n t labels the probability for the system to be in state n at time t even though in most situations this equation does not allow a closed form solution it represents a powerful tool that enables one to get insight into the traditional continuous and deterministic rate equations as well as fluctuations stemming from the discreteness of the system let us first focus on the deterministic case following the detailed analytic derivation described in section 1 4 of supplementary information s1 it can be proved that in the limit where the volume of the system goes to infinity van kampen et al 2014 the stochastic model described by eq 1 8 can be mapped into the following set of ordinary differential equations 10 ϕ d α ϕ d ϕ p ξ d δ ϕ d ϕ b γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ b δ ϕ b ϕ c η h α ϕ d ϕ p γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ c δ ϕ c ϕ p ε α ϕ d ϕ p γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ p δ ϕ p where ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c and ϕ p stand for the continuous concentrations associated to diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate respectively setting equal to zero the temporal derivatives appearing on the left hand side of eq 10 the solution of the corresponding nonlinear system gives the equilibrium point that we here label ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c ϕ p its components are 11 ϕ d ε η δ ξ d h 1 α γ h 1 ξ c ξ b ξ d 2 δ ξ p α h 1 ϕ b ε h η δ ξ b h 1 α γ h 1 ξ c ξ d h h 1 δ α ξ p ξ d ξ b ϕ c α γ ξ b ξ d ϕ p δ α ξ d since the odes model mimics the mechanism underling our dfba implementation we expect the stationary concentrations resulting from the two different approaches to be the same for this reason denoting by fba d fba b fba c and fba p the stationary concentrations of respectively diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate resulting from the dfba simulation our idea is to set them equal to ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c ϕ p this procedure yields a nonlinear system that can be analytically solved to find an estimation of the parameters provided ε η ξ d ξ b ξ c and ξ p are known in formulae 12 δ ε ξ d fba d ξ b fba b ξ p fba p α ε ξ d fba p ξ d fba d ξ b fba b ξ p fba

cobra toolbox v 2 0 6 in matlab 2015b with gurobi v 6 5 0 as the linear programming solver dynamic fba was performed using an ad hoc modified version of dfbalab gomez et al 2014 stochastic simulations were performed using the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 essentially based on a dynamic monte carlo method all the codes used in this work are available at https synml sourceforge io 3 results 3 1 the integrated reconstruction represents phototroph heterotroph metabolic cross talk in this work we have combined two existing metabolic reconstructions namely ilpb1025 and imf721 in a single integrated model to simulate a synthetic ecosystem characterized by the metabolic interactions existing between a phototroph the model diatom p tricornutum and a heterotrophic bacterium p haloplanktis tac125 the integrated metabolic model consists of 1746 genes 3588 reactions and 2861 metabolites this synthetic ecosystem encompasses 9 compartments including 1 external shared compartment where cellular products are secreted imported by the two organisms 6 and 2 cellular compartments belonging to the diatom and the bacterium reconstructions respectively in an initial phase reaction boundaries were defined as reported in methods a community biomass objective function was defined as the linear combination of ptri and phtac125 biomasses as described in methods an fba simulation was performed assuming such conditions allowing a preliminary outlook on the metabolic phenotype of the diatom bacterium community this analysis revealed that the model correctly predicts the main known features for such a biological system in that the diatom is predicted to take up co 2 from the environment and to use nh 4 as n source consistently o 2 is released in the environment as a product of the diatom metabolism the simulated conditions support the growth and o 2 consumption of the heterotrophic bacterium phtac125 whose predicted growth rate is 0 02 h 1 no ammonia uptake is predicted for the bacterium consistent with the fact that amino acids part of the dom fraction can be used as a source for both c and n by phtac125 as experimentally shown in mocali et al 2017 we then checked the metabolic interdependencies existing between the two models in the ecosystem to this aim we computed the pareto front between diatom and bacterium grow rates fig 2 a in its simplest formulation the pareto front represents the trade off between the two organisms maximal growth rates accordingly the surface delimited by the pareto optimality frontier identifies the set of optimal solution of our double optimization diatom and bacterium growth such solutions i e a couple of growth rate values are said to be pareto optimal as there are no other solutions that can better satisfy all of the objectives simultaneously in particular fig 2a revealed three main features i a situation in which both the diatom and the bacterium grow at their corresponding highest achievable growth rate is not included in the plane of feasible solutions ii diatom growth is predicted even in the absence of bacterial growth but conversely iii bacterial growth in the absence of diatom growth is not a feasible solution overall this analysis confirmed that the two models embedded in the integrated reconstruction are dependent of each other and that both competition simultaneous bacterial and diatom maximal growth is not a feasible solution and commensalism no bacterial growth in the absence of diatom growth can be described by our system the latter feature emerges because diatom derived dom aa is the only carbon source available to the bacterium indeed decreasing the amount of light available to the diatom resulted in a decrease of the overall community growth rate fig 2b no clues concerning which substrate s is responsible for the competition between the two organisms can be derived simply by inspecting the pareto frontier to identify those shared metabolites whose availability limited the growth of both organisms we performed a robustness analysis i e we evaluated the effect on phtac125 and ptri growth rates of perturbing the exchange rate of each of the 14 compounds that can be taken up by each organism in the reconstruction we identified two macronutrients whose uptake is essential for sustaining the growth of both organisms namely phosphate and sulphate as shown in fig 2c and d perturbing the exchange rates of such compounds strongly influences the growth rate of ptri and phtac125 and no growth is predicted when their exchange rate is set to 0 as outlined below metabolic competition over these inorganic ions among diatoms and bacteria is well characterized egge 1998 bratbak and thingstad 1985 3 2 a dynamic fba model for the phototroph heterotroph metabolic cross talk to understand the dynamics of the metabolic interactions between ph tac125 and ptri we implemented a dynamic constraint based model of their growth in a well stirred reactor as described in gomez et al 2014 mirroring the simulation previously described ptri thrives only on photons and co 2 and releases dom aa that constitutes the only carbon source for phtac125 the amount of matter released by diatom in the form of dom is highly variable and seems to be dependent on the species and the environment considered see below in this initial simulation we assumed that 10 of the fixed carbon was released in the culture and could be metabolised by the bacterium we started the dynamic simulation from a 1 1 ratio in phtac125 and ptri cell concentrations in this synthetic community 0 01 gcdw l we then set an initial non limiting phosphate and carbon concentration of 5 mmol l and 10 mmol l respectively additionally the concentration of the inlet flow of phosphate δ was set to 0 0016 mmol l mimicking the observed concentration of phosphate in natural conditions zimmer and cutter 2012 michaelis menten expressions were implemented to set the proper phosphate exchange rate for both the organisms as described in supplementary material s1 as phtac125 metabolism is known to be geared towards the consumption of amino acids medigue et al 2005 fondi et al 2016 sannino et al 2017 wilmes et al 2010 we monitored the concentration of the exchanged amino acids glutamate serine threonine asparagine and aspartate across the entire simulation as shown in fig 3 b and c both organisms start growing thanks to the irradiance the diatom and to the initial amount of carbon present in the system the bacterium fig 3c and d the initial growth of both organisms however is interrupted by the exhaustion of the phosphate excess in the medium fig 3b and c the diatom starts a second growth phase growing earlier than the bacterium compatible with the fact that the latter has no carbon source available until ptri has reached a certain cell density and has released a sufficient amount of dom aa in the medium after the diatom production of dom aa is sufficiently high fig 3d the bacterium starts another growth phase fig 3c which is further interrupted by phosphate decrease afterwards as phosphate is added to the co culture in a limiting amount an oscillatory pattern is observed reflecting the competition for phosphate on one side and the fact the phtac125 thrives only on released dom aa on the other indeed as dom aa get more abundant phtac125 increases its phosphate requirement to sustain growth and consequently reduces the amount of available phosphate for ptri this in turn slows down the diatom growth rate and the amount of available carbon to the bacterium such an oscillatory pattern is clearly reflected when computing the ratio between bacterium and diatom biomass throughout the simulation fig 3a the simulated culture conditions will then lead to a steady state in which the concentrations of the different species both organisms and dissolved nutrients will not change over time in our simulation the equilibrium is reached with a ptri concentration that is 100 fold higher than that of phtac125 additionally the final diatom cellular concentration and the average predicted growth rate predicted by our simulation throughout the simulation were 0 038 gdw l and 0 0128 h 1 for ptri and 0 0025 gdw l and 0 0164 h 1 for phtac125 increasing the concentration of phosphate available to the two organisms resulted in a longer and larger oscillatory pattern before the final steady state is reached fig 3a apparently an increased phosphate concentration leads to a positive feedback according to which bacterial growth rate increases dom aa and nutrients are consumed more rapidly and a stronger bacterium diatom competition for phosphate is established this trend is further amplified if the dilution rate of phosphate is set to zero allowing both organisms to consume all the phosphate that is introduced into the system in this case the species display sustained oscillations see supplementary information s1 clearly the amount of dom released by the diatom and used by the bacterium as carbon and energy sources is crucial for maintaining the equilibrium between phtac125 and ptri biomass concentration in this closed system we monitored the effect of varying the amount of dom released by the diatom on the stability of the co culture system thus we performed distinct dynamic simulations varying for each of them the ratio between biomass accumulation and released dom our analysis shows that as might expected the ptri phtac125 ratio in this synthetic ecosystem increases with decreasing dom release fig 4 this reflects both that the diatom redirects a greater fraction of cellular intermediates to the synthesis of biomass rather than to the secretion of c compounds and that consequently there is less dom available for the bacterium finally we have considered the recent finding according to which bacteria are able to degrade monomethylamine which is a ubiquitous organic nitrogen compound in marine environments providing ammonium to diatoms and sustain their growth in the absence of external ammonia suleiman et al 2016 we have accounted for this scenario by modifying of two organism model and making the bacterium secreted ammonium essential for the diatom growth results of this analysis are reported in supplementary material s1 3 3 ode based modelling of idbe as shown the dfba model represents the behaviour of a phtac125 ptri co culture nevertheless this dynamic modelling framework is purely deterministic and as such it cannot deal with possible noise and fluctuations of the surrounding environment indeed it is widely accepted that the marine environment is subjected to recurrent fluctuations in nutrient levels through the movement of tides and currents cruz de carvalho et al 2016 especially at the micro scale level cordero and datta 2016 enke et al 2018 for this reason the next step was to use the results of this dynamic simulation to set up a simpler and more controllable dynamic model based on odes see methods using the fixed point values obtained for each parameter we performed a dynamic simulation of the diatom bacterium co culture using eq 10 to check whether despite being computationally simpler the implemented odes model could qualitatively reproduce the behaviour of the dynamic constraint based modelling as shown in the insets of fig 3a e the odes based model correctly predicts an initial increase of bacterial diatom and carbon species also in agreement with the previous simulation phosphate is predicted to decrease from its initial concentration determining the stop of the growth of the aforementioned species similarly the biomass ratio of diatom and bacterial cells predicted by the odes based model qualitatively resembles that resulting from the constraint based model displaying an initial predominance of bacterial cells followed by a rapid and persistent shift towards a diatom dominated culture as expected the odes based model then approaches the same steady point predicted by the dfba model although displaying a reduced oscillatory trend this is likely due to the difference in the basic formulation of the two models the dfba model embeds more variables and parameters and is therefore capable of accounting for more complex behaviours of this specific co culture after checking that the simpler dynamic system displayed the same overall trend of the dfba model we wanted to address the possible effects of fluctuations on the simulated metabolic cross talk between ptri and phtac125 the mathematical models described previously have approached the problem via deterministic paradigms overlooking the possible role played by the noise this aspect becomes particularly important when as in this case accounting for the presence of diverse chemical species in a spatially diffusive environment for example the two organisms may compete for nutrients e g phosphate at the microscopic scale they might be hindering each other with regard to the binding of the nutrient molecule under specific conditions i e nutrients paucity and or unbalanced biomass ration in the culture such competition sustained by the stochastic component of the dynamics might result in different and alternative steady states in order to perform stochastic simulations we initially adjusted some of the parameters of the model in order to get 1 a balanced ratio between diatom and bacterial cells at the fixed point and 2 concentration values for all the species embedded in the system sufficiently high to avoid their eventual extinction from the system after a few iterations this involved reducing the dilution rate of phtac125 and ptri and doubling the fraction of produced biomass leaving the diatom cell as dom from 10 to 20 table 1 leaving the diatom cell that represents the only carbon source for the bacteria as already stated the master equation 9 cannot be solved analytically analytical progress is possible only by making use of expansion techniques which require specific assumptions one available tool to overcome this limitation is to solve the stochastic model through dedicated numerical schemes such as the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 each trajectory corresponding to an exact single gillespie simulation belongs to the probability distribution solution of the master equation assuming the initial conditions listed in table 1 our analysis showed a little effect of noise on the stability of the synthetic ecosystem with the two species displaying the same overall dynamics as the deterministic model fig 5 we also performed the same stochastic simulation for different values of the inlet phosphate concentrations ϵ revealing no major influence of this parameter on the overall stability of the system supplementary file s1 the other parameter that might influence the dynamics of the synthetic ecosystem is the dilution rate of the diatom ξ d and the bacterium ξ b in the simulated bioreactor as it ultimately regulates the number of cells populating the co culture thus we tested the robustness of the system in respect to stochastic fluctuations for a different range of fba d fba b cell concentration ratios we performed a new series of stochastic simulations setting the dilution rates the rate at which microorganisms are removed from the system to 10 20 40 60 and 80 for both the diatom and the bacterium and tested all the possible combinations thereof when dilution rates for both organisms are above 50 and the ratio between diatom and bacteria dilution rates is high i e the diatom cell concentration does not sensibly exceed the bacterial one the system displays a rather robust trend with respect to noise see colored lines of fig 6 a indeed no major discrepancies compared to the deterministic simulation are observed black line of fig 6a at higher values of bacterial dilution rates i e with lower bacterial cells in the co culture the equilibrium becomes rather unstable when the ratio between diatom and bacteria dilution rates approaches 0 3 i e bacteria die roughly three times faster than diatoms some stochastic simulations deviate from the fixed point and more specifically the culture becomes diatom dominated fig 6b a further increase in bacterial dilution rate leads to a clear prevalence of diatom dominated co cultures among the whole set of stochastic simulations fig 6c as virtually all the simulations lead to the maximum biomass concentration achievable by the diatom as expected we observed no bacterial dominated co cultures among all the stochastic simulations performed as the diatom produced dom aa is essential for phtac125 survival 4 discussion in this work we have used two established genome scale metabolic reconstructions to build a synthetic ecosystem accounting for part of the metabolic interdependencies between diatoms and bacteria applying cbmm namely fba revealed that our model is able to capture the basic metabolic relationships as competition and commensalism which are commonly observed in diatom heterotroph associations amin et al 2012 in our synthetic ecosystem the growth of the bacterium depends on the release of dom aa by the diatom but the growth of the bacterium reduces the availability of inorganic ions phosphate and sulfate to the diatom on the other hand the growth of the bacterium reduces the availability of inorganic ions phosphate and sulfate to the diatom thus negatively affecting its growth the integrated reconstruction was then analysed by means of a dynamic framework that is dfba this allowed the simulation of a co culture system stirred reactor and to evaluate the effect of specific parameters e g phosphate inflow concentration on the dynamics of this biological system in agreement with previous results from experimental diatom bacteria co cultures and mathematical models l et al 2017 bratbak and thingstad 1985 our simulations reached an equilibrium with the diatoms and the bacteria co existing by adjusting the different parameters encompassed by our model we showed that this equilibrium can be shifted towards bacterial or algal dominance and or leading to interesting collective phenotypes e g sustained oscillations the final cellular concentration of the two organisms together fell in the range of measured values for ptri alone indeed a mono culture of ptri on a f 2 medium reached a final cell concentration between 150 and 200 mg and a μ of 0 025 h 1 an average μ of 0 0128 h 1 was predicted by our simulation throughout the simulation yodsuwan et al 2017 this relationship between phtac125 and ptri biomass concentration resembles the one observed when growing other representatives of these two groups of organisms in a laboratory setting diner et al 2016 varying the concentration of the phosphate inflow fig 3 had an effect on the intermediate stage of growth with smaller but longer oscillations observed when the phosphate concentration was increased such collective oscillations are typically observed in the presence of metabolic co dependencies liu et al 2015 we then tested the effect of varying the proportion of fixed carbon that is redirected by the diatom towards dom secretion rather than biomass assembly on the overall balance of the entire system phytoplankton exudation and or cell lysis represents a primary resource for bacterial metabolism baines and pace 1991 the quantification of dissolved organic substances released by phytoplankton has long been the subject of research and debate a few works based on extensive data re analysis identified an approximative average range of 10 to 20 released dom over a diatom total primary production with values up to 50 and as low as 4 thornton 2014 perry 1976 our model predicts a shift towards a diatom dominated culture as the fraction of carbon secreted in the medium rather than redirected towards diatom biomass assembly is decreased fig 4 however the two species coexist across all the dom release rates tested finally using the fixed points predicted by the dfba simulation we implemented a stochastic dynamic model of the same phtac125 ptri co culture this system is composed of 4 ordinary differential equations eq 10 accounting for the change in time of the concentration of ptri and phtac125 cells dom aa and phosphate after successfully checking that the dynamic model resembled the trends observed during dfba simulations we tested the effect of noise on the equilibrium between the two microorganisms we found the synthetic ecosystem to be quite robust at similar diatom bacterial cell concentrations and for different phosphate inflows in this case every stochastic simulation resembled the trend obtained with the deterministic model however decreasing the ratio of diatom bacterial cell concentration down to 0 3 by regulating their corresponding dilution rates resulted in a bistable ecosystem phenotype with a few stochastic simulations leading to an entirely diatom dominated co culture interestingly bacteria have been shown to play a role in the explosion of algal population bloom in mesocosm experiments e g by inhibiting diatom aggregation and prolonging the bloom smith et al 1995 riemann et al 2000 on the basis of the results of our model we hypothesize that the bacterial cell concentration and its effect on the metabolic interactions with the diatom may also have a role in determining the shift towards a diatom dominated culture below a certain threshold stochastic noise may induce the extinction of bacteria from the co culture and as a consequence reduce the overall competition with diatoms for essential nutrients e g phosphate this in turn may lead to the explosion of the diatom population this is in agreement with previous observations on the abrupt decrease of bacterial abundance concomitantly with algal blooms riemann et al 2000 although this is still a debated point see zhou et al 2018 and smith et al 1995 and with the bistable behaviour of modelled planktonic systems edwards 2001 generally speaking here we have introduced a system that includes both competition for the same resource phosphate and commensalism similar systems have been recently described and modelled revealing their capability to display oscillatory patterns fowler 2014 fowler et al 2014 mcguinness et al 2014 moyles and fowler 2018 in particular the interaction of populations displaying a degree of competition can promote self sustained oscillations these oscillations can exhibit extraordinarily low values of the populations implying the effective extinction of the populations again these outcomes match those predicted by our two organism model system despite differences in the mathematical formulation of the problem and in the microbial species included 5 conclusions here we have presented a synthetic bacterial diatom ecosystem the model was specifically designed for describing possible metabolic interactions occurring between an heterotrophic bacterium p haloplanktis and a diatom p tricornutum such interactions were studied at different levels using different modelling techniques ranging from static constraint based to dynamic stochastic modelling a number of community level constraint based models have been developed in recent years chan et al 2017 zomorrodi and segre 2016 machado et al 2018 the model presented here provides a first attempt to formalize the possible metabolic cross talk occurring in a part of the microbial loop in building up our model we relied on several approximations first grazers e g metazoans capable of feeding on microalgae and thus possibly contributing to their extinction from the synthetic ecosystem were not explicitly accounted for by our metabolic reconstruction tuning the diatom dilution rates in the odes based model could account for variations in grazer activity for a more process based representation of the impact of grazers a genome scale metabolic reconstruction of these organisms would be needed unfortunately such reconstructions do not exist furthermore in our proof of concept reconstruction we have identified possible metabolic interactions only on the basis of the genome sequence of the two microbial representatives it is entirely possible that other metabolic cross talks between these organisms exist and that the network of shared metabolites is more complex than the one hypothesized in this work metabolomic experiments conducted over co cultures of phtac125 and ptri and their corresponding single cultures will clarify this point and highlight untapped metabolites exchange between these two organisms finally at present there is no direct evidence of ptri and phtac125 co occurring in the natural environment despite pseudoalteromonadaceae representatives having been shown to be the prevalent microbial family throughout most of the growth phases of the diatom moejes et al 2017 the framework presented is currently driving the implementation of an experimental diatom bacterium co culture that in turn will be used to train our model and adjust all the parameters that are currently unknown once properly trained it will be possible to use our synthetic ecosystem to predict interspecies dynamics reliably under numerous conditions this might include for example the study of the effect of environmental perturbations on the overall system e g climate change related perturbations or the possible exploitation of this ecosystem for biotechnological purposes acknowledgements this work was

25087,marine ecosystems are characterized by an intricate set of interactions one of the most important occurs through the exchange of dissolved organic matter dom provided by phototrophs and used by heterotrophic bacteria as their main carbon and energy source this metabolic interaction represents the foundation of the entire ocean food web here we have assembled a synthetic ecosystem to assist the systems level investigation of this biological association this was achieved by building an integrated genome scale metabolic reconstruction using two model organisms a diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum and an heterotrophic bacterium pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis the model was initially analysed using a constraint based approach flux balance analysis fba and then turned into a dynamic dfba model to simulate a diatom bacteria co culture and to study the effect of changes in growth parameters on such a system furthermore we developed a simpler dynamic ordinary differential equations odes system that fed with dfba results was able to qualitatively describe this synthetic ecosystem and allowed performing stochastic simulations to assess the effect of noise on the overall balance of this co culture we show that our model represents known metabolic cross talks of a phototroph heterotroph system including mutualism and competition for inorganic ions i e phosphate and sulphate in addition the dynamic simulation predicts realistic growth rates for both the diatom and the bacterium and a steady state balance between diatom and bacterial cell concentration that matches those determined in experimental co cultures this steady state however is reached following an oscillatory trend a behaviour that is typically observed in the presence of metabolic co dependencies finally we show that at high diatom bacteria cell concentration ratio stochastic fluctuations can lead to the extinction of bacteria from the co culture causing an explosion of diatom population we anticipate that the developed synthetic ecosystem will serve as a basis for the generation of testable hypotheses and as a scaffold for integrating and interpreting omics data from experimental co cultures keywords microbial loop flux balance analysis metabolic modelling 1 introduction the term microbial loop refers to the production and microbial assimilation of dissolved organic matter dom in the marine environment azam et al 1983 fenchel 2008 a key role in such process is possessed by phytoplankton the pool of free floating photosynthetic organisms capable of capturing energy from sunlight and thus transforming inorganic matter into organic matter buchan et al 2014 carbon fixation by phytoplankton enters the microbial loop in two key ways as the phytoplankton is directly grazed by zooplankton and exudes carbon that is used a substrate by heterotrophic bacteria and subsequently transferred to higher trophic levels buchan et al 2014 ecologically speaking the microbial loop has a tremendous importance given that i roughly one half of the available atmospheric oxygen derives from photosynthetic organisms within the marine microbial loop and ii it represents the foundation of the entire marine food web pomeroy et al 2007 at the same time this biological process is hard to understand in detail given the many complex interactions at different cellular levels among different species this is a typical feature of marine ecosystems that encompass many cellular levels metabolism signalling etc and that connect every species to many others through different interaction types such as mutualism competition and parasitism amin et al 2012 a well known association occurring within the microbial loop involves diatoms and bacteria amin et al 2012 diatoms are ubiquitous photosynthetic eukaryotes that are responsible for about 20 of photosynthesis on earth amin et al 2012 such phototrophic organisms are key players in shaping the global carbon cycle as they can serve as food for higher eukaryotes and more importantly in the context of the present work for heterotrophic bacteria this latter group of bacteria includes ubiquitous microorganisms that usually thrive on organic carbon compounds produced by diatoms or other phototrophs thus recycling them back to carbon dioxide and water indeed from a metabolic perspective the phycosphere the region that extends outward from an algal cell bell and mitchell 1972 is characterized by an intense activity this includes commensalism based on organic carbon supplied by phytoplankton and competition for mineral nutrients diner et al 2016 additionally in some cases diatoms have been shown to benefit from the presence of heterotrophic bacteria in their surroundings cooper and smith 2015 sonnenschein et al 2012 suleiman et al 2016 as the latter can synthesize and release essential nutrients to their partners on one hand dom release by diatoms a widespread process that may result in up to 50 of the fixed carbon leaving the cell represents the main nutrient source for heterotrophic bacteria occupying the phycosphere morán et al 2001a morán et al 2001b moran and estrada 2002 on the other hand diatoms and bacteria compete for the usage of several inorganic ions studies concerning the assimilation of inorganic phosphate and nitrate for example have shown that bacteria compete with phytoplankton for these nutrients bratbak and thingstad 1985 thingstad et al 1993 diner et al 2016 phototroph heterotroph interactions can be tackled both experimentally and theoretically co cultures embedding these two types of microorganisms represent excellent platforms for identifying possible metabolic cross talks and other interactions between these two organisms wang et al 2014 l et al 2017 complementary theoretical models have allowed shedding light on system level characteristics of this biological association stone 1990 baretta bekker et al 1994 bratbak and thingstad 1985 this latter approach has been mainly based on the use of systems of ordinary differential equations odes to predict the variation in time of phytoplankton and bacteria cell number in simulated co culture experiments in such systems biological entities e g bacterial and or phytoplankton cells are represented as discrete units whose concentration in time i e growth rate is a function of a few parameters such as the nutrient concentration and or the growth rate of the eventual competitor the increasingly popular genome scale metabolic modelling gsmm approach offers the opportunity to examine the phototroph heterotroph association and ecosystems in general succurro and ebenhöh 2018 bosi et al 2017 under a different perspective and with higher resolution indeed despite being demanding the assembly of genome scale metabolic reconstructions accounting for the almost entire set of metabolic reactions of a cell is today feasible in a reasonable amount of time and for virtually every strain whose genome has been sequenced kim et al 2017 additionally the use of constraint based metabolic modelling tools e g flux balance analysis fba allows simulating metabolic fluxes at the whole cell level given the available nutrients to date however this approach has never been exploited to investigate the metabolic cross talk between diatom and bacterial representatives systemically the aim of this work is the construction of a metabolic model to reproduce the interactions between autotrophs and heterotrophs in silico for this purpose we used available resources for two model organisms i e the heterotrophic bacterium pseudoalteromonas haloplanktins tac125 phtac125 and the phototrophic diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum ptri our group has recently assembled and experimentally validated a genome scale metabolic reconstruction for the heterotrophic antarctic bacterium p haloplanktins tac125 fondi et al 2015 this microorganism is considered the model of cold adapted bacteria and a growing body of literature has illustrated its main physiological features wilmes et al 2010 sannino et al 2017 similarly p tricornutum is considered one of the model diatom representatives and many experiments have contributed to the deep characterization of its physiology available nowadays genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been performed for this diatom most recently in early 2017 levering et al 2017 importantly representatives of these taxa have been shown to co occur in oceanic samples moejes et al 2017 here we show that this combined metabolic reconstruction is able to represent the main known features of this simple microbial community including competition and commensalism and to predict the behaviour of this biological system dynamically being based on genome scale reconstructions our approach allows exploring and interrogating the model at the single metabolic reaction metabolite level further using the fixed points predicted by constraint based metabolic modelling cbmm a simpler odes model was implemented and used to model the dynamics of the phtac125 ptri co culture and to perform stochastic modelling of this synthetic ecosystem we anticipate that the implemented modelling framework will represent a valuable resource for a more focused experimental design to study diatom bacteria interactions 2 methods 2 1 the constraint based model the diatom bacterium synthetic ecosystem was built starting from the single organism models of p tricornutum levering et al 2016 2017 and p haloplanktis tac125 fondi et al 2015 we adopted the following strategy to build a multi compartment metabolic model accounting for the metabolic interactions of these two organisms 1 as the two reconstructions encompassed different naming schemes we mapped the two reconstructions to the same name space using the metanetx server bernard et al 2012 2 to minimize the required interventions on the original reconstructions only the names of the boundary metabolites common to the two reconstructions were changed to the corresponding metanetx code in other words only the set of metabolites that can be exported and imported by the two organisms were named according to the same name space these 14 metabolites supplementary material s1 will represent the pool of nutrients that can be eventually shared among the two organisms by means of different interaction types namely competition and cooperation 3 a multi compartment model was built this included a compartment s in which the two single organism reconstructions are inserted and in which extracellular metabolites can be secreted and or taken up this compartment ideally represents the growth medium exchange reactions regulating the amount of nutrients present in this common compartment were included in the overall model to modulate their availability to the two organisms additional compartments included extracellular and cytoplasmic bacterial compartments z and t respectively extracellular cytoplasmic chloroplastic mitocondrial thylakoid lumen and peroxisomic diatom compartments e c h m u x respectively a schematic representation of the multi compartment model is reported in fig 1 concerning community biomass we defined a community level objective function by linearly merging the species biomass equations into the following biomass generating reaction b c b d b b where b c b d and b b represent community diatom and bacterial biomasses respectively in our integrated reconstruction dom is secreted by the diatom and represents the only carbon source for the bacterium more in detail we introduced a dom release reaction in the combined model accounting for the exudation of a fraction 10 of the biomass produced by the diatom through auxotrophic growth following experimental evidences the composition of the secreted dom included carbohydrates glucose mannose arabinose xylose fucose galactose and glucuronate fatty acids myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid palmitoleic acid alpha linoleic acid eicosapentanoic acid and all the 20 amino acids the kind and the relative amount of each single compound released in the external medium by the diatom was derived from the biomass composition equation of the original diatom metabolic reconstruction and or from specific literature levering et al 2017 benavides et al 2013 see supplementary material s1 for the specific model reactions accounting for dom release concerning phtac125 carbon uptake it is well established that when grown in a complex medium i the metabolism of this bacterium is geared towards the consumption of amino acids medigue et al 2005 fondi et al 2016 sannino et al 2017 wilmes et al 2010 and ii the bacterium thrives on a very narrow spectrum of carbohydrates fondi et al 2015 we then assumed that the bacterium would preferentially feed on a reduced set of dom derived compounds rather than on the entire set of single dom constituents listed above in particular when facing a complex mixture of amino acids phtac125 selectively starts feeding on glutamate serine threonine asparagine and aspartate the remaining amino acids are consumed only after the exhaustion of this set wilmes et al 2010 we then assumed that out of all the compounds released by the diatom the bacterium would only feed on these amino acids dom derived amino acids hereinafter dom aa lower bounds of amino acids uptake reactions of phtac125 were initially set to 1 mmol g h 1 a value representative for this bacterium when it is grown in a medium rich in amino acids fondi et al 2015 the other boundaries of the integrated model were set as described in supplementary material s1 the integrated phtac125 ptri metabolic reconstruction was next converted into a dynamic constraint based model of this co culture using the approach implemented in dfbalab gomez et al 2014 as described in detail in supplementary material s1 mirroring the previously described constraint based static model ptri thrives only on photons and co 2 and releases dom in the culture dom aa in turn represents the only carbon source for phtac125 further the growth of both organisms is dependent on phosphate and accordingly they compete for it all the other micro nutrients were considered to be present in non limiting concentrations i e the lower bounds of the corresponding reactions were set to 1000 a negligible initial amount 1x10 5 mmol l of the other nutrients whose concentrations were allowed to change in time e g dom components was assumed to ensure their accumulation during the dynamic simulation non zero derivatives a set of differential equations was then used to model the dynamic co growth of phtac125 and ptri and the consumption of the nutrients in the medium see supplementary material s1 2 2 the stochastic model of the synthetic ecosystem the dynamic description of the phtac125 ptri co culture was also formulated as an ensemble of stochastic rules using a set of chemical equations to this end we lumped all the species of the constraint based model and denote by d b c and p one individual of diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate respectively in this system mimicking the previous set up the diatom relies on phosphate and light to produce biomass and dissolved carbon that in turn represents the only carbon source for the bacterium as we decided not to include the constant inflow of photons in this odes dynamic system of equations the equation describing the growth of diatoms in the system can be written as 1 d p α 2 d h c where α represents the overall rate of the reaction while h is the number of produced molecules of carbon bacteria in the system rely on dissolved carbon produced exclusively by the diatom and phosphate to duplicate and eventually increase their biomass we describe this relationship using the following equation 2 b p c γ 2 b where γ represents the overall rate of the reaction similar to bratbak and thingstad 1985 the growth rate of the diatom is a function of p and d whereas bacterial growth depends on p and c availability additionally phosphate and carbon are injected into the system at a constant rate 3 ε p 4 η c it is to be noted that in our synthetic ecosystem c can only be produced by the activity of the diatom and no influx of external c was allowed for this reason the parameter regulating the inflow of c η was set to 0 during the dynamic simulations eventually all the species undergo degradation according to 5 d ξ d δ 6 b ξ b δ 7 c ξ c δ 8 p ξ p δ where δ is the degradation rate and ξ i with i d b c p are dilution rate constants at each time t the system is fully described by n n d n b n c n p a vector whose components n i for i d b c p are discrete quantities that identify the total number of elements of species i to proceed in the analysis it is necessary to introduce the transition rates t n n from the state n to the new state n these transitions originate from eq 1 8 and their explicit forms can be found in in section 1 4 of supplementary information s1 in this way the dynamics of the system is governed by a master equation whose generic form reads 9 d dt p n t n n t n n p n t t n n p n t where p n t labels the probability for the system to be in state n at time t even though in most situations this equation does not allow a closed form solution it represents a powerful tool that enables one to get insight into the traditional continuous and deterministic rate equations as well as fluctuations stemming from the discreteness of the system let us first focus on the deterministic case following the detailed analytic derivation described in section 1 4 of supplementary information s1 it can be proved that in the limit where the volume of the system goes to infinity van kampen et al 2014 the stochastic model described by eq 1 8 can be mapped into the following set of ordinary differential equations 10 ϕ d α ϕ d ϕ p ξ d δ ϕ d ϕ b γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ b δ ϕ b ϕ c η h α ϕ d ϕ p γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ c δ ϕ c ϕ p ε α ϕ d ϕ p γ ϕ b ϕ p ϕ c ξ p δ ϕ p where ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c and ϕ p stand for the continuous concentrations associated to diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate respectively setting equal to zero the temporal derivatives appearing on the left hand side of eq 10 the solution of the corresponding nonlinear system gives the equilibrium point that we here label ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c ϕ p its components are 11 ϕ d ε η δ ξ d h 1 α γ h 1 ξ c ξ b ξ d 2 δ ξ p α h 1 ϕ b ε h η δ ξ b h 1 α γ h 1 ξ c ξ d h h 1 δ α ξ p ξ d ξ b ϕ c α γ ξ b ξ d ϕ p δ α ξ d since the odes model mimics the mechanism underling our dfba implementation we expect the stationary concentrations resulting from the two different approaches to be the same for this reason denoting by fba d fba b fba c and fba p the stationary concentrations of respectively diatom bacterium carbon and phosphate resulting from the dfba simulation our idea is to set them equal to ϕ d ϕ b ϕ c ϕ p this procedure yields a nonlinear system that can be analytically solved to find an estimation of the parameters provided ε η ξ d ξ b ξ c and ξ p are known in formulae 12 δ ε ξ d fba d ξ b fba b ξ p fba p α ε ξ d fba p ξ d fba d ξ b fba b ξ p fba

cobra toolbox v 2 0 6 in matlab 2015b with gurobi v 6 5 0 as the linear programming solver dynamic fba was performed using an ad hoc modified version of dfbalab gomez et al 2014 stochastic simulations were performed using the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 essentially based on a dynamic monte carlo method all the codes used in this work are available at https synml sourceforge io 3 results 3 1 the integrated reconstruction represents phototroph heterotroph metabolic cross talk in this work we have combined two existing metabolic reconstructions namely ilpb1025 and imf721 in a single integrated model to simulate a synthetic ecosystem characterized by the metabolic interactions existing between a phototroph the model diatom p tricornutum and a heterotrophic bacterium p haloplanktis tac125 the integrated metabolic model consists of 1746 genes 3588 reactions and 2861 metabolites this synthetic ecosystem encompasses 9 compartments including 1 external shared compartment where cellular products are secreted imported by the two organisms 6 and 2 cellular compartments belonging to the diatom and the bacterium reconstructions respectively in an initial phase reaction boundaries were defined as reported in methods a community biomass objective function was defined as the linear combination of ptri and phtac125 biomasses as described in methods an fba simulation was performed assuming such conditions allowing a preliminary outlook on the metabolic phenotype of the diatom bacterium community this analysis revealed that the model correctly predicts the main known features for such a biological system in that the diatom is predicted to take up co 2 from the environment and to use nh 4 as n source consistently o 2 is released in the environment as a product of the diatom metabolism the simulated conditions support the growth and o 2 consumption of the heterotrophic bacterium phtac125 whose predicted growth rate is 0 02 h 1 no ammonia uptake is predicted for the bacterium consistent with the fact that amino acids part of the dom fraction can be used as a source for both c and n by phtac125 as experimentally shown in mocali et al 2017 we then checked the metabolic interdependencies existing between the two models in the ecosystem to this aim we computed the pareto front between diatom and bacterium grow rates fig 2 a in its simplest formulation the pareto front represents the trade off between the two organisms maximal growth rates accordingly the surface delimited by the pareto optimality frontier identifies the set of optimal solution of our double optimization diatom and bacterium growth such solutions i e a couple of growth rate values are said to be pareto optimal as there are no other solutions that can better satisfy all of the objectives simultaneously in particular fig 2a revealed three main features i a situation in which both the diatom and the bacterium grow at their corresponding highest achievable growth rate is not included in the plane of feasible solutions ii diatom growth is predicted even in the absence of bacterial growth but conversely iii bacterial growth in the absence of diatom growth is not a feasible solution overall this analysis confirmed that the two models embedded in the integrated reconstruction are dependent of each other and that both competition simultaneous bacterial and diatom maximal growth is not a feasible solution and commensalism no bacterial growth in the absence of diatom growth can be described by our system the latter feature emerges because diatom derived dom aa is the only carbon source available to the bacterium indeed decreasing the amount of light available to the diatom resulted in a decrease of the overall community growth rate fig 2b no clues concerning which substrate s is responsible for the competition between the two organisms can be derived simply by inspecting the pareto frontier to identify those shared metabolites whose availability limited the growth of both organisms we performed a robustness analysis i e we evaluated the effect on phtac125 and ptri growth rates of perturbing the exchange rate of each of the 14 compounds that can be taken up by each organism in the reconstruction we identified two macronutrients whose uptake is essential for sustaining the growth of both organisms namely phosphate and sulphate as shown in fig 2c and d perturbing the exchange rates of such compounds strongly influences the growth rate of ptri and phtac125 and no growth is predicted when their exchange rate is set to 0 as outlined below metabolic competition over these inorganic ions among diatoms and bacteria is well characterized egge 1998 bratbak and thingstad 1985 3 2 a dynamic fba model for the phototroph heterotroph metabolic cross talk to understand the dynamics of the metabolic interactions between ph tac125 and ptri we implemented a dynamic constraint based model of their growth in a well stirred reactor as described in gomez et al 2014 mirroring the simulation previously described ptri thrives only on photons and co 2 and releases dom aa that constitutes the only carbon source for phtac125 the amount of matter released by diatom in the form of dom is highly variable and seems to be dependent on the species and the environment considered see below in this initial simulation we assumed that 10 of the fixed carbon was released in the culture and could be metabolised by the bacterium we started the dynamic simulation from a 1 1 ratio in phtac125 and ptri cell concentrations in this synthetic community 0 01 gcdw l we then set an initial non limiting phosphate and carbon concentration of 5 mmol l and 10 mmol l respectively additionally the concentration of the inlet flow of phosphate δ was set to 0 0016 mmol l mimicking the observed concentration of phosphate in natural conditions zimmer and cutter 2012 michaelis menten expressions were implemented to set the proper phosphate exchange rate for both the organisms as described in supplementary material s1 as phtac125 metabolism is known to be geared towards the consumption of amino acids medigue et al 2005 fondi et al 2016 sannino et al 2017 wilmes et al 2010 we monitored the concentration of the exchanged amino acids glutamate serine threonine asparagine and aspartate across the entire simulation as shown in fig 3 b and c both organisms start growing thanks to the irradiance the diatom and to the initial amount of carbon present in the system the bacterium fig 3c and d the initial growth of both organisms however is interrupted by the exhaustion of the phosphate excess in the medium fig 3b and c the diatom starts a second growth phase growing earlier than the bacterium compatible with the fact that the latter has no carbon source available until ptri has reached a certain cell density and has released a sufficient amount of dom aa in the medium after the diatom production of dom aa is sufficiently high fig 3d the bacterium starts another growth phase fig 3c which is further interrupted by phosphate decrease afterwards as phosphate is added to the co culture in a limiting amount an oscillatory pattern is observed reflecting the competition for phosphate on one side and the fact the phtac125 thrives only on released dom aa on the other indeed as dom aa get more abundant phtac125 increases its phosphate requirement to sustain growth and consequently reduces the amount of available phosphate for ptri this in turn slows down the diatom growth rate and the amount of available carbon to the bacterium such an oscillatory pattern is clearly reflected when computing the ratio between bacterium and diatom biomass throughout the simulation fig 3a the simulated culture conditions will then lead to a steady state in which the concentrations of the different species both organisms and dissolved nutrients will not change over time in our simulation the equilibrium is reached with a ptri concentration that is 100 fold higher than that of phtac125 additionally the final diatom cellular concentration and the average predicted growth rate predicted by our simulation throughout the simulation were 0 038 gdw l and 0 0128 h 1 for ptri and 0 0025 gdw l and 0 0164 h 1 for phtac125 increasing the concentration of phosphate available to the two organisms resulted in a longer and larger oscillatory pattern before the final steady state is reached fig 3a apparently an increased phosphate concentration leads to a positive feedback according to which bacterial growth rate increases dom aa and nutrients are consumed more rapidly and a stronger bacterium diatom competition for phosphate is established this trend is further amplified if the dilution rate of phosphate is set to zero allowing both organisms to consume all the phosphate that is introduced into the system in this case the species display sustained oscillations see supplementary information s1 clearly the amount of dom released by the diatom and used by the bacterium as carbon and energy sources is crucial for maintaining the equilibrium between phtac125 and ptri biomass concentration in this closed system we monitored the effect of varying the amount of dom released by the diatom on the stability of the co culture system thus we performed distinct dynamic simulations varying for each of them the ratio between biomass accumulation and released dom our analysis shows that as might expected the ptri phtac125 ratio in this synthetic ecosystem increases with decreasing dom release fig 4 this reflects both that the diatom redirects a greater fraction of cellular intermediates to the synthesis of biomass rather than to the secretion of c compounds and that consequently there is less dom available for the bacterium finally we have considered the recent finding according to which bacteria are able to degrade monomethylamine which is a ubiquitous organic nitrogen compound in marine environments providing ammonium to diatoms and sustain their growth in the absence of external ammonia suleiman et al 2016 we have accounted for this scenario by modifying of two organism model and making the bacterium secreted ammonium essential for the diatom growth results of this analysis are reported in supplementary material s1 3 3 ode based modelling of idbe as shown the dfba model represents the behaviour of a phtac125 ptri co culture nevertheless this dynamic modelling framework is purely deterministic and as such it cannot deal with possible noise and fluctuations of the surrounding environment indeed it is widely accepted that the marine environment is subjected to recurrent fluctuations in nutrient levels through the movement of tides and currents cruz de carvalho et al 2016 especially at the micro scale level cordero and datta 2016 enke et al 2018 for this reason the next step was to use the results of this dynamic simulation to set up a simpler and more controllable dynamic model based on odes see methods using the fixed point values obtained for each parameter we performed a dynamic simulation of the diatom bacterium co culture using eq 10 to check whether despite being computationally simpler the implemented odes model could qualitatively reproduce the behaviour of the dynamic constraint based modelling as shown in the insets of fig 3a e the odes based model correctly predicts an initial increase of bacterial diatom and carbon species also in agreement with the previous simulation phosphate is predicted to decrease from its initial concentration determining the stop of the growth of the aforementioned species similarly the biomass ratio of diatom and bacterial cells predicted by the odes based model qualitatively resembles that resulting from the constraint based model displaying an initial predominance of bacterial cells followed by a rapid and persistent shift towards a diatom dominated culture as expected the odes based model then approaches the same steady point predicted by the dfba model although displaying a reduced oscillatory trend this is likely due to the difference in the basic formulation of the two models the dfba model embeds more variables and parameters and is therefore capable of accounting for more complex behaviours of this specific co culture after checking that the simpler dynamic system displayed the same overall trend of the dfba model we wanted to address the possible effects of fluctuations on the simulated metabolic cross talk between ptri and phtac125 the mathematical models described previously have approached the problem via deterministic paradigms overlooking the possible role played by the noise this aspect becomes particularly important when as in this case accounting for the presence of diverse chemical species in a spatially diffusive environment for example the two organisms may compete for nutrients e g phosphate at the microscopic scale they might be hindering each other with regard to the binding of the nutrient molecule under specific conditions i e nutrients paucity and or unbalanced biomass ration in the culture such competition sustained by the stochastic component of the dynamics might result in different and alternative steady states in order to perform stochastic simulations we initially adjusted some of the parameters of the model in order to get 1 a balanced ratio between diatom and bacterial cells at the fixed point and 2 concentration values for all the species embedded in the system sufficiently high to avoid their eventual extinction from the system after a few iterations this involved reducing the dilution rate of phtac125 and ptri and doubling the fraction of produced biomass leaving the diatom cell as dom from 10 to 20 table 1 leaving the diatom cell that represents the only carbon source for the bacteria as already stated the master equation 9 cannot be solved analytically analytical progress is possible only by making use of expansion techniques which require specific assumptions one available tool to overcome this limitation is to solve the stochastic model through dedicated numerical schemes such as the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 each trajectory corresponding to an exact single gillespie simulation belongs to the probability distribution solution of the master equation assuming the initial conditions listed in table 1 our analysis showed a little effect of noise on the stability of the synthetic ecosystem with the two species displaying the same overall dynamics as the deterministic model fig 5 we also performed the same stochastic simulation for different values of the inlet phosphate concentrations ϵ revealing no major influence of this parameter on the overall stability of the system supplementary file s1 the other parameter that might influence the dynamics of the synthetic ecosystem is the dilution rate of the diatom ξ d and the bacterium ξ b in the simulated bioreactor as it ultimately regulates the number of cells populating the co culture thus we tested the robustness of the system in respect to stochastic fluctuations for a different range of fba d fba b cell concentration ratios we performed a new series of stochastic simulations setting the dilution rates the rate at which microorganisms are removed from the system to 10 20 40 60 and 80 for both the diatom and the bacterium and tested all the possible combinations thereof when dilution rates for both organisms are above 50 and the ratio between diatom and bacteria dilution rates is high i e the diatom cell concentration does not sensibly exceed the bacterial one the system displays a rather robust trend with respect to noise see colored lines of fig 6 a indeed no major discrepancies compared to the deterministic simulation are observed black line of fig 6a at higher values of bacterial dilution rates i e with lower bacterial cells in the co culture the equilibrium becomes rather unstable when the ratio between diatom and bacteria dilution rates approaches 0 3 i e bacteria die roughly three times faster than diatoms some stochastic simulations deviate from the fixed point and more specifically the culture becomes diatom dominated fig 6b a further increase in bacterial dilution rate leads to a clear prevalence of diatom dominated co cultures among the whole set of stochastic simulations fig 6c as virtually all the simulations lead to the maximum biomass concentration achievable by the diatom as expected we observed no bacterial dominated co cultures among all the stochastic simulations performed as the diatom produced dom aa is essential for phtac125 survival 4 discussion in this work we have used two established genome scale metabolic reconstructions to build a synthetic ecosystem accounting for part of the metabolic interdependencies between diatoms and bacteria applying cbmm namely fba revealed that our model is able to capture the basic metabolic relationships as competition and commensalism which are commonly observed in diatom heterotroph associations amin et al 2012 in our synthetic ecosystem the growth of the bacterium depends on the release of dom aa by the diatom but the growth of the bacterium reduces the availability of inorganic ions phosphate and sulfate to the diatom on the other hand the growth of the bacterium reduces the availability of inorganic ions phosphate and sulfate to the diatom thus negatively affecting its growth the integrated reconstruction was then analysed by means of a dynamic framework that is dfba this allowed the simulation of a co culture system stirred reactor and to evaluate the effect of specific parameters e g phosphate inflow concentration on the dynamics of this biological system in agreement with previous results from experimental diatom bacteria co cultures and mathematical models l et al 2017 bratbak and thingstad 1985 our simulations reached an equilibrium with the diatoms and the bacteria co existing by adjusting the different parameters encompassed by our model we showed that this equilibrium can be shifted towards bacterial or algal dominance and or leading to interesting collective phenotypes e g sustained oscillations the final cellular concentration of the two organisms together fell in the range of measured values for ptri alone indeed a mono culture of ptri on a f 2 medium reached a final cell concentration between 150 and 200 mg and a μ of 0 025 h 1 an average μ of 0 0128 h 1 was predicted by our simulation throughout the simulation yodsuwan et al 2017 this relationship between phtac125 and ptri biomass concentration resembles the one observed when growing other representatives of these two groups of organisms in a laboratory setting diner et al 2016 varying the concentration of the phosphate inflow fig 3 had an effect on the intermediate stage of growth with smaller but longer oscillations observed when the phosphate concentration was increased such collective oscillations are typically observed in the presence of metabolic co dependencies liu et al 2015 we then tested the effect of varying the proportion of fixed carbon that is redirected by the diatom towards dom secretion rather than biomass assembly on the overall balance of the entire system phytoplankton exudation and or cell lysis represents a primary resource for bacterial metabolism baines and pace 1991 the quantification of dissolved organic substances released by phytoplankton has long been the subject of research and debate a few works based on extensive data re analysis identified an approximative average range of 10 to 20 released dom over a diatom total primary production with values up to 50 and as low as 4 thornton 2014 perry 1976 our model predicts a shift towards a diatom dominated culture as the fraction of carbon secreted in the medium rather than redirected towards diatom biomass assembly is decreased fig 4 however the two species coexist across all the dom release rates tested finally using the fixed points predicted by the dfba simulation we implemented a stochastic dynamic model of the same phtac125 ptri co culture this system is composed of 4 ordinary differential equations eq 10 accounting for the change in time of the concentration of ptri and phtac125 cells dom aa and phosphate after successfully checking that the dynamic model resembled the trends observed during dfba simulations we tested the effect of noise on the equilibrium between the two microorganisms we found the synthetic ecosystem to be quite robust at similar diatom bacterial cell concentrations and for different phosphate inflows in this case every stochastic simulation resembled the trend obtained with the deterministic model however decreasing the ratio of diatom bacterial cell concentration down to 0 3 by regulating their corresponding dilution rates resulted in a bistable ecosystem phenotype with a few stochastic simulations leading to an entirely diatom dominated co culture interestingly bacteria have been shown to play a role in the explosion of algal population bloom in mesocosm experiments e g by inhibiting diatom aggregation and prolonging the bloom smith et al 1995 riemann et al 2000 on the basis of the results of our model we hypothesize that the bacterial cell concentration and its effect on the metabolic interactions with the diatom may also have a role in determining the shift towards a diatom dominated culture below a certain threshold stochastic noise may induce the extinction of bacteria from the co culture and as a consequence reduce the overall competition with diatoms for essential nutrients e g phosphate this in turn may lead to the explosion of the diatom population this is in agreement with previous observations on the abrupt decrease of bacterial abundance concomitantly with algal blooms riemann et al 2000 although this is still a debated point see zhou et al 2018 and smith et al 1995 and with the bistable behaviour of modelled planktonic systems edwards 2001 generally speaking here we have introduced a system that includes both competition for the same resource phosphate and commensalism similar systems have been recently described and modelled revealing their capability to display oscillatory patterns fowler 2014 fowler et al 2014 mcguinness et al 2014 moyles and fowler 2018 in particular the interaction of populations displaying a degree of competition can promote self sustained oscillations these oscillations can exhibit extraordinarily low values of the populations implying the effective extinction of the populations again these outcomes match those predicted by our two organism model system despite differences in the mathematical formulation of the problem and in the microbial species included 5 conclusions here we have presented a synthetic bacterial diatom ecosystem the model was specifically designed for describing possible metabolic interactions occurring between an heterotrophic bacterium p haloplanktis and a diatom p tricornutum such interactions were studied at different levels using different modelling techniques ranging from static constraint based to dynamic stochastic modelling a number of community level constraint based models have been developed in recent years chan et al 2017 zomorrodi and segre 2016 machado et al 2018 the model presented here provides a first attempt to formalize the possible metabolic cross talk occurring in a part of the microbial loop in building up our model we relied on several approximations first grazers e g metazoans capable of feeding on microalgae and thus possibly contributing to their extinction from the synthetic ecosystem were not explicitly accounted for by our metabolic reconstruction tuning the diatom dilution rates in the odes based model could account for variations in grazer activity for a more process based representation of the impact of grazers a genome scale metabolic reconstruction of these organisms would be needed unfortunately such reconstructions do not exist furthermore in our proof of concept reconstruction we have identified possible metabolic interactions only on the basis of the genome sequence of the two microbial representatives it is entirely possible that other metabolic cross talks between these organisms exist and that the network of shared metabolites is more complex than the one hypothesized in this work metabolomic experiments conducted over co cultures of phtac125 and ptri and their corresponding single cultures will clarify this point and highlight untapped metabolites exchange between these two organisms finally at present there is no direct evidence of ptri and phtac125 co occurring in the natural environment despite pseudoalteromonadaceae representatives having been shown to be the prevalent microbial family throughout most of the growth phases of the diatom moejes et al 2017 the framework presented is currently driving the implementation of an experimental diatom bacterium co culture that in turn will be used to train our model and adjust all the parameters that are currently unknown once properly trained it will be possible to use our synthetic ecosystem to predict interspecies dynamics reliably under numerous conditions this might include for example the study of the effect of environmental perturbations on the overall system e g climate change related perturbations or the possible exploitation of this ecosystem for biotechnological purposes acknowledgements this work was

25088,integrating population ecology and aeroecology is important for understanding dispersal dynamics of pest insects that depend on aerial habitats sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is an economic pest of sorghum in asia africa australia and south america and recently invaded north america affecting over 90 of the continent s sorghum production long distance wind aided dispersal together with the ability to overwinter in the southernmost sorghum producing areas appear responsible for their geographic spread in north america we developed a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of sugarcane aphids to forecast regional infestations of sorghum fields we parameterized and calibrated the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenologies of the southern to central great plains of the usa where sorghum is cultivated we validated the model by comparing simulated spatial temporal patterns of aphid infestations to georeferenced field data on infestations collected as part of an extensive field project we assessed potential usefulness of the model by analysing regional patterns of aphid infestations on sorghum simulated under climatic conditions recorded in the southern to central great plains in 2017 on a regional scale the simulated northward advance of aphid infestations generally followed the seasonal development of sorghum with the main invasion front moving northward from southern to central texas then northwest towards the panhandles of texas and oklahoma northernmost and westernmost regions respectively of these states and then northward again into central and western kansas within this general regional trend the stochastic nature of simulated infestations resulted in wide variation within each region with regard to time lags between the appearance of sorghum and initial infestation which led to wide variation in infestation levels the geographical distribution of simulated aphid infestation probabilities approximately mirrored the proportion of land cover in sorghum production with a prominent infestation hot spot covering west central kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma models capable of simulating both local population dynamics as well as long range multi generational dispersal of wind borne pests show promise as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs keywords aerobiology aphid biometeorology dispersal flight invasion 1 introduction assessing population response to management is the key to predicting spatial distributions and dynamics at stages ranging from extinction to expansion however this can be particularly challenging for species that depend on the aerosphere the relatively thin substratum of the troposphere closest to earth s surface that acts as a fluid medium for movement as well as a source of nutrients and variable environmental conditions frick et al 2017 kunz et al 2008 aeroecology is an emerging scientific discipline that seeks to broaden understanding about the ecological function and biological importance of the aerosphere frick et al 2013 recently more and more ecologists have worked more or less independently of atmospheric scientists to study airborne organisms kunz et al 2008 wind aided insect dispersal has been investigated using a variety of atmospheric simulation models such as generic spatial insect model gensim rochester et al 1996 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit stein et al 2015 and the nuclear accident model name chapman et al 2012 these models have been used to simulate migration flights of a variety of insect species for example hysplit has been used to simulate dispersal of boll weevils anthonomus grandis in texas kim et al 2010 westbrook et al 2011 corn earworms helicoverpa zea in the central usa westbrook 2008 and fall armyworm moths spodoptera frugiperda in the usa and canada westbrook et al 2016 to date models of insect dispersal have focused on acute migration events rather than seasonal multi generational migration with one notable exception westbrook et al 2016 the model of westbrook et al 2016 is unique in that it simulates daily population growth of an insect and its primary host plant as well as migration of the insect population over multiple generations based on daily atmospheric data this approach is particularly important within an areawide pest management context for species that expand their range annually from winter refugia such as the fall armyworm moth and the sugarcane aphid for such species the extent of annual northward range expansion depends not only on current climatic conditions but also on the distribution of remnant populations that have overwintered along with the timing of initial infestations at the southern boundary of the invaded region sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is found worldwide and is an economic pest of sorghum sorghum bicolor in asia africa australia and south america singh et al 2004 the species is a recent invasive pest of sorghum in north america that was first reported at outbreak and highly damaging levels on north american sorghum in 2013 along the coastal areas in texas usa bowling et al 2016 by the end of 2015 sugarcane aphid had expanded to 17 states in the usa and to all sorghum producing regions in mexico affecting over 90 of the sorghum production in north america bowling et al 2016 its invasive nature on north american sorghum was substantiated by its rapid spread and outbreak potential brewer et al 2019 and the presence of a predominant genotype not previously observed on sorghum harris shultz et al 2017 sugarcane aphids reproduce asexually adults give birth to live nymphs which develop through four non winged nymphal stages development from birth to adult is affected by environmental temperatures and takes 4 to 12 days meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 adults may be apterous non winged or alate winged and live for 10 to 37 days meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 their lifetime reproductive potential ranges from 34 to 96 nymphs meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 van rensburg 1973 sugarcane aphid population growth can occur rapidly in warm climatic conditions singh et al 2004 such as in much of the sorghum producing regions of north america during sorghum growing season bowling et al 2016 singh et al 2004 following colonization populations can grow exponentially with densities up to 28 000 aphids per plant van rensburg 1973 in southern texas population densities exceeding 10 000 aphids per plant have been observed in sorghum producing fields bowling et al 2016 aphid species have the ability of long distance wind aided dispersal irwin and thresh 1988 which is particularly relevant in case of sugarcane aphid in much of the southcentral to central great plains where sorghum is not viable for aphid colonization during winter and must be recolonized by insects that are incapable of overwintering locally bowling et al 2016 the importance of long distance wind aided dispersal of sugarcane aphids in north america has been inferred by field observations of large concentrated areas of alates where colonies were not previously observed bowling et al 2016 the wind aided dispersal of alates together with the capability to overwinter on living annual and perennial hosts in the southernmost sorghum producing areas have been suggested as the main factors responsible for the geographic spread of sugarcane aphids in north america bowling et al 2016 in this paper we describe an individual based model grimm et al 2006 2010 that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of wind borne insects to forecast regional patterns of infestations of field crops our primary objective is to assess the potential usefulness of a model that dynamically integrates local pest population dynamics with long range multi generational dispersal within an areawide pest management framework as a proof of concept we focus on forecasting infestations of sorghum fields in the great plains of the usa by sugarcane aphids in the section of methods that follow we first provide an overview of the model section 2 1 followed by a detailed description of model structure and function section 2 2 we then describe model parameterization verification and calibration section 2 3 and model validation section 2 4 2 methods 2 1 model overview the model is a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of sugarcane aphids to forecast regional multi generational infestations of sorghum fields derived from migrating and reproducing aphids fig 1 the model represents an area of 1 750 000 km2 divided into landscape cells measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 simulations are run for 1 year using a daily time step attributes of landscape cells include the proportion of the cell containing sorghum fields air temperature developmental stage of sorghum leaf area per sorghum plant and aphid density per sorghum leaf within landscape cells sorghum planting dates and sorghum development class short or long duration development are latitude dependent and sorghum development through phenological stages and growth increase of leaf area are temperature dependent attributes of aphids include life cycle stage pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive and migratory status migrant capable winged aphids or non migrant un winged aphids aphid reproduction development and mortality are temperature dependent with mortality also influenced by aphid density on sorghum leaves aphid wing formation and thereby emigration potential from landscape cells depends on plant phenology dixon 1988 with probability of emigration increasing markedly during the last sorghum developmental stage as the plant s nutritive value to the aphid declines sharply emigrating aphids are dispersed by prevailing winds potentially being displaced up to hundreds of kilometres in a day aphid immigration and colonization of landscape cells depends on dispersal trajectories of migrants and the proportion of the potentially colonized cell the cell receiving migrants containing growing sorghum we parameterized the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenology representative of the southern to central great plains and calibrated the model to generate the general spatial temporal pattern of aphid infestations that could be inferred from reports by sorghum producers we validated the model by comparing simulated patterns of aphid infestations with those documented by data collected as part of an extensive field project elliott et al 2017 we assessed the potential usefulness of the model by simulating regional infestation patterns under several hypothetical scenarios 2 2 model structure and function 2 2 1 integrating life cycle and aeroecology portions of model the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle as well as the phenological development of sorghum is programmed and executed in netlogo http ccl northwestern edu netlogo wilensky 1999 and the aeroecological portion of the life cycle is executed in hysplit 4 9 https ready arl noaa gov hysplit traj php stein et al 2015 the two portions of the model are coupled via program link koralewski et al 2019 that facilitates an ongoing dialogue between hysplit and netlogo the information exchange is initiated as soon as netlogo calculates aphid emigration see section 2 2 8 8 aphids emigrating from each netlogo landscape cell are passed as inert particles to the control and emitimes files of hysplit the program link then runs the hysplit program hycs std exe concentration model to simulate aphid dispersal the resulting binary concentration file cdump is converted to ascii format by the hysplit program con2asc exe which also is run by link the process is completed when netlogo reads the hysplit output with geo referenced particle concentration data representing potential aphid colonists landing in each netlogo cell see section 2 2 8 3 from the ascii converted cdump file below sections 2 2 2 2 2 8 we provide a detailed model description of the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for describing individual based models in ecology grimm et al 2006 2010 in appendix we provide a summary of model input data parameter values and the associated information sources table a1 as well as descriptions and units of measure of state variables and global variables table a2 2 2 2 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate regional patterns of infestations of sorghum fields by sugarcane aphids in response to seasonally varying meteorological and landscape conditions the spatial and temporal patterns of initial infestations are of particular interest 2 2 3 entities state variables and scales entities include 1 700 landscape cells each measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 2 a variable number of super aphids super individuals scheffer et al 1995 each representing a cohort of aphids state variables or attributes of landscape cells include location latitude and longitude of their centre point habitat type sorghum field or non sorghum field air temperature daily maximum minimum mean c and number of degree days accumulated to date c both at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface current leaf area of sorghum cm2 current number of super aphids number of cohorts of aphids in the cell current total number of aphids per sorghum leaf within the cell and day of year of first aphid infestation attributes of super aphids include habitat type of current location current life cycle stage of cohort members pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive status migrant or not yet migrated and number of adjusted degree days adjusted for the temperature dependent contribution of a degree day toward life stage development see section 2 2 8 5 accumulated since the beginning of the current life stage the determination of temporal and spatial scales is based on the purpose of the model the ecology of the organisms involved the level of detail contained in available information and computational considerations the purpose of the model requires a temporal extent that encompasses the growing season of sorghum in the southern to central great plains and a spatial extent that encompasses the main sorghum growing areas within this region a temporal extent of 1 year is sufficient to encompass the sorghum growing season from planting in the south to harvest in the north and thus also encompasses the temporal extent of potential aphid infestations a daily time step allows adequate representation of the effects of seasonally varying air temperatures on the phenological development of sorghum roozeboom and prasad 2016 and on the life cycle development of aphids mccornack et al 2004 a spatial extent of 1 750 000 km2 is sufficient to encompass the main sorghum growing areas of the southern to central great plains a spatial resolution of 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 is appropriate for representing the meso to macro scale aeroecological dynamics of insects westbrook and eyster 2017 and also provides a synoptic regional representation of aphid infestation dynamics which facilitates the interpretation of results within an area wide pest management framework westbrook et al 2016 the daily processes involved in the phenological development of sorghum and the life cycle development of aphids within each landscape cell are represented in terms of aphid population dynamics on a single sorghum plant that is the terrestrial portion of the model simulates specific local conditions which are assumed to be typical of those occurring within the landscape cell the representation of this level of physiological ecological detail is supported by information available in the literature on sorghum and aphids explicit representation of fine scale spatial heterogeneity of local conditions within landscape cells is not supported by available field data and also is limited by computational considerations 2 2 4 process overview and scheduling during each simulation the netlogo program initializes the system by inputting a georeferenced map of the study area and assigning attributes to the landscape cells fig 2 netlogo then reads input data in the form of time series of values representing the environmental conditions under which the simulation will be run next netlogo iteratively executes the ten submodels described below at the beginning of each simulated day netlogo 1 updates the date and air temperature at ground level and at 2 m above ground level input data section 2 2 8 1 2 calculates development and maturity of sorghum section 2 2 8 2 3 calculates aphid immigration and colonization section 2 2 8 3 and 4 establishes infestations of aphids arriving from outside the study area these include the initial infestation of aphids during all simulations and may or may not include subsequent infestations depending on the scenario being simulated section 2 2 8 4 next netlogo calculates aphid 5 life stage development section 2 2 8 5 6 mortality section 2 2 8 6 7 reproduction section 2 2 8 7 and 7 emigration section 2 2 8 8 netlogo calculates if necessary a density dependent reduction of aphid densities in landscape cells section 2 2 8 9 finally netlogo updates all global variables and writes output to text files which includes current values of the attributes of landscape cells aphid individuals and global variables section 2 2 8 10 2 2 5 design concepts 2 2 5 1 basic principles the two basic concepts underlying the model design are 1 the aphid life cycle and population growth are influenced primarily by weather and host plant composition across the landscape brewer et al 2019 and 2 aphids are dispersed by wind currents as small particles incapable of controlling their own horizontal flight displacements irwin and thresh 1988 survival development and reproduction depend primarily on air temperature migratory displacements depend on the vertical profile of prevailing wind velocity with the goal of providing a useful tool for area wide pest management the model has been designed to represent explicitly the effects of seasonally variable weather conditions landscape heterogeneity and the uncertain influence of regional wind currents on aphid population dynamics and migration variable weather conditions are represented in the form of time series of daily air temperature values under which the simulation will be run landscape heterogeneity is represented in the form of a georeferenced map of the study area indicating the proportions of landscape cells that are in sorghum production regional wind currents are represented in the form of time series of georeferenced vertical profiles of wind velocity 2 2 5 2 emergence spatial and temporal patterns of aphid abundance are summarized as emerge as in the odd terminology system level properties as the result of equations in the life cycle portion of the model describing daily development rates see section 2 2 8 5 daily probabilities of mortality see section 2 2 8 6 reproduction see section 2 2 8 7 and emigration see section 2 2 8 8 as well as daily rates of immigration see section 2 2 8 3 from the aeroecological portion of the model rates of super aphid development and probabilities of mortality reproduction and emigration depend on the temporally variable air temperature patterns see section 2 2 8 1 rates of immigration depend on the geographic distribution of emigrants relative to the temporally variable vertical profiles of wind velocity and the availability of a host plant see section 2 2 8 2 2 2 5 3 sensing landscape cells sense are aware of their current air temperature c at ground level and at 2 m above ground level the number of degree days accumulated to date c see section 2 2 8 2 their current leaf area of sorghum see section 2 2 8 2 as well as the current total number of aphids within the cell super aphids sense the habitat type of their current location the current life cycle stage of the aphid cohort they represent and number of adjusted degree days accumulated since the beginning of their current life stage see section 2 2 8 5 for both landscape cells and super aphids the mechanism by which this sensing occurs is implicit that is there are no explicit rules governing the acquisition of this information 2 2 5 4 interaction the rate of development of super aphids through their various life stages see section 2 2 8 5 depends on air temperatures at ground level within the landscape cell in which they are located the probability of super aphids emigrating from a landscape cell see section 2 2 8 8 depends on the density of aphids and the developmental stage of sorghum within the cell see section 2 2 8 2 the successful colonization of a landscape cell by immigrating super aphids see section 2 2 8 3 depends on the habitat type of the invaded cell i e if sorghum is available for aphid colonization 2 2 5 5 stochasticity daily mortality reproduction emigration and immigration of super aphids are determined probabilistically see sections 2 2 8 6 2 2 8 7 2 2 8 8 and 2 2 8 3 respectively 2 2 5 6 observation the model records daily values for all attributes of landscape cells and aphid super individuals as well as for all global variables the majority of these data are used for verifying that the model code is functioning appropriately output data recorded to address model objectives include the spatial and temporal distributions of aphid infestations of sorghum fields summary output data collected from the model include the number of landscape cells containing sorghum infested with aphids and the days of first infestations of landscape cells 2 2 6 initialization netlogo first inputs a georeferenced map of the study area which encompasses the principal sorghum growing areas in the u s great plains netlogo then assigns initial values to each state variable or attribute of the landscape cells see section 2 2 3 other than latitude and longitude of their center point initial values of cell attributes depend on the starting date of the simulation and the scenario being simulated 2 2 7 input data netlogo reads input data in the form of time series of values representing minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface in each landscape cell as well as the planting dates and locations for sorghum length of the time series and inputted air temperature values depend on the scenario being simulated as do the planting dates and locations for sorghum 2 2 8 submodels executing daily events and processes 2 2 8 1 update calendar date and air temperatures at the beginning of each day the program updates the simulation date and the minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface in each landscape cell 2 2 8 2 calculate sorghum development daily development of sorghum through three growth stages is based on the post emergence accumulation of growing degree units gdu which are calculated as gdu daily maximum air temperature 2 m above the soil surface c daily minimum air temperature 2 m above the soil surface c 2 base temperature c where the base temperature for sorghum is 10 c gerik et al 2003 mean temperatures 10 c are entered as 10 c and mean temperatures 38 c are entered as 38 c the three sorghum growth stages vegetative gs 1 reproductive gs 2 and grain fill gs 3 are defined for both short season sorghum sorghum hybrids with relatively fast maturation and long season sorghum hybrids with relatively long maturation following gerik et al 2003 for short season hybrids 1 gs 1 if gdu 530 2 gs 2 if 530 gdu 970 3 gs 3 if 970 gdu 1420 and harvest occurs when gdu 1420 for long season hybrids 4 gs 1 if gdu 780 5 gs 2 if 780 gdu 1220 6 gs 3 if 1220 gdu 1670 and harvest occurs when gdu 1670 leaf area la in cm2 per plant for short season hybrids is calculated for gs 1 as 7 l a g s 1 25 8 e x p 0 0097 g d u and for gs 2 and gs 3 as 8 l a g s 2 3 2000 1 e x p 0 01 g d u 975 2400 based on information in roozeboom and prasad 2016 leaf area la in cm2 per plant for long season hybrids is calculated for gs 1 as 9 l a g s 1 11 553 e x p 0 0077 g d u and for gs 2 and gs 3 as 10 l a g s 2 3 2000 1 e x p 0 0095 g d u 1150 3000 also based on information in roozeboom and prasad 2016 for both sorghum maturity classes total leaf area cannot exceed 5000 cm2 short season hybrids are primarily planted in landscape cells located at 32 n latitude and long season hybrids are primarily planted in landscape cells located at 32 n latitude michael brewer pers obs selected landscape cells with growing sorghum also may be designated as having remnant sorghum during the non growing season depending on the scenario being simulated this affects aphid infestations in these cells when the next sorghum growing season begins see section 2 2 8 4 2 2 8 3 calculate aphid immigration and colonization super aphids emigrating from landscape cells within the study area see section 2 2 8 8 are distributed as immigrants to other landscape cells within the study area each day by hysplit via link see section 2 2 1 colonization of sorghum fields by immigrants occurs probabilistically with the daily colonization probability equal to the proportion of the landscape cell occupied by growing sorghum if colonization is successful one new super aphid is created the super aphid is assigned an age of 8 days the life stage reproductive and the status migrant which allows colonizing individuals to reproduce but prevents their further migration the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids i e it is a super individual scheffer et al 1995 in this case of size 1 at the time when the super aphid is created the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in that landscape cell which is a patch attribute is increased by 1 potential immigrants landing in a landscape cell with an unsuitable habitat type without growing sorghum do not survive new colonization does not occur in remnant sorghum 2 2 8 4 establish infestations of aphids arriving from outside study area and from remnant sorghum at selected times during a simulation selected landscape cells may receive dispersing aphids arriving from outside the area depending on the scenario being simulated that is these immigrants do not emigrate from cells within the study area and are not received as input from hysplit this usually represents initial infestations resulting from aphids arriving during the spring from south of the study area mexico also during spring coincident with the appearance of growing sorghum landscape cells with remnant sorghum see section 2 2 8 2 may become infested with aphids which implicitly have survived the non growing season these infestations are initiated by creating one new super aphid the super aphid is assigned an age of 8 days the life stage reproductive and the status non migrant which allows these super aphids to reproduce and to migrate as described in section 3 8 3 the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids of size 1 and the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in that landscape cell is increased by 1 2 2 8 5 calculate aphid life stage development super aphids develop through pre reproductive reproductive and post reproductive life stages as functions of mean daily air temperatures at the soil surface daily maximum air temperature at the soil surface c daily minimum air temperature at the soil surface c 2 we estimated temperature dependent development under variable temperature regimes using the general equation developed by davidson 1944 100 n l k 1 e x p a b x as described by poché et al 2016 this is a bisymmetrical sigmoid curve with the distance between the lower and upper developmental temperature thresholds k estimated as 11 k 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 2 2 c 1 c 3 c 1 c 3 c 2 2 where c1 c2 and c3 are values for 100 n l on the curve at three temperatures on the abscissa we represented the temperature dependent development from pre reproductive to reproductive to post reproductive to death due to old age based on information in hinson 2017 as 12 c i p r e r e p 112 6761 1 e x p 2 8574 t i o 8 3255 13 c i r e

on day i to the development toward the next life stage and ti o represents mean daily air temperature at the soil surface c on day i the model accumulates ci over time separately for each super aphid and when i c i 1 0 for a given super aphid that super aphid and all the aphids represented by the cohort size of that super aphid advance to the next developmental stage the base mean air temperature at the soil surface for development is 10 c based on information in hinson 2017 2 2 8 6 calculate aphid mortality super aphids die 1 when mean daily air temperature at the soil surface 40 c which is the upper lethal temperature hinson 2017 2 when they exceed 50 days of age which we assume is their non temperature imposed physiological longevity hinson 2017 3 when they exceed their environmental temperature imposed developmental longevity see section 2 2 8 5 and 4 when there is no sorghum either growing or remnant in their landscape cell if mortality is due to temperature or no sorghum all of the aphids in the corresponding landscape cell a patch attribute die that is that patch attribute is set to zero mortality of aphids in a landscape patch also occurs implicitly via the density dependent reduction of new born aphids see section 2 2 8 9 2 2 8 7 calculate aphid reproduction super aphids in the reproductive stage produce one new super aphid each day the super aphid is assigned an age of 0 days the life stage pre reproductive and the status non migrant which allows these super aphids to reproduce and to migrate as described in section 2 2 8 3 the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids and the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in the landscape cell is increased by the size of the new cohort represented by the super aphid the size of the new cohort csi is calculated initially based on laboratory experiments conducted by hinson 2017 as a function of mean daily air temperature at the soil surface t i o 15 c s i 0 0250 t i o 2 0 8560 t i o 0 2687 cohort size then is reduced by one half to account for non temperature dependent differences between laboratory and field conditions brewer et al 2017 2 2 8 8 calculate aphid emigration super aphids emigrating from each landscape cell each day are sent to hysplit via link see section 2 2 1 migration flights are 12 h in duration beginning 0900 central daylight time based on reported aerial captures of aphids glick 1939 super aphids can emigrate only during their first two days in the reproductive stage parry 2013 super aphids emigrate probabilistically depending on the developmental stage of the sorghum plant they are on daily emigration probabilities are 10 for super aphids on gsi and gsii sorghum and 50 for super aphids on gsiii sorghum emigration probabilities increase markedly during the last sorghum developmental stage because the nutritive value of the plant for aphids declines sharply dixon 1988 2 2 8 9 density dependent reduction of aphid population size for those landscape cells in which the post emigration number of aphids per sorghum leaf exceeds an arbitrary upper limit nmax the number of aphids per sorghum leaf is reduced to nmax we inferred the value of nmax to be equal to 1000 based on data from field experiments conducted by brewer et al 2017 this density dependent reduction of aphid numbers per leaf implicitly represents daily losses due to predators and other potential sources of natural mortality not included explicitly in the model 2 2 8 10 update all global variables and write output to text files at the end of each day netlogo updates the values of all state and global variables and writes them to text files selected portions of this output can be suppressed to reduce the time required to execute a simulation 2 3 model parameterization verification and calibration 2 3 1 parameterization of environmental and landscape characteristics we parameterized the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenology representative of the southern to central great plains of the usa during the year 2017 this area extends from 25 to 41 north latitude and encompasses the principal sorghum growing areas in the usa including the states of texas oklahoma and kansas fig 3 usda nass 2018 we obtained georeferenced minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and in the air at 2 m above the soil surface from the usdc noaa air resources laboratory archived eta data assimilation system edas http www ready noaa gov archives php we obtained the planting dates harvest dates and locations of sorghum from the national agricultural statistics service usda usda nass 2010 2 3 2 verification of aphid life stage development we verified that simulated lengths of pre reproductive reproductive and post reproductive aphid life stages were similar to those expected based on the laboratory studies of hinson 2017 which were used to parameterize aphid life stage development see section 2 2 8 5 laboratory studies were conducted under diurnally fluctuating temperatures representing cool 11 to 24 c moderate 16 to 29 c warm 21 to 34 c and hot 26 to 39 c regimes the range of spatially and temporally varying temperatures to which aphids were exposed during simulation were generally encompassed by these laboratory temperature regimes greater than 99 of simulated aphids spent 1 day in pre reproductive stage and 86 spent 14 days in reproductive stage simulated lengths of reproductive stages ranged from 14 to 21 days simulated lengths of post reproductive stages ranged from 1 to 35 days these simulated lengths of life stages corresponded well with those observed in the laboratory table 1 2 3 3 calibration of sorghum development we calibrated sorghum development in each of five latitudinally defined regions represented in the model such that simulated times from planting to harvest approximated those reported by the usda we accomplished this by multiplying the growing degree units gdu see section 2 2 8 2 accumulated each day by a region specific calibration factor given the inputted planting dates the un calibrated model predicted harvest dates earlier than those reported as the most active harvest dates usda nass 2010 in four of the five regions after calibration the ranges of simulated harvest dates and days to harvest encompassed the ranges reported as the most active harvest dates and the associated ranges of days to harvest usda nass 2010 table 2 2 3 4 calibration of aphid regional migration we calibrated aphid regional migration such that the model generated the general spatial temporal pattern of aphid infestations that could be inferred from reports by sorghum producers in texas in 2017 our calibration procedure followed the general scheme outlined by janssen and heuberger 1995 we accomplished this by multiplying the colonization probability of each landscape cell see section 2 2 8 3 by the same calibration factor we extracted sorghum producer reports of infestation from eddmaps https www eddmaps org eddmaps 2018 we initialized calibration simulations with infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 which was the midpoint of the dates of first infestations reported by sorghum producers in this region in 2017 given these initial infestations the un calibrated model predicted average dates of first infestations later than those reported by texas sorghum producers to calibrate aphid regional migration rates we adjusted the daily colonization probabilities of landscape cells see section 2 2 8 3 we did this by introducing a single new constant into the model which is multiplied times the daily colonization probability of each landscape cell we then sequentially increased the value of the new constant from 1 0 in increments of 0 1 until the average simulated dates of first infestation of landscape cells fell within the ranges of the dates reported by sorghum producers in the corresponding geographical areas of texas fig 4 the ranges of dates of simulated first infestations were broader than the ranges of reported dates which was an expected consequence of the ubiquitous nature of the simulated sampling scheme that is whereas all simulated infestations were detected and reported detection and reporting of infestations by sorghum producers undoubtedly was limited by the practical constraints imposed on field sampling efforts 2 4 model validation we validated the model by comparing simulated versus observed spatial temporal patterns of aphid infestations simulated patterns were based on 10 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations observed patterns were based on an independent set of georeferenced field data on first detections of infestations collected in texas oklahoma and kansas during 2017 as part of an extensive usda field project elliott et al 2017 these data were not used during model development a total of 132 sorghum fields were monitored by counting winged and wingless sugarcane aphids on two leaves from each of 54 sorghum plants located within a roughly 100 100 m portion of each field monitoring was done weekly during the sorghum growing seasons in texas oklahoma and kansas field locations were chosen to achieve broad geographic coverage of sorghum growing areas in each of the three states each field was sampled from one to more than a dozen times with the number of samplings dependent on factors such as insecticide application and plant senescence which would render a field of limited value for further aphid sampling we again initialized simulated infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 we compared simulated dates of first infestations of aphids in landscape cells within each of the five latitudinally defined regions represented in the model see table 2 for the latitudes dividing regions to the 2017 field data collected within the corresponding regions the average dates of simulated first infestations fell within the range of reported first infestation dates in all but one northern texas of the regions fig 5 again not surprisingly the ranges of dates of simulated first infestations were broader than the ranges of reported dates the usda field samples although collected more methodically necessarily were even more restricted both spatially and temporally than were the field observations of sorghum producers in northern texas the range of reported first infestation dates was smaller than that reported in the other sampling areas although these data may reflect accurately the 2017 infestation chronology in this area it seems more likely that they reflect the temporal and especially spatial constraints imposed on the sampling effort 3 results we assessed potential usefulness of the model by analysing regional patterns of aphid infestations on sorghum simulated under climatic conditions recorded in the southern to central great plains in the year 2017 as before initialized simulated infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 and ran 10 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations we analysed simulation results in terms of seasonal patterns of aphid infestations related to sorghum development we also identified infestation hot spots and cold spots that is groups of spatially clustered landscape cells with infestation probabilities higher and lower respectively than those of surrounding landscape cells getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 on a regional scale the simulated northward advance of aphid infestations generally followed the seasonal development of sorghum along a latitudinal gradient fig 6 the main invasion front moved northward from southern to central texas then northwest towards the panhandles of texas and oklahoma northernmost and westernmost regions respectively of these states and then northward again into central and western kansas within this general regional trend however simulated local patterns of aphid population growth on sorghum were quite variable fig 7 the stochastic nature of simulated infestations resulted in wide variation among landscape cells within each region with regard to time lags between the appearance of sorghum and initial infestation which led to wide variation in infestation levels time lags between sorghum appearance and infestation varied from 8 to 144 days thus encompassing the entire sorghum growing season table 2 with no apparent latitudinal trend the geographical distribution of simulated aphid infestation probabilities fig 8 a approximately mirrored the proportion of land cover in sorghum production fig 3 a prominent infestation hot spot covered west central kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma fig 8b the cold spots in western texas and in the eastern portions of texas oklahoma and kansas in effect bounded the primary aphid migration corridor 4 discussion the primary objective of the present work was to assess the potential usefulness of a model that integrates local pest population dynamics with long range multi generational dispersal viewed within an areawide pest management framework perhaps the most salient feature of our simulation results is that they provide regional infestation forecasts like weather forecasts they provide probabilistic estimates that change in time and space the simulation results depicted in fig 6 provide forecasts of the regional advance of an aphid infestation front which in general follows the northward advance of sorghum maturation behind the regional front more localized infestation forecasts are inherently uncertain thus it should not be surprising if neighbouring sorghum fields experienced markedly different timing and intensity of infestations for example the graphs of aphid densities embedded in fig 7 represent one realization of many possible futures in which neighbouring patches 128 and 156 experienced markedly different infestations by chance the initial infestation of patch 156 occurred relatively close to sorghum harvest precluding the build up of dense aphid populations however the initial infestation of patch 128 occurred earlier in the growing season and could have contributed to dense aphid populations another salient feature of our simulation results is that they permit identification of geographical patterns of infestation hot spots these are areas within which infestation probabilities are notably higher than in surrounding areas understandably these areas are correlated with the distribution and abundance of sorghum fields but they also reflect the effect of prevailing winds for example there are areas in south central and north western kansas with 5 percent of the land surface in sorghum production fig 3 which are included in the hot spot that blankets those regions of the state fig 8 from an areawide pest management perspective such model results are useful for assessing the regional distribution of infestation risks and conveying this information to producers ideally an areawide pest management approach for cereal aphids of the great plains would be supported by a regional pest risk information system anchored by predictive modelling which is interactive with local aphid monitoring activities and an archived knowledge base to inform management decisions brewer et al 2019 because of their capacity for long distance migration and high reproduction singh et al 2004 areawide management is appropriate for outbreak prone cereal aphid species to reduce the scale and severity of outbreaks and the associated economic impacts elliott et al 2008 the predictive model anchoring the areawide pest management system may initially guide regional aphid monitoring with traditional aphid scouting or advanced remote sensing brewer et al 2019 stanton et al 2017 in the southern to central great plains where infestations are most likely derived from aphid migrants the model would also be informed by continuing aphid monitoring in the southern reaches of great plains i e the rio grande valley where aphids survive the winter on sorghum hosts other model usage and expansion of modelling conditions includes assessment of the aphid impact on changing abiotic and biotic conditions such as planting partially aphid resistant sorghum and populations of resident natural enemies of sugarcane aphid brewer et al 2017 the primary economic area of interest for sugarcane aphid is the southern to central great plains inclusive of the states of texas oklahoma and kansas where 75 percent of us sorghum production occurs usda nass 2018 future deployment in an agricultural context of the predictive synoptic model may take the form of a component of a web based data management and delivery system the model would receive aphid field data via web based computational linkages and return simulated data projected infestation chronologies via an analogous set of linkages new field data received via the web would be used iteratively to re initialize and also to re validate the model simulated data sent to the web would be used to create time series of near real time maps of potential future aphid infestations which could be shared with appropriate user groups for educational purposes and management use as defined by the user the current paper summarizes the first steps in developing evaluating and applying a predictive synoptic model to forecast sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum in the great plains of the usa our initial efforts have provided insight into what we might reasonably expect from these types of models currently and in the near future in this regard we would offer the following comments on two aspects of technological feasibility and also on the need to embrace the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations regarding technological feasibility two aspects remain challenging although recent progress is encouraging the first is the challenge of coupling sophisticated models of general physical environmental processes with custom built ecological simulation models whereas there are widely accepted and readily available atmospheric models e g hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit stein et al 2015 that provide sophisticated representations of general physical environmental processes most ecological simulation models are developed de novo to address specific questions wang et al 2017 although conceptually straightforward establishing computational linkages that permit an ongoing dialogue during the course of a simulation between such georeferenced physical environmental models and spatially explicit ecological models can be problematic laniak et al 2013 in the present work development of the computational link integrating the life cycle and aeroecology portions of our model koralewski et al 2019 was facilitated by the fact that we needed to pass only one variable between models the linkage was facilitated further because aphids are such weak flyers that they could be treated simply as inert particles by the atmospheric dispersion model hysplit the second technological challenge is to develop computational links between a predictive simulation model and other components of an areawide pest management framework which would allow for systematic field data input into the model and would facilitate accessibility to model forecasts for the present work we currently are exploring the feasibility and efficiency of computational linkages between our simulation model and established websites that receive and share reports of local aphid detections from and with sorghum producers and pest management practitioners throughout the region and provide summaries of field data and maps of recently infested areas eddmaps 2018 regarding the need to embrace the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations we would suggest that the expectation of forecasting models should not be to make precise predictions of occurrences of infestations but rather to provide an investigative tool to aid in the effective preparedness for possible prevention of and integrated management response to infestations in this respect we agree with walters 1986 that the real value of models of complex natural systems is to provide clear caricatures of nature against which to test and expand experience uncertainty regarding model predictions will persist due to the inability to collect field data at temporal and spatial scales appropriate for rigorous evaluation of model predictions within the context of an areawide pest management program for cereal aphids of the great plains such investigative use might take the form for example of spatially simulating across a large region such as the great plains the potential effects of the deployment of aphid resistant cultivars the fostering of populations of natural enemies of aphids brewer et al 2017 or the selective use of insecticides triggered by economic thresholds elliott et al 2008 in any case it is important to appreciate and communicate clearly the uncertainty or probabilistic nature that necessarily is associated with model predictions of how complex agro ecological systems might respond to changing environmental conditions and management actions cartwright et al 2016 we expect an appreciation and acceptance of the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations will remain challenging in the foreseeable future as we strive to integrate spatially explicit simulation model forecasts with reporting maps of local aphid monitoring deleon et al 2017 nonetheless models that integrate the life cycle and aeroecology of wind borne pests to simulate both local pest population dynamics as well as long range multi generational dispersal have great promise as becoming integral parts of adaptive areawide pest management programs such models can incorporate directly processes ranging from global climatic change to regional changes in land use and land ownership to local changes in habitat characteristics to explore their probable effects on local pest population dynamics and subsequently regional invasion velocity such models can offer pest management practitioners the ability to project time series of probable seasonal range expansions thus providing potential invasion chronologies upon which to base proactive management plans of particular importance simulations can depict the time lags between initial invasion and subsequent dispersal from a given locality the challenge for areawide pest management programs is to view modelling as an ongoing scientific and participatory process that serves adaptive management in this regard the first aim of modelling should be to identify new knowledge and data needs that will lead to further understanding of the potential impacts of alternative management scenarios another aim should be to assist in obtaining consensus on or defensibility of more near term and appropriate scales regional management decisions such aims demand transparency in modelling practice especially in the selection of a model type and approach that recognizes the context in which the model will be used such aims also call for the use of participatory processes and analytic tools that help identify the types of data knowledge and associated experiments that facilitate integration of the modelling process within the particular pest management context acknowledgements this research was supported by usda ars agreement no 58 3091 6 035 with

25088,integrating population ecology and aeroecology is important for understanding dispersal dynamics of pest insects that depend on aerial habitats sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is an economic pest of sorghum in asia africa australia and south america and recently invaded north america affecting over 90 of the continent s sorghum production long distance wind aided dispersal together with the ability to overwinter in the southernmost sorghum producing areas appear responsible for their geographic spread in north america we developed a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of sugarcane aphids to forecast regional infestations of sorghum fields we parameterized and calibrated the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenologies of the southern to central great plains of the usa where sorghum is cultivated we validated the model by comparing simulated spatial temporal patterns of aphid infestations to georeferenced field data on infestations collected as part of an extensive field project we assessed potential usefulness of the model by analysing regional patterns of aphid infestations on sorghum simulated under climatic conditions recorded in the southern to central great plains in 2017 on a regional scale the simulated northward advance of aphid infestations generally followed the seasonal development of sorghum with the main invasion front moving northward from southern to central texas then northwest towards the panhandles of texas and oklahoma northernmost and westernmost regions respectively of these states and then northward again into central and western kansas within this general regional trend the stochastic nature of simulated infestations resulted in wide variation within each region with regard to time lags between the appearance of sorghum and initial infestation which led to wide variation in infestation levels the geographical distribution of simulated aphid infestation probabilities approximately mirrored the proportion of land cover in sorghum production with a prominent infestation hot spot covering west central kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma models capable of simulating both local population dynamics as well as long range multi generational dispersal of wind borne pests show promise as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs keywords aerobiology aphid biometeorology dispersal flight invasion 1 introduction assessing population response to management is the key to predicting spatial distributions and dynamics at stages ranging from extinction to expansion however this can be particularly challenging for species that depend on the aerosphere the relatively thin substratum of the troposphere closest to earth s surface that acts as a fluid medium for movement as well as a source of nutrients and variable environmental conditions frick et al 2017 kunz et al 2008 aeroecology is an emerging scientific discipline that seeks to broaden understanding about the ecological function and biological importance of the aerosphere frick et al 2013 recently more and more ecologists have worked more or less independently of atmospheric scientists to study airborne organisms kunz et al 2008 wind aided insect dispersal has been investigated using a variety of atmospheric simulation models such as generic spatial insect model gensim rochester et al 1996 the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit stein et al 2015 and the nuclear accident model name chapman et al 2012 these models have been used to simulate migration flights of a variety of insect species for example hysplit has been used to simulate dispersal of boll weevils anthonomus grandis in texas kim et al 2010 westbrook et al 2011 corn earworms helicoverpa zea in the central usa westbrook 2008 and fall armyworm moths spodoptera frugiperda in the usa and canada westbrook et al 2016 to date models of insect dispersal have focused on acute migration events rather than seasonal multi generational migration with one notable exception westbrook et al 2016 the model of westbrook et al 2016 is unique in that it simulates daily population growth of an insect and its primary host plant as well as migration of the insect population over multiple generations based on daily atmospheric data this approach is particularly important within an areawide pest management context for species that expand their range annually from winter refugia such as the fall armyworm moth and the sugarcane aphid for such species the extent of annual northward range expansion depends not only on current climatic conditions but also on the distribution of remnant populations that have overwintered along with the timing of initial infestations at the southern boundary of the invaded region sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is found worldwide and is an economic pest of sorghum sorghum bicolor in asia africa australia and south america singh et al 2004 the species is a recent invasive pest of sorghum in north america that was first reported at outbreak and highly damaging levels on north american sorghum in 2013 along the coastal areas in texas usa bowling et al 2016 by the end of 2015 sugarcane aphid had expanded to 17 states in the usa and to all sorghum producing regions in mexico affecting over 90 of the sorghum production in north america bowling et al 2016 its invasive nature on north american sorghum was substantiated by its rapid spread and outbreak potential brewer et al 2019 and the presence of a predominant genotype not previously observed on sorghum harris shultz et al 2017 sugarcane aphids reproduce asexually adults give birth to live nymphs which develop through four non winged nymphal stages development from birth to adult is affected by environmental temperatures and takes 4 to 12 days meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 adults may be apterous non winged or alate winged and live for 10 to 37 days meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 their lifetime reproductive potential ranges from 34 to 96 nymphs meksongsee and chawanapong 1985 singh et al 2004 van rensburg 1973 sugarcane aphid population growth can occur rapidly in warm climatic conditions singh et al 2004 such as in much of the sorghum producing regions of north america during sorghum growing season bowling et al 2016 singh et al 2004 following colonization populations can grow exponentially with densities up to 28 000 aphids per plant van rensburg 1973 in southern texas population densities exceeding 10 000 aphids per plant have been observed in sorghum producing fields bowling et al 2016 aphid species have the ability of long distance wind aided dispersal irwin and thresh 1988 which is particularly relevant in case of sugarcane aphid in much of the southcentral to central great plains where sorghum is not viable for aphid colonization during winter and must be recolonized by insects that are incapable of overwintering locally bowling et al 2016 the importance of long distance wind aided dispersal of sugarcane aphids in north america has been inferred by field observations of large concentrated areas of alates where colonies were not previously observed bowling et al 2016 the wind aided dispersal of alates together with the capability to overwinter on living annual and perennial hosts in the southernmost sorghum producing areas have been suggested as the main factors responsible for the geographic spread of sugarcane aphids in north america bowling et al 2016 in this paper we describe an individual based model grimm et al 2006 2010 that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of wind borne insects to forecast regional patterns of infestations of field crops our primary objective is to assess the potential usefulness of a model that dynamically integrates local pest population dynamics with long range multi generational dispersal within an areawide pest management framework as a proof of concept we focus on forecasting infestations of sorghum fields in the great plains of the usa by sugarcane aphids in the section of methods that follow we first provide an overview of the model section 2 1 followed by a detailed description of model structure and function section 2 2 we then describe model parameterization verification and calibration section 2 3 and model validation section 2 4 2 methods 2 1 model overview the model is a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of sugarcane aphids to forecast regional multi generational infestations of sorghum fields derived from migrating and reproducing aphids fig 1 the model represents an area of 1 750 000 km2 divided into landscape cells measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 simulations are run for 1 year using a daily time step attributes of landscape cells include the proportion of the cell containing sorghum fields air temperature developmental stage of sorghum leaf area per sorghum plant and aphid density per sorghum leaf within landscape cells sorghum planting dates and sorghum development class short or long duration development are latitude dependent and sorghum development through phenological stages and growth increase of leaf area are temperature dependent attributes of aphids include life cycle stage pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive and migratory status migrant capable winged aphids or non migrant un winged aphids aphid reproduction development and mortality are temperature dependent with mortality also influenced by aphid density on sorghum leaves aphid wing formation and thereby emigration potential from landscape cells depends on plant phenology dixon 1988 with probability of emigration increasing markedly during the last sorghum developmental stage as the plant s nutritive value to the aphid declines sharply emigrating aphids are dispersed by prevailing winds potentially being displaced up to hundreds of kilometres in a day aphid immigration and colonization of landscape cells depends on dispersal trajectories of migrants and the proportion of the potentially colonized cell the cell receiving migrants containing growing sorghum we parameterized the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenology representative of the southern to central great plains and calibrated the model to generate the general spatial temporal pattern of aphid infestations that could be inferred from reports by sorghum producers we validated the model by comparing simulated patterns of aphid infestations with those documented by data collected as part of an extensive field project elliott et al 2017 we assessed the potential usefulness of the model by simulating regional infestation patterns under several hypothetical scenarios 2 2 model structure and function 2 2 1 integrating life cycle and aeroecology portions of model the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle as well as the phenological development of sorghum is programmed and executed in netlogo http ccl northwestern edu netlogo wilensky 1999 and the aeroecological portion of the life cycle is executed in hysplit 4 9 https ready arl noaa gov hysplit traj php stein et al 2015 the two portions of the model are coupled via program link koralewski et al 2019 that facilitates an ongoing dialogue between hysplit and netlogo the information exchange is initiated as soon as netlogo calculates aphid emigration see section 2 2 8 8 aphids emigrating from each netlogo landscape cell are passed as inert particles to the control and emitimes files of hysplit the program link then runs the hysplit program hycs std exe concentration model to simulate aphid dispersal the resulting binary concentration file cdump is converted to ascii format by the hysplit program con2asc exe which also is run by link the process is completed when netlogo reads the hysplit output with geo referenced particle concentration data representing potential aphid colonists landing in each netlogo cell see section 2 2 8 3 from the ascii converted cdump file below sections 2 2 2 2 2 8 we provide a detailed model description of the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle following the odd overview design concepts and details protocol for describing individual based models in ecology grimm et al 2006 2010 in appendix we provide a summary of model input data parameter values and the associated information sources table a1 as well as descriptions and units of measure of state variables and global variables table a2 2 2 2 purpose the purpose of the model is to simulate regional patterns of infestations of sorghum fields by sugarcane aphids in response to seasonally varying meteorological and landscape conditions the spatial and temporal patterns of initial infestations are of particular interest 2 2 3 entities state variables and scales entities include 1 700 landscape cells each measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 2 a variable number of super aphids super individuals scheffer et al 1995 each representing a cohort of aphids state variables or attributes of landscape cells include location latitude and longitude of their centre point habitat type sorghum field or non sorghum field air temperature daily maximum minimum mean c and number of degree days accumulated to date c both at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface current leaf area of sorghum cm2 current number of super aphids number of cohorts of aphids in the cell current total number of aphids per sorghum leaf within the cell and day of year of first aphid infestation attributes of super aphids include habitat type of current location current life cycle stage of cohort members pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive status migrant or not yet migrated and number of adjusted degree days adjusted for the temperature dependent contribution of a degree day toward life stage development see section 2 2 8 5 accumulated since the beginning of the current life stage the determination of temporal and spatial scales is based on the purpose of the model the ecology of the organisms involved the level of detail contained in available information and computational considerations the purpose of the model requires a temporal extent that encompasses the growing season of sorghum in the southern to central great plains and a spatial extent that encompasses the main sorghum growing areas within this region a temporal extent of 1 year is sufficient to encompass the sorghum growing season from planting in the south to harvest in the north and thus also encompasses the temporal extent of potential aphid infestations a daily time step allows adequate representation of the effects of seasonally varying air temperatures on the phenological development of sorghum roozeboom and prasad 2016 and on the life cycle development of aphids mccornack et al 2004 a spatial extent of 1 750 000 km2 is sufficient to encompass the main sorghum growing areas of the southern to central great plains a spatial resolution of 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 is appropriate for representing the meso to macro scale aeroecological dynamics of insects westbrook and eyster 2017 and also provides a synoptic regional representation of aphid infestation dynamics which facilitates the interpretation of results within an area wide pest management framework westbrook et al 2016 the daily processes involved in the phenological development of sorghum and the life cycle development of aphids within each landscape cell are represented in terms of aphid population dynamics on a single sorghum plant that is the terrestrial portion of the model simulates specific local conditions which are assumed to be typical of those occurring within the landscape cell the representation of this level of physiological ecological detail is supported by information available in the literature on sorghum and aphids explicit representation of fine scale spatial heterogeneity of local conditions within landscape cells is not supported by available field data and also is limited by computational considerations 2 2 4 process overview and scheduling during each simulation the netlogo program initializes the system by inputting a georeferenced map of the study area and assigning attributes to the landscape cells fig 2 netlogo then reads input data in the form of time series of values representing the environmental conditions under which the simulation will be run next netlogo iteratively executes the ten submodels described below at the beginning of each simulated day netlogo 1 updates the date and air temperature at ground level and at 2 m above ground level input data section 2 2 8 1 2 calculates development and maturity of sorghum section 2 2 8 2 3 calculates aphid immigration and colonization section 2 2 8 3 and 4 establishes infestations of aphids arriving from outside the study area these include the initial infestation of aphids during all simulations and may or may not include subsequent infestations depending on the scenario being simulated section 2 2 8 4 next netlogo calculates aphid 5 life stage development section 2 2 8 5 6 mortality section 2 2 8 6 7 reproduction section 2 2 8 7 and 7 emigration section 2 2 8 8 netlogo calculates if necessary a density dependent reduction of aphid densities in landscape cells section 2 2 8 9 finally netlogo updates all global variables and writes output to text files which includes current values of the attributes of landscape cells aphid individuals and global variables section 2 2 8 10 2 2 5 design concepts 2 2 5 1 basic principles the two basic concepts underlying the model design are 1 the aphid life cycle and population growth are influenced primarily by weather and host plant composition across the landscape brewer et al 2019 and 2 aphids are dispersed by wind currents as small particles incapable of controlling their own horizontal flight displacements irwin and thresh 1988 survival development and reproduction depend primarily on air temperature migratory displacements depend on the vertical profile of prevailing wind velocity with the goal of providing a useful tool for area wide pest management the model has been designed to represent explicitly the effects of seasonally variable weather conditions landscape heterogeneity and the uncertain influence of regional wind currents on aphid population dynamics and migration variable weather conditions are represented in the form of time series of daily air temperature values under which the simulation will be run landscape heterogeneity is represented in the form of a georeferenced map of the study area indicating the proportions of landscape cells that are in sorghum production regional wind currents are represented in the form of time series of georeferenced vertical profiles of wind velocity 2 2 5 2 emergence spatial and temporal patterns of aphid abundance are summarized as emerge as in the odd terminology system level properties as the result of equations in the life cycle portion of the model describing daily development rates see section 2 2 8 5 daily probabilities of mortality see section 2 2 8 6 reproduction see section 2 2 8 7 and emigration see section 2 2 8 8 as well as daily rates of immigration see section 2 2 8 3 from the aeroecological portion of the model rates of super aphid development and probabilities of mortality reproduction and emigration depend on the temporally variable air temperature patterns see section 2 2 8 1 rates of immigration depend on the geographic distribution of emigrants relative to the temporally variable vertical profiles of wind velocity and the availability of a host plant see section 2 2 8 2 2 2 5 3 sensing landscape cells sense are aware of their current air temperature c at ground level and at 2 m above ground level the number of degree days accumulated to date c see section 2 2 8 2 their current leaf area of sorghum see section 2 2 8 2 as well as the current total number of aphids within the cell super aphids sense the habitat type of their current location the current life cycle stage of the aphid cohort they represent and number of adjusted degree days accumulated since the beginning of their current life stage see section 2 2 8 5 for both landscape cells and super aphids the mechanism by which this sensing occurs is implicit that is there are no explicit rules governing the acquisition of this information 2 2 5 4 interaction the rate of development of super aphids through their various life stages see section 2 2 8 5 depends on air temperatures at ground level within the landscape cell in which they are located the probability of super aphids emigrating from a landscape cell see section 2 2 8 8 depends on the density of aphids and the developmental stage of sorghum within the cell see section 2 2 8 2 the successful colonization of a landscape cell by immigrating super aphids see section 2 2 8 3 depends on the habitat type of the invaded cell i e if sorghum is available for aphid colonization 2 2 5 5 stochasticity daily mortality reproduction emigration and immigration of super aphids are determined probabilistically see sections 2 2 8 6 2 2 8 7 2 2 8 8 and 2 2 8 3 respectively 2 2 5 6 observation the model records daily values for all attributes of landscape cells and aphid super individuals as well as for all global variables the majority of these data are used for verifying that the model code is functioning appropriately output data recorded to address model objectives include the spatial and temporal distributions of aphid infestations of sorghum fields summary output data collected from the model include the number of landscape cells containing sorghum infested with aphids and the days of first infestations of landscape cells 2 2 6 initialization netlogo first inputs a georeferenced map of the study area which encompasses the principal sorghum growing areas in the u s great plains netlogo then assigns initial values to each state variable or attribute of the landscape cells see section 2 2 3 other than latitude and longitude of their center point initial values of cell attributes depend on the starting date of the simulation and the scenario being simulated 2 2 7 input data netlogo reads input data in the form of time series of values representing minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface in each landscape cell as well as the planting dates and locations for sorghum length of the time series and inputted air temperature values depend on the scenario being simulated as do the planting dates and locations for sorghum 2 2 8 submodels executing daily events and processes 2 2 8 1 update calendar date and air temperatures at the beginning of each day the program updates the simulation date and the minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and at 2 m above the soil surface in each landscape cell 2 2 8 2 calculate sorghum development daily development of sorghum through three growth stages is based on the post emergence accumulation of growing degree units gdu which are calculated as gdu daily maximum air temperature 2 m above the soil surface c daily minimum air temperature 2 m above the soil surface c 2 base temperature c where the base temperature for sorghum is 10 c gerik et al 2003 mean temperatures 10 c are entered as 10 c and mean temperatures 38 c are entered as 38 c the three sorghum growth stages vegetative gs 1 reproductive gs 2 and grain fill gs 3 are defined for both short season sorghum sorghum hybrids with relatively fast maturation and long season sorghum hybrids with relatively long maturation following gerik et al 2003 for short season hybrids 1 gs 1 if gdu 530 2 gs 2 if 530 gdu 970 3 gs 3 if 970 gdu 1420 and harvest occurs when gdu 1420 for long season hybrids 4 gs 1 if gdu 780 5 gs 2 if 780 gdu 1220 6 gs 3 if 1220 gdu

short season hybrids are primarily planted in landscape cells located at 32 n latitude and long season hybrids are primarily planted in landscape cells located at 32 n latitude michael brewer pers obs selected landscape cells with growing sorghum also may be designated as having remnant sorghum during the non growing season depending on the scenario being simulated this affects aphid infestations in these cells when the next sorghum growing season begins see section 2 2 8 4 2 2 8 3 calculate aphid immigration and colonization super aphids emigrating from landscape cells within the study area see section 2 2 8 8 are distributed as immigrants to other landscape cells within the study area each day by hysplit via link see section 2 2 1 colonization of sorghum fields by immigrants occurs probabilistically with the daily colonization probability equal to the proportion of the landscape cell occupied by growing sorghum if colonization is successful one new super aphid is created the super aphid is assigned an age of 8 days the life stage reproductive and the status migrant which allows colonizing individuals to reproduce but prevents their further migration the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids i e it is a super individual scheffer et al 1995 in this case of size 1 at the time when the super aphid is created the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in that landscape cell which is a patch attribute is increased by 1 potential immigrants landing in a landscape cell with an unsuitable habitat type without growing sorghum do not survive new colonization does not occur in remnant sorghum 2 2 8 4 establish infestations of aphids arriving from outside study area and from remnant sorghum at selected times during a simulation selected landscape cells may receive dispersing aphids arriving from outside the area depending on the scenario being simulated that is these immigrants do not emigrate from cells within the study area and are not received as input from hysplit this usually represents initial infestations resulting from aphids arriving during the spring from south of the study area mexico also during spring coincident with the appearance of growing sorghum landscape cells with remnant sorghum see section 2 2 8 2 may become infested with aphids which implicitly have survived the non growing season these infestations are initiated by creating one new super aphid the super aphid is assigned an age of 8 days the life stage reproductive and the status non migrant which allows these super aphids to reproduce and to migrate as described in section 3 8 3 the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids of size 1 and the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in that landscape cell is increased by 1 2 2 8 5 calculate aphid life stage development super aphids develop through pre reproductive reproductive and post reproductive life stages as functions of mean daily air temperatures at the soil surface daily maximum air temperature at the soil surface c daily minimum air temperature at the soil surface c 2 we estimated temperature dependent development under variable temperature regimes using the general equation developed by davidson 1944 100 n l k 1 e x p a b x as described by poché et al 2016 this is a bisymmetrical sigmoid curve with the distance between the lower and upper developmental temperature thresholds k estimated as 11 k 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 2 2 c 1 c 3 c 1 c 3 c 2 2 where c1 c2 and c3 are values for 100 n l on the curve at three temperatures on the abscissa we represented the temperature dependent development from pre reproductive to reproductive to post reproductive to death due to old age based on information in hinson 2017 as 12 c i p r e r e p 112 6761 1 e x p 2 8574 t i o 8 3255 13 c i r e

on day i to the development toward the next life stage and ti o represents mean daily air temperature at the soil surface c on day i the model accumulates ci over time separately for each super aphid and when i c i 1 0 for a given super aphid that super aphid and all the aphids represented by the cohort size of that super aphid advance to the next developmental stage the base mean air temperature at the soil surface for development is 10 c based on information in hinson 2017 2 2 8 6 calculate aphid mortality super aphids die 1 when mean daily air temperature at the soil surface 40 c which is the upper lethal temperature hinson 2017 2 when they exceed 50 days of age which we assume is their non temperature imposed physiological longevity hinson 2017 3 when they exceed their environmental temperature imposed developmental longevity see section 2 2 8 5 and 4 when there is no sorghum either growing or remnant in their landscape cell if mortality is due to temperature or no sorghum all of the aphids in the corresponding landscape cell a patch attribute die that is that patch attribute is set to zero mortality of aphids in a landscape patch also occurs implicitly via the density dependent reduction of new born aphids see section 2 2 8 9 2 2 8 7 calculate aphid reproduction super aphids in the reproductive stage produce one new super aphid each day the super aphid is assigned an age of 0 days the life stage pre reproductive and the status non migrant which allows these super aphids to reproduce and to migrate as described in section 2 2 8 3 the super aphid represents a cohort of aphids and the number of aphids per sorghum leaf in the landscape cell is increased by the size of the new cohort represented by the super aphid the size of the new cohort csi is calculated

reduced by one half to account for non temperature dependent differences between laboratory and field conditions brewer et al 2017 2 2 8 8 calculate aphid emigration super aphids emigrating from each landscape cell each day are sent to hysplit via link see section 2 2 1 migration flights are 12 h in duration beginning 0900 central daylight time based on reported aerial captures of aphids glick 1939 super aphids can emigrate only during their first two days in the reproductive stage parry 2013 super aphids emigrate probabilistically depending on the developmental stage of the sorghum plant they are on daily emigration probabilities are 10 for super aphids on gsi and gsii sorghum and 50 for super aphids on gsiii sorghum emigration probabilities increase markedly during the last sorghum developmental stage because the nutritive value of the plant for aphids declines sharply dixon 1988 2 2 8 9 density dependent reduction of aphid population size for those landscape cells in which the post emigration number of aphids per sorghum leaf exceeds an arbitrary upper limit nmax the number of aphids per sorghum leaf is reduced to nmax we inferred the value of nmax to be equal to 1000 based on data from field experiments conducted by brewer et al 2017 this density dependent reduction of aphid numbers per leaf implicitly represents daily losses due to predators and other potential sources of natural mortality not included explicitly in the model 2 2 8 10 update all global variables and write output to text files at the end of each day netlogo updates the values of all state and global variables and writes them to text files selected portions of this output can be suppressed to reduce the time required to execute a simulation 2 3 model parameterization verification and calibration 2 3 1 parameterization of environmental and landscape characteristics we parameterized the model to represent environmental conditions and sorghum phenology representative of the southern to central great plains of the usa during the year 2017 this area extends from 25 to 41 north latitude and encompasses the principal sorghum growing areas in the usa including the states of texas oklahoma and kansas fig 3 usda nass 2018 we obtained georeferenced minimum and maximum daily temperatures at the soil surface and in the air at 2 m above the soil surface from the usdc noaa air resources laboratory archived eta data assimilation system edas http www ready noaa gov archives php we obtained the planting dates harvest dates and locations of sorghum from the national agricultural statistics service usda usda nass 2010 2 3 2 verification of aphid life stage development we verified that simulated lengths of pre reproductive reproductive and post reproductive aphid life stages were similar to those expected based on the laboratory studies of hinson 2017 which were used to parameterize aphid life stage development see section 2 2 8 5 laboratory studies were conducted under diurnally fluctuating temperatures representing cool 11 to 24 c moderate 16 to 29 c warm 21 to 34 c and hot 26 to 39 c regimes the range of spatially and temporally varying temperatures to which aphids were exposed during simulation were generally encompassed by these laboratory temperature regimes greater than 99 of simulated aphids spent 1 day in pre reproductive stage and 86 spent 14 days in reproductive stage simulated lengths of reproductive stages ranged from 14 to 21 days simulated lengths of post reproductive stages ranged from 1 to 35 days these simulated lengths of life stages corresponded well with those observed in the laboratory table 1 2 3 3 calibration of sorghum development we calibrated sorghum development in each of five latitudinally defined regions represented in the model such that simulated times from planting to harvest approximated those reported by the usda we accomplished this by multiplying the growing degree units gdu see section 2 2 8 2 accumulated each day by a region specific calibration factor given the inputted planting dates the un calibrated model predicted harvest dates earlier than those reported as the most active harvest dates usda nass 2010 in four of the five regions after calibration the ranges of simulated harvest dates and days to harvest encompassed the ranges reported as the most active harvest dates and the associated ranges of days to harvest usda nass 2010 table 2 2 3 4 calibration of aphid regional migration we calibrated aphid regional migration such that the model generated the general spatial temporal pattern of aphid infestations that could be inferred from reports by sorghum producers in texas in 2017 our calibration procedure followed the general scheme outlined by janssen and heuberger 1995 we accomplished this by multiplying the colonization probability of each landscape cell see section 2 2 8 3 by the same calibration factor we extracted sorghum producer reports of infestation from eddmaps https www eddmaps org eddmaps 2018 we initialized calibration simulations with infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 which was the midpoint of the dates of first infestations reported by sorghum producers in this region in 2017 given these initial infestations the un calibrated model predicted average dates of first infestations later than those reported by texas sorghum producers to calibrate aphid regional migration rates we adjusted the daily colonization probabilities of landscape cells see section 2 2 8 3 we did this by introducing a single new constant into the model which is multiplied times the daily colonization probability of each landscape cell we then sequentially increased the value of the new constant from 1 0 in increments of 0 1 until the average simulated dates of first infestation of landscape cells fell within the ranges of the dates reported by sorghum producers in the corresponding geographical areas of texas fig 4 the ranges of dates of simulated first infestations were broader than the ranges of reported dates which was an expected consequence of the ubiquitous nature of the simulated sampling scheme that is whereas all simulated infestations were detected and reported detection and reporting of infestations by sorghum producers undoubtedly was limited by the practical constraints imposed on field sampling efforts 2 4 model validation we validated the model by comparing simulated versus observed spatial temporal patterns of aphid infestations simulated patterns were based on 10 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations observed patterns were based on an independent set of georeferenced field data on first detections of infestations collected in texas oklahoma and kansas during 2017 as part of an extensive usda field project elliott et al 2017 these data were not used during model development a total of 132 sorghum fields were monitored by counting winged and wingless sugarcane aphids on two leaves from each of 54 sorghum plants located within a roughly 100 100 m portion of each field monitoring was done weekly during the sorghum growing seasons in texas oklahoma and kansas field locations were chosen to achieve broad geographic coverage of sorghum growing areas in each of the three states each field was sampled from one to more than a dozen times with the number of samplings dependent on factors such as insecticide application and plant senescence which would render a field of limited value for further aphid sampling we again initialized simulated infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 we compared simulated dates of first infestations of aphids in landscape cells within each of the five latitudinally defined regions represented in the model see table 2 for the latitudes dividing regions to the 2017 field data collected within the corresponding regions the average dates of simulated first infestations fell within the range of reported first infestation dates in all but one northern texas of the regions fig 5 again not surprisingly the ranges of dates of simulated first infestations were broader than the ranges of reported dates the usda field samples although collected more methodically necessarily were even more restricted both spatially and temporally than were the field observations of sorghum producers in northern texas the range of reported first infestation dates was smaller than that reported in the other sampling areas although these data may reflect accurately the 2017 infestation chronology in this area it seems more likely that they reflect the temporal and especially spatial constraints imposed on the sampling effort 3 results we assessed potential usefulness of the model by analysing regional patterns of aphid infestations on sorghum simulated under climatic conditions recorded in the southern to central great plains in the year 2017 as before initialized simulated infestations in the rio grande valley of texas on march 28 day of year 87 and ran 10 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations we analysed simulation results in terms of seasonal patterns of aphid infestations related to sorghum development we also identified infestation hot spots and cold spots that is groups of spatially clustered landscape cells with infestation probabilities higher and lower respectively than those of surrounding landscape cells getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 on a regional scale the simulated northward advance of aphid infestations generally followed the seasonal development of sorghum along a latitudinal gradient fig 6 the main invasion front moved northward from southern to central texas then northwest towards the panhandles of texas and oklahoma northernmost and westernmost regions respectively of these states and then northward again into central and western kansas within this general regional trend however simulated local patterns of aphid population growth on sorghum were quite variable fig 7 the stochastic nature of simulated infestations resulted in wide variation among landscape cells within each region with regard to time lags between the appearance of sorghum and initial infestation which led to wide variation in infestation levels time lags between sorghum appearance and infestation varied from 8 to 144 days thus encompassing the entire sorghum growing season table 2 with no apparent latitudinal trend the geographical distribution of simulated aphid infestation probabilities fig 8 a approximately mirrored the proportion of land cover in sorghum production fig 3 a prominent infestation hot spot covered west central kansas and the panhandles of texas and oklahoma fig 8b the cold spots in western texas and in the eastern portions of texas oklahoma and kansas in effect bounded the primary aphid migration corridor 4 discussion the primary objective of the present work was to assess the potential usefulness of a model that integrates local pest population dynamics with long range multi generational dispersal viewed within an areawide pest management framework perhaps the most salient feature of our simulation results is that they provide regional infestation forecasts like weather forecasts they provide probabilistic estimates that change in time and space the simulation results depicted in fig 6 provide forecasts of the regional advance of an aphid infestation front which in general follows the northward advance of sorghum maturation behind the regional front more localized infestation forecasts are inherently uncertain thus it should not be surprising if neighbouring sorghum fields experienced markedly different timing and intensity of infestations for example the graphs of aphid densities embedded in fig 7 represent one realization of many possible futures in which neighbouring patches 128 and 156 experienced markedly different infestations by chance the initial infestation of patch 156 occurred relatively close to sorghum harvest precluding the build up of dense aphid populations however the initial infestation of patch 128 occurred earlier in the growing season and could have contributed to dense aphid populations another salient feature of our simulation results is that they permit identification of geographical patterns of infestation hot spots these are areas within which infestation probabilities are notably higher than in surrounding areas understandably these areas are correlated with the distribution and abundance of sorghum fields but they also reflect the effect of prevailing winds for example there are areas in south central and north western kansas with 5 percent of the land surface in sorghum production fig 3 which are included in the hot spot that blankets those regions of the state fig 8 from an areawide pest management perspective such model results are useful for assessing the regional distribution of infestation risks and conveying this information to producers ideally an areawide pest management approach for cereal aphids of the great plains would be supported by a regional pest risk information system anchored by predictive modelling which is interactive with local aphid monitoring activities and an archived knowledge base to inform management decisions brewer et al 2019 because of their capacity for long distance migration and high reproduction singh et al 2004 areawide management is appropriate for outbreak prone cereal aphid species to reduce the scale and severity of outbreaks and the associated economic impacts elliott et al 2008 the predictive model anchoring the areawide pest management system may initially guide regional aphid monitoring with traditional aphid scouting or advanced remote sensing brewer et al 2019 stanton et al 2017 in the southern to central great plains where infestations are most likely derived from aphid migrants the model would also be informed by continuing aphid monitoring in the southern reaches of great plains i e the rio grande valley where aphids survive the winter on sorghum hosts other model usage and expansion of modelling conditions includes assessment of the aphid impact on changing abiotic and biotic conditions such as planting partially aphid resistant sorghum and populations of resident natural enemies of sugarcane aphid brewer et al 2017 the primary economic area of interest for sugarcane aphid is the southern to central great plains inclusive of the states of texas oklahoma and kansas where 75 percent of us sorghum production occurs usda nass 2018 future deployment in an agricultural context of the predictive synoptic model may take the form of a component of a web based data management and delivery system the model would receive aphid field data via web based computational linkages and return simulated data projected infestation chronologies via an analogous set of linkages new field data received via the web would be used iteratively to re initialize and also to re validate the model simulated data sent to the web would be used to create time series of near real time maps of potential future aphid infestations which could be shared with appropriate user groups for educational purposes and management use as defined by the user the current paper summarizes the first steps in developing evaluating and applying a predictive synoptic model to forecast sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum in the great plains of the usa our initial efforts have provided insight into what we might reasonably expect from these types of models currently and in the near future in this regard we would offer the following comments on two aspects of technological feasibility and also on the need to embrace the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations regarding technological feasibility two aspects remain challenging although recent progress is encouraging the first is the challenge of coupling sophisticated models of general physical environmental processes with custom built ecological simulation models whereas there are widely accepted and readily available atmospheric models e g hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model hysplit stein et al 2015 that provide sophisticated representations of general physical environmental processes most ecological simulation models are developed de novo to address specific questions wang et al 2017 although conceptually straightforward establishing computational linkages that permit an ongoing dialogue during the course of a simulation between such georeferenced physical environmental models and spatially explicit ecological models can be problematic laniak et al 2013 in the present work development of the computational link integrating the life cycle and aeroecology portions of our model koralewski et al 2019 was facilitated by the fact that we needed to pass only one variable between models the linkage was facilitated further because aphids are such weak flyers that they could be treated simply as inert particles by the atmospheric dispersion model hysplit the second technological challenge is to develop computational links between a predictive simulation model and other components of an areawide pest management framework which would allow for systematic field data input into the model and would facilitate accessibility to model forecasts for the present work we currently are exploring the feasibility and efficiency of computational linkages between our simulation model and established websites that receive and share reports of local aphid detections from and with sorghum producers and pest management practitioners throughout the region and provide summaries of field data and maps of recently infested areas eddmaps 2018 regarding the need to embrace the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations we would suggest that the expectation of forecasting models should not be to make precise predictions of occurrences of infestations but rather to provide an investigative tool to aid in the effective preparedness for possible prevention of and integrated management response to infestations in this respect we agree with walters 1986 that the real value of models of complex natural systems is to provide clear caricatures of nature against which to test and expand experience uncertainty regarding model predictions will persist due to the inability to collect field data at temporal and spatial scales appropriate for rigorous evaluation of model predictions within the context of an areawide pest management program for cereal aphids of the great plains such investigative use might take the form for example of spatially simulating across a large region such as the great plains the potential effects of the deployment of aphid resistant cultivars the fostering of populations of natural enemies of aphids brewer et al 2017 or the selective use of insecticides triggered by economic thresholds elliott et al 2008 in any case it is important to appreciate and communicate clearly the uncertainty or probabilistic nature that necessarily is associated with model predictions of how complex agro ecological systems might respond to changing environmental conditions and management actions cartwright et al 2016 we expect an appreciation and acceptance of the uncertainty associated with forecasting pest infestations will remain challenging in the foreseeable future as we strive to integrate spatially explicit simulation model forecasts with reporting maps of local aphid monitoring deleon et al 2017 nonetheless models that integrate the life cycle and aeroecology of wind borne pests to simulate both local pest population dynamics as well as long range multi generational dispersal have great promise as becoming integral parts of adaptive areawide pest management programs such models can incorporate directly processes ranging from global climatic change to regional changes in land use and land ownership to local changes in habitat characteristics to explore their probable effects on local pest population dynamics and subsequently regional invasion velocity such models can offer pest management practitioners the ability to project time series of probable seasonal range expansions thus providing potential invasion chronologies upon which to base proactive management plans of particular importance simulations can depict the time lags between initial invasion and subsequent dispersal from a given locality the challenge for areawide pest management programs is to view modelling as an ongoing scientific and participatory process that serves adaptive management in this regard the first aim of modelling should be to identify new knowledge and data needs that will lead to further understanding of the potential impacts of alternative management scenarios another aim should be to assist in obtaining consensus on or defensibility of more near term and appropriate scales regional management decisions such aims demand transparency in modelling practice especially in the selection of a model type and approach that recognizes the context in which the model will be used such aims also call for the use of participatory processes and analytic tools that help identify the types of data knowledge and associated experiments that facilitate integration of the modelling process within the particular pest management context acknowledgements this research was supported by usda ars agreement no 58 3091 6 035 with

25089,an archipelagic landscape ecological network alen is important for optimizing the bird migration route and providing reference for island biodiversity maintenance the alen with full connectivity at dual spatial scales was established in this study ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen based on the habitat suitability and integrating the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance then the landscape structures of the alen were analyzed and the optimization measures were proposed to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity miaodao archipelago an important and typical archipelago in north china was selected as the study area results indicated that the alen was composed of 32 nodes and 81 routes at archipelago scale and 42 sources and 76 corridors at island scale at archipelago scale the ecological efficiency of the alen was determined by the landscape resistance and position of different islands and the landscape structure optimization should focus on the islands that involved the indispensable routes at island scale the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors contributed the most to the ecological efficiency more ecological sources with uniform distribution should be added and the corridor width of 50 m was practical to implement the alen the alen realized the full connectivity that is the bird species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors across the dual spatial scales and the balance of efficiency and cost was achieved the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances keywords archipelago landscape ecological network full connectivity dual spatial scales euclidean distance least cost distance 1 introduction the island is a distinctive geographical entity with special position limited area and isolated space eldridge et al 2014 chi et al 2015a gil et al 2018 it provides important ecological functions as habitat for rare species and key stopover for bird migration catry et al 2003 weigelt et al 2013 boyer and jetz 2014 chi et al 2017 borges et al 2018 however such unique conditions render the island ecosystem distinctly vulnerable to external natural and anthropogenic disturbances the former denotes to seawater intrusion coastal erosion collapse and landslide storm surge and alien species intrusion reaser et al 2007 china islands compiling committee 2013 gao et al 2014 meyer 2014 the latter mainly refers to various human activities such as urban construction ocean and coastal engineering agricultural activities and tourism agetsuma 2007 moghal and o connell 2018 xie et al 2018 the aforementioned factors greatly threaten the island ecosystems the archipelago is a group of neighboring islands it is the main form of spatial distribution of islands in china and is mostly located in coastal zones chi et al 2017 the coastal zones in china are in the coverage area of the east asia australia bird migration route which is one of the eight largest bird migration routes in the world chi et al 2017 thus the archipelagos serve as important habitat and stopover for rare bird and bird migration respectively liang et al 2007 chi et al 2017 meanwhile the archipelagos especially the inhabited islands in it carry considerable human beings they inhabit and exploit the islands and inevitably generate negative influences on the island natural ecosystems by occupying the habitat splitting the natural landscape changing the biological community and emitting the pollutants lomolino 2000 shealer and alexander 2013 emer et al 2018 gil et al 2018 in certain islands of china human activity has been the main driving factor of the ecosystem changes li et al 2015 chi et al 2017 xie et al 2018 thus the ecological functions of such islands for biodiversity maintenance and bird migration are severely damaged it is an important issue to balance the island exploitation and conservation and to achieve the island sustainable development under the background of increasing human activity landscape ecological network also known as greenway network or green infrastructure is an effective way to enhance the landscape connectivity in areas with intensive human activity it expands the extent of species survival through providing highly connected network for species flow and thus it mitigates the threats from human activity to the biodiversity finn 1995 opdam and wascher 2004 kong et al 2010 fu et al 2012 the theories of island biogeography and metapopulation as well as the landscape ecology and 3s technology provide theoretical and methodological basis for the establishment of landscape ecological network macarchur and wilson 1963 1967 pinto and keitt 2009 kong et al 2010 chi et al 2015b the general process for establishing a landscape ecological network can be summarized as targeted species selection habitat suitability analysis ecological source identification ecological link corridor generation and countermeasure proposal currently the empirical studies on the landscape ecological network have been conducted in different areas with different spatial scales and good results were achieved zhang and wang 2006 jongman et al 2011 yin et al 2011 liu et al 2015 dondina et al 2018 santos et al 2018 for the islands with important ecological functions and distinct ecological vulnerability an effective landscape ecological network is of great significance for maintaining the island biodiversity and improving the ecosystem stability the landscape ecological network on a single island has been established in a previous study chi et al 2015b however clear spatial boundaries limit the extent of the landscape ecological network and thereby the ecological efficiency therefore different single islands should be assembled in an archipelagic view and an archipelagic landscape ecological network alen at dual spatial scales namely archipelago and island scales should be established aiming to realize a full connectivity at archipelago scale the alen indicates the network that connects different islands through bird flight routes at island scale the alen denotes the network that links important habitat areas through ecological corridors within a specific island great differences in island area shape mutual distance terrain conditions land covers and human activities exist among different islands vogiatzakis et al 2008 borges et al 2018 they contribute to the distinct differences of the islands in ecological status and functions in the alen furthermore the natural and anthropogenic factors also exhibit spatial heterogeneities within an island chi et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the establishment of the alen at the dual spatial scales is important for utilizing the ecological functions of different islands and improving landscape ecological integration and connectivity in an archipelago which could optimize the bird migration route in eastern china and provide reference for island biodiversity maintenance although previous studies have provided necessary methods the unique conditions of the island ecosystems which remarkably differ from those in the mainland make it difficult to establish the alen therefore an alen with full connectivity at dual spatial scales was established in this study miaodao archipelago an important and typical archipelago in north china was selected as the study area with data acquired from remote sensing and filed work the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance which are frequently used means were integrated in the alen establishment and the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen then the landscape structures of the alen were analyzed and the optimization measures for the alen were proposed to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity fig 1 we aim to solve the following three questions 1 how the alen at the dual spatial scales was established to achieve the full connectivity 2 how the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified 3 how the optimization measures were proposed to balance the island conservation and exploitation under the background of increasing human activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area miaodao archipelago is in the north of the shandong peninsula and at the juncture of the yellow and bohai seas fig 2 it is the location of changdao county in shandong province of china at 2017 the gross domestic product gdp and the gdp per capita of the whole county were 7 14 billion yuan 1064 5 million dollars and 162 577 yuan 24 238 4 dollars respectively people s government of changdao county 2018 the gdp per capita was in a high level in china at the end of 2017 the total population was 41 714 of which the urban population was 22 440 compared with those in last year the total population decreased whereas the urban population increased people s government of changdao county 2018 the archipelago has a temperate and monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 12 0 c and 537 mm respectively and the temperature and rainfall change greatly at different seasons chi et al 2017 all of the islands in the archipelago are bedrock islands with eroded hills as the main topographic type which results in complex terrain factors poor soil quality and bad habitat condition for native forests chi et al 2016 the archipelago provides an important habitat and stopover for bird species and the number of bird species recorded accounts for 25 of all bird species in china therefore a national nature reserve was established here at 1988 for bird conservation however increasing human activities have made the island ecosystems threatened urban constructions considerably transformed the island geomorphology and landscape pattern and occupied the natural habitat for birds rapid development of tourism resulted in a remarkable increase of annual tourist number from 1 15 million at 2005 to 3 85 million at 2017 people s government of changdao county 2018 which put much pressure on the island ecosystem and greatly promoted the unban construction miaodao archipelago is composed of 10 inhabited islands and numerous uninhabited islands different islands in the archipelago possess distinct spatial heterogeneities in natural conditions and anthropogenic influences the inhabited islands have large areas and carry the majority of the human activities of which nanchangshan island is the demographic economic and cultural center of changdao county the uninhabited islands possess smaller areas and receive much less human exploitations than the inhabited islands furthermore mutual distances terrains soils vegetation and other ecological characteristics substantially vary on different islands and in different positions within an island these unique conditions render the study area a natural laboratory for the alen establishment at dual spatial scales considering the minimum area principle the 10 inhabited islands and 22 uninhabited islands with areas higher than 0 1 hm2 were selected to establish the alen fig 2 table 1 2 2 data sources different types of remote sensing data were collected from satellites of worldview 1 and landsat 8 the worldview 1 data was acquired at 2013 and the landsat 8 data was acquired at different seasons during 2013 2014 the interpretations of island outlines and land covers were conducted through arcgis 10 0 and the landscape types were divided into coniferous forest broad leaf forest grassland farmland bare land traffic land building land and square the top of atmosphere radiance and reflectance of each band in landsat 8 data were calculated using the metadata they were used for the calculations of different kinds of ecological indices the aster gdem v 2 published in 2011 was adopted to generate terrain factors of altitude slope and aspect field work was also conducted and a total of 110 sampling sites were set to investigate the plant data in tree shrub and herb layers which was described in detail in a previous study by the authors chi et al 2017 2 3 establishment and analysis of the alen the alen was established based on the spatial distribution of bird habitat suitability combining the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance and aiming to reveal the full connectivity at archipelago and island scales 2 3 1 habitat suitability and landscape resistance the habitat suitability was evaluated using a model of form structure function disturbance fsfd the form was represented by the island area and position patch density and slope were used as the indices of the structure the function referred to ecosystem productivity and plant diversity and island exploitation disturbance was used to quantify the disturbance the model was realized by using the aforementioned data of island outline land covers ecological indices terrain factors and plant diversity thus the habitat suitability and its spatial distribution were obtained the details were represented in a previous study by the authors chi et al 2017 landscape resistance represents the difficulty for species to survive in or migrate across a specific landscape area dauber et al 2003 kong et al 2010 moraes et al 2018 it is fundamental to the alen and provides basic data for the selection of ecological nodes source the generation of ecological routes corridors and the evaluation of the ecological efficiency in the following steps the landscape resistance was represented using an index namely landscape resistance value lrv which was determined by the results of habitat suitability larue and nielsen 2008 the lrv in our study involved various aspects of factors influencing the bird habitat suitability and was calculated using the following equation 1 lrv 100 hsi where hsi is the habitat suitability index obtained from the previous study at archipelago and island scales and it ranges from 0 to 100 chi et al 2017 thus the lrv also ranges from 0 to 100 the higher the lrv the lower the hsi and the worse for the alen establishment the spatial distributions of lrv at the dual spatial scales are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 establishment of the alen the alen was composed of four types of elements namely the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale the birds have two ways to flow in the alen that is flight and walk wu et al 2016 they could flight across different nodes through the routes at archipelago scale meanwhile they could flight or walk across different sources through the corridors within a specific island at archipelago scale the ecological nodes denote the key points for species migration in the whole archipelago and all of the 32 islands were considered ecological nodes in forms of their barycenters fig 2 table 1 the ecological routes refer to the linear flight routes connecting different islands the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 0 was adopted to generate the potential flight routes connecting each two islands and the potential flights summed to 496 fig 4 at island scale the ecological sources indicate the important habitat areas within a specific island and they possess high ecological functions for species maintenance and dispersal wu et al 2013 the identification of ecological sources is vital for the alen establishment previous methods were always based on the biodiversity richness and ecosystem service importance teng et al 2011 wu et al 2013 hu et al 2018 in our study the ecological sources were identified using the lri and the area of landscape patch and the continuous patches with lri 25 and area 1 hm2 and lri 50 and area 10 hm2 were considered the ecological sources then a total of 47 ecological sources were selected fig 5 table 2 the alen at island scale was conducted within the island and thus the islands with two or more ecological sources were selected to establish the alen that is is 1 is 5 were selected and they possessed 16 11 4 8 and 3 ecological sources respectively thus the 42 ecological sources were adopted to conduct the alen at island scale the method of least cost distance was adopted to simulate the potential ecological corridors through the cost distance tool in arcgis 10 0 and a total of 633 potential ecological corridors connecting each two ecological sources within the same island were generated fig 5 lots of potential routes and corridors at the dual spatial scales were generated however considerable proportions of the potential routes and corridors were relatively ecological inefficient and establishment of the alen including all these routes and corridors was at high cost which was unnecessary therefore an ecological importance value eiv was used to evaluate the ecological efficiency of each route and corridor based on the gravity model kong et al 2010 the equations are as follows 2 e i v a b n a n b d a b 2 3 n i 1 p i ln s i 4 d a b l a b l max where eiva b is the eiv of ra b ca b ra b ca b is the route corridor between islands sources a and b na and nb are weight values of islands sources a and b respectively da b is the standard distance of ra b ca b pi and si are the lrv and area of islands sources i respectively la b is euclidean distance cost distance of ra b ca b and l max is the maximum euclidean distance cost distance of all routes corridors the routes corridors through the same island source with included angles 15 mutual distances 100 m were eliminated to remain the one with the highest eiv then the routes corridors with eiv 1 were considered core routes corridors and the other routes corridors with eiv 0 1 were considered ordinary routes corridors aiming to the full connectivity it should be ensured that all islands sources were connected with each other through the routes corridors therefore some routes corridors with eiv 0 1 may also be selected to fill the connectivity gap when necessary and they were considered ordinary routes corridors the sum of eiv of all routes corridors through a specific island source was considered the eiv of the island source and the islands sources were classified into different levels using the standards in table 3 2 3 3 structure analysis of the alen the habitat quality and network connectivity are the fundamental factors of the alen and are realized by the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as the ecological sources and corridors at island scale meanwhile they are greatly influenced by the landscape structure of these elements in the alen tattoni et al 2012 chi et al 2017 according to the features of archipelago landscape structures coniferous forest broad leaf forest grassland and farmland which are covered by vegetation and could provide necessary habitat and food for birds michel et al 2010 porzig et al 2014 cardador et al 2015 they were considered the suitable landscape sl bare land is poor in vegetation productivity which is closely related to the bird community selwood et al 2018 however bare land still provides a stopover place for birds and thus was considered the moderate landscape ml traffic land building land and square constructed by human beings are major interferences to birds tattoni et al 2012 shealer and alexander 2013 chi et al 2017 they were considered the disturbance landscape dl the landscape structures of different ecological nodes and sources at the dual spatial scales were analyzed furthermore the ecological corridors are not lines on the land and they possess certain widths the assignment of widths is determined by complex factors including the protected object land cover condition and corridor length zhu et al 2005 generally low width will result in the low network connectivity and the high influence of edge effect the larger the width the higher the ecological function of corridor however the higher the cost of the alen smith and hellmund 1993 zhu et al 2005 chi et al 2015b based on previous studies the range of 50 m 200 m was suitable for bird conservation in different areas smith and hellmund 1993 chi et al 2015b considering the limited areas of the islands and the mutual distances of the corridors the widths of 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m 50 m 60 m 70 m 80 m 90 m and 100 m were adopted as the optical widths and the landscape structures of the ecological corridors in different widths were analyzed 3 results 3 1 the alen at the dual spatial scales 3 1 1 the alen at archipelago scale among all of the potential routes a total of 81 routes were selected to connect all of the 32 island nodes and thus the alen at archipelago scale was established fig 6 for the 32 island nodes the numbers and areas of the first second and third class islands were 4 and 11 28 hm2 15 and 2086 95 hm2 and 13 and 3285 91 hm2 respectively the islands that possessed the highest three eivs were is 32 is 30 and is 26 whereas the islands that possessed the lowest three eivs were is 12 is 21 and is 8 table 1 for the 81 routes the numbers and lengths of the ordinary and core routes were 32 and 288 05 km and 49 and 137 52 km respectively the routes that possessed the highest three eivs were r32 30 r26 17 and r15 26 whereas the routes that possessed the lowest three eivs were r18 14 r28 5 and r15 14 table 4 3 1 2 the alen at island scale among all of the potential corridors a total of 76 corridors were selected which connected the 42 sources and they constituted the alen at island scale fig 7 for the 42 ecological sources the numbers and areas of the first second and third class sources were 8 and 123 90 hm2 24 and 682 58 hm2 and 10 and 664 94 hm2 respectively the sources that possessed the highest three eivs were so 14 so 16 and so 12 and the sources that possessed the lowest three eivs were so 31 so 30 and so 28 table 2 for the 76 corridors 51 were important corridors and 25 were core corridors the lengths of ordinary and core corridors were 51 71 km and 13 37 km respectively the corridors that possessed the highest three eivs were c5 14 c12 16 and c8 14 which were all located in is 1 and the corridors that possessed the lowest three eivs were c29 30 c30 31 and c4 6 table 5 3 2 landscape structure of the alen the landscape structures of island nodes at archipelago scale are shown in table 6 the sl on most of the islands occupied the largest proportions including is 1 is 21 and is 23 is 25 on the remaining islands the ml was the main landscape especially is 27 is 32 which were totally composed of bare lands the dl proportion was relatively high on large and inhabited islands and reached the highest on is 1 for different levels of island nodes the proportions of sl were the second third and first class nodes in the descending order the proportions of ml were the first third and second class nodes in the descending order and the proportions of dl were the third second and first class nodes in the descending order the landscape structures of ecological sources and corridors at island scale are shown in tables 7 and 8 for the ecological sources the sl occupied the largest proportion of each class of source and the areas of dl were small in each source the ml generally possessed small areas but occupied a lot in certain sources such as so 10 and so 39 for the ecological corridors the proportion of sl decreased and the proportions of ml and dl generally increased with the increase in the corridor width in ordinary and core corridors and the core corridors possessed higher proportions of sl and ml and lower proportion of dl than ordinary corridors 4 discussion 4 1 the full connectivity of the alen the alen with full connectivity indicates that 1 island nodes are connected with each other through efficient routes at archipelago scale 2 ecological sources within a specific island are connected with each other though efficient corridors at island scale 3 all of the nodes and sources in the whole archipelago can reach each other across the dual spatial scales and 4 the efficiency and cost of the alen are well coordinated the alen that we established could meet all the aforementioned demands at archipelago scale the 32 islands were all considered the ecological nodes because of the special status of each island in the archipelago chi et al 2017 they were connected through the 81 routes and bird species could flight from each of the island to the others along the route fig 6 at island scale the ecological sources were selected based on the landscape resistance and area which determined the quality and quantity of the habitat the 42 sources on the five islands were connected through 76 corridors and the birds could walk or flight from each of the sources to the others along the corridors within an island fig 7 thus all of the nodes and sources were connected across the scales that is the species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors fig 8 the routes and corridors have been evaluated using the eiv which referred to the ecological efficiency therefore the 81 routes and 76 corridors were proven to have high ecological efficiency compared to the potential routes with total number and length of 496 and 11824 42 km respectively the selected routes greatly removed the unnecessary parts and the total number and length have been decreased to 81 and 425 59 km respectively similarly the number and total length of selected corridors were decreased to 76 and 65 07 km respectively compared to those of the potential ones of 633 and 94 18 km respectively it indicated that the cost of the alen was substantially decreased and thereby the balance of efficiency and cost could been achieved the different levels of the elements indicated their status in the alen they were determined by their eivs which was calculated using the lrv and area of the node source as well as the distance of the route corridor kong et al 2010 the distance referred to the euclidean distance connecting two islands for the route and the cost distance linking two sources for the corridor the eiv generally increased with the increase in area and the decrease in lrv and distance at archipelago scale the islands with different areas were distributed unevenly in the archipelago they showed concentrated distribution in the southern and northern areas especially the southern area yet scattered distribution in the central part of the archipelago fig 2 the first class island nodes occupied a low number and they generally possessed small areas and close positions with other islands the second and third class island nodes had similar numbers yet the latter possessed larger areas indicating that large islands always had low eivs large islands especially the inhabited islands suffered much human activity which contributed to the high lrv in addition parts of the islands with low eivs especially is 6 is 8 is 12 and is 13 were in the border area and far from the other islands in the archipelago it indicated that the lrv and position rather than the area were decisive to the levels of different island nodes the core routes showed more number yet lower length than the ordinary routes revealing that the routes with low length generally possessed high eivs the core routes were mainly located in the southern area and the others were observed between islands with close positions the routes connecting islands across the southern central and northern areas were all ordinary ones with high length at island scale the first class sources were all in the central and northern parts on is 1 with concentrated distribution and the areas and lrvs differed greatly among these sources the second class sources were mainly in is 1 is 2 and is 4 and they occupied the most number of the sources the third class sources were mainly in is 3 and is 5 which could be explained by the few number of sources in the two islands the core corridors were mainly observed in is 1 with few number and low length whereas the ordinary corridors constituted the majority moreover the core corridors possessed much lower proportion of dl than the ordinary corridors it indicated that the number and spatial distribution of ecological sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors within an island greatly influenced the levels of elements at island scale the alen was realized based on the habitat suitability evaluation which considered various aspects of factors and can be easily conducted using filed and remote sensing data chi et al 2017 the ecological routes and corridors were linear and curvilinear types respectively the routes were designed using euclidean distance approach for bird migration across islands via flight and the corridors were generated using least cost distance approach for bird migration within an island via flight or walk the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance were frequently used in previous studies with clear operations kong et al 2010 chi et al 2015b liu et al 2015 hu et al 2018 they were combined in the alen establishment for the dual spatial scales and the full connectivity was achieved therefore the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos in coastal zones of china as well as other archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances in the world 4 2 optimization measures based on the landscape structure of the alen the optimization measures for the alen were proposed aiming to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity which were influenced by complex natural and anthropogenic factors store and jokimäki 2003 kong et al 2010 porzig et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the aforementioned analyses indicated that the lrv and position of the islands determined the ecological efficiency of the alen at archipelago scale and the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors within an island contributed the most at island scale most of the factors could be modified by humans through changing the landscape structures shen et al 2017 chi et al 2018 thus optimization of landscape structure has been the main approach to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity at archipelago scale the island areas and positions were naturally formed and basically could not be transformed yet the lrvs can be decreased by increasing the proportions of sl on the whole island table 6 for the inhabited islands which possessed a considerable area of dl their lrvs can be decreased by converting the dl to the ml or sl through land consolidation and ecological restoration crecente et al 2002 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2017 for the uninhabited islands ecological construction can be focused on the transition from the ml to the sl the routes were designed for bird flight and can be improved by decreasing the lrvs of the islands that they connected the key routes that were indispensable for connecting islands across southern central and northern areas of the archipelago consisted of r5 28 r4 12 r12 13 and r21 29 and the islands they connected including is 4 is 5 is 12 is 13 is 21 is 28 and is 29 should be paid more attention the measures at island scale were different from those for the whole island at archipelago scale and they focused on the spatial configuration of landscape structures within an island the effective way for improving the alen is to set new ecological sources with uniform spatial distribution the landscape structures of current sources indicated the importance of the sl table 7 thus the optimization of landscape structures was conducted to convert the ml and dl to the sl in specific areas aiming to set new sources for the islands with areas higher than 5 km2 including is 1 is 5 the alen at island scale has been established in our study however the existing sources were inadequate and more sources should be set on these islands especially on is 3 and is 5 furthermore the intersections of the existing corridors which considerably influenced the frequency of species flow and the stability of the alen should be also considered new sources yin et al 2011 fu et al 2012 for the islands with areas lower than 5 km2 and higher than 1 km2 including is 6 is 11 two or more sources should be set in suitable locations and the alen at island should be established on these islands the landscape structures of ecological corridors in different widths indicating that the proportion of dl increased with the increase in the widths resulting in the increasing difficulty of the landscape structure optimization table 8 considering the minimum width requirement and the optimization difficulty the width of 50 m could be selected as the practical width to implement the alen smith and hellmund 1993 chi et al 2015b meanwhile the dl is essential to the carrying capacity for human beings on islands martín cejas and sánchez 2010 chi et al 2015a thus the adequate quantity of dl should be ensured through reasonable spatial planning and the island exploitation and conservation should be well coordinated in the next study the alen will be integrated into the regional and national landscape ecological network which involves the mainland and a series of archipelagos in coastal zones of china and the suitability quality and network connectivity will be further improved in a more macro spatial scale 5 conclusions the alen with full connectivity was established at the dual spatial scales four types of elements namely the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen based on the spatial distribution of bird habitat suitability and integrating the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance the ecological efficiencies of the elements in the alen were evaluated using the eiv the alen establishment in miaodao archipelago realized the full connectivity using data acquired from field investigation and remote sensing the bird species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors across the dual spatial scales and the balance of efficiency and cost was achieved the optimization measures were then proposed for the improvement of the habitat quality and network connectivity of the alen furthermore the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos in coastal zones of china as well as other archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances in the world the alen in miaodao archipelago consisted of 32 nodes and 81 routes at archipelago scale as well as 42 sources and 76 corridors at island scale the landscape structures of different elements indicated that the sl occupied the largest proportions of most nodes and sources however considerable ml and dl were still observed on certain parts for the corridors the proportion of sl decreased and the proportions of ml and dl increased with the increase in the corridor width the lrv and position of the islands determined the ecological efficiency of the alen at archipelago scale and the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors contributed the most at island scale the optimization of landscape structure was the main approach to improve the alen at archipelago scale the optimization was conducted for the whole island and is 4 is 5 is 12 is 13 is 21 is 28 and is 29 that involved the indispensable routes should be paid more attention at island scale more ecological sources with uniform spatial distribution should be added and the width of 50 m could be considered the practical width to implement the alen acknowledgments this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china no

25089,an archipelagic landscape ecological network alen is important for optimizing the bird migration route and providing reference for island biodiversity maintenance the alen with full connectivity at dual spatial scales was established in this study ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen based on the habitat suitability and integrating the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance then the landscape structures of the alen were analyzed and the optimization measures were proposed to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity miaodao archipelago an important and typical archipelago in north china was selected as the study area results indicated that the alen was composed of 32 nodes and 81 routes at archipelago scale and 42 sources and 76 corridors at island scale at archipelago scale the ecological efficiency of the alen was determined by the landscape resistance and position of different islands and the landscape structure optimization should focus on the islands that involved the indispensable routes at island scale the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors contributed the most to the ecological efficiency more ecological sources with uniform distribution should be added and the corridor width of 50 m was practical to implement the alen the alen realized the full connectivity that is the bird species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors across the dual spatial scales and the balance of efficiency and cost was achieved the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances keywords archipelago landscape ecological network full connectivity dual spatial scales euclidean distance least cost distance 1 introduction the island is a distinctive geographical entity with special position limited area and isolated space eldridge et al 2014 chi et al 2015a gil et al 2018 it provides important ecological functions as habitat for rare species and key stopover for bird migration catry et al 2003 weigelt et al 2013 boyer and jetz 2014 chi et al 2017 borges et al 2018 however such unique conditions render the island ecosystem distinctly vulnerable to external natural and anthropogenic disturbances the former denotes to seawater intrusion coastal erosion collapse and landslide storm surge and alien species intrusion reaser et al 2007 china islands compiling committee 2013 gao et al 2014 meyer 2014 the latter mainly refers to various human activities such as urban construction ocean and coastal engineering agricultural activities and tourism agetsuma 2007 moghal and o connell 2018 xie et al 2018 the aforementioned factors greatly threaten the island ecosystems the archipelago is a group of neighboring islands it is the main form of spatial distribution of islands in china and is mostly located in coastal zones chi et al 2017 the coastal zones in china are in the coverage area of the east asia australia bird migration route which is one of the eight largest bird migration routes in the world chi et al 2017 thus the archipelagos serve as important habitat and stopover for rare bird and bird migration respectively liang et al 2007 chi et al 2017 meanwhile the archipelagos especially the inhabited islands in it carry considerable human beings they inhabit and exploit the islands and inevitably generate negative influences on the island natural ecosystems by occupying the habitat splitting the natural landscape changing the biological community and emitting the pollutants lomolino 2000 shealer and alexander 2013 emer et al 2018 gil et al 2018 in certain islands of china human activity has been the main driving factor of the ecosystem changes li et al 2015 chi et al 2017 xie et al 2018 thus the ecological functions of such islands for biodiversity maintenance and bird migration are severely damaged it is an important issue to balance the island exploitation and conservation and to achieve the island sustainable development under the background of increasing human activity landscape ecological network also known as greenway network or green infrastructure is an effective way to enhance the landscape connectivity in areas with intensive human activity it expands the extent of species survival through providing highly connected network for species flow and thus it mitigates the threats from human activity to the biodiversity finn 1995 opdam and wascher 2004 kong et al 2010 fu et al 2012 the theories of island biogeography and metapopulation as well as the landscape ecology and 3s technology provide theoretical and methodological basis for the establishment of landscape ecological network macarchur and wilson 1963 1967 pinto and keitt 2009 kong et al 2010 chi et al 2015b the general process for establishing a landscape ecological network can be summarized as targeted species selection habitat suitability analysis ecological source identification ecological link corridor generation and countermeasure proposal currently the empirical studies on the landscape ecological network have been conducted in different areas with different spatial scales and good results were achieved zhang and wang 2006 jongman et al 2011 yin et al 2011 liu et al 2015 dondina et al 2018 santos et al 2018 for the islands with important ecological functions and distinct ecological vulnerability an effective landscape ecological network is of great significance for maintaining the island biodiversity and improving the ecosystem stability the landscape ecological network on a single island has been established in a previous study chi et al 2015b however clear spatial boundaries limit the extent of the landscape ecological network and thereby the ecological efficiency therefore different single islands should be assembled in an archipelagic view and an archipelagic landscape ecological network alen at dual spatial scales namely archipelago and island scales should be established aiming to realize a full connectivity at archipelago scale the alen indicates the network that connects different islands through bird flight routes at island scale the alen denotes the network that links important habitat areas through ecological corridors within a specific island great differences in island area shape mutual distance terrain conditions land covers and human activities exist among different islands vogiatzakis et al 2008 borges et al 2018 they contribute to the distinct differences of the islands in ecological status and functions in the alen furthermore the natural and anthropogenic factors also exhibit spatial heterogeneities within an island chi et al 2018 xie et al 2018 the establishment of the alen at the dual spatial scales is important for utilizing the ecological functions of different islands and improving landscape ecological integration and connectivity in an archipelago which could optimize the bird migration route in eastern china and provide reference for island biodiversity maintenance although previous studies have provided necessary methods the unique conditions of the island ecosystems which remarkably differ from those in the mainland make it difficult to establish the alen therefore an alen with full connectivity at dual spatial scales was established in this study miaodao archipelago an important and typical archipelago in north china was selected as the study area with data acquired from remote sensing and filed work the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance which are frequently used means were integrated in the alen establishment and the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen then the landscape structures of the alen were analyzed and the optimization measures for the alen were proposed to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity fig 1 we aim to solve the following three questions 1 how the alen at the dual spatial scales was established to achieve the full connectivity 2 how the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified 3 how the optimization measures were proposed to balance the island conservation and exploitation under the background of increasing human activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area miaodao archipelago is in the north of the shandong peninsula and at the juncture of the yellow and bohai seas fig 2 it is the location of changdao county in shandong province of china at 2017 the gross domestic product gdp and the gdp per capita of the whole county were 7 14 billion yuan 1064 5 million dollars and 162 577 yuan 24 238 4 dollars respectively people s government of changdao county 2018 the gdp per capita was in a high level in china at the end of 2017 the total population was 41 714 of which the urban population was 22 440 compared with those in last year the total population decreased whereas the urban population increased people s government of changdao county 2018 the archipelago has a temperate and monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 12 0 c and 537 mm respectively and the temperature and rainfall change greatly at different seasons chi et al 2017 all of the islands in the archipelago are bedrock islands with eroded hills as the main topographic type which results in complex terrain factors poor soil quality and bad habitat condition for native forests chi et al 2016 the archipelago provides an important habitat and stopover for bird species and the number of bird species recorded accounts for 25 of all bird species in china therefore a national nature reserve was established here at 1988 for bird conservation however increasing human activities have made the island ecosystems threatened urban constructions considerably transformed the island geomorphology and landscape pattern and occupied the natural habitat for birds rapid development of tourism resulted in a remarkable increase of annual tourist number from 1 15 million at 2005 to 3 85 million at 2017 people s government of changdao county 2018 which put much pressure on the island ecosystem and greatly promoted the unban construction miaodao archipelago is composed of 10 inhabited islands and numerous uninhabited islands different islands in the archipelago possess distinct spatial heterogeneities in natural conditions and anthropogenic influences the inhabited islands have large areas and carry the majority of the human activities of which nanchangshan island is the demographic economic and cultural center of changdao county the uninhabited islands possess smaller areas and receive much less human exploitations than the inhabited islands furthermore mutual distances terrains soils vegetation and other ecological characteristics substantially vary on different islands and in different positions within an island these unique conditions render the study area a natural laboratory for the alen establishment at dual spatial scales considering the minimum area principle the 10 inhabited islands and 22 uninhabited islands with areas higher than 0 1 hm2 were selected to establish the alen fig 2 table 1 2 2 data sources different types of remote sensing data were collected from satellites of worldview 1 and landsat 8 the worldview 1 data was acquired at 2013 and the landsat 8 data was acquired at different seasons during 2013 2014 the interpretations of island outlines and land covers were conducted through arcgis 10 0 and the landscape types were divided into coniferous forest broad leaf forest grassland farmland bare land traffic land building land and square the top of atmosphere radiance and reflectance of each band in landsat 8 data were calculated using the metadata they were used for the calculations of different kinds of ecological indices the aster gdem v 2 published in 2011 was adopted to generate terrain factors of altitude slope and aspect field work was also conducted and a total of 110 sampling sites were set to investigate the plant data in tree shrub and herb layers which was described in detail in a previous study by the authors chi et al 2017 2 3 establishment and analysis of the alen the alen was established based on the spatial distribution of bird habitat suitability combining the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance and aiming to reveal the full connectivity at archipelago and island scales 2 3 1 habitat suitability and landscape resistance the habitat suitability was evaluated using a model of form structure function disturbance fsfd the form was represented by the island area and position patch density and slope were used as the indices of the structure the function referred to ecosystem productivity and plant diversity and island exploitation disturbance was used to quantify the disturbance the model was realized by using the aforementioned data of island outline land covers ecological indices terrain factors and plant diversity thus the habitat suitability and its spatial distribution were obtained the details were represented in a previous study by the authors chi et al 2017 landscape resistance represents the difficulty for species to survive in or migrate across a specific landscape area dauber et al 2003 kong et al 2010 moraes et al 2018 it is fundamental to the alen and provides basic data for the selection of ecological nodes source the generation of ecological routes corridors and the evaluation of the ecological efficiency in the following steps the landscape resistance was represented using an index namely landscape resistance value lrv which was determined by the results of habitat suitability larue and nielsen 2008 the lrv in our study involved various aspects of factors influencing the bird habitat suitability and was calculated using the following equation 1 lrv 100 hsi where hsi is the habitat suitability index obtained from the previous study at archipelago and island scales and it ranges from 0 to 100 chi et al 2017 thus the lrv also ranges from 0 to 100 the higher the lrv the lower the hsi and the worse for the alen establishment the spatial distributions of lrv at the dual spatial scales are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 establishment of the alen the alen was composed of four types of elements namely the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale the birds have two ways to flow in the alen that is flight and walk wu et al 2016 they could flight across different nodes through the routes at archipelago scale meanwhile they could flight or walk across different sources through the corridors within a specific island at archipelago scale the ecological nodes denote the key points for species migration in the whole archipelago and all of the 32 islands were considered ecological nodes in forms of their barycenters fig 2 table 1 the ecological routes refer to the linear flight routes connecting different islands the euclidean distance tool in arcgis 10 0 was adopted to generate the potential flight routes connecting each two islands and the potential flights summed to 496 fig 4 at island scale the ecological sources indicate the important habitat areas within a specific island and they possess high ecological functions for species maintenance and dispersal wu et al 2013 the identification of ecological sources is vital for the alen establishment previous methods were always based on the biodiversity richness and ecosystem service importance teng et al 2011 wu et al 2013 hu et al 2018 in our study the ecological sources were identified using the lri and the area of landscape patch and the continuous patches with lri 25 and area 1 hm2 and lri 50 and area 10 hm2 were considered the ecological sources then a total of 47 ecological sources were selected fig 5 table 2 the alen at island scale was conducted within the island and thus the islands with two or more ecological sources were selected to establish the alen that is is 1 is 5 were selected and they possessed 16 11 4 8 and 3 ecological sources respectively thus the 42 ecological sources were adopted to conduct the alen at island scale the method of least cost distance was adopted to simulate the potential ecological corridors through the cost distance tool in arcgis 10 0 and a total of 633 potential ecological corridors connecting each two ecological sources within the same island were generated fig 5 lots of potential routes and corridors at the dual spatial scales were generated however considerable proportions of the potential routes and corridors were relatively ecological inefficient and establishment of the alen including all these routes and corridors was at high cost which was unnecessary therefore an ecological importance value eiv was used to evaluate the ecological efficiency of each route and corridor based on the gravity model kong et al 2010 the equations are as follows 2 e i v a b n a n b d a b 2 3 n i 1 p i ln s i 4 d a b l a b l max where eiva b is the eiv of ra b ca b ra b ca b is the route corridor between islands sources a and b na and nb are weight values of islands sources a and b respectively da b is the standard distance of ra b ca b pi and si are the lrv and area of islands sources i respectively la b is euclidean distance cost distance of ra b ca b and l max is the maximum euclidean distance cost distance of all routes corridors the routes corridors through the same island source with included angles 15 mutual distances 100 m were eliminated to remain the one with the highest eiv then the routes corridors with eiv 1 were considered core routes corridors and the other routes corridors with eiv 0 1 were considered ordinary routes corridors aiming to the full connectivity it should be ensured that all islands sources were connected with each other through the routes corridors therefore some routes corridors with eiv 0 1 may also be selected to fill the connectivity gap when necessary and they were considered ordinary routes corridors the sum of eiv of all routes corridors through a specific island source was considered the eiv of the island source and the islands sources were classified into different levels using the standards in table 3 2 3 3 structure analysis of the alen the habitat quality and network connectivity are the fundamental factors of the alen and are realized by the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale as well as the ecological sources and corridors at island scale meanwhile they are greatly influenced by the landscape structure of these elements in the alen tattoni et al 2012 chi et al 2017 according to the features of archipelago landscape structures coniferous forest broad leaf forest grassland and farmland which are covered by vegetation and could provide necessary habitat and food for birds michel et al 2010 porzig et al 2014 cardador et al 2015 they were considered the suitable landscape sl bare land is poor in vegetation productivity which is closely related to the bird community selwood et al 2018 however bare land still provides a stopover place for birds and thus was considered the moderate landscape ml traffic land building land and square constructed by human beings are major interferences to birds tattoni et al 2012 shealer and alexander 2013 chi et al 2017 they were considered the disturbance landscape dl the landscape structures of different ecological nodes and sources at the dual spatial scales were analyzed furthermore the ecological corridors are not lines on the land and they possess certain widths the assignment of widths is determined by complex factors including the protected object land cover condition and corridor length zhu et al 2005 generally low width will result in the low network connectivity and the high influence of edge effect the larger the width the higher the ecological function of corridor however the higher the cost of the alen smith and hellmund 1993 zhu et al 2005 chi et al 2015b based on previous studies the range of 50 m 200 m was suitable for bird conservation in different areas smith and hellmund 1993 chi et al 2015b considering the limited areas of the islands and the mutual distances of the corridors the widths of 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m 50 m 60 m 70 m 80 m 90 m and 100 m were adopted as the optical widths and the landscape structures of the ecological corridors in different widths were analyzed 3 results 3 1 the alen at the dual spatial scales 3 1 1 the alen at archipelago scale among all of the potential routes a total of 81 routes were selected to connect all of the 32 island nodes and thus the alen at archipelago scale was established fig 6 for the 32 island nodes the numbers and areas of the first second and third class islands were 4 and 11 28 hm2 15 and 2086 95 hm2 and 13 and 3285 91 hm2 respectively the islands that possessed the highest three eivs were is 32 is 30 and is 26 whereas the islands that possessed the lowest three eivs were is 12 is 21 and is 8 table 1 for the 81 routes the numbers and lengths of the ordinary and core routes were 32 and 288 05 km and 49 and 137 52 km respectively the routes that possessed the highest three eivs were r32 30 r26 17 and r15 26 whereas the routes that possessed the lowest three eivs were r18 14 r28 5 and r15 14 table 4 3 1 2 the alen at island scale among all of the potential corridors a total of 76 corridors were selected which connected the 42 sources and they constituted the alen at island scale fig 7 for the 42 ecological sources the numbers and areas of the first second and third class sources were 8 and 123 90 hm2 24 and 682 58 hm2 and 10 and 664 94 hm2 respectively the sources that possessed the highest three eivs were so 14 so 16 and so 12 and the sources that possessed the lowest three eivs were so 31 so 30 and so 28 table 2 for the 76 corridors 51 were important corridors and 25 were core corridors the lengths of ordinary and core corridors were 51 71 km and 13 37 km respectively the corridors that possessed the highest three eivs were c5 14 c12 16 and c8 14 which were all located in is 1 and the corridors that possessed the lowest three eivs were c29 30 c30 31 and c4 6 table 5 3 2 landscape structure of the alen the landscape structures of island nodes at archipelago scale are shown in table 6 the sl on most of the islands occupied the largest proportions including is 1 is 21 and is 23 is 25 on the remaining islands the ml was the main landscape especially is 27 is 32 which were totally composed of bare lands the dl proportion was relatively high on large and inhabited islands and reached the highest on is 1 for different levels of island nodes the proportions of sl were the second third and first class nodes in the descending order the proportions of ml were the first third and second class nodes in the descending order and the proportions of dl were the third second and first class nodes in the descending order the landscape structures of ecological sources and corridors at island scale are shown in tables 7 and 8 for the ecological sources the sl occupied the largest proportion of each class of source and the areas of dl were small in each source the ml generally possessed small areas but occupied a lot in certain sources such as so 10 and so 39 for the ecological corridors the proportion of sl decreased and the proportions of ml and dl generally increased with the increase in the corridor width in ordinary and core corridors and the core corridors possessed higher proportions of sl and ml and lower proportion of dl than ordinary corridors 4 discussion 4 1 the full connectivity of the alen the alen with full connectivity indicates that 1 island nodes are connected with each other through efficient routes at archipelago scale 2 ecological sources within a specific island are connected with each other though efficient corridors at island scale 3 all of the nodes and sources in the whole archipelago can reach each other across the dual spatial scales and 4 the efficiency and cost of the alen are well coordinated the alen that we established could meet all the aforementioned demands at archipelago scale the 32 islands were all considered the ecological nodes because of the special status of each island in the archipelago chi et al 2017 they were connected through the 81 routes and bird species could flight from each of the island to the others along the route fig 6 at island scale the ecological sources were selected based on the landscape resistance and area which determined the quality and quantity of the habitat the 42 sources on the five islands were connected through 76 corridors and the birds could walk or flight from each of the sources to the others along the corridors within an island fig 7 thus all of the nodes and sources were connected across the scales that is the species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors fig 8 the routes and corridors have been evaluated using the eiv which referred to the ecological efficiency therefore the 81 routes and 76 corridors were proven to have high ecological efficiency compared to the potential routes with total number and length of 496 and 11824 42 km respectively the selected routes greatly removed the unnecessary parts and the total number and length have been decreased to 81 and 425 59 km respectively similarly the number and total length of selected corridors were decreased to 76 and 65 07 km respectively compared to those of the potential ones of 633 and 94 18 km respectively it indicated that the cost of the alen was substantially decreased and thereby the balance of efficiency and cost could been achieved the different levels of the elements indicated their status in the alen they were determined by their eivs which was calculated using the lrv and area of the node source as well as the distance of the route corridor kong et al 2010 the distance referred to the euclidean distance connecting two islands for the route and the cost distance linking two sources for the corridor the eiv generally increased with the increase in area and the decrease in lrv and distance at archipelago scale the islands with different areas were distributed unevenly in the archipelago they showed concentrated distribution in the southern and northern areas especially the southern area yet scattered distribution in the central part of the archipelago fig 2 the first class island nodes occupied a low number and they generally possessed small areas and close positions with other islands the second and third class island nodes had similar numbers yet the latter possessed larger areas indicating that large islands always had low eivs large islands especially the inhabited islands suffered much human activity which contributed to the high lrv in addition parts of the islands with low eivs especially is 6 is 8 is 12 and is 13 were in the border area and far from the other islands in the archipelago it indicated that the lrv and position rather than the area were decisive to the levels of different island nodes the core routes showed more number yet lower length than the ordinary routes revealing that the routes with low length generally possessed high eivs the core routes were mainly located in the southern area and the others were observed between islands with close positions the routes connecting islands across the southern central and northern areas were all ordinary ones with high length at island scale the first class sources were all in the central and northern parts on is 1 with concentrated distribution and the areas and lrvs differed greatly among these sources the second class sources were mainly in is 1 is 2 and is 4 and they occupied the most number of the sources the third class sources were mainly in is 3 and is 5 which could be explained by the few number of sources in the two islands the core corridors were mainly observed in is 1 with few number and low length whereas the ordinary corridors constituted the majority moreover the core corridors possessed much lower proportion of dl than the ordinary corridors it indicated that the number and spatial distribution of ecological sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors within an island greatly influenced the levels of elements at island scale the alen was realized based on the habitat suitability evaluation which considered various aspects of factors and can be easily conducted using filed and remote sensing data chi et al 2017 the ecological routes and corridors were linear and curvilinear types respectively the routes were designed using euclidean distance approach for bird migration across islands via flight and the corridors were generated using least cost distance approach for bird migration within an island via flight or walk the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance were frequently used in previous studies with clear operations kong et al 2010 chi et al 2015b liu et al 2015 hu et al 2018 they were combined in the alen establishment for the dual spatial scales and the full connectivity was achieved therefore the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos in coastal zones of china as well as other archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances in the world 4 2 optimization measures based on the landscape structure of the alen the optimization measures for the alen were proposed aiming to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity which were influenced by complex natural and anthropogenic factors store and jokimäki 2003 kong et al 2010 porzig et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the aforementioned analyses indicated that the lrv and position of the islands determined the ecological efficiency of the alen at archipelago scale and the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors within an island contributed the most at island scale most of the factors could be modified by humans through changing the landscape structures shen et al 2017 chi et al 2018 thus optimization of landscape structure has been the main approach to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity at archipelago scale the island areas and positions were naturally formed and basically could not be transformed yet the lrvs can be decreased by increasing the proportions of sl on the whole island table 6 for the inhabited islands which possessed a considerable area of dl their lrvs can be decreased by converting the dl to the ml or sl through land consolidation and ecological restoration crecente et al 2002 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2017 for the uninhabited islands ecological construction can be focused on the transition from the ml to the sl the routes were designed for bird flight and can be improved by decreasing the lrvs of the islands that they connected the key routes that were indispensable for connecting islands across southern central and northern areas of the archipelago consisted of r5 28 r4 12 r12 13 and r21 29 and the islands they connected including is 4 is 5 is 12 is 13 is 21 is 28 and is 29 should be paid more attention the measures at island scale were different from those for the whole island at archipelago scale and they focused on the spatial configuration of landscape structures within an island the effective way for improving the alen is to set new ecological sources with uniform spatial distribution the landscape structures of current sources indicated the importance of the sl table 7 thus the optimization of landscape structures was conducted to convert the ml and dl to the sl in specific areas aiming to set new sources for the islands with areas higher than 5 km2 including is 1 is 5 the alen at island scale has been established in our study however the existing sources were inadequate and more sources should be set on these islands especially on is 3 and is 5 furthermore the intersections of the existing corridors which considerably influenced the frequency of species flow and the stability of the alen should be also considered new sources yin et al 2011 fu et al 2012 for the islands with areas lower than 5 km2 and higher than 1 km2 including is 6 is 11 two or more sources should be set in suitable locations and the alen at island should be established on these islands the landscape structures of ecological corridors in different widths indicating that the proportion of dl increased with the increase in the widths resulting in the increasing difficulty of the landscape structure optimization table 8 considering the minimum width requirement and the optimization difficulty the width of 50 m could be selected as the practical width to implement the alen smith and hellmund 1993 chi et al 2015b meanwhile the dl is essential to the carrying capacity for human beings on islands martín cejas and sánchez 2010 chi et al 2015a thus the adequate quantity of dl should be ensured through reasonable spatial planning and the island exploitation and conservation should be well coordinated in the next study the alen will be integrated into the regional and national landscape ecological network which involves the mainland and a series of archipelagos in coastal zones of china and the suitability quality and network connectivity will be further improved in a more macro spatial scale 5 conclusions the alen with full connectivity was established at the dual spatial scales four types of elements namely the ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale and the ecological sources and corridors at island scale were identified to constitute the alen based on the spatial distribution of bird habitat suitability and integrating the approaches of euclidean distance and least cost distance the ecological efficiencies of the elements in the alen were evaluated using the eiv the alen establishment in miaodao archipelago realized the full connectivity using data acquired from field investigation and remote sensing the bird species could flow flight or walk all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors across the dual spatial scales and the balance of efficiency and cost was achieved the optimization measures were then proposed for the improvement of the habitat quality and network connectivity of the alen furthermore the alen could be widely applied in different archipelagos in coastal zones of china as well as other archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances in the world the alen in miaodao archipelago consisted of 32 nodes and 81 routes at archipelago scale as well as 42 sources and 76 corridors at island scale the landscape structures of different elements indicated that the sl occupied the largest proportions of most nodes and sources however considerable ml and dl were still observed on certain parts for the corridors the proportion of sl decreased and the proportions of ml and dl increased with the increase in the corridor width the lrv and position of the islands determined the ecological efficiency of the alen at archipelago scale and the number and spatial distribution of the sources as well as the landscape structure of the corridors contributed the most at island scale the optimization of landscape structure was the main approach to improve the alen at archipelago scale the optimization was conducted for the whole island and is 4 is 5 is 12 is 13 is 21 is 28 and is 29 that involved the indispensable routes should be paid more attention at island scale more ecological sources with uniform spatial distribution should be added and the width of 50 m could be considered the practical width to implement the alen acknowledgments this research was funded by the national natural science foundation of china no
